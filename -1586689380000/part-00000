On March 31, 2012, Anderson was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Four Horsemen.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career (1982\u20131984)===\nLunde began his career in early 1982, trained by Ted Lipscomb (Allen), spending much of the year wrestling in various independent wrestling companies across the United States,  including a minor run in [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid South Wrestling]] for [[Bill Watts]] 1982-1983<ref name=AlumArch>{{cite web|title=WWE Alumni, Arn Anderson Bio|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/arnanderson/bio/|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=June 16, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209040915/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/arnanderson/bio/|archivedate=February 9, 2010}}</ref> By the middle of 1983, he made his way to [[Continental Championship Wrestling|Southeastern Championship Wrestling]], an [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] affiliated promotion operating out of [[Tennessee]] and [[Alabama]]. Taking the name of '''Super Olympia''', Lunde soon became a member of [[Ron Fuller (wrestler)|Ron Fuller]]'s [[Stud Stable]] before the year was out. Lunde saw success in the tag team ranks by winning the [[CWF Tag Team Championship|NWA Southeastern Tag Team Championship]] three times with [[Jerry Stubbs|Mr. Olympia]] and once with Pat Rose throughout 1984. It was also here in this promotion that Lunde met and began what would become a lifelong friendship with Ric Flair. By the end of the year, however, Lunde left the company and joined Mid South Wrestling based out of Shreveport. Lunde's time in Mid South was coming to an end, and during a TV taping the [[Junkyard Dog|Junk Yard Dog]] mentioned to Bill Watts, the owner of Mid South Wrestling, that Lunde looked like an Anderson. Watts called Jim Crockett and convinced him to book Lunde.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling===\n====Becoming an Anderson (1984\u20131985)====\nLunde made his way to [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]]'s [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]], based in the [[The Virginias|Virginias]] and the [[The Carolinas|Carolinas]]. By this time, the company extended its range into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] after rival promoter [[Vince McMahon]] purchased [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]]. There was a strong physical resemblance between Lunde and [[Ole Anderson]], who had achieved legendary status in the Georgia and Mid-Atlantic territories as a tag team wrestler. Ole noticed that Lunde's style was a no nonsense approach in the ring and specialized in working over a part of an opponent's body throughout the match, much like Ole himself. Anderson agreed to work with Lunde, helping to hone his capabilities, and re-formed the [[Minnesota Wrecking Crew]] with Lunde replacing [[Gene Anderson]] and taking on the name of '''Arn Anderson''', Ole's kayfabe nephew. The team quickly became a force in the territory by capturing the [[NWA National Tag Team Championship]] in March 1985.<ref name=AlumArch/> Arn and Ole defended the titles throughout the year, with their highest profile match being part of the card for [[Starrcade (1985)|Starrcade 1985]] on [[Thanksgiving]] night. The Crew successfully defended the titles against [[Wahoo McDaniel]] and [[Billy Jack Haynes]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====The Four Horsemen (1985\u20131988)====\nIn the latter half of 1985, the Andersons formed a loose knit alliance with fellow heels [[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Ric Flair]], as they began to have common enemies. The foursome frequently teamed together in six-man, and sometimes, eight-man tag matches or interfered in each other's matches to help score a victory or, at least, to prevent each other from losing their titles. The alliance quickly became a force within the territory, working in feuds against some of the biggest stars in the company like [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], [[Magnum T.A.]], [[The Road Warriors]] and the [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express|Rock 'n' Roll Express]]. Anderson also saw success as a singles wrestler on January 4, 1986 by winning the vacant [[WCW World Television Championship|NWA Television Championship]].<ref name=AlumArch/> Simultaneously, Anderson was still one half of the NWA National Tag Team Champions and, even though Crockett promotions abandoned the National Tag titles in March, Anderson's success as a dual champion elevated his status within the territory. It was also during this time (in 1986) that the Andersons, Blanchard, and Flair began calling themselves [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] with [[James J. Dillon]] serving as the group's manager.<ref name=AlumArch/> Anderson also had a tremendous ability to do interviews to further the storylines he participated in. His ability to improvise in interviews allowed him to coin the \"Four Horsemen\" moniker for the stable, as he likened their coming to wrestle at an event and the aftermath of their wrath as being akin to the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], and the name stuck. Anderson continued his reign as NWA Television Champion for most of the year, holding the championship for just over 9 months before losing it to Dusty Rhodes on September 9, 1986.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe first real setback with the Horsemen occurred at [[Starrcade (1986)|Starrcade 1986]] after Anderson and Ole lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage match]] to [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]], with Ole getting pinned. The subsequent storyline positioned Ole as the weak link within the team, possibly attributed to his age. Ole's position with the group was only further weakened after he decided to take two months off after Starrcade. After Ole's return in February 1987, the other Horsemen turned on him and threw him out of the group, resulting in Ole incurring numerous attacks over the next several months. Afterwards, Ole was replaced with [[Lex Luger]] and the Horsemen resumed their dominance of the company.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Teaming with Tully Blanchard (1987\u20131988)====\n[[File:Brain Busters (Anderson and Blanchard).jpg|thumb|Anderson (left) with his tag team partner [[Tully Blanchard]]]]\nAs a member of the Horsemen, Anderson continued to be involved in high-profile angles within the company. By mid-1987, Anderson and fellow Horsemen Tully Blanchard began regularly competing as a tag team and rose quickly through the tag team ranks.<ref name=AlumArch/> The duo faced the Rock 'n' Roll Express for the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] on September 29, 1987 and were victorious.<ref name=AlumArch/> This win further solidified the group's dominance in the company as Lex Luger was the reigning [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Champion]] and Ric Flair spent most of 1987 as the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]], losing it to Ron Garvin in September, only to regain it at [[Starrcade (1987)|Starrcade 1987]] on Thanksgiving night. Anderson and Tully continued to feud throughout the rest of the year and first few months of 1988 with the Road Warriors, the Rock 'n' Roll Express and the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]] being their most frequent rivals.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nBy December 1987, Luger had defected from the Horsemen and began a heated feud with the group, with Ric Flair especially. In early 1988, Luger formed a tag team with [[Barry Windham]] and began challenging Anderson and Blanchard for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. The bigger, stronger team of Windham and Luger were eventually successful, winning the titles on March 27, 1988. The reign would be short lived, however, as Anderson and Blanchard regained the titles less than a month later after Barry Windham turned on Luger during their match and joined the Horsemen. Though Anderson and Blanchard were two of the biggest stars in Crockett's company, they were frequently in dispute with Crockett over their pay. Despite the fact that the two, along with the Horsemen, were helping to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the company, they considered themselves to be underpaid. Their last contracted match with the company took place on September 10, 1988 when they dropped the NWA World Tag Team Championship to the Midnight Express before leaving for the WWF.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1988\u20131989)===\nAnderson and Blanchard left Crockett's company to join Vince McMahon's [[World Wrestling Federation]]. Upon being named the [[Brain Busters]], the team took [[Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]] as their [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] and quickly began rising through the tag team ranks, eventually coming to challenge [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]]. On July 18, 1989, the Brain Busters won the titles, ending Demolition's historic reign of 478 days; the match would air on the July 29 edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXII]]''. Although they would lose the titles back to Demolition just over three months later, the Brain Busters continued to be a force in the WWF's tag team division.<ref name=AlumArch/>\n\n===Return to WCW===\n====World Television Champion (1989\u20131990)====\nIn December 1989, Anderson left the WWF and went back to WCW.<ref name=AlumArch/> Blanchard was slated to return as well but WWF accused him of testing positive for cocaine.  Crockett's company was now called [[World Championship Wrestling]] and was under the ownership of billionaire mogul [[Ted Turner]]. Anderson helped to reform the Horsemen and he quickly found success in the company, winning the [[WCW World Television Championship|NWA World Television Championship]] on January 2, 1990.<ref name=AlumArch/> Anderson remained the champion almost the entire year before dropping it to [[Tom Zenk]]. Zenk's reign would be short lived, however, as Anderson regained the title, having been renamed the [[WCW World Television Championship]] on January 14, 1991.<ref name=AlumArch/> His third reign with the title was also considered successful as he held the title a little more than five months before dropping it to [[Bobby Eaton|\"Beautiful\" Bobby Eaton]] on May 19, 1991. Afterwards, with Horsemen members [[Ric Flair]] and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]] gone to the WWF and [[Barry Windham]] having turned face, Anderson entered the tag team ranks of WCW.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====World Tag Team Champion (1991\u20131993)====\n{{main|The Enforcers (professional wrestling)}}\nIn the summer of 1991, Anderson formed a tag team with [[Larry Zbyszko]] and they called themselves [[The Enforcers (professional wrestling)|The Enforcers]]. After competing for several months and moving up in the tag team ranks, they successfully captured the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] on September 2, 1991. The reign would be short lived, however, as they lost the titles roughly two and a half months later to [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Dustin Rhodes]]. Anderson and Zbyszko went their separate ways shortly afterward. Anderson quickly rebounded from his split with Zbyszko and formed a tag team with Beautiful Bobby Eaton, a long-time friend and best known for his time as one half of the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]]. At this point, they were members of Paul E. Dangerously's [[Dangerous Alliance]]. They quickly moved up the tag team division and were soon a threat to Steamboat and Rhodes. Anderson and Eaton quickly won the titles on January 16, 1992 and defended the titles against all comers for the next four and a half months before losing the titles to [[The Steiner Brothers]] in May.<ref name=AlumArch/>\n\n====Four Horsemen reunion (1993\u20131994)====\nIn May 1993, Anderson joined Ole Anderson and Ric Flair to re-form the Four Horsemen. The Horsemen introduced [[Paul Roma]] as their newest member. Although athletic and a skilled in-ring competitor, Roma had spent much of his career as a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]] in the WWF. As part of an interview segment for the Ric Flair and the Four Horsemen DVD, [[Triple H]] stated that he thought the addition of Roma made the membership the weakest in the history of the group, and Arn himself referred to Roma as \"a glorified gym rat\". Although Anderson and Roma won the WCW World Tag Team Championship in August, the group quickly split and was seen as a dismal failure by WCW.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====The Stud Stable, Four Horsemen reunion (1994\u20131997)====\nAnderson remained a regular, on-screen performer in WCW over the next few years.  He wrestled as a face, even teaming with Dustin Rhodes to feud with the Stud Stable.  However he turned heel again and betrayed Rhodes by rejoining [[Robert Fuller|Col. Rob Parker]]'s [[Stud Stable]] in 1994 with [[Terry Funk]], [[Bunkhouse Buck]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|\"Stunning\" Steve Austin]] and [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]].<ref name=Stud>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/stud-stable.html|title=Stud Stable|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> The Stud Stable feuded heavily with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty]] and [[Dustin Rhodes]] until late 1994 when Funk left. In early 1995, Meng eventually left to join the [[The Dungeon of Doom|Dungeon of Doom]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAnderson's last championship run began on January 8, 1995 after winning the World Television Championship from [[Marc Mero|Johnny B. Badd]]. Anderson helped restore the prestige of the title, which he held for just over six months before dropping it to [[Rick Wilson (wrestler)|The Renegade]]. He briefly feuded with long-time friend Flair, and was assisted by [[Brian Pillman]] in his efforts. However, it was a swerve to reunify the Horsemen with Flair, Anderson, Pillman, and a partner to be named later (who ended up being [[Chris Benoit]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nBy the end of 1996, Anderson rarely competed in the ring as years of wear and tear on his body finally started to catch up with him. On the November 25 edition of ''Nitro'', Anderson fought Luger to a double count-out in a quarter-final tournament match for the vacant WCW United States Championship.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Retirement (1997)====\nOn the August 25, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', Anderson formally announced his retirement from the ring.<ref name=AlumArch/> While standing in the ring, surrounded by Ric Flair and newest Horsemen members [[Steve McMichael]] and Benoit, Anderson declared that his last official act as the \"Enforcer\" for the Four Horsemen was to offer his \"spot\" in the group to [[Curt Hennig]], as he was forced to retire due to extensive neck and upper back injuries. He worked a couple tag matches afterward, including teaming with [[David Flair]] on an episode of ''[[WCW Thunder]]'', but his physical involvement was extremely limited in those bouts.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn the September 14, 1998 edition of ''Nitro'', alongside Steve McMichael, Dean Malenko, and Chris Benoit, Anderson ceremoniously reintroduced Ric Flair to WCW after his 12-month hiatus. In doing so, they reformed the Horsemen who then feuded with WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]]. Flair won the presidency of WCW from Bischoff on the December 28, 1998 episode of ''Nitro'' followed by winning the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Uncensored (1999)|Uncensored 1999]] and turn heel in the process. Anderson remained Flair's right-hand man during this time as he attempted to keep Flair's delusional hunger for power at bay.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2000, Anderson was a member of the short-lived Old Age Outlaws. Led by [[Terry Funk]], the group of veteran wrestlers battled the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)#Revival|revived]] [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. On May 9, Anderson wrestled in two matches losing to [[David Flair]] and a week later teaming with Ric to defeat David Flair and [[Crowbar (wrestler)|Crowbar]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nWCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation in 2001, ending Anderson's tenure there.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===World Wrestling Entertainment===\n==== WCW and partnership with Flair (2001\u20132005)====\nNot long after the closing of WCW, Anderson became a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Agent|road agent]] for WWF, renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002.<ref name=AlumArch/> He occasionally appears on WWE television trying to, with the help of other WWE management, pull apart (kayfabe) backstage brawls. Before the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|WCW/ECW Invasion]] storyline, Anderson took up color commentary for a [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] match between [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] and [[Buff Bagwell]], [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1991\u20132007)|WCW Cruiserweight Championship]] match with [[Billy Kidman]] and [[Gregory Helms]] as well as another WCW Championship match between Diamond Dallas Page and Booker T, which would be his only appearances as a commentator in WWE. He made an appearance on ''Raw'' in 2002 delivering a video to [[Triple H]] before he was supposed to renew his wedding vows to then-heel, [[Stephanie McMahon]]. Anderson was also assaulted on ''Raw'' by [[The Undertaker]] leading up the Undertaker vs. then-babyface, Ric Flair match at [[WrestleMania X8]]. During that bout, Anderson made a brief in-ring appearance, delivering his signature ''[[Professional wrestling throws#Spinebuster|spinebuster]]'' to The Undertaker. He would later turn heel once again by helping Ric Flair in his feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], leading to Austin (kayfabe) [[urinating]] on him. Several months later he became a face once again and attempted to help a then-babyface Flair gain ([[kayfabe]]) sole ownership of WWE during a match with [[Vince McMahon]], but backed down from a confrontation with [[Brock Lesnar]], who entered the ring to assist McMahon.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Various appearances and departure (2006\u20132019)====\nAnderson made a special appearance at the October 2006 ''Raw'' Family Reunion special, in which he was in Ric Flair's corner for his match against [[Nick Mitchell|Mitch]] of the [[Spirit Squad]]. Anderson was in the corner of Flair, [[Sgt. Slaughter]], Dusty Rhodes, and [[Ron Simmons]] at [[Survivor Series (2006)|Survivor Series 2006]], where the four faced the Spirit Squad, but was ejected from the arena during the match. On the March 31, 2008 ''Raw'', Anderson came out to say his final goodbye to Ric Flair and thank him for his career. At the [[No Mercy (2008)|No Mercy]] event, he was backstage congratulating [[Triple H]] for retaining the [[WWE Championship]] against [[Jeff Hardy]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn an episode of ''Smackdown Live'' in August 2016, Anderson made an appearance as one of the people asked by [[Heath Slater]] to be his tag team partner for the tournament to determine the inaugural winners of the [[WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship]]. Anderson refused to help Slater upon learning that he was not Slater's first choice as a tag team partner. On the August 8, 2017 episode of ''Smackdown Live'', Anderson made a guest appearance on Fashion Police, revealing himself to be the one who destroyed Breezango's toy horse, Tully, and boasting he was the best horse from [[the Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|the Four Horsemen]], and that \"Tully\" should have been named \"Arn\".{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn February 22, 2019, it was reported Anderson had been fired from the WWE.<ref>https://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=124356</ref><ref>http://www.prowrestlingsheet.com/arn-anderson-let-go-wwe/#.XG_Ye-hKiUk</ref> It was later reported this was due to Anderson allowing an intoxicated [[Alicia Fox]] to wrestle a match at a WWE Live Event on February 10.<ref>https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/report-arn-anderson-was-let-go-wwe-because-he-allowed-alicia-fox-wrestle-while-intoxicated</ref> At Starcast II, Anderson spoke briefly about his release saying he didn't want to be somewhere he was not wanted and the hours had become too much for him. He couldn't say much due to being bound by a non-disclosure agreement.<ref name=\"fightful.com\">https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/arn-anderson-unable-detail-his-wwe-departure-says-he-doesn-t-want-be-where-he-s-not-wanted</ref>\n\n===All Elite Wrestling (2019-present)===\nOn August 31, 2019, Anderson made a surprise appearance at the [[All Elite Wrestling]] (AEW) pay-per-view event, [[All Out (2019)|All Out]], assisting [[Cody Rhodes|Cody]] in his match against [[Tye Dillinger|Shawn Spears]] by hitting Spears with a spinebuster. On November 6, 2019, Anderson would be a guest commentator on ''[[AEW Dark]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=#AEW Dark Episode 6 - Charlotte, NC|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rsIYGxO7FY|language=en|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref>\n\nOn December 30, 2019, AEW announced that Arn Anderson has signed a contract with the company as Cody's personal advisor and head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/wrestling/2019/12/30/cody-rhodes-to-introduce-arn-anderson-manager-aew|title=Breaking: Cody Rhodes Will Have Arn Anderson as Manager in AEW|last=Barrasso|first=Justin|publisher=Sports Illustrated|website=si.com|date=December 30, 2019|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref> He would make his ''[[AEW Dynamite]]'' debut on the January 1, 2020 episode, assisting Cody to win his match against [[Darby Allin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allelitewrestling.com/post/aew-dynamite-results-january-1-2020|title=AEW DYNAMITE Results January 1, 2020|publisher=All Elite Wrestling|website=allelitewrestling.com|date=January 1, 2020|accessdate=January 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nAlthough he was [[Anderson family|billed as such]] at various times, Arn is not related to [[Gene Anderson]], [[Lawrence Heinemi|Lars Anderson]], [[Ole Anderson]], [[C.W. Anderson]] or [[Ric Flair]]. He was given the Anderson name and was originally billed as Ole's brother, and then later billed as Ole's nephew, because of his resemblance to Ole in appearance and wrestling style and billed as Ric Flair's cousin. Flair is not related to any of the Andersons, but he is a longtime friend of Arn.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1993, Anderson was involved in a brutal stabbing incident during a WCW tour of Europe. On October 27, 1993, in [[Blackburn, Lancashire]], Anderson and [[Sid Eudy]] were involved in an argument at a hotel bar. Anderson threatened Eudy with a broken bottle. After being sent to their rooms by security chief Doug Dillinger, Eudy later came to Andersons door armed with a chair leg. A pair of safety scissors was introduced into the brawl by Anderson, with Eudy receiving four stab wounds and Anderson receiving twenty, losing a pint and a half of blood. The fight was broken up by WCW wrestler [[2 Cold Scorpio]], who was credited with saving Anderson's life. Neither man pressed charges against the other, and British police declined to do so since both men were leaving the country. Eudy was later fired over the incident.<ref>{{cite journal|title=none|author=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=November 8, 1993}}</ref>\n\nAs stated in his biography, in a match in 1994, Arn was thrown into the ring ropes. The top rope broke from the turnbuckle, but he was able to land on his feet. Six months later, the same event happened again, but this time he landed full-force on to the concrete and hit his head, neck, and upper back. He never took time off to heal. As time passed, with no down time, the injuries worsened. In his biography, Anderson states that the first sign of problems was, during a match, his left arm suddenly went numb and unresponsive. Later on, they found a rib, possibly torn away from the spine during the accident, was popping in and out of joint, causing shoulder discomfort and weakness.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nUpon seeing his [[chiropractor]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], and consulting medical experts in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], the damage was found to be much more severe and surgery was deemed the only option to keep his left arm functioning at all. Surgery occurred in Atlanta in late 1996 (resulting in a left posterior [[laminectomy]] of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th cervical bones and a fusion of the 7th cervical and 1st thoracic bones) and was successful in repairing most of the damage, but there does remain some muscle weakness, loss of fine motor control, and loss of muscle mass in his left arm. He spent many weeks in the hospital during that time, crediting his recovery to his wife, his physical therapist, and the fact he did not want his children to be fatherless.

His career has been highlighted by his alliances with [[Ric Flair]] and various members of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|wrestling stable]] [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). After his retirement Anderson worked as [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Agent|producer]] for [[WWE]] until 2019. On March 31, 2012, Anderson was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as a member of the Four Horsemen.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career (1982\u20131984)===\nLunde began his career in early 1982, trained by Ted Lipscomb (Allen), spending much of the year wrestling in various independent wrestling companies across the United States,  including a minor run in [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid South Wrestling]] for [[Bill Watts]] 1982-1983<ref name=AlumArch>{{cite web|title=WWE Alumni, Arn Anderson Bio|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/arnanderson/bio/|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=June 16, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209040915/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/arnanderson/bio/|archivedate=February 9, 2010}}</ref> By the middle of 1983, he made his way to [[Continental Championship Wrestling|Southeastern Championship Wrestling]], an [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]] affiliated promotion operating out of [[Tennessee]] and [[Alabama]]. Taking the name of '''Super Olympia''', Lunde soon became a member of [[Ron Fuller (wrestler)|Ron Fuller]]'s [[Stud Stable]] before the year was out. Lunde saw success in the tag team ranks by winning the [[CWF Tag Team Championship|NWA Southeastern Tag Team Championship]] three times with [[Jerry Stubbs|Mr. Olympia]] and once with Pat Rose throughout 1984. It was also here in this promotion that Lunde met and began what would become a lifelong friendship with Ric Flair. By the end of the year, however, Lunde left the company and joined Mid South Wrestling based out of Shreveport. Lunde's time in Mid South was coming to an end, and during a TV taping the [[Junkyard Dog|Junk Yard Dog]] mentioned to Bill Watts, the owner of Mid South Wrestling, that Lunde looked like an Anderson. Watts called Jim Crockett and convinced him to book Lunde.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling===\n====Becoming an Anderson (1984\u20131985)====\nLunde made his way to [[Jim Crockett, Jr.]]'s [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]], based in the [[The Virginias|Virginias]] and the [[The Carolinas|Carolinas]]. By this time, the company extended its range into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] after rival promoter [[Vince McMahon]] purchased [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]]. There was a strong physical resemblance between Lunde and [[Ole Anderson]], who had achieved legendary status in the Georgia and Mid-Atlantic territories as a tag team wrestler. Ole noticed that Lunde's style was a no nonsense approach in the ring and specialized in working over a part of an opponent's body throughout the match, much like Ole himself. Anderson agreed to work with Lunde, helping to hone his capabilities, and re-formed the [[Minnesota Wrecking Crew]] with Lunde replacing [[Gene Anderson]] and taking on the name of '''Arn Anderson''', Ole's kayfabe nephew. The team quickly became a force in the territory by capturing the [[NWA National Tag Team Championship]] in March 1985.<ref name=AlumArch/> Arn and Ole defended the titles throughout the year, with their highest profile match being part of the card for [[Starrcade (1985)|Starrcade 1985]] on [[Thanksgiving]] night. The Crew successfully defended the titles against [[Wahoo McDaniel]] and [[Billy Jack Haynes]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====The Four Horsemen (1985\u20131988)====\nIn the latter half of 1985, the Andersons formed a loose knit alliance with fellow heels [[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Ric Flair]], as they began to have common enemies. The foursome frequently teamed together in six-man, and sometimes, eight-man tag matches or interfered in each other's matches to help score a victory or, at least, to prevent each other from losing their titles. The alliance quickly became a force within the territory, working in feuds against some of the biggest stars in the company like [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], [[Magnum T.A.]], [[The Road Warriors]] and the [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express|Rock 'n' Roll Express]]. Anderson also saw success as a singles wrestler on January 4, 1986 by winning the vacant [[WCW World Television Championship|NWA Television Championship]].<ref name=AlumArch/> Simultaneously, Anderson was still one half of the NWA National Tag Team Champions and, even though Crockett promotions abandoned the National Tag titles in March, Anderson's success as a dual champion elevated his status within the territory. It was also during this time (in 1986) that the Andersons, Blanchard, and Flair began calling themselves [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|The Four Horsemen]] with [[James J. Dillon]] serving as the group's manager.<ref name=AlumArch/> Anderson also had a tremendous ability to do interviews to further the storylines he participated in. His ability to improvise in interviews allowed him to coin the \"Four Horsemen\" moniker for the stable, as he likened their coming to wrestle at an event and the aftermath of their wrath as being akin to the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]], and the name stuck. Anderson continued his reign as NWA Television Champion for most of the year, holding the championship for just over 9 months before losing it to Dusty Rhodes on September 9, 1986.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe first real setback with the Horsemen occurred at [[Starrcade (1986)|Starrcade 1986]] after Anderson and Ole lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage match]] to [[The Rock 'n' Roll Express]], with Ole getting pinned. The subsequent storyline positioned Ole as the weak link within the team, possibly attributed to his age. Ole's position with the group was only further weakened after he decided to take two months off after Starrcade. After Ole's return in February 1987, the other Horsemen turned on him and threw him out of the group, resulting in Ole incurring numerous attacks over the next several months. Afterwards, Ole was replaced with [[Lex Luger]] and the Horsemen resumed their dominance of the company.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Teaming with Tully Blanchard (1987\u20131988)====\n[[File:Brain Busters (Anderson and Blanchard).jpg|thumb|Anderson (left) with his tag team partner [[Tully Blanchard]]]]\nAs a member of the Horsemen, Anderson continued to be involved in high-profile angles within the company. By mid-1987, Anderson and fellow Horsemen Tully Blanchard began regularly competing as a tag team and rose quickly through the tag team ranks.<ref name=AlumArch/> The duo faced the Rock 'n' Roll Express for the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship|NWA World Tag Team Championship]] on September 29, 1987 and were victorious.<ref name=AlumArch/> This win further solidified the group's dominance in the company as Lex Luger was the reigning [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Champion]] and Ric Flair spent most of 1987 as the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]], losing it to Ron Garvin in September, only to regain it at [[Starrcade (1987)|Starrcade 1987]] on Thanksgiving night. Anderson and Tully continued to feud throughout the rest of the year and first few months of 1988 with the Road Warriors, the Rock 'n' Roll Express and the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]] being their most frequent rivals.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nBy December 1987, Luger had defected from the Horsemen and began a heated feud with the group, with Ric Flair especially. In early 1988, Luger formed a tag team with [[Barry Windham]] and began challenging Anderson and Blanchard for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. The bigger, stronger team of Windham and Luger were eventually successful, winning the titles on March 27, 1988. The reign would be short lived, however, as Anderson and Blanchard regained the titles less than a month later after Barry Windham turned on Luger during their match and joined the Horsemen. Though Anderson and Blanchard were two of the biggest stars in Crockett's company, they were frequently in dispute with Crockett over their pay. Despite the fact that the two, along with the Horsemen, were helping to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the company, they considered themselves to be underpaid. Their last contracted match with the company took place on September 10, 1988 when they dropped the NWA World Tag Team Championship to the Midnight Express before leaving for the WWF.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1988\u20131989)===\nAnderson and Blanchard left Crockett's company to join Vince McMahon's [[World Wrestling Federation]]. Upon being named the [[Brain Busters]], the team took [[Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan]] as their [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] and quickly began rising through the tag team ranks, eventually coming to challenge [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] for the [[WWF Tag Team Championship]]. On July 18, 1989, the Brain Busters won the titles, ending Demolition's historic reign of 478 days; the match would air on the July 29 edition of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXII]]''. Although they would lose the titles back to Demolition just over three months later, the Brain Busters continued to be a force in the WWF's tag team division.<ref name=AlumArch/>\n\n===Return to WCW===\n====World Television Champion (1989\u20131990)====\nIn December 1989, Anderson left the WWF and went back to WCW.<ref name=AlumArch/> Blanchard was slated to return as well but WWF accused him of testing positive for cocaine.  Crockett's company was now called [[World Championship Wrestling]] and was under the ownership of billionaire mogul [[Ted Turner]]. Anderson helped to reform the Horsemen and he quickly found success in the company, winning the [[WCW World Television Championship|NWA World Television Championship]] on January 2, 1990.<ref name=AlumArch/> Anderson remained the champion almost the entire year before dropping it to [[Tom Zenk]]. Zenk's reign would be short lived, however, as Anderson regained the title, having been renamed the [[WCW World Television Championship]] on January 14, 1991.<ref name=AlumArch/> His third reign with the title was also considered successful as he held the title a little more than five months before dropping it to [[Bobby Eaton|\"Beautiful\" Bobby Eaton]] on May 19, 1991. Afterwards, with Horsemen members [[Ric Flair]] and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]] gone to the WWF and [[Barry Windham]] having turned face, Anderson entered the tag team ranks of WCW.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====World Tag Team Champion (1991\u20131993)====\n{{main|The Enforcers (professional wrestling)}}\nIn the summer of 1991, Anderson formed a tag team with [[Larry Zbyszko]] and they called themselves [[The Enforcers (professional wrestling)|The Enforcers]]. After competing for several months and moving up in the tag team ranks, they successfully captured the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] on September 2, 1991. The reign would be short lived, however, as they lost the titles roughly two and a half months later to [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Dustin Rhodes]]. Anderson and Zbyszko went their separate ways shortly afterward. Anderson quickly rebounded from his split with Zbyszko and formed a tag team with Beautiful Bobby Eaton, a long-time friend and best known for his time as one half of the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]]. At this point, they were members of Paul E. Dangerously's [[Dangerous Alliance]]. They quickly moved up the tag team division and were soon a threat to Steamboat and Rhodes. Anderson and Eaton quickly won the titles on January 16, 1992 and defended the titles against all comers for the next four and a half months before losing the titles to [[The Steiner Brothers]] in May.<ref name=AlumArch/>\n\n====Four Horsemen reunion (1993\u20131994)====\nIn May 1993, Anderson joined Ole Anderson and Ric Flair to re-form the Four Horsemen. The Horsemen introduced [[Paul Roma]] as their newest member. Although athletic and a skilled in-ring competitor, Roma had spent much of his career as a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]] in the WWF. As part of an interview segment for the Ric Flair and the Four Horsemen DVD, [[Triple H]] stated that he thought the addition of Roma made the membership the weakest in the history of the group, and Arn himself referred to Roma as \"a glorified gym rat\". Although Anderson and Roma won the WCW World Tag Team Championship in August, the group quickly split and was seen as a dismal failure by WCW.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====The Stud Stable, Four Horsemen reunion (1994\u20131997)====\nAnderson remained a regular, on-screen performer in WCW over the next few years.  He wrestled as a face, even teaming with Dustin Rhodes to feud with the Stud Stable.  However he turned heel again and betrayed Rhodes by rejoining [[Robert Fuller|Col. Rob Parker]]'s [[Stud Stable]] in 1994 with [[Terry Funk]], [[Bunkhouse Buck]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|\"Stunning\" Steve Austin]] and [[Tonga Fifita|Meng]].<ref name=Stud>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/stud-stable.html|title=Stud Stable|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-09-08}}</ref> The Stud Stable feuded heavily with [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty]] and [[Dustin Rhodes]] until late 1994 when Funk left. In early 1995, Meng eventually left to join the [[The Dungeon of Doom|Dungeon of Doom]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nAnderson's last championship run began on January 8, 1995 after winning the World Television Championship from [[Marc Mero|Johnny B. Badd]]. Anderson helped restore the prestige of the title, which he held for just over six months before dropping it to [[Rick Wilson (wrestler)|The Renegade]]. He briefly feuded with long-time friend Flair, and was assisted by [[Brian Pillman]] in his efforts. However, it was a swerve to reunify the Horsemen with Flair, Anderson, Pillman, and a partner to be named later (who ended up being [[Chris Benoit]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nBy the end of 1996, Anderson rarely competed in the ring as years of wear and tear on his body finally started to catch up with him. On the November 25 edition of ''Nitro'', Anderson fought Luger to a double count-out in a quarter-final tournament match for the vacant WCW United States Championship.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Retirement (1997)====\nOn the August 25, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', Anderson formally announced his retirement from the ring.<ref name=AlumArch/> While standing in the ring, surrounded by Ric Flair and newest Horsemen members [[Steve McMichael]] and Benoit, Anderson declared that his last official act as the \"Enforcer\" for the Four Horsemen was to offer his \"spot\" in the group to [[Curt Hennig]], as he was forced to retire due to extensive neck and upper back injuries. He worked a couple tag matches afterward, including teaming with [[David Flair]] on an episode of ''[[WCW Thunder]]'', but his physical involvement was extremely limited in those bouts.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn the September 14, 1998 edition of ''Nitro'', alongside Steve McMichael, Dean Malenko, and Chris Benoit, Anderson ceremoniously reintroduced Ric Flair to WCW after his 12-month hiatus. In doing so, they reformed the Horsemen who then feuded with WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]]. Flair won the presidency of WCW from Bischoff on the December 28, 1998 episode of ''Nitro'' followed by winning the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Uncensored (1999)|Uncensored 1999]] and turn heel in the process. Anderson remained Flair's right-hand man during this time as he attempted to keep Flair's delusional hunger for power at bay.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2000, Anderson was a member of the short-lived Old Age Outlaws. Led by [[Terry Funk]], the group of veteran wrestlers battled the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)#Revival|revived]] [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. On May 9, Anderson wrestled in two matches losing to [[David Flair]] and a week later teaming with Ric to defeat David Flair and [[Crowbar (wrestler)|Crowbar]].{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nWCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation in 2001, ending Anderson's tenure there.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n===World Wrestling Entertainment===\n==== WCW and partnership with Flair (2001\u20132005)====\nNot long after the closing of WCW, Anderson became a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Agent|road agent]] for WWF, renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002.<ref name=AlumArch/> He occasionally appears on WWE television trying to, with the help of other WWE management, pull apart (kayfabe) backstage brawls. Before the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|WCW/ECW Invasion]] storyline, Anderson took up color commentary for a [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] match between [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] and [[Buff Bagwell]], [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1991\u20132007)|WCW Cruiserweight Championship]] match with [[Billy Kidman]] and [[Gregory Helms]] as well as another WCW Championship match between Diamond Dallas Page and Booker T, which would be his only appearances as a commentator in WWE. He made an appearance on ''Raw'' in 2002 delivering a video to [[Triple H]] before he was supposed to renew his wedding vows to then-heel, [[Stephanie McMahon]]. Anderson was also assaulted on ''Raw'' by [[The Undertaker]] leading up the Undertaker vs. then-babyface, Ric Flair match at [[WrestleMania X8]]. During that bout, Anderson made a brief in-ring appearance, delivering his signature ''[[Professional wrestling throws#Spinebuster|spinebuster]]'' to The Undertaker. He would later turn heel once again by helping Ric Flair in his feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], leading to Austin (kayfabe) [[urinating]] on him. Several months later he became a face once again and attempted to help a then-babyface Flair gain ([[kayfabe]]) sole ownership of WWE during a match with [[Vince McMahon]], but backed down from a confrontation with [[Brock Lesnar]], who entered the ring to assist McMahon.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Various appearances and departure (2006\u20132019)====\nAnderson made a special appearance at the October 2006 ''Raw'' Family Reunion special, in which he was in Ric Flair's corner for his match against [[Nick Mitchell|Mitch]] of the [[Spirit Squad]]. Anderson was in the corner of Flair, [[Sgt.

Anderson refused to help Slater upon learning that he was not Slater's first choice as a tag team partner. On the August 8, 2017 episode of ''Smackdown Live'', Anderson made a guest appearance on Fashion Police, revealing himself to be the one who destroyed Breezango's toy horse, Tully, and boasting he was the best horse from [[the Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|the Four Horsemen]], and that \"Tully\" should have been named \"Arn\".{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn February 22, 2019, it was reported Anderson had been fired from the WWE.<ref>https://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=124356</ref><ref>http://www.prowrestlingsheet.com/arn-anderson-let-go-wwe/#.XG_Ye-hKiUk</ref> It was later reported this was due to Anderson allowing an intoxicated [[Alicia Fox]] to wrestle a match at a WWE Live Event on February 10.<ref>https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/report-arn-anderson-was-let-go-wwe-because-he-allowed-alicia-fox-wrestle-while-intoxicated</ref> At Starcast II, Anderson spoke briefly about his release saying he didn't want to be somewhere he was not wanted and the hours had become too much for him.

Anderson]] or [[Ric Flair]]. He was given the Anderson name and was originally billed as Ole's brother, and then later billed as Ole's nephew, because of his resemblance to Ole in appearance and wrestling style and billed as Ric Flair's cousin. Flair is not related to any of the Andersons, but he is a longtime friend of Arn.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1993, Anderson was involved in a brutal stabbing incident during a WCW tour of Europe. On October 27, 1993, in [[Blackburn, Lancashire]], Anderson and [[Sid Eudy]] were involved in an argument at a hotel bar. Anderson threatened Eudy with a broken bottle. After being sent to their rooms by security chief Doug Dillinger, Eudy later came to Andersons door armed with a chair leg. A pair of safety scissors was introduced into the brawl by Anderson, with Eudy receiving four stab wounds and Anderson receiving twenty, losing a pint and a half of blood. The fight was broken up by WCW wrestler [[2 Cold Scorpio]], who was credited with saving Anderson's life. Neither man pressed charges against the other, and British police declined to do so since both men were leaving the country. Eudy was later fired over the incident.<ref>{{cite journal|title=none|author=Dave Meltzer|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=November 8, 1993}}</ref>\n\nAs stated in his biography, in a match in 1994, Arn was thrown into the ring ropes. The top rope broke from the turnbuckle, but he was able to land on his feet. Six months later, the same event happened again, but this time he landed full-force on to the concrete and hit his head, neck, and upper back. He never took time off to heal. As time passed, with no down time, the injuries worsened. In his biography, Anderson states that the first sign of problems was, during a match, his left arm suddenly went numb and unresponsive. Later on, they found a rib, possibly torn away from the spine during the accident, was popping in and out of joint, causing shoulder discomfort and weakness.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nUpon seeing his [[chiropractor]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], and consulting medical experts in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]], the damage was found to be much more severe and surgery was deemed the only option to keep his left arm functioning at all. Surgery occurred in Atlanta in late 1996 (resulting in a left posterior [[laminectomy]] of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th cervical bones and a fusion of the 7th cervical and 1st thoracic bones) and was successful in repairing most of the damage, but there does remain some muscle weakness, loss of fine motor control, and loss of muscle mass in his left arm. He spent many weeks in the hospital during that time, crediting his recovery to his wife, his physical therapist, and the fact he did not want his children to be fatherless. However, he would be readmitted in March 1997 with symptoms akin to cardiac arrest and [[Heart failure|pulmonary failure]], but was released soon afterwards.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Other media==\nHis book, ''Arn Anderson 4 Ever'', was released on April 30, 2000.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nArn Anderson has appeared in ''[[WWE Legends of WrestleMania]]'' and ''[[WWE '12]]'' as a ''legend''.

Lightning from an embedded cumulonimbus cloud may interact with the nimbostratus but only in the immediate area around it. In this situation with lightning and rain occurring it would be hard to tell which type of cloud was producing the rain from the ground, however cumulonimbus tend to produce larger droplets and more intense downpours. The occurrence of cumulonimbus and nimbostratus together is uncommon, and usually only nimbostratus is found at a warm front.\n\n==Forecast==\n[[Image:Nimbostratus.jpg|200px|thumb|Nimbostrati often have very few visual features.]]\n\nNimbostratus is generally a sign of an approaching warm or occluded front producing steady moderate precipitation, as opposed to the shorter period of typically heavier precipitation released by a cold-frontal cumulonimbus cloud.<ref name=\"cloudspotterguide\">{{cite book|last=Pretor-Pinney|first=Gavin|title=The Cloudspotter's Guide: The Science, History, and Culture of Clouds|publisher=Perigee|year=2007|isbn=0-399-53345-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAiKY4xU6y8C}}</ref> Precipitation may last for several days, depending on the speed of the frontal system.<ref name=\"dunlop\" /> A nimbostratus virga cloud is the same as normal nimbostratus, but the rain or snow falls as [[virga]] which doesn't reach the ground. [[Stratus cloud|Stratus]] or [[stratocumulus]] usually replace the nimbostratus after the passage of the warm or occluded front.\n\n==Origin of name==\n{{further information|Cloud#History of cloud science and nomenclature}}\n\nUnder [[Luke Howard]]'s first systematized study of clouds, carried out in France in 1802, three general cloud ''forms'' were established based on appearance and characteristics of formation: ''cirriform,'' ''cumuliform'' and ''stratiform.'' These were further divided into upper and lower types depending on altitude. In addition to these three main types, Howard added two names to designate multiple cloud types joined together: ''cumulostratus,'' a blending of cumulus clouds and stratus layers, and ''nimbus,'' a complex blending of cirriform, cumuliform, and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation.\n\nLater, in the 20th century, an IMC{{clarify|What is this?|date=June 2019}} commission for the study of clouds put forward a refined and more restricted definition of the genus nimbus, effectively reclassifying it as a stratiform cloud type. It was then renamed ''nimbostratus,'' and published with the new name in the 1932 edition of the ''International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky''. This left cumulonimbus as the only nimboform type as indicated by its root name.\n\n==Subtypes and derivative types==\n:*Species and varieties: Nimbostratus is very thick, opaque, and featureless, so this genus type is not subdivided into species or varieties.<ref name=\"Species\">{{cite book |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Species, International Cloud Atlas |year=1975 |url=http://library.wmo.int/pmb_ged/wmo_407_en-v1.pdf |pages=18\u201320 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Varieties\">{{cite book |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Varieties, International Cloud Atlas |year=1975 |url=http://library.wmo.int/pmb_ged/wmo_407_en-v1.pdf |pages=20\u201322 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref>\n:::*Precipitation-based supplementary features: Nimbostratus is a major precipitation cloud and produces the virga or praecipitatio features.

However, the other sheet-like clouds usually each occupy only one or two levels at the same time. Stratus clouds are low-level and form from near ground level to {{convert|2000|m|ft}} at all latitudes. In the middle level are the altostratus clouds that form from {{convert|2000|m|ft}} to {{convert|7000|m|ft}} in polar areas, {{convert|7000|m|ft}} in temperate areas, and {{convert|7600|m|ft}} in tropical areas. Although altostratus forms mostly in the middle level of the troposphere, strong frontal lift can push it into the lower part of the high-level. The main high-level stratiform cloud is cirrostratus which is composed of ice crystals that often produce halo effects around the sun. Cirrostratus forms at altitudes of {{convert|3000|to|7600|m|ft}} in high latitudes, {{convert|5000|to|12000|m|ft}} in temperate latitudes, and {{convert|6100|to|18000|m|ft}} in low, tropical latitudes. <!-- <ref name=\"nws-jetstream\" /> -->  Of the non-stratiform clouds, cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus are the most closely related to nimbostratus because of their vertical extent and ability to produce moderate to heavy precipitation.  The remaining cumuliform (cumulus) and stratocumuliform (stratocumulus, altocumulus, and cirrocumulus) clouds have the least in common with nimbus.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Nimbostratus clouds}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060924180030/http://education.arm.gov/nsdl/Library/glossary.shtml#anchorN National Science Digital Library - Nimbostratus]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060620003348/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/atmospheric_moisture/clouds_3.html Nimbostratus and Other Low Clouds]\n\n{{Cloud types}}\n\n[[Category:Stratus]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox cloud \n| name           = Nimbostratus cloud\n| image location = Ns1.jpg\n| image name     = Nimbostratus with [[Scud (cloud)|pannus]]\n| abbreviation   = Ns\n| symbol         = CM_2.png\n| genus          = Nimbostratus (''rain, layered'')\n| species        = none\n| variety        = none\n| altitude_m     = 500-5,500\n| altitude_ft    = 2,000-18,000\n| level          = medium\n| appearance     = Dark, widespread, formless layer\n| precipitation  = Yes, but may be [[virga]]\n| thinkness      = 2.0&nbsp;km\n| Ice content    =\n}}\n\nA '''nimbostratus cloud''' is a multi-level, gray, often dark, amorphous, nearly uniform [[cloud]] that usually produces continuous rain, snow, or sleet but no lightning or thunder.<ref>[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/cloud Cloud] in the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia</ref><ref>[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=nimbostratus Nimbostratus] in the American Heritage Dictionary</ref><ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/nimbostratus Nimbostratus] in the Oxford Dictionaries Online</ref> \n\nAlthough it is usually a low-based cloud, it actually forms most commonly in the middle level of the troposphere and then spreads vertically into the low and high levels.

Lightning from an embedded cumulonimbus cloud may interact with the nimbostratus but only in the immediate area around it. In this situation with lightning and rain occurring it would be hard to tell which type of cloud was producing the rain from the ground, however cumulonimbus tend to produce larger droplets and more intense downpours. The occurrence of cumulonimbus and nimbostratus together is uncommon, and usually only nimbostratus is found at a warm front.\n\n==Forecast==\n[[Image:Nimbostratus.jpg|200px|thumb|Nimbostrati often have very few visual features.]]\n\nNimbostratus is generally a sign of an approaching warm or occluded front producing steady moderate precipitation, as opposed to the shorter period of typically heavier precipitation released by a cold-frontal cumulonimbus cloud.<ref name=\"cloudspotterguide\">{{cite book|last=Pretor-Pinney|first=Gavin|title=The Cloudspotter's Guide: The Science, History, and Culture of Clouds|publisher=Perigee|year=2007|isbn=0-399-53345-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAiKY4xU6y8C}}</ref> Precipitation may last for several days, depending on the speed of the frontal system.<ref name=\"dunlop\" /> A nimbostratus virga cloud is the same as normal nimbostratus, but the rain or snow falls as [[virga]] which doesn't reach the ground. [[Stratus cloud|Stratus]] or [[stratocumulus]] usually replace the nimbostratus after the passage of the warm or occluded front.\n\n==Origin of name==\n{{further information|Cloud#History of cloud science and nomenclature}}\n\nUnder [[Luke Howard]]'s first systematized study of clouds, carried out in France in 1802, three general cloud ''forms'' were established based on appearance and characteristics of formation: ''cirriform,'' ''cumuliform'' and ''stratiform.'' These were further divided into upper and lower types depending on altitude. In addition to these three main types, Howard added two names to designate multiple cloud types joined together: ''cumulostratus,'' a blending of cumulus clouds and stratus layers, and ''nimbus,'' a complex blending of cirriform, cumuliform, and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation.\n\nLater, in the 20th century, an IMC{{clarify|What is this?|date=June 2019}} commission for the study of clouds put forward a refined and more restricted definition of the genus nimbus, effectively reclassifying it as a stratiform cloud type. It was then renamed ''nimbostratus,'' and published with the new name in the 1932 edition of the ''International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky''. This left cumulonimbus as the only nimboform type as indicated by its root name.\n\n==Subtypes and derivative types==\n:*Species and varieties: Nimbostratus is very thick, opaque, and featureless, so this genus type is not subdivided into species or varieties.<ref name=\"Species\">{{cite book |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Species, International Cloud Atlas |year=1975 |url=http://library.wmo.int/pmb_ged/wmo_407_en-v1.pdf |pages=18\u201320 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Varieties\">{{cite book |editor=World Meteorological Organization |title=Varieties, International Cloud Atlas |year=1975 |url=http://library.wmo.int/pmb_ged/wmo_407_en-v1.pdf |pages=20\u201322 |accessdate=26 August 2014}}</ref>\n:::*Precipitation-based supplementary features: Nimbostratus is a major precipitation cloud and produces the virga or praecipitatio features.  The latter can achieve heavy intensity due to the cloud's vertical depth.\n:::*Accessory cloud: Nimbostratus pannus is an accessory cloud of nimbostratus that forms as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck.<ref name=\"Features\">{{cite book|editor=[[World Meteorological Organization]]|title=Features, International Cloud Atlas|volume=I|year=1975|url=https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/22|pages=[https://archive.org/details/manualonobservat00worl/page/22 22\u201324]|isbn=92-63-10407-7|accessdate=26 August 2014|url-access=registration}}</ref> Pannus is coded C<sub>L</sub>7.\n:::*Genitus mother clouds: This genus type can form from cumulus and cumulonimbus.\n:::*Mutatus mother clouds: Nimbostratus can form due to the complete transformation of altocumulus, altostratus and stratocumulus.\n\n== Relation to other clouds ==\nMulti-level nimbostratus is physically related to other stratiform genus-types by way of being non-convective in nature. However, the other sheet-like clouds usually each occupy only one or two levels at the same time. Stratus clouds are low-level and form from near ground level to {{convert|2000|m|ft}} at all latitudes. In the middle level are the altostratus clouds that form from {{convert|2000|m|ft}} to {{convert|7000|m|ft}} in polar areas, {{convert|7000|m|ft}} in temperate areas, and {{convert|7600|m|ft}} in tropical areas. Although altostratus forms mostly in the middle level of the troposphere, strong frontal lift can push it into the lower part of the high-level. The main high-level stratiform cloud is cirrostratus which is composed of ice crystals that often produce halo effects around the sun. Cirrostratus forms at altitudes of {{convert|3000|to|7600|m|ft}} in high latitudes, {{convert|5000|to|12000|m|ft}} in temperate latitudes, and {{convert|6100|to|18000|m|ft}} in low, tropical latitudes. <!-- <ref name=\"nws-jetstream\" /> -->  Of the non-stratiform clouds, cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus are the most closely related to nimbostratus because of their vertical extent and ability to produce moderate to heavy precipitation.  The remaining cumuliform (cumulus) and stratocumuliform (stratocumulus, altocumulus, and cirrocumulus) clouds have the least in common with nimbus\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Nimbostratus clouds}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060924180030/http://education.arm.gov/nsdl/Library/glossary.shtml#anchorN National Science Digital Library - Nimbostratus]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060620003348/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/atmospheric_moisture/clouds_3.html Nimbostratus and Other Low Clouds]\n\n{{Cloud types}}\n\n[[Category:Stratus]]\n", "name_user": "Newydd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRelation to other clouds", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimbostratus_cloud"}

He also appears as a playable character in Blizzard's crossover [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]''. Outside video games, Raynor appears in the novels ''[[Liberty's Crusade]]'' and ''[[StarCraft Uprising|Queen of Blades]]'', while his backstory is explored in the novels ''[[StarCraft Uprising|Heaven's Devils]]'' and ''[[StarCraft Uprising|Devil's Due]]''. [[Robert Clotworthy]] voices the character in all video game appearances.\n\nCreated by [[Chris Metzen]] and James Phinney, Raynor is loosely based on a character of the same name in the 1991 film ''[[Rush (1991 film)|Rush]]''. Metzen conceived Raynor to represent the ordinary man in a series populated with politically motivated characters. Raynor's physical appearance was designed by Metzen himself. A [[Terran Marine|Terran]] in his thirties, Raynor is a former soldier and outlaw who eventually becomes a [[City marshal|marshal]] on a backwater colony world. Raynor joins [[Arcturus Mengsk|Arcturus Mengsk's]] revolution against the oppressive [[Templar Caste|Terran Confederacy]] but becomes disillusioned with Mengsk's genocidal tactics, forming his own paramilitary group to challenge Mengsk's tyranny.\n\nThe character has received a positive critical response; Raynor's depiction in ''StarCraft'' and ''Brood War'' was praised for its character depth and the quality of Clotworthy's voice acting. One survey by [[GameSpot]] put Raynor as one of the top ten heroes in video gaming.\n\n==Character design==\n[[File:Robert Clotworthy Headshot.JPG|upright|right|thumb|Raynor was the first video game character Clotworthy had the opportunity to voice.<ref name=\"Clotworthy\"/>]]\n\nThe character of Raynor was originally devised by [[Chris Metzen]]<ref name=\"manualcredits\"/> and James Phinney,<ref name=\"manualcredits\">{{cite book|chapter=Credits|page=94|author=Underwood, Peter|author2=Roper, Bill |author3=Metzen, Chris |author4= Vaughn, Jeffrey |title=StarCraft (manual)|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|date=1998-04-01}}</ref> with his depiction as a rough-living and dangerous man developed through various pieces of concept art by Metzen. In an interview, Raynor's voice actor Robert Clotworthy cited one piece of this concept art in how he decided to voice the character. The art, showing Raynor on a hoverbike and outfitted with futuristic weaponry, gave Clotworthy the impression that as Raynor was someone people \"wouldn't mess with\", he would not have to raise his voice as \"other characters [would] shut up and listen\" or face the consequences.<ref name=\"Clotworthy\"/> Clotworthy also stated that in the event that a ''StarCraft'' film was produced, he believed [[Clive Owen]] would be the perfect choice to play Raynor due to him \"being dangerous\".<ref name=\"Clotworthy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/starcraft-2---jim-raynor-blizzard-and-the-ugly/|title=''StarCraft'' \u2013 Robert Clotworthy (Jim Raynor) Interview| publisher=BlizzPlanet|date=2007-06-06|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref>\n\nRaynor's character is based on a character of the same name in the film ''[[Rush (1991 film)|Rush]]'', whom Chris Metzen describes as a \"gritty, undercover cop\".

Raynor is a marshall on the [[Templar caste|Confederate]] fringe colony of Mar Sara, where he is attempting to defend the population from an expanding Zerg infestation. As the Confederacy abandons Mar Sara to its fate, [[Arcturus Mengsk]] and his rebel Sons of Korhal arrive to evacuate the colony. Thoroughly disillusioned with the Confederacy, Raynor and his colonial militia join the Sons of Korhal.<ref>'''Raynor:''' Arcturus' boys sprung me from the prison ship. Apparently, they're as frustrated with the Confederates as we are! I know their reputation, but they seem to be on the level.\u2014{{cite video game|title=StarCraft|developer=Blizzard Entertainment|year=1998|level=The Jacobs Installation}}</ref> During his time with the rebels, Raynor falls in love with Mengsk's second-in-command, psychic assassin [[Sarah Kerrigan]]. However, when Mengsk uses Zerg-attracting Confederate technology to destroy the Confederate capital Tarsonis and abandons Kerrigan on Tarsonis to the Zerg, Raynor and his militia desert, hijacking Mengsk's flagship ''Hyperion'' in the process.<ref>'''Raynor:''' I can't believe he actually left her down there! I'm gone, and you'd better come with me. There's no tellin' who Arcturus'll screw over next. / [...] / '''Mengsk:''' Gentlemen, you've done very well, but remember that we've still got a job to do. The seeds of a new Empire have been sewn, and if we hope to reap\u2013 / '''Raynor:''' Aw, to hell with you! / '''Mengsk:''' You're making a terrible mistake. Don't even think to cross me! I've sacrificed too much to let this fall apart. / '''Raynor:''' You mean like you sacrificed Kerrigan? / '''Mengsk:''' You'll regret that. You don't seem to realize my situation here.

Soon after, Raynor is lured to the planet Char by psychic dreams. He discovers the source is Kerrigan, who has been captured and infested by the Zerg. Raynor tries to save her, but to no avail;<ref>'''Raynor:''' Sarah... Is that really you? / '''Kerrigan:''' To an extent... I'm far more than I once was, Jim. You shouldn't have come here. / '''Raynor:''' But the dreams... I dreamed you were still alive, that somehow... you were calling to me. / '''Kerrigan:''' I was. While I was in the chrysalis, I instinctively reached out to you and Arcturus telepathically. Apparently, Arcturus sent Duke here to reclaim me. But that was then, Jim. I'm one of the Zerg, now. And I like what I am. You can't imagine how this feels... / '''Raynor:''' So... what? Are you goin' to kill me now, darlin'? / '''Kerrigan:''' It is certainly within my power. But you're not a threat to me, Jim. Be smart. Leave here now, and never seek to confront the Zerg again. / '''Raynor:''' Doesn't look like I have much choice.\u2014{{cite video game|title=StarCraft|developer=Blizzard Entertainment|year=1998|level=Agent of the Swarm}}</ref> he and his men end up stranded on Char for months. Raynor discovers a Protoss force led by high templar [[Tassadar]] and the [[dark templar]] [[Zeratul]] is also on Char, likewise attracted by Kerrigan's psychic emanations and subsequently stranded. The two groups ally and hold out against Kerrigan and the Zerg until rescue arrives with forces from the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. Raynor and his remaining Raiders accompany Tassadar back to Aiur, which has fallen prey to Zerg invasion, and help the Protoss destroy the gargantuan [[Zerg Overmind]].<ref>'''Raynor:''' Well, I guess all I have left is to see this through. The Zerg have taken everything from me: my home, my family, my friends. I know that nothing I do can bring those things back, but I'll be damned if I just sit on my hands and wait for the end.

The Raiders and Fenix's forces remain on Aiur as a rearguard while the surviving Protoss evacuate their homeworld, now devastated and overrun by the Zerg, for the dark templar world of Shakuras.<ref>'''Raynor:''' Executor, my crew and I will remain here on Aiur and shut the gate down on this side.

I'm a man of action. What can I say? / '''Fenix:''' I shall remain with Raynor as well, Executor. My duty is to Aiur, after all. / '''Artanis:''' Farewell then, brave warriors.

Wish us luck.\u2014{{cite video game|title=StarCraft: Brood War|developer=Blizzard Entertainment|year=1998|level=Dunes of Shakuras}}</ref> Raynor is later contacted by Kerrigan, who convinces them to join with her against the [[United Earth Directorate]] (UED), which has arrived to pacify the sector by any means necessary. Raynor and Fenix reluctantly prevent Mengsk's capture by the UED,<ref>'''DuGalle:''' You have far outlived your reputation 'citizen' Mengsk. Captain, prepare to take the Emperor into custody. / '''Raynor:''' You'll have to postpone those plans, gentlemen. / '''Adjutant:''' Sir, the rebel command ship ''Hyperion'' has just entered our sensor range. It is accompanied by a small Protoss fleet. / '''DuGalle:''' What?! Who are these intruders? / '''Mengsk:''' Jim Raynor...

However, Kerrigan turns on her allies, launching a surprise attack against both the Dominion and the Raiders. Although the ''Hyperion'' escapes the planet, Fenix is killed in the attack; an outraged Raynor vows that Kerrigan will die by his hands.<ref>'''Raynor:''' Fenix! No! / '''Kerrigan:''' What are you worried about, Jim? He died the way all Protoss hope to: in combat! / '''Raynor:''' He died because you betrayed him! How many noble souls do you need to consume before you're satisfied? How many more people need to die before you realize what you've become? / '''Kerrigan:''' You don't even know what you're talking about, Jim! / '''Raynor:''' Don't I? I'll see you dead for this, Kerrigan. For Fenix and all the others who got caught between you and your mad quest for power! / '''Kerrigan:''' Tough talk, Jimmy. But I don't think you have what it takes to be a killer. / '''Raynor:''' It may not be tomorrow, darlin'. It may not even happen with an army at my back. But rest assured: I'm the man who's going to kill you some day.\u2014{{cite video game|title=StarCraft: Brood War|developer=Blizzard Entertainment|year=1998|level=True Colors}}</ref>\n\n====''StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty''====\nThe 2010 sequel ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty|Wings of Liberty]]'' takes place four years later, where the Raiders are still resisting the renewed Dominion, but are low on morale and resources, while their efforts are marginalised by Dominion media. Raynor, blaming himself for Kerrigan's transformation and Fenix's death, has started drinking. He returns to Mar Sara, where he is approached by a former associate, [[Tychus Findlay]], with a business proposition to acquire [[Xel'Naga]] artifacts for a research group, the Moebius Foundation. The artifacts, guarded by an extremist faction of Protoss, are also sought by Kerrigan, who launches a vast invasion of the Dominion to find them. Between Missions Zeratul appears and tells Raynor that Kerrigan must survive the coming battles \"or all is lost\", as she will be pivotal to every species surviving a coming enemy worse than even the Zerg. To prove his point he leaves a protoss memory device, through which Raynor sees Zeratuls journey following an ancient prophecy and the vision of an alternate timelines future. In this Vision Kerrigan had died and the swarm (under control of an unknown entity) is wiping out the last remaining Protoss - with the Humans having already fallen and the Zerg being wiped out after their victory.\n\nEventually accumulating all the artifacts, the Raiders discover that the Moebius Foundation is a front for the heir apparent of the Dominion, [[Valerian Mengsk]]; though the ''Hyperion'' crew is concerned about having been working for their enemy, Valerian coaxes Raynor to accompany him in invading Char as the combined artifact may reverse Kerrigan's infestation. Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg, the Raiders defend the artifact from Kerrigan until it can be activated; upon detonating, it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again. However, Findlay, acting on orders from Arcturus Mengsk, attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan, forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan.\n\n====''StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm''====\nFollowing the battle of Char, in ''[[StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm|Heart of the Swarm]]'', Raynor and Kerrigan are taken to a secret lab by Valerian to evaluate the extension of Kerrigan's current power to control the Zergs, until it is attacked by Dominion forces. Raynor is captured by Nova and Mengsk declares that he was executed, much to Kerrigan's grief. However, Mengsk later contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor is still alive and under his custody, using him as a leverage to have her keep the Zerg swarm, now reunited under her command, away from Dominion Territory. Kerrigan then manages to rescue Raynor with the Raiders' help and despite his rejection of Kerrigan at first for choosing to abandon her humanity in order to save him, he and his forces join the swarm for a final battle on Korhal to overthrow Mengsk, saving Kerrigan once more when the Emperor tries to destroy her with the artifact, ultimately leading to Mengsk's death at her hands. Reconciled with Kerrigan, Raynor bids farewell to her as she leaves with the Zerg swarm to confront Amon, the fallen Xel'Naga which intends to return and exterminate both the Zerg and Protoss races.\n\n====''StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void''====\nDuring the events of ''[[StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void|Legacy of the Void]]'', Raynor participates in the defense of Korhal from Amon's forces alongside Artanis. He is later given a psionic call by Kerrigan to aid her and Artanis in a joint Terran Dominion/Zerg Swarm/Protoss invasion of the Void, a realm accessed from the Xel'Naga homeworld of Ulnar, to permanently kill Amon. In the aftermath of the war, Raynor disappears from public view with Kerrigan.\n\n==== ''Heroes of the Storm'' ====\nRaynor appears as a [[Player character|playable character]] in the [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] video game ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', which features various characters from Blizzard's franchises as playable heroes. He is one of many ''StarCraft'' heroes that are available in the game, and features a unique skillset including a heroic ability to summon the Hyperion to fire upon the battleground he is on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/raynor/|title=Raynor - Heroes of the Storm|website=us.battle.net|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> Raynor is a ranged assassin that can keep enemies away with his basic abilities. He relies on his hard-hitting physical attacks and long range to fight his enemies from a safe distance. Since he lacks any form of innate escape mechanism, like teleports or dashes, knowing when to take a fight and when to retreat is crucial to achieve good results when playing this hero. Jim Raynor is also the leading character in the game's tutorial, and one of the six Blizzard characters who appear in the ''Heroes of the Storm'' cinematic trailer.<ref>{{Citation|title=Heroes of the Storm\u2122 Cinematic Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ecv0bT9DEo|language=en|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref>\n\n===In novels===\nSeveral ''StarCraft'' novels also feature Raynor; he is a prominent character in ''[[Liberty's Crusade]]'', which reveals that Raynor had a wife and son.<ref name=\"Libertyfamily\"/> His son exhibited psychic potential and consequently is conscripted for the Confederate [[Ghost agent|ghost program]], where the intense training ultimately kills him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Grubb, Jeff|title=StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|chapter=Belly of the Beast|date=March 2001|page=181|title-link=StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade}}</ref> Afterward, Raynor's wife Liddy dies after a period of depression and illness.<ref name=\"Libertyfamily\">{{cite book|author=Grubb, Jeff|title=StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|chapter=The Wreck of the ''Norad II''|date=March 2001|page=147|title-link=StarCraft: Liberty's Crusade}}</ref> As a result, Raynor immerses himself in his work and develops a penchant for operating alone. He is also the primary protagonist in ''[[StarCraft Uprising|Queen of Blades]]'', a novelization of the events of ''StarCraft''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Episode II in which Raynor attempts to rescue [[Sarah Kerrigan]] from the [[Zerg]] on Char<ref>{{cite book|title=StarCraft: Queen of Blades|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|chapter=Chapter 4|pages=56\u201372|date=June 2006|title-link=StarCraft: Queen of Blades}}</ref> and eventually allies with the high templar [[Tassadar]] and renegade dark templar [[Zeratul]], facilitating the reconciliation between the two estranged Protoss.<ref>{{cite book|title=StarCraft: Queen of Blades|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|chapter=Chapter 17|pages=279\u2013295|date=June 2006|title-link=StarCraft: Queen of Blades}}</ref>\nMore recently, his early military and criminal history, including his association with Tychus Findlay, were explored in the novels Heaven's Devils and Devil's Due. Also in Devil's Due, Raynor's father died by machine error. Raynor's mother died at day when Raynor visited her.\n\n==Reception==\nThe character of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an \"almost prototypical action movie figure\" with a \"healthy dose of arrogance\" who despite always attempting to do the morally right thing invariably ends up with \"the worst end of the deal\" due to circumstances beyond his control.

Raynor is a predominant character in the science fiction real-time strategy video games ''[[StarCraft (video game)|StarCraft]]'' and ''[[StarCraft: Brood War|Brood War]]'', and is a [[player character]] in ''[[StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty]]''. He also appears as a playable character in Blizzard's crossover [[multiplayer online battle arena]] game ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]''. Outside video games, Raynor appears in the novels ''[[Liberty's Crusade]]'' and ''[[StarCraft Uprising|Queen of Blades]]'', while his backstory is explored in the novels ''[[StarCraft Uprising|Heaven's Devils]]'' and ''[[StarCraft Uprising|Devil's Due]]''. [[Robert Clotworthy]] voices the character in all video game appearances.\n\nCreated by [[Chris Metzen]] and James Phinney, Raynor is loosely based on a character of the same name in the 1991 film ''[[Rush (1991 film)|Rush]]''. Metzen conceived Raynor to represent the ordinary man in a series populated with politically motivated characters. Raynor's physical appearance was designed by Metzen himself. A [[Terran Marine|Terran]] in his thirties, Raynor is a former soldier and outlaw who eventually becomes a [[City marshal|marshal]] on a backwater colony world. Raynor joins [[Arcturus Mengsk|Arcturus Mengsk's]] revolution against the oppressive [[Templar Caste|Terran Confederacy]] but becomes disillusioned with Mengsk's genocidal tactics, forming his own paramilitary group to challenge Mengsk's tyranny.\n\nThe character has received a positive critical response; Raynor's depiction in ''StarCraft'' and ''Brood War'' was praised for its character depth and the quality of Clotworthy's voice acting. One survey by [[GameSpot]] put Raynor as one of the top ten heroes in video gaming.\n\n==Character design==\n[[File:Robert Clotworthy Headshot.JPG|upright|right|thumb|Raynor was the first video game character Clotworthy had the opportunity to voice.<ref name=\"Clotworthy\"/>]]\n\nThe character of Raynor was originally devised by [[Chris Metzen]]<ref name=\"manualcredits\"/> and James Phinney,<ref name=\"manualcredits\">{{cite book|chapter=Credits|page=94|author=Underwood, Peter|author2=Roper, Bill |author3=Metzen, Chris |author4= Vaughn, Jeffrey |title=StarCraft (manual)|publisher=[[Blizzard Entertainment]]|date=1998-04-01}}</ref> with his depiction as a rough-living and dangerous man developed through various pieces of concept art by Metzen. In an interview, Raynor's voice actor Robert Clotworthy cited one piece of this concept art in how he decided to voice the character. The art, showing Raynor on a hoverbike and outfitted with futuristic weaponry, gave Clotworthy the impression that as Raynor was someone people \"wouldn't mess with\", he would not have to raise his voice as \"other characters [would] shut up and listen\" or face the consequences.<ref name=\"Clotworthy\"/> Clotworthy also stated that in the event that a ''StarCraft'' film was produced, he believed [[Clive Owen]] would be the perfect choice to play Raynor due to him \"being dangerous\".<ref name=\"Clotworthy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blizzplanet.com/blog/comments/starcraft-2---jim-raynor-blizzard-and-the-ugly/|title=''StarCraft'' \u2013 Robert Clotworthy (Jim Raynor) Interview| publisher=BlizzPlanet|date=2007-06-06|accessdate=2007-07-11}}</ref>\n\nRaynor's character is based on a character of the same name in the film ''[[Rush (1991 film)|Rush]]'', whom Chris Metzen describes as a \"gritty, undercover cop\".

As the Confederacy abandons Mar Sara to its fate, [[Arcturus Mengsk]] and his rebel Sons of Korhal arrive to evacuate the colony. Thoroughly disillusioned with the Confederacy, Raynor and his colonial militia join the Sons of Korhal.<ref>'''Raynor:''' Arcturus' boys sprung me from the prison ship.

Raynor tries to save her, but to no avail;<ref>'''Raynor:''' Sarah... Is that really you? / '''Kerrigan:''' To an extent... I'm far more than I once was, Jim.

Raynor discovers a Protoss force led by high templar [[Tassadar]] and the [[dark templar]] [[Zeratul]] is also on Char, likewise attracted by Kerrigan's psychic emanations and subsequently stranded. The two groups ally and hold out against Kerrigan and the Zerg until rescue arrives with forces from the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. Raynor and his remaining Raiders accompany Tassadar back to Aiur, which has fallen prey to Zerg invasion, and help the Protoss destroy the gargantuan [[Zerg Overmind]].<ref>'''Raynor:''' Well, I guess all I have left is to see this through.

However, Kerrigan turns on her allies, launching a surprise attack against both the Dominion and the Raiders. Although the ''Hyperion'' escapes the planet, Fenix is killed in the attack; an outraged Raynor vows that Kerrigan will die by his hands.<ref>'''Raynor:''' Fenix!

Raynor, blaming himself for Kerrigan's transformation and Fenix's death, has started drinking. He returns to Mar Sara, where he is approached by a former associate, [[Tychus Findlay]], with a business proposition to acquire [[Xel'Naga]] artifacts for a research group, the Moebius Foundation. The artifacts, guarded by an extremist faction of Protoss, are also sought by Kerrigan, who launches a vast invasion of the Dominion to find them. Between Missions Zeratul appears and tells Raynor that Kerrigan must survive the coming battles \"or all is lost\", as she will be pivotal to every species surviving a coming enemy worse than even the Zerg. To prove his point he leaves a protoss memory device, through which Raynor sees Zeratuls journey following an ancient prophecy and the vision of an alternate timelines future. In this Vision Kerrigan had died and the swarm (under control of an unknown entity) is wiping out the last remaining Protoss - with the Humans having already fallen and the Zerg being wiped out after their victory.\n\nEventually accumulating all the artifacts, the Raiders discover that the Moebius Foundation is a front for the heir apparent of the Dominion, [[Valerian Mengsk]]; though the ''Hyperion'' crew is concerned about having been working for their enemy, Valerian coaxes Raynor to accompany him in invading Char as the combined artifact may reverse Kerrigan's infestation. Although the Dominion takes heavy losses to the Zerg, the Raiders defend the artifact from Kerrigan until it can be activated; upon detonating, it destroys all nearby Zerg and leaves Kerrigan human again. However, Findlay, acting on orders from Arcturus Mengsk, attempts to kill the weakened Kerrigan, forcing Raynor to kill Findlay before tending to Kerrigan.\n\n====''StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm''====\nFollowing the battle of Char, in ''[[StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm|Heart of the Swarm]]'', Raynor and Kerrigan are taken to a secret lab by Valerian to evaluate the extension of Kerrigan's current power to control the Zergs, until it is attacked by Dominion forces. Raynor is captured by Nova and Mengsk declares that he was executed, much to Kerrigan's grief. However, Mengsk later contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor is still alive and under his custody, using him as a leverage to have her keep the Zerg swarm, now reunited under her command, away from Dominion Territory. Kerrigan then manages to rescue Raynor with the Raiders' help and despite his rejection of Kerrigan at first for choosing to abandon her humanity in order to save him, he and his forces join the swarm for a final battle on Korhal to overthrow Mengsk, saving Kerrigan once more when the Emperor tries to destroy her with the artifact, ultimately leading to Mengsk's death at her hands. Reconciled with Kerrigan, Raynor bids farewell to her as she leaves with the Zerg swarm to confront Amon, the fallen Xel'Naga which intends to return and exterminate both the Zerg and Protoss races.\n\n====''StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void''====\nDuring the events of ''[[StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void|Legacy of the Void]]'', Raynor participates in the defense of Korhal from Amon's forces alongside Artanis. He is later given a psionic call by Kerrigan to aid her and Artanis in a joint Terran Dominion/Zerg Swarm/Protoss invasion of the Void, a realm accessed from the Xel'Naga homeworld of Ulnar, to permanently kill Amon. In the aftermath of the war, Raynor disappears from public view with Kerrigan.\n\n==== ''Heroes of the Storm'' ====\nRaynor appears as a [[Player character|playable character]] in the [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] video game ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'', which features various characters from Blizzard's franchises as playable heroes.

Since he lacks any form of innate escape mechanism, like teleports or dashes, knowing when to take a fight and when to retreat is crucial to achieve good results when playing this hero.

Also in Devil's Due, Raynor's father died by machine error. Raynor's mother died at day when Raynor visited her.\n\n==Reception==\nThe character of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an \"almost prototypical action movie figure\" with a \"healthy dose of arrogance\" who despite always attempting to do the morally right thing invariably ends up with \"the worst end of the deal\" due to circumstances beyond his control.

The characters are engaged in the recovery of a cargo of [[pearl]]s from a shipwreck perilously close to the volcano.<ref>KRAKATOA - EAST OF JAVA\nMonthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 36, Iss. 420,  (Jan 1, 1969): 174. </ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1883, the [[volcano]] on the island of [[Krakatoa]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] begins to erupt, terrorizing the children at a mission school in [[Palembang]] on nearby [[Sumatra]].  \n\nMeanwhile, across the [[Sunda Strait]] at her [[home port]] of [[Anjer]] on the west coast of [[Java]], the [[Steamship|steamer]] ''Batavia Queen'', under the command of Captain Chris Hanson ([[Maximilian Schell]]), takes aboard passengers and cargo, including a [[diving bell]] and a [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]. Among the passengers coming aboard are Douglas Rigby ([[John Leyton]]), the designer, owner, and operator of the diving bell; Giovanni Borghese ([[Rossano Brazzi]]) and his son Leoncavallo ([[Sal Mineo]]), who own and operate the balloon as \"The Flying Borgheses;\" Harry Connerly ([[Brian Keith]]), a [[Underwater diving|diver]]; Connerly{{'}}s mistress Charley Adams ([[Barbara Werle]]), who is a professional [[soprano]] and former [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] hostess; four female Japanese [[Pearl diving|pearl divers]] led by Toshi ([[Jacqui Chan]]); and Laura Travis ([[Diane Baker]]), a married woman who had an extramarital affair with Hanson in [[Jakarta|Batavia]].\n\nLaura was married to an abusive man with whom she had a son named Peter. Her husband did not want the marriage but also threatened to take Peter away from her if she asked for a divorce. Wanting to be with Hanson, she had asked for a divorce anyway, and her husband had left her, taking both Peter and a fortune in [[pearl]]s with him aboard the steamer ''Arianna''. The ''Arianna'' had sunk off Krakatoa during a storm, and a guilt-ridden Laura, fearing that Peter had died aboard the ''Arianna'' and blaming herself for his death, had spent a year in a [[mental institution]] before coming aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\nHanson has organized the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to find the wreck of the ''Arianna'', [[Marine salvage|salvage]] the pearls, and determine Peter{{'}}s fate &ndash; and to find Peter if he is still alive. Hanson plans to use a variety of techniques to search for the wreck and salvage the pearls, with the Borgheses{{'}} balloon conducting an aerial search of shallow waters around Krakatoa, the pearl divers providing a mobile underwater search-and-salvage capability in shallow waters, Rigby in his diving bell searching in deeper water, and Connerly responsible both for recovering the pearls if they are in waters too deep for the pearl divers and for assisting in the heavy work of bringing the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[safe]] to the surface. Colonial authorities arrive just before the ''Batavia Queen'' departs and force Hanson to take 30 convicts and their jailer aboard for transportation to [[Madura Island]], countering his argument that the ship is not equipped to accommodate them and has no room for them by telling him to transport the prisoners in the ship{{'}}s [[Hold (ship)|hold]] in appalling conditions. Hanson plans to deliver the convicts to Madura after recovering the pearls off Krakatoa.  One of the prisoners, Lester Danzig ([[J. D. Cannon]]), is an acquaintance of Hanson{{'}}s, and Hanson allows him to make the voyage on deck instead of in the hold. Aware that Krakatoa has begun to erupt and warned by a colonial official that the island is a \"raging volcano,\" Hanson replies that the volcano had been quiet for the previous 200 years and posed no threat now.\n\nDuring the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to Krakatoa, her crew and passengers observe strange phenomena: They see [[seabird]]s swarming in huge flocks by day, witness a series of fiery explosions erupting from the sea one evening, and hear a high-pitched, ear-splitting hissing and whistling sound like that of escaping [[steam]] on another night. During a conversation on deck one night, Danzig discovers that Connerly is using [[laudanum]] to kill the pain of a lung disease which he is keeping secret from Hanson because it might interfere with his diving abilities. Danzig informs Connerly of Laura's time in the mental institution, calling into question the veracity of her story about the pearls. The Borgheses, Connerly, Charley, Rigby, and Toshi confront Hanson about Laura's mental state, but Hanson assures them that Laura{{'}}s story about the ''Arianna'' is true. Connerly takes so much [[laudanum]] that he hallucinates one night, attacks one of the pearl divers, and assaults several crewmen coming to her aid before they can subdue him. On Hanson's orders, the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s crew suspends Connerly in a slatted box above the [[main deck]] so that he will pose no danger to others aboard the ship; Charley tearfully pleads with Hanson for Connerly's release, and Hanson relents and frees him. Meanwhile, Leoncavallo and Toshi take a romantic interest in one another.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Krakatoa to find the island shrouded in thick smoke. It clears when she anchors off the island, and the Borgheses ascend in their balloon while Rigby descends in his diving bell. The Borgheses quickly discover the wreck of the ''Arianna'' and guide the ''Batavia Queen'' and the submerged Rigby to it. Immediately afterwards, the motor driving the [[propeller]] that allows them to steer their balloon fails and they careen helplessly over Krakatoa and into its active [[Volcanic crater|crater]]. They jettison the useless engine and propeller into the crater{{'}}s [[lava lake]] to reduce weight and finally are blown clear of the crater by a volcanic explosion which sets their balloon afire. They drift away from the island, leap into the sea, and are rescued, but the fire destroys the balloon.\n\nDanzig tells Hanson of Connerly{{'}}s lung problems, and Hanson decides that he will dive on the ''Arianna'' instead of Connerly. While Connerly and Hanson argue over this, Rigby{{'}}s diving bell becomes snagged on [[coral]]. The pearl divers, Hanson, and Connerly all dive into the water to free Rigby, and while they and the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s other passengers and crew are thus occupied, Danzig steals a pistol he finds in the ship{{'}}s chart room, knocks the jailer unconscious, and frees the prisoners. They take over the ship, throw the unconscious jailer overboard to drown, and imprison the passengers and crew in the hold, where they also place Rigby and the pearl divers when they return to the ''Batavia Queen''. Before returning, and unaware of the turn of events aboard the ''Batavia Queen'', Hanson and Connerly swim to the wreck of the ''Arianna'', find the ship{{'}}s safe, and attach a cable to it to have it hoisted aboard the ''Batavia Queen''. Upon their return, Danzig has Connerly lowered into the hold but forces Hanson to look on at gunpoint as he opens the ''Arianna''{{'}}s safe on the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s deck. They find nothing in the safe but a cheap [[pocket watch]]. When an explosion on Krakatoa distracts Danzig, Hanson overpowers him, takes the pistol from him, pushes the heavy safe over onto one convict, shoots two others, and uses steam from a hose to force the rest of the prisoners to jump overboard. They swim to nearby Krakatoa, never to be seen again.\n\nAfter Hanson frees the passengers and crew from the hold, Rigby finds another compartment in the safe which contains the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[logbook]]. Laura and Hanson examine the logbook for clues about Peter{{'}}s fate. The logbook reveals that the ''Arianna'' made a last port call at Palembang before sinking, and a letter tucked into the logbook says that Peter disembarked there to attend the mission school. Hanson decides to steam to Palembang to find Peter. By now, Krakatoa is erupting continually, and the volcano{{'}}s explosions begin to hurl [[lava bomb]]s into the surrounding sea. A number of them strike the ''Batavia Queen'' as she gets underway for Palembang, starting fires which the crew puts out. As Toshi runs across the deck toward Leoncavallo, one of the lava bombs strikes and kills her.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Palembang to find the mission school heavily damaged, burning, and abandoned. Hanson hails a passing [[Junk (ship)|junk]], and someone aboard the junk tells him that the staff and students of the school all are alive and had fled Palembang that morning aboard another boat, intending to sail to Java. The ''Batavia Queen'' soon comes to the assistance of an overcrowded and sinking [[sampan]], which proves to be the school{{'}}s boat. The ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s passengers and crew rescue everyone aboard the sampan, including Peter, who has a joyful reunion with Laura. A chest belonging to Peter comes aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' during the rescue; it contains the pearls, and Connerly, Rigby, the Borgheses, and the three surviving pearl divers receive their shares of the fortune.\n\nKrakatoa{{'}}s violent explosions become larger and continuous; Hanson assumes that they will generate a [[tsunami]] and begins to prepare the ''Batavia Queen'' to ride it out. Although Hanson assures him that a tsunami will destroy nearby Anjer and that he is safer at sea aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' if she can get to deep water in time, Connerly disputes the ship{{'}}s ability to survive and demands that Hanson allow those who wish to go ashore to row to Anjer with him in one of the ship{{'}}s [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. Giovanni Borghese, Charley, and the three surviving pearl divers all join Connerly in the lifeboat and row to Anjer.\n\nKrakatoa disintegrates in one final, cataclysmic explosion, which generates an enormous tsunami. It strikes Anjer shortly after the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lifeboat arrives there; unable to outrun the wave, Connerly and Charley embrace for the last time before the wave engulfs and kills them. At sea, Hanson, Laura, Peter, Rigby, Leoncavallo Borghese, the refugees from the mission school, and the ship's crew ride out the tsunami successfully aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\n==Cast== \n(as given in end credits)\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as Captain Chris Hanson\n* [[Diane Baker]] as Laura Travis\n* [[Brian Keith]] as Harry Connerly \n* [[Barbara Werle]] as Charley Adams\n* [[Sal Mineo]] as Leoncavallo Borghese\n* [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Giovanni Borghese\n* [[John Leyton]] as Dr. Douglas Rigby\n* [[J.D.

The script then was written so as to incorporate the special effects sequences.<ref name=\"model ships\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', 1969, including quotes from Louri\u00e9, Eugene, ''My Work in Films'', Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985] {{ISBN|0-15-662342-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe French [[film director]], [[art director]], [[production designer]], [[set designer]], and [[screenwriter]] [[Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9]] had worked for the film's producers as art and special-effects director for the 1965 movie ''[[Crack in the World]]'', and they hired him to create the special effects for ''Krakatoa, East of Java''. \n\nIn 1965, Louri\u00e9 scouted the coast of [[Spain]] for a suitable steamer for use in the film as the fictional ''Batavia Queen''; ultimately he chose a [[cargo ship]] &ndash; a former [[passenger-cargo ship]] employed as a [[tramp steamer]] between Spain and [[Morocco]] &ndash; he found unloading [[coal]] at a pier in [[Bilbao]] whose captain said she had been built in [[England]] sometime around 1880. \n\nLouri\u00e9 had the steamer remodeled in [[M\u00e1laga]], Spain, at a [[shipyard]] which transformed her into the ''Batavia Queen'' by increasing the height of her [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] and [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and installing new [[Yard (sailing)|yards]] on her masts and a new [[bowsprit]] and carved wooden [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] on her [[Bow (ship)|bow]]. The steamer also was provided with functioning [[sail]]s for her masts and yards.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nFor special effects, Louri\u00e9's team constructed two models of the modified steamer, a one-to-ten-scale model that was 18 feet (5.5 meters) long, and, for long shots of the ''Batavia Queen'' as she approaches Krakatoa, a one-to-twenty-scale model. The latter proved too small to provide realistic effects, so Louri\u00e9 chose not to use it in the film, instead using only the larger model.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nAfter considering a [[water tank]] in [[Malta]], Louri\u00e9 chose the water tank he had used for the 1964 film ''[[Flight from Ashiya]]'' at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in [[Rome]] to film special effects sequences depicting the ''Batavia Queen'' at sea. The tank was approximately 300 by 400 feet (91 by 122 meters) in area and had a sky backing of 70 feet (21 meters). The sequences were filmed using three [[Super Panavision 70]] cameras running at three times normal speed to make the movements of the miniatures more realistic, although the cameras were not designed for such work and often overheated and required repairs. Louri\u00e9 tried to disguise the miniature ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lack of a crew or passengers as she gets underway for Palembang, slowly picking her way through a narrow passage under a rain of lava bombs while Krakatoa erupts nearby, by enveloping her in smoke. For the final sequence in which the ''Batavia Queen'' rides out a very large tsunami at sea, Louri\u00e9's team spent three days filming the model in the water tank in extreme conditions, creating large waves through the use of 35-foot (10.6-meter) dump tanks with a capacity of 2,600 gallons (9,842 liters),<ref name=\"metric\" group=\"note\">The source does not specify the type of [[gallon]] it uses. This [[Metric system|metric]] conversion from [[English units]] assumes that the English unit used is the [[Gallon#The US liquid gallon|United States liquid gallon]].

Producer [[Philip Yordan]] dropped out of the production after its special effects had already been shot, and a new associate producer came on board who commissioned a new script.<ref name=\"tcm\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/152598%7C0/Krakatoa-East-of-Java.html TCM Film Article: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'']</ref> \n\nThese changes in leadership led to conceptual changes that created some inconsistency in tone and odd moments in the finished film.<ref name=\"tcm\"/> While apparently conceiving ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' overall as a family-friendly adventure story, the producers also opted to attract a more adult audience by including some sordid and racy elements: the tortured relationship between Connerly and Charley and Laura's extramarital affair with Hanson, as well as a [[striptease]] Charley performs for Connerly in their [[state room]].<ref name=\"tcm\"/> \n\nAt other times, the movie{{'}}s soundtrack is clumsily incorporated into the narrative: while performing her striptease, Charley sings a rendition of \"A Nice Old-Fashioned Girl\" that would be appropriate in a [[Musical film|musical]] but seems strangely out of place in an adventure or disaster film, and the vocal version of the movie{{'}}s romantic theme song \"East of Java\" incongruously plays during scenes of filthy prisoners shuffling into the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s hold and sweating sailors performing the labor necessary to get the ship out to sea as she begins her voyage from Anjer.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nKowalski said \"We had more than our share of problems because you can't control such varying conditions as weather, sea, children and animals.

([[Mount Tambora]], on [[Sumbawa]], much less well known than Krakatoa despite its own &ndash; and even larger &ndash; cataclysmic explosion in 1815, is the violent volcano east of Java.) Despite the geographic error in the film's title, its makers chose to leave it unchanged, apparently believing that it was a more exotic title than \"''Krakatoa, West of Java''.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Furthermore, the film aided in popularizing [[Krakatoa#Etymology|the spelling \"Krakatoa\"]], as opposed to the Indonesian spelling \"Krakatau.\"\n\n===Film format===\n''Krakatoa, East of Java'' was filmed in Super Panavision 70 (with some scenes filmed in [[Todd-AO]]), and presented in [[70 mm film|70&nbsp;mm]] [[Cinerama]] in some cinemas.

Among the passengers coming aboard are Douglas Rigby ([[John Leyton]]), the designer, owner, and operator of the diving bell; Giovanni Borghese ([[Rossano Brazzi]]) and his son Leoncavallo ([[Sal Mineo]]), who own and operate the balloon as \"The Flying Borgheses;\" Harry Connerly ([[Brian Keith]]), a [[Underwater diving|diver]]; Connerly{{'}}s mistress Charley Adams ([[Barbara Werle]]), who is a professional [[soprano]] and former [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]] hostess; four female Japanese [[Pearl diving|pearl divers]] led by Toshi ([[Jacqui Chan]]); and Laura Travis ([[Diane Baker]]), a married woman who had an extramarital affair with Hanson in [[Jakarta|Batavia]].\n\nLaura was married to an abusive man with whom she had a son named Peter. Her husband did not want the marriage but also threatened to take Peter away from her if she asked for a divorce. Wanting to be with Hanson, she had asked for a divorce anyway, and her husband had left her, taking both Peter and a fortune in [[pearl]]s with him aboard the steamer ''Arianna''. The ''Arianna'' had sunk off Krakatoa during a storm, and a guilt-ridden Laura, fearing that Peter had died aboard the ''Arianna'' and blaming herself for his death, had spent a year in a [[mental institution]] before coming aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\nHanson has organized the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to find the wreck of the ''Arianna'', [[Marine salvage|salvage]] the pearls, and determine Peter{{'}}s fate &ndash; and to find Peter if he is still alive. Hanson plans to use a variety of techniques to search for the wreck and salvage the pearls, with the Borgheses{{'}} balloon conducting an aerial search of shallow waters around Krakatoa, the pearl divers providing a mobile underwater search-and-salvage capability in shallow waters, Rigby in his diving bell searching in deeper water, and Connerly responsible both for recovering the pearls if they are in waters too deep for the pearl divers and for assisting in the heavy work of bringing the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[safe]] to the surface. Colonial authorities arrive just before the ''Batavia Queen'' departs and force Hanson to take 30 convicts and their jailer aboard for transportation to [[Madura Island]], countering his argument that the ship is not equipped to accommodate them and has no room for them by telling him to transport the prisoners in the ship{{'}}s [[Hold (ship)|hold]] in appalling conditions. Hanson plans to deliver the convicts to Madura after recovering the pearls off Krakatoa.  One of the prisoners, Lester Danzig ([[J. D. Cannon]]), is an acquaintance of Hanson{{'}}s, and Hanson allows him to make the voyage on deck instead of in the hold. Aware that Krakatoa has begun to erupt and warned by a colonial official that the island is a \"raging volcano,\" Hanson replies that the volcano had been quiet for the previous 200 years and posed no threat now.\n\nDuring the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s voyage to Krakatoa, her crew and passengers observe strange phenomena: They see [[seabird]]s swarming in huge flocks by day, witness a series of fiery explosions erupting from the sea one evening, and hear a high-pitched, ear-splitting hissing and whistling sound like that of escaping [[steam]] on another night. During a conversation on deck one night, Danzig discovers that Connerly is using [[laudanum]] to kill the pain of a lung disease which he is keeping secret from Hanson because it might interfere with his diving abilities. Danzig informs Connerly of Laura's time in the mental institution, calling into question the veracity of her story about the pearls. The Borgheses, Connerly, Charley, Rigby, and Toshi confront Hanson about Laura's mental state, but Hanson assures them that Laura{{'}}s story about the ''Arianna'' is true. Connerly takes so much [[laudanum]] that he hallucinates one night, attacks one of the pearl divers, and assaults several crewmen coming to her aid before they can subdue him. On Hanson's orders, the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s crew suspends Connerly in a slatted box above the [[main deck]] so that he will pose no danger to others aboard the ship; Charley tearfully pleads with Hanson for Connerly's release, and Hanson relents and frees him. Meanwhile, Leoncavallo and Toshi take a romantic interest in one another.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Krakatoa to find the island shrouded in thick smoke. It clears when she anchors off the island, and the Borgheses ascend in their balloon while Rigby descends in his diving bell. The Borgheses quickly discover the wreck of the ''Arianna'' and guide the ''Batavia Queen'' and the submerged Rigby to it. Immediately afterwards, the motor driving the [[propeller]] that allows them to steer their balloon fails and they careen helplessly over Krakatoa and into its active [[Volcanic crater|crater]]. They jettison the useless engine and propeller into the crater{{'}}s [[lava lake]] to reduce weight and finally are blown clear of the crater by a volcanic explosion which sets their balloon afire. They drift away from the island, leap into the sea, and are rescued, but the fire destroys the balloon.\n\nDanzig tells Hanson of Connerly{{'}}s lung problems, and Hanson decides that he will dive on the ''Arianna'' instead of Connerly. While Connerly and Hanson argue over this, Rigby{{'}}s diving bell becomes snagged on [[coral]]. The pearl divers, Hanson, and Connerly all dive into the water to free Rigby, and while they and the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s other passengers and crew are thus occupied, Danzig steals a pistol he finds in the ship{{'}}s chart room, knocks the jailer unconscious, and frees the prisoners. They take over the ship, throw the unconscious jailer overboard to drown, and imprison the passengers and crew in the hold, where they also place Rigby and the pearl divers when they return to the ''Batavia Queen''. Before returning, and unaware of the turn of events aboard the ''Batavia Queen'', Hanson and Connerly swim to the wreck of the ''Arianna'', find the ship{{'}}s safe, and attach a cable to it to have it hoisted aboard the ''Batavia Queen''. Upon their return, Danzig has Connerly lowered into the hold but forces Hanson to look on at gunpoint as he opens the ''Arianna''{{'}}s safe on the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s deck. They find nothing in the safe but a cheap [[pocket watch]]. When an explosion on Krakatoa distracts Danzig, Hanson overpowers him, takes the pistol from him, pushes the heavy safe over onto one convict, shoots two others, and uses steam from a hose to force the rest of the prisoners to jump overboard. They swim to nearby Krakatoa, never to be seen again.\n\nAfter Hanson frees the passengers and crew from the hold, Rigby finds another compartment in the safe which contains the ''Arianna''{{'}}s [[logbook]]. Laura and Hanson examine the logbook for clues about Peter{{'}}s fate. The logbook reveals that the ''Arianna'' made a last port call at Palembang before sinking, and a letter tucked into the logbook says that Peter disembarked there to attend the mission school. Hanson decides to steam to Palembang to find Peter. By now, Krakatoa is erupting continually, and the volcano{{'}}s explosions begin to hurl [[lava bomb]]s into the surrounding sea. A number of them strike the ''Batavia Queen'' as she gets underway for Palembang, starting fires which the crew puts out. As Toshi runs across the deck toward Leoncavallo, one of the lava bombs strikes and kills her.\n\nThe ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Palembang to find the mission school heavily damaged, burning, and abandoned. Hanson hails a passing [[Junk (ship)|junk]], and someone aboard the junk tells him that the staff and students of the school all are alive and had fled Palembang that morning aboard another boat, intending to sail to Java. The ''Batavia Queen'' soon comes to the assistance of an overcrowded and sinking [[sampan]], which proves to be the school{{'}}s boat. The ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s passengers and crew rescue everyone aboard the sampan, including Peter, who has a joyful reunion with Laura. A chest belonging to Peter comes aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' during the rescue; it contains the pearls, and Connerly, Rigby, the Borgheses, and the three surviving pearl divers receive their shares of the fortune.\n\nKrakatoa{{'}}s violent explosions become larger and continuous; Hanson assumes that they will generate a [[tsunami]] and begins to prepare the ''Batavia Queen'' to ride it out. Although Hanson assures him that a tsunami will destroy nearby Anjer and that he is safer at sea aboard the ''Batavia Queen'' if she can get to deep water in time, Connerly disputes the ship{{'}}s ability to survive and demands that Hanson allow those who wish to go ashore to row to Anjer with him in one of the ship{{'}}s [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]]. Giovanni Borghese, Charley, and the three surviving pearl divers all join Connerly in the lifeboat and row to Anjer.\n\nKrakatoa disintegrates in one final, cataclysmic explosion, which generates an enormous tsunami. It strikes Anjer shortly after the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lifeboat arrives there; unable to outrun the wave, Connerly and Charley embrace for the last time before the wave engulfs and kills them. At sea, Hanson, Laura, Peter, Rigby, Leoncavallo Borghese, the refugees from the mission school, and the ship's crew ride out the tsunami successfully aboard the ''Batavia Queen''.\n\n==Cast== (as given in end credits)\n* [[Maximilian Schell]] as Captain Chris Hanson\n* [[Diane Baker]] as Laura Travis\n* [[Brian Keith]] as Harry Connerly \n* [[Barbara Werle]] as Charley Adams\n* [[Sal Mineo]] as Leoncavallo Borghese\n* [[Rossano Brazzi]] as Giovanni Borghese\n* [[John Leyton]] as Dr. Douglas Rigby\n* [[J.D.

The script then was written so as to incorporate the special effects sequences.<ref name=\"model ships\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', 1969, including quotes from Louri\u00e9, Eugene, ''My Work in Films'', Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985] {{ISBN|0-15-662342-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe French [[film director]], [[art director]], [[production designer]], [[set designer]], and [[screenwriter]] [[Eug\u00e8ne Louri\u00e9]] had worked for the film's producers as art and special-effects director for the 1965 movie ''[[Crack in the World]]'', and they hired him to create the special effects for ''Krakatoa, East of Java''. \n\nIn 1965, Louri\u00e9 scouted the coast of [[Spain]] for a suitable steamer for use in the film as the fictional ''Batavia Queen''; ultimately he chose a [[cargo ship]] &ndash; a former [[passenger-cargo ship]] employed as a [[tramp steamer]] between Spain and [[Morocco]] &ndash; he found unloading [[coal]] at a pier in [[Bilbao]] whose captain said she had been built in [[England]] sometime around 1880. \n\nLouri\u00e9 had the steamer remodeled in [[M\u00e1laga]], Spain, at a [[shipyard]] which transformed her into the ''Batavia Queen'' by increasing the height of her [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] and [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and installing new [[Yard (sailing)|yards]] on her masts and a new [[bowsprit]] and carved wooden [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]] on her [[Bow (ship)|bow]]. The steamer also was provided with functioning [[sail]]s for her masts and yards.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nFor special effects, Louri\u00e9's team constructed two models of the modified steamer, a one-to-ten-scale model that was 18 feet (5.5 meters) long, and, for long shots of the ''Batavia Queen'' as she approaches Krakatoa, a one-to-twenty-scale model. The latter proved too small to provide realistic effects, so Louri\u00e9 chose not to use it in the film, instead using only the larger model.<ref name=\"model ships\"/>\n\nAfter considering a [[water tank]] in [[Malta]], Louri\u00e9 chose the water tank he had used for the 1964 film ''[[Flight from Ashiya]]'' at [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in [[Rome]] to film special effects sequences depicting the ''Batavia Queen'' at sea. The tank was approximately 300 by 400 feet (91 by 122 meters) in area and had a sky backing of 70 feet (21 meters). The sequences were filmed using three [[Super Panavision 70]] cameras running at three times normal speed to make the movements of the miniatures more realistic, although the cameras were not designed for such work and often overheated and required repairs. Louri\u00e9 tried to disguise the miniature ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s lack of a crew or passengers as she gets underway for Palembang, slowly picking her way through a narrow passage under a rain of lava bombs while Krakatoa erupts nearby, by enveloping her in smoke. For the final sequence in which the ''Batavia Queen'' rides out a very large tsunami at sea, Louri\u00e9's team spent three days filming the model in the water tank in extreme conditions, creating large waves through the use of 35-foot (10.6-meter) dump tanks with a capacity of 2,600 gallons (9,842 liters),<ref name=\"metric\" group=\"note\">The source does not specify the type of [[gallon]] it uses.

It lost to ''[[Marooned (1969 film)|Marooned]]''.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nLouri\u00e9 himself makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', portraying a [[lighthouse]] keeper on the coast of Java who observes Krakatoa's final, cataclysmic explosion and enters the lighthouse to send news of it by [[telegraph]].<ref name=\"cameo\">[http://modelshipsinthecinema.com/wp/archives/548 Model Ships in the Cinema: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' (caption for photograph of lighthouse keeper operating telegraph)]</ref>\n\n===Yordan's Departure===\nIn addition to its challenging special effects, the makers of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' encountered various difficulties during the film's production. Producer [[Philip Yordan]] dropped out of the production after its special effects had already been shot, and a new associate producer came on board who commissioned a new script.<ref name=\"tcm\">[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/152598%7C0/Krakatoa-East-of-Java.html TCM Film Article: ''Krakatoa, East of Java'']</ref> \n\nThese changes in leadership led to conceptual changes that created some inconsistency in tone and odd moments in the finished film.<ref name=\"tcm\"/> While apparently conceiving ''Krakatoa, East of Java'' overall as a family-friendly adventure story, the producers also opted to attract a more adult audience by including some sordid and racy elements: the tortured relationship between Connerly and Charley and Laura's extramarital affair with Hanson, as well as a [[striptease]] Charley performs for Connerly in their [[state room]].<ref name=\"tcm\"/> \n\nAt other times, the movie{{'}}s soundtrack is clumsily incorporated into the narrative: while performing her striptease, Charley sings a rendition of \"A Nice Old-Fashioned Girl\" that would be appropriate in a [[Musical film|musical]] but seems strangely out of place in an adventure or disaster film, and the vocal version of the movie{{'}}s romantic theme song \"East of Java\" incongruously plays during scenes of filthy prisoners shuffling into the ''Batavia Queen''{{'}}s hold and sweating sailors performing the labor necessary to get the ship out to sea as she begins her voyage from Anjer.<ref name=\"tcm\"/>\n\nKowalski said \"We had more than our share of problems because you can't control such varying conditions as weather, sea, children and animals.  But nearly everyone bore up under very trying circumstances. My life was only threatened four times.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\nKowalski added that \"the tendency  in Cinerama has been to employ wide-angle shots that show everybody in the scene. I'm not doing that. I'm cutting quickly from one shot to another so things happen. I'm also devoting much care to the characters. I think if you have a bunch of people that the audience cares about, then you can build up the big scenic effects with no difficulty.\"<ref name=\"los\"/>\n\n===Title===\nDuring production of ''Krakatoa, East of Java'', its producers became aware that Krakatoa is, in fact, west of Java &ndash; and east of Sumatra. ([[Mount Tambora]], on [[Sumbawa]], much less well known than Krakatoa despite its own &ndash; and even larger &ndash; cataclysmic explosion in 1815, is the violent volcano east of Java.) Despite the geographic error in the film's title, its makers chose to leave it unchanged, apparently believing that it was a more exotic title than \"''Krakatoa, West of Java''.\"{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Furthermore, the film aided in popularizing [[Krakatoa#Etymology|the spelling \"Krakatoa\"]], as opposed to the Indonesian spelling \"Krakatau.\"\n\n===Film format===\n''Krakatoa, East of Java'' was filmed in Super Panavision 70 (with some scenes filmed in [[Todd-AO]]), and presented in [[70 mm film|70&nbsp;mm]] [[Cinerama]] in some cinemas.

Late in the film, when the ''Batavia Queen'' arrives off Palembang in search of Peter Travis, Palembang appears to be along the coast of Sumatra; however, Palembang, while accessible to ships via the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]], lies well inland. The ''Batavia Queen'' finds the mission school in ruins and ablaze because of Krakatoa's eruption; although Krakatoa's eruption was audible in Palembang and the air pressure wave from its final explosion was strong enough to shake the walls of houses and cause cracks to appear in some, the town did not suffer the serious damage implied by the condition of the mission school in the film.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OXcCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&q=Palembang%20Krakatoa Anonymous, ''Nature: A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Science, Volume XXX, May 1884 to October 1884'', New York: McMillan and Company, 1884, p. 12.]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vk8PAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA483&lpg=PA483&q=Palembang%20Krakatoa Symons, G.

In hills where [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees were accessible, they built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. Residents of Monterey recall Redwood houses. One of the main village buildings, the [[sweat lodge]] was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of earth and brush.

The Ohlone probably practiced ''[[Kuksu (religion)|Kuksu]]'', a form of [[shamanism]] shared by many Central and Northern California tribes. Although, it is also possible that the Ohlone people learned Kuksu from other tribes while at the missions. Kuksu included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty [[rites of passage]], intervention with the [[Spirit|spirit world]] and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms.<ref>Bear Shamanism, Kroeber, 1925:472. Observation that Kuksu may have been learned at missions, Kroeber, 1925:470.

However Kroeber observed less \"specialized [[cosmogony]]\" in the Ohlone, which he termed one of the \"southern Kuksu-dancing groups\", in comparison to the [[Maidu]] and groups in the [[Sacramento Valley]]; he noted \"if, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies.\"<ref>Kroeber, 1925:445.</ref>\n\nThe conditions upon which the Ohlone joined the Spanish missions are subject to debate. Some have argued that they were forced to convert to [[Catholicism]], while others have insisted that forced baptism was not recognized by the Catholic Church. All who have looked into the matter agree, however, that baptized Indians who tried to leave mission communities were forced to return. The first conversions to Catholicism were at Mission San Carlos Borromeo, alias Carmel, in 1771. In the San Francisco Bay area the first baptisms occurred at Mission San Francisco in 1777. Many first-generation Mission Era conversions to Catholicism were debatably incomplete and \"external\".<ref>Costo & Costo, 1987, develop the argument for forced conversion; Sandos, 2004, emphasizes conversion through the attractions of modern technology and music; Milliken, 1995:67, discusses first baptisms and conversions to Catholicism at Mission San Francisco; Bean, 1994:279\u2013281 discusses first-generation conversions to Catholicism as incomplete and external.</ref>\n[[File:Coiffures_du_danse_Choris.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of traditional Ohlone headdresses by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\nIt is apparent that the pre-contact Ohlone had distinguished medicine persons among their tribe.

These lodges were built near stream banks because water was believed to be capable of great healing. Men and women would gather in the sweat lodges to \"cleanse, purify, and empower themselves\" for a task like hunting and spirit dancing.<ref name=\"Teixiera 1991\" /> Today, there is a place located in Hollister called [[Indian Canyon, California|Indian Canyon]], where a traditional sweat lodge, or Tupentak, has been built for the same ceremonial purposes. Along with the development of the sweat lodge in the early 1990s, the construction of an upen- tah-ruk, or round house/assembly house, was underway as well. These areas are meant to provide a gathering place for tribal meetings, traditional dances and ceremonies, and education activities.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\">{{cite book|last=Sayers|first=Anne|title=In Breath So It Is in Spirit:The Story of Indian Canyon|date=1994|publisher=Ballena|pages=350\u2013355}}</ref> Indian Canyon is an important place because it is open to all Native American groups in the United States and around the world as a place to hold traditional native practices without federal restrictions.

Indian Canyon allows Natives to reclaim their heritage and implement their ancestral beliefs and practices into their lives.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\" />\n\n===Sacred narratives and mythology===\n\nThe storytelling of sacred narratives has been an important component of Ohlone indigenous culture for thousands of years, and continues to be of importance today. The narratives often teach specific moral or spiritual lessons, and are illustrative of the cultural, spiritual, and religious beliefs of the tribe. Because not all the Ohlone bands shared a unified identity, and therefore have varying religious and spiritual beliefs, the stories are unique to the tribe. Today, sacred narratives are still an important part of the Ohlone culture. Sadly, only a minimal number of sacred stories have survived Spanish colonization during the 1700s and 1800s due to ethnographic efforts in the Missions. Many Ohlone bands refer to anthropologic records to reconstruct their sacred narratives because some Ohlone people living in the missions acted as \"professional consultants\" for anthropologic research, and therefore told their past stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California: Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=47\u201371|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref> The problem with this type of recording is that the stories are not always complete due to translation differences where meaning can be easily misunderstood.\n\nTherefore, many Ohlone bands today feel responsible for re-adopting these narratives and discussing them with cultural representatives and other Ohlone people to decide what their meanings are. This process is important because the Ohlone can further piece together a cultural identity of their past ancestors, and ultimately for themselves as well. Additionally, through knowing sacred narratives and sharing them with the public through live performances or storytelling, the Ohlone people are able to create an awareness that their cultural group is not extinct, but actually surviving and wanting recognition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California:Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nOhlone folklore and legend centered around the Californian [[culture hero]]es of the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] trickster spirit, as well as Eagle and Hummingbird (and in the Chochenyo region, a falcon-like being named Kaknu).

The Ohlone territory consisted of the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula down to Big Sur in the south. There were more than fifty Ohlone landholding groups prior to the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries. The Ohlone were able to thrive in this area by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical pattern found in California coastal tribes. Each of the Ohlone villages interacted with each other through trade, intermarriage, and ceremonial events, as well as through occasional conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Teixeira|first=Lauren|title=Access to information on the Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay area: a descriptive guide to research.|date=1991|publisher=Masters Thesis}}</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone culture was relatively stable until the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double-purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans by building a series of [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and of expanding Spanish territorial claims. The Rumsien were the first Ohlone people to be encountered and documented in Spanish records when, in 1602, explorer [[Sebastian Vizca\u00edno]] reached and named the area that is now [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] in December of that year. Despite Vizca\u00edno's positive reports, nothing further happened for more than 160 years. It was not until 1769 that the next Spanish expedition arrived in Monterey, led by [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]]. This time, the [[Spanish missions in California#Military districts|military expedition]] was accompanied by [[Franciscan]] missionaries, whose purpose was to establish a chain of missions to bring Christianity to the native people. Under the leadership of Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], the missions introduced Spanish religion and culture to the Ohlone.<ref>For Spanish missionaries and colonization, Teixeira, 1997:3; Fink, 1972:29\u201330.

Under Father Serra's leadership, the Spanish Franciscans erected seven missions inside the Ohlone region and brought most of the Ohlone into these missions to live and work. The missions erected within the Ohlone region were: [[Mission San Carlos Borrom\u00e9o de Carmelo]] (founded in 1770), [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1776), [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1777), [[Mission Santa Cruz]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] (founded in 1797), and [[Mission San Juan Bautista]] (founded in 1797). The Ohlone who went to live at the missions were called [[Mission Indians]], and also ''[[:wikt:neophyte|neophytes]].'' They were blended with other Native American ethnicities such as the [[Coast Miwok]] transported from the North Bay into the Mission San Francisco and Mission San Jos\u00e9.<ref>Mission name list only; dates from Wikipedia related article.

The Spanish soldiers traditionally escorted the Franciscans on missionary outreach daytrips but declined to camp overnight. For the first twenty years, the missions accepted a few converts at a time, slowly gaining population. Between November 1794 and May 1795, a large wave of Bay Area Native Americans were [[baptism|baptized]] and moved into Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Francisco, including 360 people to Mission Santa Clara and the entire Huichun village populations of the East Bay to Mission San Francisco. In March 1795, this migration was followed almost immediately by the worst-seen epidemic, as well as food shortages, resulting in alarming statistics of death and escapes from the missions. In pursuing the runaways, the Franciscans sent neophytes first and (as a last resort) soldiers to go round up the runaway \"Christians\" from their relatives, and bring them back to the missions. By running to tribes outside of the missions, escapees and those sent to bring them back to the mission spread illness outside of the missions.<ref>For events of 1795\u20131796, Milliken, 1995:129\u2013134 (\"Mass Migration in Winter of 1794\u201395\").

Other causes were a drastic diet change from hunter and gatherer fare to a diet high in carbohydrates and low in vegetables and animal protein, harsh lifestyle changes, and unsanitary living conditions.<ref name=\"Bean 1994\"/>\n\n====Land and property disputes====\n\nUnder Spanish rule, the intent for the future of the mission properties is difficult to ascertain. Property disputes arose over who owned the mission (and adjacent) lands, between the Spanish crown, the Catholic Church, the Natives and the Spanish settlers of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]: There were \"heated debates\" between \"the Spanish State and ecclesiastical bureaucracies\" over the government authority of the missions. Setting the precedent in an interesting petition to the Governor in 1782, the Franciscan priests claimed the \"Missions Indians\" owned both land and cattle, and they represented the Natives in a petition against the San Jose settlers. The fathers mentioned the \"Indians' crops\" were being damaged by the San Jose settlers' livestock and also mentioned settlers \"getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission.\"  They also stated the Mission Indians had property and rights to defend it: \"Indians are at liberty to slaughter such (San Jose pueblo) livestock as trespass unto their lands.\" \"By law\", the mission property was to pass to the Mission Indians after a period of about ten years, when they would become Spanish citizens. In the interim period, the Franciscans were mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Natives.<ref>For \"heated debates\" between church and state, Milliken, 1995:2n. For petition of 1782, Indians vs. settlers of San Jose, with quotations, see Milliken, 1995:72\u201373 (quoting Murguia and Pena [1782] 1955:400).

At this point, the Ohlone were supposed to receive land grants and property rights, but few did and most of the mission lands went to the secular administrators. In the end, even attempts by mission leaders to restore native lands were in vain. Before this time, 73 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]], but with the new r\u00e9gime most lands were turned into Mexican-owned rancherias. The Ohlone became the laborers and ''vaqueros'' (cowboys) of Mexican-owned rancherias.<ref>Fink, 1972:64: \"Land grants were scarce; In 1830 only 50 private ranches were held in Alta California, of which 7 were in the Monterey region.\" For number of land grants, see Cowan 1956:139\u2013140. For Mission secularizarion to rancherias, Teixeira, 1997:3; Bean, 1994:234; Fink, 1972:63.</ref>\n\n===Survival===\n[[File:Isabel Meadows.jpg|thumb|[[Isabel Meadows]], considered the last fluent speaker of an Ohlone language]]\nThe Ohlone eventually regathered in multi-ethnic rancherias, along with other Mission Indians from families that spoke the [[Coast Miwok]], [[Bay Miwok]], [[Plains Miwok]], [[Patwin]], [[Yokuts]], and [[Esselen]] languages. Many of the Ohlone that had survived the experience at Mission San Jose went to work at ''Alisal Rancheria'' in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], and ''El Molino'' in [[Niles, California|Niles]]. Communities of mission survivors also formed in [[Sunol, California|Sunol]], Monterey and [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]. In the 1840s a wave of United States settlers encroached into the area, and California became annexed to the United States. The new settlers brought in new diseases to the Ohlone.<ref>Teixeira, 1997:3\u20134, \"Historical Overview\".</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone lost the vast majority of their population between 1780 and 1850, because of an abysmal birth rate, high infant mortality rate, diseases and social upheaval associated with European immigration into California. By all estimates, the Ohlone were reduced to less than ten percent of their original pre-mission era population. By 1852 the Ohlone population had shrunk to about 864\u20131,000, and was continuing to decline. By the early 1880s, the northern Ohlone were virtually extinct, and the southern Ohlone people were severely impacted and largely displaced from their communal land grant in the [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]]. To call attention to the plight of the California Indians, Indian Agent, reformer, and popular novelist [[Helen Hunt Jackson]] published accounts of her travels among the Mission Indians of California in 1883.<ref>For population estimates, Cook, 1976a:183, 236\u2013245.

See also Blevins 2004.</ref>\n\n==Burial practices==\n\n===Sacred sites and importance===\nThe arrival of the Spanish in the 1776 decelerated the culture, sovereignty, religion, and language of the Ohlone. Before the Spanish invasion, the Muwekma Ohlone had an estimated 500 shellmounds lining the sea and shores of the San Francisco Bay. Shellmounds are essentially Ohlone habitation sites where peopled lived and died and often buried. The mounds consist predominately of molluscan shells, with lesser amounts mammal and fish bone, vegetal materials and other organic material deposited by the Ohlone for thousands of years. These shellmounds are the direct result of village life. Archaeologists have examined the mounds and often refer to them as \"middens,\" or \"kitchen midden\" meaning an accumulation of refuse. \n\nOne theory is that the massive amount of shellfish remains represent Ohlone ritual behavior, whereas they would spend months mourning their dead and feasting on large amounts of shellfish which were disposed of ever growing the girth and height of the mound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartier|first=Robert|title=Santa Cruz County History - Spanish Period & Earlier.}}</ref>{{fact|date=May 2019}} Shellmounds were once found all over the San Francisco Bay area near marshlands, creeks, wetlands, and rivers. San Bruno Mountain is home to the nation's largest intact shellmound. These mounds are also thought to have served a practical purpose as well, since these shellmounds were usually near waterways or the ocean, they protected the village from high tide as well as to provide high ground for line of sight navigation for watercraft on San Francisco Bay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=Unacknowledged Tribes, Dangerous Knowledge: The Muwekma Ohlone and How Indian Identities Are \"Known\".|date=2003}}</ref> The [[Emeryville Shellmound]] is a site standing at over 60 feet (18 m) tall and 350 feet (105 m) in diameter, and was believed to be occupied between 400 and 2800 years ago.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe Ohlone burial practices changed over time with cremation being preferred before the arrival of the Spanish. Once the cremation was complete the loved ones and friends would place ornaments as well as other valuables as an offering to the dead. Ohlone believed that this would give them good fortune in the afterlife. Many of these artifacts have been found in and around the shellmounds. They often include a wide variety of shell beads and ornaments as well as frequently used everyday items such as stone and bone tools. These burials also showcase genealogies and territorial rights. The mounds were seen as a cultural statement because the villages on top were clearly visible and their sacred aura was very dominant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heizer|first=Robert|title=The California Indians; a Source Book|url=https://archive.org/details/californiaindia00heiz|url-access=registration|date=1971|location=Berkeley: University of California.}}</ref>\n\n===Present day burial and sacred sites===\n\n'''Glen Cove'''\n\nOhlone tribes have protested in Vallejo, California and insist that Glen Cove, a sacred site for many Natives, is one of the last native village sites in the San Francisco Bay that has escaped urban development.

Natives today are engaging in extensive cultural research to bring back knowledge, narratives, beliefs, and practices of the post-contact days with the Spanish. The Spanish eradicated and stripped the Ohlones of their cultural heritage by causing the death of ninety percent of the population, and forcing cultural assimilation with military fortification and Catholic reform. After the arrival of the Americans, many land grants were contested in court.  Preserving their burial sites is a way to gain acknowledgment as a cultural group.<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolin|first=Malcolm|title=The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area.|url=https://archive.org/details/ohlonewayindianl00marg_0|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Heyday|location=Berkeley}}</ref>\n\n'''Site CA-SCL-732- Kaphan Umux or Three Wolves Site'''\n\nThe Muwekma Ohlone tribe are active participants in the revival of Ohlone people across the East and South Bay. Key to their success is in their involvement in unearthing and analyzing their ancestral remains in ancient burial sites, which allows them to \"recapture their history and to reconstruct the present and future of their people\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=\"What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> Due to Spanish colonization in the 1700s so much cultural history, knowledge, and identity was lost due to death and forced assimilation of so many natives. Only some sacred cultural narratives survive through the recording of stories told from various Ohlone elders living in the missions between 1769\u20131833. This makes analyzing pre-contact Ohlone sites so difficult because so much of the symbolism and ritual are unknown. Therefore, the Muwekma see their participation in archeological projects as a way to bring tribal members together as a unified community, and as a way to reestablish the link between the Ohlone people today and their pre-contact ancestors through their ability to analyze remains and be coauthors in the archeological reports.<ref name=\"Field 2003\">{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|date=2003|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> One major archeological site the Muwekma tribe actively helped excavate, is the burial site CA-SCL-732 in San Jose, dating between 1500-2700 BCE. In this burial site, excavated in 1992, the remains of three ritually buried wolves were found among human remains.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> In other grave site, the skeletal remains of two more wolves were found with \"braided, uncured yucca or soap root fiber cordage around their necks\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> There were many other fragments of remains of animals like deer, squirrel, mountain lion, grizzly bear, fox, badger, blue goose, and elk found as well. From the excavations it is clear that the animals were ritually buried, along with beads and other ornamentations.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\nAlthough the truth may not be known about exactly what these findings mean, the Muwekma and the archeological team analyzed the ritual burial of the animal remains as a way to learn what they may tell about the Ohlone cosmology and cultural system before pre-contact influence. One way the team did this was utilizing known narratives of the Ohlone, as ascribed by previous ethnographers who recorded the sacred narratives of various Ohlone elders in the missions across the Bay, well as the narratives telling of other central California cosmologies to make references about what the meaning of the possible kinship between the animals and the Ohlone in these burials were. Together the archeological team made three hypotheses: animals served as \"moieties, clans, lineages, families, and so on,\" animals were \"dream helpers,\" or personal spirit allies for individuals, and lastly, the animals were representations of \"sacred deity-like figures\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\n===Indian People Organizing for Change===\nIndian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) is a community-based organization in the San Francisco Bay Area. Its members, including Ohlone tribal members and conservation activists, work together in order to accomplish social and environmental justice within the Bay Area American Indian community. Current projects include the preservation of Bay Area shellmounds, which are the sacred burial sites of the Ohlone Nation, whose homeland is the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, IPOC has spread awareness throughout the community through shellmounds walks and has advocated for the preservation of sacred burial sites in the Emeryville Mall, Glen Cove Site, Hunters Point in San Francisco, just to name a few.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gould|first=Corrina|title=\"Indian People Organizing for Change.\" Indian People Organizing for Change.|url=http://ipocshellmoundwalk.homestead.com/}}</ref>\n\n==== Sogorea Te Land Trust ====\n{{Main|Sogorea Te Land Trust}}\nThe Sogorea Te Land Trust is a [[land trust]] founded by members of IPOC in 2012 with the goals of returning traditionally [[Chochenyo]] and [[Karkin]] lands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] stewardship and cultivating more active, reciprocal relationships with the land.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Indigenous-women-lead-effort-to-reclaim-ancestral-12384730.php|title=Indigenous women lead effort to reclaim ancestral lands|last=Kost|first=Ryan|date=28 November 2017|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref> It has also started a project called the Shuumi Land Tax, which asks that non-indigenous people living on Ohlone land to pay dues for the land that they live on.<ref name=\":0\" /> The tax has no legal ramifications and no connection with the United States government or [[Internal Revenue Service]], but the organization prefers this term (as opposed to merely calling contributions [[Donation|donations]]) as it asserts indigenous [[sovereignty]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kalw.org/post/native-americans-ask-east-bay-residents-pay-tax-land#stream/0|title=Native Americans ask East Bay residents to pay 'tax' on land|last=Dalmas|first=Jeremy|date=16 April 2018|website=KALW Local Public Radio 91.7 San Francisco|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nCostanoan is an externally applied name ([[exonym]]). The Spanish explorers and settlers referred to the native groups of this region collectively as the ''Coste\u00f1os'' (the \"coastal people\") circa 1769. Over time, the English-speaking settlers arriving later [[Anglicized]] the word ''Coste\u00f1os'' into the name of ''Costanoans.'' (The suffix \"-an\" is English). For many years, the people were called the Costanoans in English language and records.<ref name=\"Teix-pg4\">Teixeira, 1997:4, \"The Term 'Costanoan/Ohlone'\".</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, the name of Ohlone has been used by some of the members and the popular media to replace the name ''Costanoan.'' ''Ohlone'' might have originally derived from a Spanish rancho called ''Oljon'', and referred to a single band who inhabited the Pacific Coast near [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]] Creek. The name ''Ohlone'' was traced by Teixeira through the mission records of Mission San Francisco, Bancroft's ''Native Races'', and Frederick Beechey's Journal regarding a visit to the Bay Area in 1826\u201327. ''Oljone'', ''Olchones'' and ''Alchones'' are spelling variations of ''Ohlone'' found in Mission San Francisco records. However, because of its tribal origin, Ohlone is not universally accepted by the native people, and some members prefer to either to continue to use the name Costanoan or to revitalize and be known as the ''Muwekma''. Teixeira maintains Ohlone is the common usage since 1960, which has been traced back to the Rancho Oljon on the Pescadero Creek. Teixeira states in part: \"A tribe that once existed along the San Mateo County coast.\" Milliken states the name came from: \"A tribe on the lower drainages of San Gregorio Creek and Pescadero Creek on the Pacific Coast\".<!--CITATIONS:--><ref>Opinions and quotations, Teixeira 1997:4; Milliken, 1995:249.</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\n{{See also|List of Ohlone villages}}\nLinguists identified eight regional, linguistic divisions or subgroups of the Ohlone, listed below from north to south:<ref>Levy, 1978:485\u2013486; Teixeira, 1997:37\u201338, \"Linguistics\"; and Milliken, 1995:24\u201326, \"Linguistic Landscape\".

However, modern researchers{{who|date=April 2014}} believe that American anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]]'s projection of 7,000&nbsp;Ohlone \"Costanoans\" was much too low. Later researchers such as [[Richard L. Levy|Richard Levy]] estimated \"10,000 or more\" Ohlone.<ref name=\"Levy, 1978:486\"/>\n\nThe highest estimate comes from [[Sherburne F. Cook]], who in later life concluded there were 26,000 Ohlone and Salinans in the \"Northern Mission Area\". Per Cook, the \"Northern Mission Area\" means \"the region inhabited by the Costanoans and Salinans between San Francisco Bay and the headwaters of the Salinas River. To this may be added for convenience the local area under the jurisdiction of the San Luis Obispo even though there is an infringement of the Chumash.\" In this model, the Ohlone people's territory was one half of the \"Northern Mission Area\". It was however known to be more densely populated than the southern Salinan territory, per Cook: \"The Costanoan density was nearly 1.8 persons per square mile with the maximum in the Bay region. The Esselen was approximately 1.3, the Salinan must have been still lower.\" We can estimate that Cook meant about 18,200 Ohlone based on his own statements (70% of \"Northern Mission Area\"), plus or minus a few thousand margin for error, but he does not give an exact number.<ref>For definition of 'Northern Mission area\", Cook, 1976b:20. For density of populations, Cook, 1976a:187.</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone population after contact in 1769 with the Spaniards spiralled downwards. Cook describes rapidly declining indigenous populations in California between 1769 and 1900, in his posthumously published book, ''The Population of the California Indians, 1769\u20131970.'' Cook states in part: \"Not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"  The population had dropped to about 10% of its original numbers by 1848.<ref>For quotation, see Cook, 1976b:200.

Kroeber]] who researched the California natives and authored a few publications on the Ohlone from 1904 to 1910, and [[Clinton Hart Merriam|C. Hart Merriam]] who researched the Ohlone in detail from 1902 to 1929. This was followed by [[John Peabody Harrington|John P. Harrington]] who researched the Ohlone languages from 1921 to 1939, and other aspects of Ohlone culture, leaving volumes of field notes at his death. Other research was added by Robert Cartier, Madison S. Beeler, and [[Sherburne F. Cook]], to name a few. In many cases, the Ohlone names they used vary in spelling, translation and tribal boundaries, depending on the source. Each tried to [[chronicle]] and interpret this complex society and language(s) before the pieces vanished.<ref>Historians and research years, Teixeira, 1997, biographical articles; notably page 34: \"John Peabody Harrington\". Variances in data and interpretation can be noted in main published references Kroeber, Merriam, Harrington, Cook.</ref>\n\nThere was noticeable competition and some disagreement between the first scholars: Both Merriam and Harrington produced much in-depth Ohlone research in the shadow of the highly published Kroeber and competed in print with him. In the ''Editor's Introduction'' to ''Merriam (1979)'', Robert F. Heizer (as the protege of Kroeber and also the curator of Merriam's work) states \"both men disliked A. L. Kroeber.\"  Harrington, independently working for the Smithsonian Institution cornered most of the Ohlone research as his own specialty, was \"not willing to share his findings with Kroeber&nbsp;... Kroeber and his students neglected the Chumash and Costanoans, but this was done because Harrington made it quite clear that he would resent Kroeber's 'muscling in.{{'\"}}<ref>Quotation \"both men disliked Kroeber\" said by Heizer, in \"Editor's Intro\" of Merriam (1979).

When Spanish explorers and missionaries arrived in the late 18th century, the Ohlone inhabited the area along the coast from [[San Francisco Bay]] through [[Monterey Bay]] to the lower [[Salinas Valley]]. At that time they spoke a variety of related languages. The [[Ohlone languages]] make up a sub-family of the [[Utian languages|Utian language]] family.<ref>Callaghan 1997</ref> Older proposals place Utian within the [[Penutian language|Penutian]] language phylum, while newer proposals group it as [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]].\n\nBritish ethnologist [[Robert Gordon Latham]] originally used the term \"Costanoan\" to refer to the linguistically similar but ethnically diverse Native American tribes in the San Francisco Bay Area.<ref>{{cite journal |title=On the Languages of Northern, Western and Central America |author=Latham, R.

They lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical ethnographic California pattern. The members of these various bands interacted freely with one another.

The Spanish constructed [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] along the California coast with the objective of Christianizing the native people and culture. Between the years 1769 and 1834, the number of Indigenous Californians dropped from 300,000 to 250,000. After California entered into the Union in 1850, the state government perpetrated massacres against the Ohlone people.

The Muwekma Ohlone Tribe has members from around the San Francisco Bay Area, and is composed of descendants of the Ohlones/Costanoans from the San Jose, Santa Clara, and San Francisco missions. The Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation, consisting of descendants of intermarried [[Rumsen tribe|Rumsen]] Costanoan and [[Esselen]] speakers of Mission San Carlos Borromeo, are centered at Monterey. The Amah-Mutsun Tribe are descendants of [[Mutsun tribe|Mutsun]] Costanoan speakers of Mission San Juan Bautista, inland from Monterey Bay. Most members of another group of Rumsien language, descendants from Mission San Carlos, the Costanoan Rumsien Carmel Tribe of Pomona/Chino, now live in southern California. These groups, and others with smaller memberships (see groups listed under the heading ''Present Day'' below) are separately petitioning the federal government for [[Federally recognized tribes|tribal recognition]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Choris Ohlone.jpg|thumb|Ohlone people painted by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\n=== Pre-Contact Lifestyle ===\nThe Ohlone inhabited fixed village locations, moving temporarily to gather seasonal foodstuffs like [[acorn]]s and berries. The Ohlone people lived in Northern California from the northern tip of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] down to northern region of [[Big Sur]], and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the [[Diablo Range]] in the east. Their vast region included the San Francisco Peninsula, [[Santa Clara Valley]], [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], [[Monterey Bay|Monterey Bay area]], as well as present-day [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] and the [[Salinas Valley]]. Prior to Spanish contact, the Ohlone formed a complex association of approximately 50&nbsp;different \"nations or tribes\" with about 50 to 500 members each, with an average of 200. Over 50&nbsp;distinct Ohlone tribes and villages have been recorded. The Ohlone villages interacted through trade, intermarriage and ceremonial events, as well as some [[wiktionary:internecine|internecine]] conflict. Cultural arts included [[basket-weaving]] skills, seasonal ceremonial dancing events, female [[tattoo]]s, ear and nose piercings, and other ornamentation.<ref>For habitation region, Kroeber, 1925:462.

In hills where [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees were accessible, they built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. Residents of Monterey recall Redwood houses. One of the main village buildings, the [[sweat lodge]] was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of earth and brush.

In cold weather, they might don animal skin capes or feather capes. Women commonly wore deerskin aprons, [[tule]] skirts, or shredded bark skirts. On cool days, they also wore animal skin capes.

Although, it is also possible that the Ohlone people learned Kuksu from other tribes while at the missions. Kuksu included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty [[rites of passage]], intervention with the [[Spirit|spirit world]] and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms.<ref>Bear Shamanism, Kroeber, 1925:472.

However Kroeber observed less \"specialized [[cosmogony]]\" in the Ohlone, which he termed one of the \"southern Kuksu-dancing groups\", in comparison to the [[Maidu]] and groups in the [[Sacramento Valley]]; he noted \"if, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies.\"<ref>Kroeber, 1925:445.</ref>\n\nThe conditions upon which the Ohlone joined the Spanish missions are subject to debate. Some have argued that they were forced to convert to [[Catholicism]], while others have insisted that forced baptism was not recognized by the Catholic Church. All who have looked into the matter agree, however, that baptized Indians who tried to leave mission communities were forced to return. The first conversions to Catholicism were at Mission San Carlos Borromeo, alias Carmel, in 1771. In the San Francisco Bay area the first baptisms occurred at Mission San Francisco in 1777. Many first-generation Mission Era conversions to Catholicism were debatably incomplete and \"external\".<ref>Costo & Costo, 1987, develop the argument for forced conversion; Sandos, 2004, emphasizes conversion through the attractions of modern technology and music; Milliken, 1995:67, discusses first baptisms and conversions to Catholicism at Mission San Francisco; Bean, 1994:279\u2013281 discusses first-generation conversions to Catholicism as incomplete and external.</ref>\n[[File:Coiffures_du_danse_Choris.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of traditional Ohlone headdresses by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\nIt is apparent that the pre-contact Ohlone had distinguished medicine persons among their tribe.

These lodges were built near stream banks because water was believed to be capable of great healing. Men and women would gather in the sweat lodges to \"cleanse, purify, and empower themselves\" for a task like hunting and spirit dancing.<ref name=\"Teixiera 1991\" /> Today, there is a place located in Hollister called [[Indian Canyon, California|Indian Canyon]], where a traditional sweat lodge, or Tupentak, has been built for the same ceremonial purposes. Along with the development of the sweat lodge in the early 1990s, the construction of an upen- tah-ruk, or round house/assembly house, was underway as well. These areas are meant to provide a gathering place for tribal meetings, traditional dances and ceremonies, and education activities.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\">{{cite book|last=Sayers|first=Anne|title=In Breath So It Is in Spirit:The Story of Indian Canyon|date=1994|publisher=Ballena|pages=350\u2013355}}</ref> Indian Canyon is an important place because it is open to all Native American groups in the United States and around the world as a place to hold traditional native practices without federal restrictions. Indian Canyon is also home to many Ohlone people, specifically of the Mutsun band, and serves as an educational, cultural, and spiritual environment for all visitors. Indian Canyon allows Natives to reclaim their heritage and implement their ancestral beliefs and practices into their lives.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\" />\n\n===Sacred narratives and mythology===\n\nThe storytelling of sacred narratives has been an important component of Ohlone indigenous culture for thousands of years, and continues to be of importance today. The narratives often teach specific moral or spiritual lessons, and are illustrative of the cultural, spiritual, and religious beliefs of the tribe. Because not all the Ohlone bands shared a unified identity, and therefore have varying religious and spiritual beliefs, the stories are unique to the tribe. Today, sacred narratives are still an important part of the Ohlone culture. Sadly, only a minimal number of sacred stories have survived Spanish colonization during the 1700s and 1800s due to ethnographic efforts in the Missions. Many Ohlone bands refer to anthropologic records to reconstruct their sacred narratives because some Ohlone people living in the missions acted as \"professional consultants\" for anthropologic research, and therefore told their past stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California: Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=47\u201371|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref> The problem with this type of recording is that the stories are not always complete due to translation differences where meaning can be easily misunderstood.\n\nTherefore, many Ohlone bands today feel responsible for re-adopting these narratives and discussing them with cultural representatives and other Ohlone people to decide what their meanings are. This process is important because the Ohlone can further piece together a cultural identity of their past ancestors, and ultimately for themselves as well. Additionally, through knowing sacred narratives and sharing them with the public through live performances or storytelling, the Ohlone people are able to create an awareness that their cultural group is not extinct, but actually surviving and wanting recognition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California:Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nOhlone folklore and legend centered around the Californian [[culture hero]]es of the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] trickster spirit, as well as Eagle and Hummingbird (and in the Chochenyo region, a falcon-like being named Kaknu).

The Ohlone territory consisted of the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula down to Big Sur in the south. There were more than fifty Ohlone landholding groups prior to the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries. The Ohlone were able to thrive in this area by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical pattern found in California coastal tribes. Each of the Ohlone villages interacted with each other through trade, intermarriage, and ceremonial events, as well as through occasional conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Teixeira|first=Lauren|title=Access to information on the Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay area: a descriptive guide to research.|date=1991|publisher=Masters Thesis}}</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone culture was relatively stable until the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double-purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans by building a series of [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and of expanding Spanish territorial claims. The Rumsien were the first Ohlone people to be encountered and documented in Spanish records when, in 1602, explorer [[Sebastian Vizca\u00edno]] reached and named the area that is now [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] in December of that year. Despite Vizca\u00edno's positive reports, nothing further happened for more than 160 years. It was not until 1769 that the next Spanish expedition arrived in Monterey, led by [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]]. This time, the [[Spanish missions in California#Military districts|military expedition]] was accompanied by [[Franciscan]] missionaries, whose purpose was to establish a chain of missions to bring Christianity to the native people. Under the leadership of Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], the missions introduced Spanish religion and culture to the Ohlone.<ref>For Spanish missionaries and colonization, Teixeira, 1997:3; Fink, 1972:29\u201330.

Under Father Serra's leadership, the Spanish Franciscans erected seven missions inside the Ohlone region and brought most of the Ohlone into these missions to live and work. The missions erected within the Ohlone region were: [[Mission San Carlos Borrom\u00e9o de Carmelo]] (founded in 1770), [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1776), [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1777), [[Mission Santa Cruz]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] (founded in 1797), and [[Mission San Juan Bautista]] (founded in 1797). The Ohlone who went to live at the missions were called [[Mission Indians]], and also ''[[:wikt:neophyte|neophytes]].'' They were blended with other Native American ethnicities such as the [[Coast Miwok]] transported from the North Bay into the Mission San Francisco and Mission San Jos\u00e9.<ref>Mission name list only; dates from Wikipedia related article.

The Spanish soldiers traditionally escorted the Franciscans on missionary outreach daytrips but declined to camp overnight. For the first twenty years, the missions accepted a few converts at a time, slowly gaining population. Between November 1794 and May 1795, a large wave of Bay Area Native Americans were [[baptism|baptized]] and moved into Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Francisco, including 360 people to Mission Santa Clara and the entire Huichun village populations of the East Bay to Mission San Francisco. In March 1795, this migration was followed almost immediately by the worst-seen epidemic, as well as food shortages, resulting in alarming statistics of death and escapes from the missions. In pursuing the runaways, the Franciscans sent neophytes first and (as a last resort) soldiers to go round up the runaway \"Christians\" from their relatives, and bring them back to the missions. By running to tribes outside of the missions, escapees and those sent to bring them back to the mission spread illness outside of the missions.<ref>For events of 1795\u20131796, Milliken, 1995:129\u2013134 (\"Mass Migration in Winter of 1794\u201395\").

Other causes were a drastic diet change from hunter and gatherer fare to a diet high in carbohydrates and low in vegetables and animal protein, harsh lifestyle changes, and unsanitary living conditions.<ref name=\"Bean 1994\"/>\n\n====Land and property disputes====\n\nUnder Spanish rule, the intent for the future of the mission properties is difficult to ascertain. Property disputes arose over who owned the mission (and adjacent) lands, between the Spanish crown, the Catholic Church, the Natives and the Spanish settlers of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]: There were \"heated debates\" between \"the Spanish State and ecclesiastical bureaucracies\" over the government authority of the missions. Setting the precedent in an interesting petition to the Governor in 1782, the Franciscan priests claimed the \"Missions Indians\" owned both land and cattle, and they represented the Natives in a petition against the San Jose settlers. The fathers mentioned the \"Indians' crops\" were being damaged by the San Jose settlers' livestock and also mentioned settlers \"getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission.\"  They also stated the Mission Indians had property and rights to defend it: \"Indians are at liberty to slaughter such (San Jose pueblo) livestock as trespass unto their lands.\" \"By law\", the mission property was to pass to the Mission Indians after a period of about ten years, when they would become Spanish citizens. In the interim period, the Franciscans were mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Natives.<ref>For \"heated debates\" between church and state, Milliken, 1995:2n. For petition of 1782, Indians vs. settlers of San Jose, with quotations, see Milliken, 1995:72\u201373 (quoting Murguia and Pena [1782] 1955:400).

At this point, the Ohlone were supposed to receive land grants and property rights, but few did and most of the mission lands went to the secular administrators. In the end, even attempts by mission leaders to restore native lands were in vain. Before this time, 73 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]], but with the new r\u00e9gime most lands were turned into Mexican-owned rancherias. The Ohlone became the laborers and ''vaqueros'' (cowboys) of Mexican-owned rancherias.<ref>Fink, 1972:64: \"Land grants were scarce; In 1830 only 50 private ranches were held in Alta California, of which 7 were in the Monterey region.\" For number of land grants, see Cowan 1956:139\u2013140. For Mission secularizarion to rancherias, Teixeira, 1997:3; Bean, 1994:234; Fink, 1972:63.</ref>\n\n===Survival===\n[[File:Isabel Meadows.jpg|thumb|[[Isabel Meadows]], considered the last fluent speaker of an Ohlone language]]\nThe Ohlone eventually regathered in multi-ethnic rancherias, along with other Mission Indians from families that spoke the [[Coast Miwok]], [[Bay Miwok]], [[Plains Miwok]], [[Patwin]], [[Yokuts]], and [[Esselen]] languages. Many of the Ohlone that had survived the experience at Mission San Jose went to work at ''Alisal Rancheria'' in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], and ''El Molino'' in [[Niles, California|Niles]]. Communities of mission survivors also formed in [[Sunol, California|Sunol]], Monterey and [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]. In the 1840s a wave of United States settlers encroached into the area, and California became annexed to the United States. The new settlers brought in new diseases to the Ohlone.<ref>Teixeira, 1997:3\u20134, \"Historical Overview\".</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone lost the vast majority of their population between 1780 and 1850, because of an abysmal birth rate, high infant mortality rate, diseases and social upheaval associated with European immigration into California. By all estimates, the Ohlone were reduced to less than ten percent of their original pre-mission era population. By 1852 the Ohlone population had shrunk to about 864\u20131,000, and was continuing to decline. By the early 1880s, the northern Ohlone were virtually extinct, and the southern Ohlone people were severely impacted and largely displaced from their communal land grant in the [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]]. To call attention to the plight of the California Indians, Indian Agent, reformer, and popular novelist [[Helen Hunt Jackson]] published accounts of her travels among the Mission Indians of California in 1883.<ref>For population estimates, Cook, 1976a:183, 236\u2013245.

Before the Spanish invasion, the Muwekma Ohlone had an estimated 500 shellmounds lining the sea and shores of the San Francisco Bay. Shellmounds are essentially Ohlone habitation sites where peopled lived and died and often buried. The mounds consist predominately of molluscan shells, with lesser amounts mammal and fish bone, vegetal materials and other organic material deposited by the Ohlone for thousands of years. These shellmounds are the direct result of village life. Archaeologists have examined the mounds and often refer to them as \"middens,\" or \"kitchen midden\" meaning an accumulation of refuse. \n\nOne theory is that the massive amount of shellfish remains represent Ohlone ritual behavior, whereas they would spend months mourning their dead and feasting on large amounts of shellfish which were disposed of ever growing the girth and height of the mound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartier|first=Robert|title=Santa Cruz County History - Spanish Period & Earlier.}}</ref>{{fact|date=May 2019}} Shellmounds were once found all over the San Francisco Bay area near marshlands, creeks, wetlands, and rivers. San Bruno Mountain is home to the nation's largest intact shellmound. These mounds are also thought to have served a practical purpose as well, since these shellmounds were usually near waterways or the ocean, they protected the village from high tide as well as to provide high ground for line of sight navigation for watercraft on San Francisco Bay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=Unacknowledged Tribes, Dangerous Knowledge: The Muwekma Ohlone and How Indian Identities Are \"Known\".|date=2003}}</ref> The [[Emeryville Shellmound]] is a site standing at over 60 feet (18 m) tall and 350 feet (105 m) in diameter, and was believed to be occupied between 400 and 2800 years ago.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe Ohlone burial practices changed over time with cremation being preferred before the arrival of the Spanish. Once the cremation was complete the loved ones and friends would place ornaments as well as other valuables as an offering to the dead. Ohlone believed that this would give them good fortune in the afterlife. Many of these artifacts have been found in and around the shellmounds. They often include a wide variety of shell beads and ornaments as well as frequently used everyday items such as stone and bone tools. These burials also showcase genealogies and territorial rights. The mounds were seen as a cultural statement because the villages on top were clearly visible and their sacred aura was very dominant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heizer|first=Robert|title=The California Indians; a Source Book|url=https://archive.org/details/californiaindia00heiz|url-access=registration|date=1971|location=Berkeley: University of California.}}</ref>\n\n===Present day burial and sacred sites===\n\n'''Glen Cove'''\n\nOhlone tribes have protested in Vallejo, California and insist that Glen Cove, a sacred site for many Natives, is one of the last native village sites in the San Francisco Bay that has escaped urban development.

Natives today are engaging in extensive cultural research to bring back knowledge, narratives, beliefs, and practices of the post-contact days with the Spanish. The Spanish eradicated and stripped the Ohlones of their cultural heritage by causing the death of ninety percent of the population, and forcing cultural assimilation with military fortification and Catholic reform. After the arrival of the Americans, many land grants were contested in court.  Preserving their burial sites is a way to gain acknowledgment as a cultural group.<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolin|first=Malcolm|title=The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area.|url=https://archive.org/details/ohlonewayindianl00marg_0|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Heyday|location=Berkeley}}</ref>\n\n'''Site CA-SCL-732- Kaphan Umux or Three Wolves Site'''\n\nThe Muwekma Ohlone tribe are active participants in the revival of Ohlone people across the East and South Bay.

Only some sacred cultural narratives survive through the recording of stories told from various Ohlone elders living in the missions between 1769\u20131833. This makes analyzing pre-contact Ohlone sites so difficult because so much of the symbolism and ritual are unknown. Therefore, the Muwekma see their participation in archeological projects as a way to bring tribal members together as a unified community, and as a way to reestablish the link between the Ohlone people today and their pre-contact ancestors through their ability to analyze remains and be coauthors in the archeological reports.<ref name=\"Field 2003\">{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|date=2003|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> One major archeological site the Muwekma tribe actively helped excavate, is the burial site CA-SCL-732 in San Jose, dating between 1500-2700 BCE. In this burial site, excavated in 1992, the remains of three ritually buried wolves were found among human remains.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> In other grave site, the skeletal remains of two more wolves were found with \"braided, uncured yucca or soap root fiber cordage around their necks\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> There were many other fragments of remains of animals like deer, squirrel, mountain lion, grizzly bear, fox, badger, blue goose, and elk found as well. From the excavations it is clear that the animals were ritually buried, along with beads and other ornamentations.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\nAlthough the truth may not be known about exactly what these findings mean, the Muwekma and the archeological team analyzed the ritual burial of the animal remains as a way to learn what they may tell about the Ohlone cosmology and cultural system before pre-contact influence. One way the team did this was utilizing known narratives of the Ohlone, as ascribed by previous ethnographers who recorded the sacred narratives of various Ohlone elders in the missions across the Bay, well as the narratives telling of other central California cosmologies to make references about what the meaning of the possible kinship between the animals and the Ohlone in these burials were. Together the archeological team made three hypotheses: animals served as \"moieties, clans, lineages, families, and so on,\" animals were \"dream helpers,\" or personal spirit allies for individuals, and lastly, the animals were representations of \"sacred deity-like figures\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\n===Indian People Organizing for Change===\nIndian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) is a community-based organization in the San Francisco Bay Area. Its members, including Ohlone tribal members and conservation activists, work together in order to accomplish social and environmental justice within the Bay Area American Indian community. Current projects include the preservation of Bay Area shellmounds, which are the sacred burial sites of the Ohlone Nation, whose homeland is the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, IPOC has spread awareness throughout the community through shellmounds walks and has advocated for the preservation of sacred burial sites in the Emeryville Mall, Glen Cove Site, Hunters Point in San Francisco, just to name a few.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gould|first=Corrina|title=\"Indian People Organizing for Change.\" Indian People Organizing for Change.|url=http://ipocshellmoundwalk.homestead.com/}}</ref>\n\n==== Sogorea Te Land Trust ====\n{{Main|Sogorea Te Land Trust}}\nThe Sogorea Te Land Trust is a [[land trust]] founded by members of IPOC in 2012 with the goals of returning traditionally [[Chochenyo]] and [[Karkin]] lands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] stewardship and cultivating more active, reciprocal relationships with the land.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Indigenous-women-lead-effort-to-reclaim-ancestral-12384730.php|title=Indigenous women lead effort to reclaim ancestral lands|last=Kost|first=Ryan|date=28 November 2017|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref> It has also started a project called the Shuumi Land Tax, which asks that non-indigenous people living on Ohlone land to pay dues for the land that they live on.<ref name=\":0\" /> The tax has no legal ramifications and no connection with the United States government or [[Internal Revenue Service]], but the organization prefers this term (as opposed to merely calling contributions [[Donation|donations]]) as it asserts indigenous [[sovereignty]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kalw.org/post/native-americans-ask-east-bay-residents-pay-tax-land#stream/0|title=Native Americans ask East Bay residents to pay 'tax' on land|last=Dalmas|first=Jeremy|date=16 April 2018|website=KALW Local Public Radio 91.7 San Francisco|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nCostanoan is an externally applied name ([[exonym]]). The Spanish explorers and settlers referred to the native groups of this region collectively as the ''Coste\u00f1os'' (the \"coastal people\") circa 1769. Over time, the English-speaking settlers arriving later [[Anglicized]] the word ''Coste\u00f1os'' into the name of ''Costanoans.'' (The suffix \"-an\" is English). For many years, the people were called the Costanoans in English language and records.<ref name=\"Teix-pg4\">Teixeira, 1997:4, \"The Term 'Costanoan/Ohlone'\".</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, the name of Ohlone has been used by some of the members and the popular media to replace the name ''Costanoan.'' ''Ohlone'' might have originally derived from a Spanish rancho called ''Oljon'', and referred to a single band who inhabited the Pacific Coast near [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]] Creek. The name ''Ohlone'' was traced by Teixeira through the mission records of Mission San Francisco, Bancroft's ''Native Races'', and Frederick Beechey's Journal regarding a visit to the Bay Area in 1826\u201327. ''Oljone'', ''Olchones'' and ''Alchones'' are spelling variations of ''Ohlone'' found in Mission San Francisco records. However, because of its tribal origin, Ohlone is not universally accepted by the native people, and some members prefer to either to continue to use the name Costanoan or to revitalize and be known as the ''Muwekma''. Teixeira maintains Ohlone is the common usage since 1960, which has been traced back to the Rancho Oljon on the Pescadero Creek. Teixeira states in part: \"A tribe that once existed along the San Mateo County coast.\" Milliken states the name came from: \"A tribe on the lower drainages of San Gregorio Creek and Pescadero Creek on the Pacific Coast\".<!--CITATIONS:--><ref>Opinions and quotations, Teixeira 1997:4; Milliken, 1995:249.</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\n{{See also|List of Ohlone villages}}\nLinguists identified eight regional, linguistic divisions or subgroups of the Ohlone, listed below from north to south:<ref>Levy, 1978:485\u2013486; Teixeira, 1997:37\u201338, \"Linguistics\"; and Milliken, 1995:24\u201326, \"Linguistic Landscape\".

Note the number of 26,000 includes Salinans</ref> Historians differ widely in their estimates, as they do with the entire [[population of Native California]]. However, modern researchers{{who|date=April 2014}} believe that American anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]]'s projection of 7,000&nbsp;Ohlone \"Costanoans\" was much too low. Later researchers such as [[Richard L. Levy|Richard Levy]] estimated \"10,000 or more\" Ohlone.<ref name=\"Levy, 1978:486\"/>\n\nThe highest estimate comes from [[Sherburne F. Cook]], who in later life concluded there were 26,000 Ohlone and Salinans in the \"Northern Mission Area\". Per Cook, the \"Northern Mission Area\" means \"the region inhabited by the Costanoans and Salinans between San Francisco Bay and the headwaters of the Salinas River. To this may be added for convenience the local area under the jurisdiction of the San Luis Obispo even though there is an infringement of the Chumash.\" In this model, the Ohlone people's territory was one half of the \"Northern Mission Area\". It was however known to be more densely populated than the southern Salinan territory, per Cook: \"The Costanoan density was nearly 1.8 persons per square mile with the maximum in the Bay region. The Esselen was approximately 1.3, the Salinan must have been still lower.\" We can estimate that Cook meant about 18,200 Ohlone based on his own statements (70% of \"Northern Mission Area\"), plus or minus a few thousand margin for error, but he does not give an exact number.<ref>For definition of 'Northern Mission area\", Cook, 1976b:20. For density of populations, Cook, 1976a:187.</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone population after contact in 1769 with the Spaniards spiralled downwards. Cook describes rapidly declining indigenous populations in California between 1769 and 1900, in his posthumously published book, ''The Population of the California Indians, 1769\u20131970.'' Cook states in part: \"Not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"  The population had dropped to about 10% of its original numbers by 1848.<ref>For quotation, see Cook, 1976b:200. For population in 1848, see Cook, 1976a:105.</ref>\n\nThe population stabilized after 1900, and as of 2005 there were at least 1,400 on tribal membership rolls.<ref>For tribal membership rolls, Muwekma Ohlone Tribe homepage, 397 members; Amah-Mutsun Band homepage, over 500 members; and Ohlone/Costanoan\u2014Esselen Nation homepage, approximately 500 members.</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{details|Ohlone languages}}\nThe Ohlone language family is commonly called \"Costanoan\", sometimes \"Ohlone\". Ohlone is classified with Miwok under the label [[Utian languages|Utian]]. The controversial [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] language phylum groups the Utian languages with other languages spoken in California, Oregon, and Washington. The most recent work suggests that Ohlone, Miwok, and Yokuts may all be sub-families within a single [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]] language family.<ref>Utian and Penutian classification: Levy, 1978:485\u2013486 (citing Kroeber), Callaghan 1997, Golla 2007.

Kroeber]] who researched the California natives and authored a few publications on the Ohlone from 1904 to 1910, and [[Clinton Hart Merriam|C. Hart Merriam]] who researched the Ohlone in detail from 1902 to 1929. This was followed by [[John Peabody Harrington|John P. Harrington]] who researched the Ohlone languages from 1921 to 1939, and other aspects of Ohlone culture, leaving volumes of field notes at his death. Other research was added by Robert Cartier, Madison S. Beeler, and [[Sherburne F. Cook]], to name a few. In many cases, the Ohlone names they used vary in spelling, translation and tribal boundaries, depending on the source. Each tried to [[chronicle]] and interpret this complex society and language(s) before the pieces vanished.<ref>Historians and research years, Teixeira, 1997, biographical articles; notably page 34: \"John Peabody Harrington\". Variances in data and interpretation can be noted in main published references Kroeber, Merriam, Harrington, Cook.</ref>\n\nThere was noticeable competition and some disagreement between the first scholars: Both Merriam and Harrington produced much in-depth Ohlone research in the shadow of the highly published Kroeber and competed in print with him. In the ''Editor's Introduction'' to ''Merriam (1979)'', Robert F. Heizer (as the protege of Kroeber and also the curator of Merriam's work) states \"both men disliked A. L. Kroeber.\"  Harrington, independently working for the Smithsonian Institution cornered most of the Ohlone research as his own specialty, was \"not willing to share his findings with Kroeber&nbsp;... Kroeber and his students neglected the Chumash and Costanoans, but this was done because Harrington made it quite clear that he would resent Kroeber's 'muscling in.{{'\"}}<ref>Quotation \"both men disliked Kroeber\" said by Heizer, in \"Editor's Intro\" of Merriam (1979).
