Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Fair Deal]], [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[New Frontier]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]].\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, both major American parties had a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and a [[Social liberalism|liberal]] wing. The conservative Northern Republicans and [[Southern Democrats]] formed the [[conservative coalition]] which dominated the [[United States Congress|Congress]] in the pre-[[Civil Rights era]]. As the Democrats under President Johnson began to support civil rights, the formerly [[Solid South]], meaning solidly Democratic, became solidly Republican, except in districts with a large number of African-American voters. Since the 1960s, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] has been considered liberal and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] has been considered conservative. As a group, liberals are referred to as the left and conservatives as the right. Starting in the 21st century, there has also been a sharp division between liberals who tend to live in denser, more heterogeneous communities and conservatives who tend to live in less dense, more homogeneous communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/03/red-state-blue-city/513857/|title=Red State, Blue City|first=David A.|last=Graham|date=February 2, 2017|website=Theatlantic.com|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/05/22/what-unites-and-divides-urban-suburban-and-rural-communities/|title=Similarities and differences between urban, suburban and rural communities in America|date=May 22, 2018|website=Pewsocialtrends.org|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe American modern liberal philosophy strongly endorses public spending on programs such as [[Education in the United States|education]], [[health care]] and [[Social programs in the United States|welfare]].

One of the greatest contrasts is between the usage in the United States and usage in Europe. According to [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] (writing in 1956), \"[l]iberalism in the American usage has little in common with the word as used in the politics of any European country, save possibly Britain\".<ref name=\"Schlesinger\">[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html \"Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans\"] by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] (1956) from: ''The Politics of Hope'' (Boston: Riverside Press, 1962).</ref> In Europe, liberalism usually means what is sometimes called [[classical liberalism]], a commitment to [[limited government]], ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics and [[Unalienable rights|unalienable individual rights]]. This classical liberalism sometimes more closely corresponds to the American definition of [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarianism]], although some may distinguish between classical liberalism and libertarianism.<ref>Tomasi, John ''Free Market Fairness'', PUP, 2012</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the general term \"liberalism\" almost always refer to modern liberalism, a more social variant of classical liberalism. In Europe, this [[social liberalism]] is closer to European [[social democracy]], although the original form is advocated by some liberal parties in Europe as well as with the [[Beveridge Group]] faction within the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], the [[Liberals (Sweden)|Liberals]], the [[Danish Social Liberal Party]], the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]], or the [[Italian Republican Party]].\n\n=== Demographics of American liberals ===\nA 2005 [[Pew Research Center]] study found that liberals were the most educated ideological demographic and were tied with the conservative sub-group of the enterprisers for the most affluent group. Of those who identified as liberal, 49% were college graduates and 41% had household incomes exceeding $75,000, compared to 27% and 28% as the national average, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2005/05/10/beyond-red-vs-blue/|title=Pew Research Center.

He holds that liberalism in the United States is aimed toward achieving [[equality of opportunity]] for all, but it is the means of achieving this that changes depending on the circumstances. He says that the \"process of redefining liberalism in terms of the social needs of the 20th century was conducted by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his [[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] and his [[The New Freedom|New Freedom]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and his [[New Deal]]. Out of these three reform periods there emerged the conception of a social [[welfare state]], in which the national government had the express obligation to maintain high levels of employment in the economy, to supervise standards of life and labor, to regulate the methods of business competition, and to establish comprehensive patterns of social security\".<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/>\n\nSome make the distinction between [[Liberalism in the United States|American classical liberalism]] and the new liberalism, better known as [[social liberalism]].<ref>Novak, William J.

(1951) 37#4 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1889359 in JSTOR]</ref> They transformed Victorian liberalism, retaining its commitment to civil liberties and individual rights while casting off its advocacy of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics. Ward helped define what would become the modern welfare state after 1933.<ref>Henry Steele, Commager, ed. ''Lester Ward and the Welfare State'' (1967)</ref> These often supported the growing working-class labor unions and sometimes even the socialists to their left. The [[Social Gospel]] movement was a Protestant intellectual movement that helped shape liberalism especially from the 1890s to the 1920s. It applied Christian ethics to social problems, especially issues of social justice such as economic inequality, poverty, alcoholism, crime, racial tensions, slums, unclean environment, child labor, inadequate labor unions, poor schools and the danger of war.<ref>Ronald C. White, Jr. and C. Howard Hopkins, ''The Social Gospel. Religion and Reform in Changing America'' (1975).</ref> [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s parents were active in the Social Gospel and had a lifetime commitment to it, for he sought to transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice as exemplified by the [[Great Society]] and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach to a sort of Christian internationalism and nation building.<ref>Randall B. Woods, ''LBJ:  Architect of American Ambition''  (2006) pp 27, 465-66, 486</ref> In philosophy and education, [[John Dewey]] was highly influential.<ref>Robert B. Westbrook, ''John Dewey and American Democracy'' (1991)</ref>\n\nIn 1900\u20131920, liberals called themselves progressives. They rallied behind Republicans led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Robert M. La Follette]] as well as Democrats led by [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] to fight corruption, waste and big [[Trust (business)|trusts]] (monopolies). They stressed ideals of social justice and the use of government to solve social and economic problems. Settlement workers such as [[Jane Addams]] were leaders of the liberal tradition.<ref>Joyce E. Williams and Vicky M. MacLean. \"In search of the kingdom: The social gospel, settlement sociology, and the science of reform in America's progressive era.\" ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'' (2012) 48#4 pp: 339\u2013362.</ref> There was a tension between sympathy with labor unions and the goal to apply scientific expertise by disinterested experts.

Croly presented the case for a planned economy, increased spending on education and the creation of a society based on the \"brotherhood of mankind\". His highly influential 1909 book ''[[The Promise of American Life]]'' proposed to raise the general standard of living by means of economic planning. Croly opposed aggressive unionization. In ''[[The Techniques of Democracy]]'' (1915), he also argued against both dogmatic individualism and dogmatic socialism.<ref>Wilfred McClay, ''Croly's progressive America'' (1998)</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Vernon Louis Parrington]] in 1928 won the Pulitzer Prize for ''Main Currents in American Thought''. It was a highly influential intellectual history of America from the colonial era to the early 20th century.

Other liberal Republicans included Senator [[Robert M. La Follette]] and his sons in Wisconsin (from about 1900 to 1946) and Western leaders such as Senator [[Hiram Johnson]] in California, Senator [[George W. Norris]] in Nebraska, Senator [[Bronson M. Cutting]] in New Mexico, Congresswoman [[Jeannette Rankin]] in Montana and Senator [[William Borah]] in Idaho from about 1900 to about 1940. They were generally liberal in domestic policy as they supported unions<ref>Ruth O'Brien, ''Workers' Paradox: The Republican Origins of New Deal Labor Policy, 1886\u20131935'' (1998) p 15</ref> and much of the [[New Deal]]. However, they were intensely isolationist in foreign policy.<ref>Robert Johnson, ''The peace progressives and American foreign relations'' (1995)</ref> This element died out by the 1940s. Starting in the 1930s, a number of mostly Northeastern Republicans took modern liberal positions regarding labor unions, spending and New Deal policies.

They promoted economic growth and high state and federal spending while accepting high taxes and much liberal legislation, with the provision they could administer it more efficiently. They opposed the Democratic big city machines while welcoming support from labor unions and big business alike. Religion was not high on their agenda, but they were strong believers in civil rights for African-Americans and women's rights and most liberals were [[pro-choice]].

Roosevelt]] came to office in 1933 amid the economic calamity of the [[Great Depression]], offering the nation a [[New Deal]] intended to alleviate economic desperation and joblessness, provide greater opportunities and restore prosperity. His presidency was the longest in American history, lasting from 1933 to 1945 and marked by an increased role for the federal government in addressing the nation's economic and social problems. Work relief programs provided jobs, ambitious projects such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] were created to promote economic development and a [[social security]] system was established. The Roosevelt administration was assisted in its endeavors by progressives in Congress, with the congressional midterm elections of 1934 returning a more radical House of Representatives that was prepared to support progressive, new liberal measures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4eg7dHZlFcC&pg=PT125&dq=peter+clements+1934+more+radical+house+of+representatives&hl=en&sa=X&ei=B4I9UrnyC_Ob0AW5r4GwCQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=peter%20clements%201934%20more%20radical%20house%20of%20representatives&f=false|title=Access to History for the IB Diploma: The Great Depression and the Americas ... - Peter Clements - Google Books|work=google.com}}</ref> As noted by J.

Full employment was reached with the total mobilization of the United States economic, social and military resources in World War II. At that point, the main relief programs such as the WPA and the CCC were ended. Arthur Herman argues that Roosevelt restored prosperity after 1940 by cooperating closely with big business,<ref>Arthur Herman, ''Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II'' (2012)</ref> although when asked \"Do you think the attitude of the Roosevelt administration toward business is delaying business recovery?\", the American people in 1939 responded \"yes\" by a margin of more than 2-to-1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_01_4_higgs.pdf|format=PDF|title=Regime Uncertainty : Why the Great Depression Lasted So Long and Why Prosperity Resumed after the War|author=Robert Higgs|website=Independent.org|accessdate=4 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe New Deal programs to relieve the Great Depression are generally regarded as a mixed success in ending unemployment. At the time, many New Deal programs, especially the CCC, were popular. Liberals hailed them for improving the life of the common citizen and for providing jobs for the unemployed, legal protection for labor unionists, modern utilities for rural America, living wages for the working poor and price stability for the family farmer. Economic progress for minorities, however, was hindered by discrimination, an issue often avoided by Roosevelt's administration.<ref>Harvard Sitkoff, ed. ''Fifty Years Later: The New Deal Evaluated'' (1985), a favorable liberal interpretation</ref>\n\n==== Relief, recovery and reform ====\nThe New Deal consisted of three types of programs designed to produce relief, recovery and reform:<ref>William E. Leuchtenburg, '' Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal: 1932-1940'' (1963)</ref>\n* Relief was the immediate effort to help the one-third of the population that was hardest hit by the depression. Roosevelt expanded [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA) work relief program and added the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), the [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA) and starting in 1935 the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). Also in 1935, the [[Social Security Act]] (SSA) and [[unemployment benefit#United States|unemployment insurance]] programs were added. Separate programs such as the [[Resettlement Administration]] and the [[Farm Security Administration]] were set up for relief in rural America.\n* Recovery was the goal of restoring the economy to pre-Depression levels. It involved greater spending of government funds in an effort to stimulate the economy, including deficit spending, dropping the [[gold standard]] and efforts to increase farm prices and foreign trade by lowering tariffs. Many programs were funded through a Hoover program of loans and loan guarantees, overseen by the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC).\n* Reform was based on the assumption that the depression was caused by the inherent instability of the market and that government intervention was necessary to rationalize and stabilize the economy and to balance the interests of farmers, business and labor. Reform measures included the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA), regulation of [[Wall Street]] by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934|Securities Exchange Act]] (SEA), the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] (AAA) for farm programs, the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) insurance for bank deposits enacted through the [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] of 1933 and the 1935 [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA), also known as the Wagner Act, dealing with labor-management relations. Despite urgings by some New Dealers, there was no major antitrust program. Roosevelt opposed socialism in the sense of state ownership of the means of production and only one major program, namely the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA), involved government ownership of the means of production (that is power plants and electrical grids). The conservatives feared the New Deal meant socialism and Roosevelt noted privately in 1934 that the \"old line press harps increasingly on state socialism and demands the return to the good old days\".<ref>Gary Dean Best, ''Pride, Prejudice, and Politics: Roosevelt Versus Recovery, 1933-1938'' (1991), 179; quote on p. 61</ref>\n\n==== Race ====\nThe New Deal was racially segregated as blacks and whites rarely worked alongside each other in New Deal programs.

The critics emphasize the absence of a philosophy of reform to explain the failure of New Dealers to attack fundamental social problems. They demonstrate the New Deal's commitment to save capitalism and its refusal to strip away private property. They detect a remoteness from the people and indifference to participatory democracy and call instead for more emphasis on conflict and exploitation.<ref>Jerold S.

Roosevelt ===\nIn international affairs, Roosevelt's presidency until 1938 reflected the isolationism that dominated practically all of American politics at the time. After 1938, he moved toward interventionism as the world hurtled toward war.<ref>Alonzo Hamby, ''For the Survival of Democracy: Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s'' (2004)</ref> Liberals split on foreign policy as many followed Roosevelt while others such as [[John L. Lewis]] of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]], historian [[Charles A. Beard]] and the [[Kennedy Family]] opposed him. However, Roosevelt added new conservative supporters such as Republicans [[Henry Stimson]] (who became his Secretary of War in 1940) and [[Wendell Willkie]] (who worked closely with Roosevelt after losing to him in the 1940s election). Anticipating the post-war period, Roosevelt strongly supported proposals to create a [[United Nations]] organization as a means of encouraging mutual cooperation to solve problems on the international stage. His commitment to internationalist ideals was in the tradition of [[Woodrow Wilson]], except that Roosevelt learned from Wilson's mistakes regarding the [[League of Nations]]. For instance, Roosevelt included Republicans in shaping foreign policy and insisted the United States have a veto at the United Nations.<ref>Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, ''FDR and the creation of the UN'' (1997)</ref>\n\n=== Liberalism during the Cold War ===\nAmerican liberalism of the [[Cold War]] era was the immediate heir to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and the somewhat more distant heir to the [[Progressive Era|progressives]] of the early 20th century. Rossinow (2008) argues that after 1945 the left-liberal alliance that operated during the New Deal years split apart for good over the issue of Communism. Anti-Communist liberals led by [[Walter Reuther]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]] expelled the far-left from labor unions and the [[New Deal coalition]] and committed the Democratic Party to a strong Cold War policy typified by [[NATO]] and the containment of Communism. Liberals became committed to a quantitative goal of economic growth that accepted large near-monopolies such as [[General Motors]] and [[American Telephone & Telegraph|AT&T]] while rejecting the structural transformation dreamed of by earlier left-liberals. The far-left had its last hurrah in [[Henry A. Wallace]]'s 1948 third-party presidential campaign. Wallace supported further New Deal reforms and opposed the Cold War, but his campaign was taken over by the far-left and Wallace retired from politics in disgust.<ref name=\"Rossinow 2008; Hamby 1992\">Rossinow (2008); Hamby (1992)</ref>\n\nMost prominent and constant among the positions of Cold War liberalism were the following:<ref name=\"Rossinow 2008; Hamby 1992\"/>\n* Support for a domestic economy built on a balance of power between labor (in the form of organized [[trade union|unions]]) and management (with a tendency to be more interested in large corporations than in [[small business]]).\n* A foreign policy focused on containing the Soviet Union and its allies.\n* The continuation and expansion of New Deal social welfare programs (in the broad sense of welfare, including programs such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]).\n* An embrace of [[Keynesianism|Keynesian economics]]. By way of compromise with political groupings to their right, this often became in practice [[military Keynesianism]].<ref>Herbert Stein, ''Presidential Economics: The Making of Economic Policy From Roosevelt to Clinton'' (3rd ed. 1994)</ref>\n\nIn some ways, this resembled what in other countries was referred to as [[social democracy]]. However, American liberals never widely endorsed [[nationalization]] of industry like European social democrats, instead favoring regulation for public benefit.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, both major American political parties included liberal and conservative factions. The [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] included the Northern and Western liberals on one hand and the generally conservative Southern whites on the other. Difficult to classify were the Northern big city Democratic [[political machine]]s. The urban machines had supported New Deal economic policies, but they faded with the coming of prosperity and the assimilation of ethnic groups. Nearly all collapsed by the 1960s in the face of racial violence in the cities<ref>Jules Witcover, ''Party of the People: A History of the Democrats'' (2003)</ref> The [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] included the moderate-to-liberal [[Wall Street]] and the moderate-to-conservative [[Main street|Main Street]]. The more liberal wing, strongest in the Northeast, was far more supportive of New Deal programs, labor unions and an internationalist foreign policy.<ref>Richard Norton Smith, ''Thomas E. Dewey and His Times'' (1984)</ref> Support for anti-Communism sometimes came at the expense of [[civil liberties]]. For example, ADA co-founder and archetypal Cold War liberal [[Hubert Humphrey]] unsuccessfully sponsored in 1950 a Senate bill to establish detention centers where those declared subversive by the President could be held without trial.<ref>Carl Solberg, ''Hubert Humphrey: A Biography'' (2003)</ref> Nonetheless, liberals opposed [[McCarthyism]] and were central to McCarthy's downfall.<ref>Richard M. Fried, ''Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective'' (1991)</ref>\n\nIn domestic policy during the [[Fifth Party System]] (1932\u20131966), liberals seldom had full control of government, but conservatives never had full control in that period either. According to Jonathan Bernstein, neither liberals nor Democrats controlled the House of Representatives very often from 1939 through 1957, although a 1958 landslide gave liberals real majorities in both houses of Congress for the first time in twenty years. However, Rules Committee reforms and others were carried out following this landslide as liberals saw that House procedures \"still prevented them from using that majority\". The conservative coalition was also important (if not dominant) from 1967 through 1974, although Congress had a liberal Democratic majority from 1985 to 1994. As also noted by Bernstein, \"there have only been a handful of years (Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term, 1961-1966, Jimmy Carter's presidency, and the first two years of Clinton's and Barack Obama's presidencies) when there were clear, working liberal majorities in the House, the Senate and the White House\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-15/democratic-party-wasn-t-always-liberal|title=Democratic Party Wasn't Always Liberal|author=Jonathan Bernstein|date=September 15, 2014|work=BloombergView.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Harry S. Truman's Fair Deal ===\nUntil he became president, liberals generally did not see [[Harry S. Truman]] as one of their own, viewing him as a Democratic Party hack. However, liberal politicians and liberal organizations such as the unions and [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) supported Truman's liberal [[Fair Deal]] proposals to continue and expand the New Deal. [[Alonzo Hamby]] argues that the Fair Deal reflected the vital center approach to liberalism which rejected totalitarianism, was suspicious of excessive concentrations of government power and honored the New Deal as an effort to achieve a progressive capitalist system. Solidly based upon the New Deal tradition in its advocacy of wide-ranging social legislation, the Fair Deal differed enough to claim a separate identity. The depression did not return after the war and the Fair Deal faced prosperity and an optimistic future. The Fair Dealers thought in terms of abundance rather than depression scarcity. Economist [[Leon Keyserling]] argued that the liberal task was to spread the benefits of abundance throughout society by stimulating economic growth. Agriculture Secretary [[Charles F. Brannan]] wanted to unleash the benefits of agricultural abundance and to encourage the development of an urban-rural Democratic coalition. However, the \"Brannan Plan\" was defeated his unrealistic confidence in the possibility uniting urban labor and farm owners who distrusted rural insurgency. The [[conservative coalition]] of Northern Republicans and Southern Democrats in Congress effectively blocked the Fair Deal and nearly all liberal legislation from the late 1930s to 1960.<ref>Ira Katznelson, Kim Geiger and Daniel Kryder. \"Limiting Liberalism: The Southern Veto in Congress, 1933-1950,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'' Vol. 108, No. 2 (Summer, 1993), pp. 283-306 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2152013 in JSTOR]</ref> The [[Korean War]] made military spending the nation's priority.<ref>Alonzo L.

[T]here are no conservative or reactionary ideas in circulation\".<ref>Douglas T. Miller and Marion Nowak, ''The fifties: the way we really were'' (1977) p 238</ref>\n\nMost historians see liberalism in the doldrums in the 1950s, with the old spark of New Deal dreams overshadowed by the glitzy complacency and conservatism of the Eisenhower years. [[Adlai Stevenson II]] lost in two landslides and presented few new liberal proposals apart from a suggestion for a worldwide ban on nuclear tests. As Barry Karl noted, Stevenson \"has suffered more at hands of the admirers he failed than he ever did from the enemies who defeated him\".<ref>Barry D.

Internationally it was strongly anti-Communist. It aimed to defend the free world, to encourage economic growth at home, and to ensure that the resulting plenty was fairly distributed.

Beginning with ''[[To Secure These Rights]]'', an official report issued by the Truman White House in 1947, self-proclaimed liberals increasingly embraced the civil rights movement. In 1948, President Truman desegregated the armed forces and the Democrats inserted a strong civil rights plank or provision in the Democratic Party platform. Black activists, most prominently [[Martin Luther King]], escalated the bearer agitation throughout the South, especially in Birmingham, Alabama, where brutal police tactics outraged national television audiences. The civil rights movement climaxed in the [[March on Washington]] in August 1963, where King gave his dramatic \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech. The activism put civil rights at the very top of the liberal political agenda and facilitated passage of the decisive [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] which permanently ended segregation in the United States and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] which guaranteed blacks the right to vote, with strong enforcement provisions throughout the South handled by the federal Department of Justice.<ref>James T.

Although President Kennedy sent federal troops to compel the [[University of Mississippi]] to admit African-American [[James Meredith]] in 1962 and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. toned down the 1963 March on Washington at Kennedy's behest, the failure to seat the [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] at the 1964 [[Democratic National Convention]] indicated a growing rift. President Johnson could not understand why the rather impressive civil rights laws passed under his leadership had failed to immunize Northern and Western cities from rioting. At the same time, the civil rights movement itself was becoming fractured. By 1966, a [[Black Power]] movement had emerged. Black Power advocates accused white liberals of trying to control the civil rights agenda. Proponents of Black Power wanted African-Americans to follow an ethnic model for obtaining power,{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} not unlike that of Democratic political machines in large cities. This put them on a collision course with urban machine politicians. On its most extreme edges, the Black Power movement contained racial separatists who wanted to give up on integration altogether\u2014a program that could not be endorsed by American liberals of any race. The mere existence of such individuals (who always got more media attention than their actual numbers might have warranted) contributed to white backlash against liberals and civil rights activists.<ref name=\"Harvard Sitkoff 2008\"/>\n\nLiberals were latecomers to the movement for equal rights for women.

Bush]] and attacked liberalism vocally in both the popular media and scholarly publications.<ref>John Ehrman, ''The Rise of Neoconservatism: Intellectual and Foreign Affairs 1945\u20131994'' (2005)</ref>\n\n=== Under attack from the New Left ===\n{{see also|New Left}}\nLiberalism came under attack from both the New Left in the early 1960s and the right in the late 1960s. Kazin (1998) says: \"The liberals who anxiously turned back the assault of the postwar Right were confronted in the 1960s by a very different adversary: a radical movement led, in the main, by their own children, the white \"New Left\".<ref>Michael Kazin, ''The populist persuasion: an American history'' (1998) p 196</ref> This new element, says Kazin, worked to \"topple the corrupted liberal order\".<ref>Kazin, ''Populist persuasion'' p 197</ref> As Maurice Isserman notes, the New Left \"came to use the word 'liberal' as a political epithet\".<ref>Maurice Isserman, ''The other American: the life of Michael Harrington'' (2001) p. 276</ref> Slack (2013) argues that the New Left was more broadly speaking the political component of a break with liberalism that took place across several academic fields, namely philosophy, psychology and sociology. In philosophy, [[existentialism]] and [[neo-Marxism]] rejected the instrumentalism of [[John Dewey]]; in psychology, [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Norman O. Brown]] rejected [[Sigmund Freud]]'s teaching of repression and sublimation; and in sociology, [[C. Wright Mills]] rejected the pragmatism of Dewey for the teachings of [[Max Weber]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/liberalism-radicalized-the-sexual-revolution-multiculturalism-and-the-rise-of-identity-politics|title=Liberalism Radicalized: The Sexual Revolution, Multiculturalism, and the Rise of Identity Politics|first=Kevin|last=Slack|website=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.anamnesisjournal.com/issues/2-web-essays/88-the-false-genealogies-of-neo-progressivismk]{{dead link|date=April 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe attack was not confined to the United States as the New Left was a worldwide movement with strength in parts of Western Europe as well as Japan. For example, massive demonstrations in France denounced [[American imperialism]] and its helpers in Western European governments.<ref>George N. Katsiaficas, ''The Imagination of the New Left: A Global Analysis of 1968'' (1987) p 51</ref><ref>Jeremi Suri, ''Power and Protest: Global Revolution and the Rise of Detente'' (2005) [http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=%22against+the+centralized%22+inauthor:suri&num=10 p 129 online]</ref>\n\nThe main activity of the New Left became [[opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War]] as conducted by liberal President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. The anti-war movement escalated the rhetorical heat as violence broke out on both sides. The climax came in sustained protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Liberals fought back, with [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], chief foreign policy advisor of the 1968 Humphrey campaign, saying the New Left \"threatened American liberalism\" in a manner reminiscent of McCarthyism.<ref>Jeff Taylor, ''Where did the party go?: William Jennings Bryan, Hubert Humphrey, and the Jeffersonian legacy'' (2006) p. 125</ref> While the New Left considered Humphrey a war criminal, Nixon attacked him as the New Left's enabler\u2014a man with \"a personal attitude of indulgence and permissiveness toward the lawless\".<ref>Peter Beinart, ''The Good Fight: Why Liberals\u2014and Only Liberals\u2014Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again'' p 49</ref> Beinart concludes that \"with the country divided against itself, contempt for Hubert Humphrey was the one thing on which left and right could agree\".<ref>Beinart, ''The Good Fight'' p 49</ref>\n\nAfter 1968, the New Left lost strength and the more serious attacks on liberalism came from the right. Nevertheless, the liberal ideology lost its attractiveness. Liberal commentator [[E. J. Dionne]] contends: \"If liberal ideology began to crumble intellectually in the 1960s it did so in part because the New Left represented a highly articulate and able wrecking crew\".<ref>[[E. J. Dionne]], ''Why Americans Hate Politics'' (1991) p 37</ref>\n\n=== Liberals and the Vietnam War ===\n{{see also|Vietnam War}}\nWhile the civil rights movement isolated liberals from their erstwhile allies, the [[Vietnam War]] threw a wedge into the liberal ranks, dividing pro-war [[War hawk|hawks]] such as Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]] from [[War dove|doves]] such as 1972 presidential candidate Senator [[George McGovern]]. As the war became the leading political issue of the day, agreement on domestic matters was not enough to hold the liberal consensus together.<ref>Melvin Small, ''At the Water's Edge: American Politics and the Vietnam War'' (2006)</ref>\n\nIn the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential campaign]], [[John F. Kennedy]] was liberal in domestic policy, but conservative on foreign policy, calling for a more aggressive stance against Communism than his opponent Richard Nixon.\n\nOpposition to the war first emerged from the New Left and from black leaders such as [[Martin Luther King]]. By 1967, there was growing opposition from within liberal ranks, led in 1968 by Senators [[Eugene McCarthy]] and [[Robert Kennedy]]. After Democratic President Lyndon Johnson announced in March 1968 that he would not run for re-election, Kennedy and McCarthy fought each other for the nomination, with Kennedy besting McCarthy in a series of Democratic primaries. The [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassination of Kennedy]] removed him from the race and Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] emerged from the disastrous [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] with the presidential nomination of a deeply divided party. Meanwhile, Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]] announced his third-party run and pulled in many working-class whites in the rural South and big-city North, most of whom had been staunch Democrats. Liberals led by the labor unions focused their attacks on Wallace while Nixon led a unified Republican Party to victory.\n\n=== Richard Nixon ===\nThe [[1968 United States presidential election|chaos of 1968]], a bitterly divided Democratic Party and bad blood between the New Left and the liberals gave Nixon the presidency. Nixon rhetorically attacked liberals, but in practice enacted many liberal policies and represented the more liberal wing of the Republican Party. Nixon established the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] by executive order, expanded the national endowments for the arts and the humanities, began affirmative action policies, opened diplomatic relations with [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], starting the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] to reduce [[ballistic missile]] availability and turned the war over to South Vietnam. He withdrew all American combat troops by 1972, signed a peace treaty in 1973 and ended the draft.<ref>Joan Hoff, ''Nixon Reconsidered'' (1995)</ref> Regardless of his policies, liberals hated Nixon and rejoiced when the [[Watergate scandal]] forced his resignation in 1974.\n\nWhile the differences between Nixon and the liberals are obvious\u2014the liberal wing of his own party favored politicians such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[William Scranton]] and Nixon overtly placed an emphasis on law and order over civil liberties, with [[Nixon's Enemies List]] being composed largely of liberals\u2014in some ways the continuity of many of Nixon's policies with those of the Kennedy\u2013Johnson years is more remarkable than the differences. Pointing at this continuity, New Left leader [[Noam Chomsky]] (himself on [[Master list of Nixon's political opponents|Nixon's enemies list]]) has called Nixon \"in many respects the last liberal president\".<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200006--.htm The Colombia Plan: April 2000] by Noam Chomsky, ''Z'' Magazine, June 2000.</ref>\n\nThe political dominance of the liberal consensus even into the Nixon years can best be seen in policies such as the successful establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency or his failed proposal to replace the welfare system with a guaranteed annual income by way of a [[negative income tax]]. [[Affirmative action]] in its most quota-oriented form was a Nixon administration policy. The Nixon [[War on Drugs]] allocated two-thirds of its funds for treatment, a far higher ratio than was to be the case under any subsequent President, Republican or Democrat. Additionally, Nixon's normalization of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and his policy of ''d\u00e9tente'' with the Soviet Union were probably more popular with liberals than with his conservative base.\n\nAn opposing view offered by [[Cass R. Sunstein]] in ''The Second Bill of Rights'' (Basic Books, 2004, {{ISBN|0-465-08332-3}}) argues that through his [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] appointments Nixon effectively ended a decades-long expansion of economic rights along the lines of those put forward in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].\n\n=== Labor unions ===\n{{main|Labor unions in the United States}}\nLabor unions were central components of liberalism, operating through the [[New Deal coalition]].<ref>Kevin Boyle, ''The UAW and the Heyday of American Liberalism 1945\u20131968'' (1995)</ref> The unions gave strong support to the Vietnam War, thereby breaking with the blacks and with the intellectual and student wings of liberalism. From time to time, dissident groups such as the Progressive Alliance, the Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition and the National Labor Committee broke from the dominant [[AFL\u2013CIO]] which they saw as too conservative. In 1995, the liberals managed to take control of the AFL\u2013CIO under the leadership of [[John Sweeney (labor leader)|John Sweeney]] of the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU). Union membership in the private sector has fallen from 33% to 7%, with a resulting decline in political weight. In 2005, the SEIU, now led by [[Andy Stern]], broke away from the AFL\u2013CIO to form its own coalition, the [[Change to Win Federation]], to support liberalism, including the [[Barack Obama]]'s agenda, especially health care reform. Stern retired in 2010.<ref>Andrew Battista, ''The Revival of Labor Liberalism'' (2008)</ref> Regardless of the loss of numbers, unions have a long tradition and deep experience in organizing and continue at the state and national level to mobilize forces for a liberal agenda, especially regarding votes for Democrats, taxes, spending, union representation and the threat to American jobs from foreign trade.<ref>Andrew Battista, ''The Revival of Labor Liberalism'' (University of Illinois Press, 2008) p 173</ref> Offsetting the decline in the private sector is a growth of unionization in the public sector. The membership of unions in the public sector such as teachers, police and city workers continues to rise, now covering 42% of local government workers.<ref>Robert L. Mathis, John H. Jackson, ''Human Resource Management'' (2007) p. 526</ref> The financial crisis that hit American states during the recession of 2008\u20132011 focused increasing attention on pension systems for government employees, with conservatives trying to reduce the pensions.<ref>\"Jerry Brown's Pension Punt,\" [https://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748703294904575385020342632394.html ''Wall Street Journal'' (editorial) Aug. 5, 2010)]</ref>\n\n=== Environmentalism ===\n{{main|Environmental movement in the United States}}\nA new unexpected political discourse emerged in the 1970s centered on the environment.<ref>Samuel P. Hays, ''A History of Environmental Politics since 1945'' (2000)</ref> The debates did not fall neatly into a left\u2013right dimension, for everyone proclaimed their support for the environment. Environmentalism appealed to the well-educated middle class, but it aroused fears among lumbermen, farmers, ranchers, blue collar workers, automobile companies and oil companies whose economic interests were threatened by new regulations.<ref>Hays, ''Beauty, Health and Performance'' (1987) pp 287\u2013328</ref> As a result, conservatives tended to oppose environmentalism while liberals endorsed new measures to protect the environment.<ref>Robert Gottlieb, ''Forcing the Spring: The Transformation of the American Environmental Movement'' (2nd ed. 2005)</ref> Liberals supported the [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|Wilderness Society]] and the [[Sierra Club]] and were sometimes successful in blocking efforts by lumber companies and oil drillers to expand operations. Environmental legislation limited the use of [[DDT]], reduced [[acid rain]] and protected numerous animal and plant species. Within the environmental movement, there was a small radical element that favored direct action rather than legislation.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Keith M. |last=Woodhouse |title=The Politics of Ecology: Environmentalism and Liberalism in the 1960s |journal=Journal for the Study of Radicalism |year=2008 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=53\u201384 |doi=10.1353/jsr.0.0008 |doi-access=free }}</ref> By the 21st century, debates over taking major action to reverse [[global warming]] by and dealing with carbon emissions were high on the agenda.

Ernst, eds. ''Encyclopedia of American political parties and elections'' (2006) pp 1667-7</ref>\n\n=== End of the liberal consensus ===\nDuring the Nixon years and through the 1970s, the liberal consensus began to come apart and the 1980 election of [[Ronald Reagan]] as president marked the election of the first non-Keynesian administration and the first application of [[supply-side economics]]. The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African-Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough to make up for the loss of some Southern Democrats. A tide of conservatism rose in response to perceived failures of liberal policies.<ref name=\"Krugman\">Krugman, Paul (2007). ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]''. New York: [[W. W. Norton]].</ref> Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the United States and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it.\n\nIn 1980, the leading liberal was Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], who challenged incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]] for the Democratic Party presidential nomination because Carter's failures had disenchanted liberals. Kennedy was decisively defeated, and in turn Carter was defeated by [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\nHistorians often use 1979\u20131980 to date a philosophical realignment within the American electorate away from Democratic liberalism and toward [[Reagan Era]] conservatism.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Age of Reagan: A History 1974-2008'' (2008) p 125</ref><ref>[[Joseph R. Conlin]], ''The American Past: A Survey of American History'' (2008) ch. 50</ref> However, some liberals hold a minority view that there was no real shift and that Kennedy's defeat was merely by historical accident caused by his poor campaign, international crises and Carter's use of the incumbency.<ref>Stanley, Timothy Randolph, \"'Sailing against the Wind': A Reappraisal of Edward Kennedy's Campaign for the 1980 Democratic Party Presidential Nomination,\" ''Journal of American Studies,'' Aug 2009, Vol. 43 Issue 2, pp 231-253</ref>\n\nAbrams (2006) argues that the eclipse of liberalism was caused by a grass-roots populist revolt, often with a fundamentalist and anti-modern theme, abetted by corporations eager to weaken labor unions and the regulatory regime of the New Deal. The success of liberalism in the first place, he argues, came from efforts of a [[liberal elite]] that had entrenched itself in key social, political and especially judicial positions. These elites, Abrams contends, imposed their brand of liberalism from within some of the least democratic and most insulated institutions, especially the universities, foundations, independent regulatory agencies and the Supreme Court. With only a weak popular base, liberalism was vulnerable to a populist counter-revolution by the nation's democratic or majoritarian forces.<ref>Richard M. Abrams, ''America Transformed: Sixty Years of Revolutionary Change, 1941\u20132001'' (2006), esp. pp ix and 125</ref>\n\n=== Bill Clinton administration and the Third Way ===\nThe term [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] refers to various political positions which try to reconcile [[right-wing]] and [[left-wing politics]] by advocating a varying synthesis of centre-right economic and left-leaning social policies.<ref>Bobbio, Norberto; Cameron, Allan.''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction''.

She was a vocal supporter and leader in the [[women's movement]] and Ford was also noted for bringing breast cancer awareness to national attention following her 1974 [[mastectomy]].

Reagan warned the United States of modern secularists who condoned abortion, excused teenage sexuality, opposed school prayer and attenuated traditional American values. His conviction that there existed a single proper personal behavior, religious worldview, economic system and proper attitude toward nations and peoples not supporting American interests worldwide is credited by [[comparative literature]] scholar Betty Jean Craige with polarizing the United States. Reagan persuaded a large portion of the public to dismiss any sincere analyses of his administration's policies as politically motivated criticisms put forth by what he labeled a [[liberal media]].<ref name=\"Craige 1996\"/>\n\nWhen George H.

Bush recognized that motivating voters to fear Dukakis as a risky, non-mainstream candidate generated political support for his own campaign. Bush's campaign also used issues of prayer to arouse suspicions that Dukakis was less devout in his religious convictions.

Alterman points out that resistance to the label liberal is not surprising due to billions of dollars worth of investment poured into the denigration of the term. A 2004 poll conducted by the National Election Study found that only 35% of respondents questioned identifying as liberal compared to 55% identifying as conservative. A 2004 Pew poll found 19% of respondents identifying as liberal and 39% identifying as conservative, with the balance identifying as moderate. A 2006 poll found that 19% identified as liberal and 36% conservative. In 2005, self-identifying moderates polled by [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Louis Harris & Associates]] were found to share essentially the same political beliefs as self-identifying liberals, but instead rejected the world liberal because of the vilification heaped on the word itself by conservatives. Alterman acknowledges political scientist [[Drew Westen]]'s observation that for most Americans the word liberal now carries meanings such as \"elite\", \"tax and spend\" and \"out of touch\".<ref name=\"Alterman 2008\"/>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n=== Free speech ===\n{{main|Freedom of speech in the United States}}\nAmerican liberals describe themselves as open to change and receptive to new ideas.<ref>\"Fact Finders\" by Jonathan Chait, ''The New Republic'', February 22, 2005</ref> For example, liberals typically accept scientific ideas that some conservatives reject, such as evolution and global warming.<ref>Barack Obama, ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'', Three Rivers Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-307-23770-5}}. \"I believe in evolution, scientific inquiry, and global warming; I believe in free speech, whether politically correct or politically incorrect, and I am suspicious of using government to impose anybody's religious beliefs&nbsp;\u2013 including my own&nbsp;\u2013 on nonbelievers.\"</ref>\n\nLiberals tend to oppose the Supreme Court's ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|Citizens United]]'' ruling in 2010 that a corporation's First Amendment right to free speech encompasses freedom to make unlimited independent expenditures for any political party, politician or [[Lobbying|lobbyist]] as they see fit. President Obama called it \"a major victory for [[big oil]], Wall Street banks, health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans\".<ref>Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html \"Justices, 5-4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit\"], ''New York Times'', January 21, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Opposition to state socialism ===\n{{see also|History of the socialist movement in the United States}}\nIn general, liberalism opposes socialism when it is understood to mean an alternative to [[capitalism]] based on state ownership of the means of production. American liberals usually doubt that bases for political opposition and freedom can survive when power is vested in the state as it was under [[Socialist state|state-socialist regimes]]. In line with the \"general pragmatic, empirical basis\" of liberalism, American liberal philosophy embraces the idea that if substantial abundance and equality of opportunity can be achieved through a system of [[Mixed economy|mixed ownership]], then there is no need for a rigid and oppressive bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/> Since the 1950s, some liberal public intellectuals have moved further toward the allegation that [[free markets]] can provide better solutions than top-down economic planning when appropriately regulated. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued that in hitherto-state-dominated functions such as nation-scale energy distribution and telecommunications marketizations can improve efficiency dramatically.<ref>Paul Krugman, [http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/05/24/260257/index.htm \"The Ascent of E-Man R.I.P.: The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit\"], ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', May 24, 1999.</ref> He also defended a monetary policy\u2014[[inflation targeting]]\u2014saying that it \"most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources\". These distortions are of a kind that war-time and postwar Keynesian economists had accepted as an inevitable byproduct of fiscal policies that selectively reduced certain consumer taxes and directed spending toward government-managed stimulus projects, even where these economists theorized at a contentious distance from some of Keynes's own, more hands-off, positions which tended to emphasize stimulating of business investment.<ref>''The Cambridge Companion to Keynes'', Roger Backhouse, Bradley W.

Historian [[H. W. Brands]] notes that \"the growth of the state is, by perhaps the most common definition, the essence of modern American liberalism\".<ref>H. W. Brands, review, in ''Journal of American History'' March 2008, Vol. 94 Issue 4, p 1227</ref> According to [[Paul Starr]], \"[l]iberal constitutions impose constraints on the power of any single public official or branch of government as well as the state as a whole\".<ref>Paul Starr, ''Freedom's Power: The History and Promise of Liberalism'', Basic Books, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-465-08187-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Morality ===\nAccording to cognitive linguist [[George Lakoff]], liberal philosophy is based on five basic categories of morality. The first, the promotion of fairness, is generally described as an emphasis on empathy as a desirable trait. With this [[social contract]] based on the [[Golden Rule]] comes the rationale for many liberal positions. The second category is assistance to those who cannot assist themselves. A nurturing, philanthropic spirit is one that is considered good in liberal philosophy. This leads to the third category, namely the desire to protect those who cannot defend themselves. The fourth category is the importance of fulfilling one's life, allowing a person to experience all that they can. The fifth and final category is the importance of caring for oneself since only thus can one act to help others.<ref>George Lakeoff, ''Moral Politics,'' 2002</ref>\n\n== Historiography ==\nLiberalism increasingly shaped American intellectual life in the 1930s and 1940s, thanks in large part to two major two-volume studies that were widely read by academics, advanced students, intellectuals and the general public, namely [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary Beard's ''The Rise of American civilization'' (2 vol.; 1927)<ref>See [http://www.unz.org/Pub/BeardCharles-1927 Complete edition online]</ref> and [[Vernon L. Parrington]]'s ''Main Currents in American Thought'' (2 vol.; 1927). The Beards exposed the material forces that shaped American history while Parrington focused on the material forces that shaped American literature. According to the Beards, virtually all political history involved the bitter conflict between the agrarians, farmers and workers led by the Jeffersonians and the capitalists led by the Hamiltonians. The Civil War marked a great triumph of the capitalists and comprised the Second American Revolution. Younger historians welcome the realistic approach that emphasized hardcore economic interest as a powerful force and downplayed the role of ideas.<ref>Clyde W. Barrow, ''More Than a Historian: The Political and Economic Thought of Charles A. Beard'' (2000).</ref> Parrington spoke to the crises at hand. According to historian Ralph Gabriel: <blockquote>''Main Currents'' attempted to trace the history of liberalism  in the American scene for citizens who were caught in a desperate predicament. It was an age in which American liberalism set the United States, through the New Deal, on a Democratic middle-of-the-road course between the contemporary extremisms of Europe, that of Communism on one hand, and of Fascism on the other. [...] The style of ''Main Currents'' was powered by Parrington's dedication to the cause of humane liberalism, by his ultimate humanistic, democratic faith.  He saw the democratic dreams of the romantic first half of the 19th century as the climax of an epic story toward which early Americans moved and from which later Americans fell away.<ref>Ralph H. Gabriel, \"Vernon Lewis Parrington,\"  in Marcus Cunliffe and Robin W. Winks, eds., ''Pastmasters: Some essays on American historians'' (1969), pp 157, 161-62</ref></blockquote>\n\nLiberal readers immediately realized where they stood in the battle between Jeffersonian democracy and Hamiltonian privilege.<ref>John Higham, ''Writing American History'' (1970) p. 134</ref> Neither the Beards nor Parrington paid any attention to slavery, race relations, or minorities. For example, the Beards \"dismissed the agitations of the abolitionists as a small direct consequence because of their lack of appeal to the public\".<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington'' (1968) pp 302, 460.</ref>\n\nPrinceton historian [[Eric F. Goldman]] helped define American liberalism for postwar generations of university students. The first edition of his most influential work appeared in 1952 with the publication of ''Rendezvous with Destiny: A History of Modern American Reform'', covering reform efforts from the Grant years to the 1950s. For decades, it was a staple of the undergraduate curriculum in history, highly regarded for its style and its exposition of modern American liberalism. According to Priscilla Roberts: <blockquote>Lively, well-written, and highly readable, it provided an overview of eight decades of reformers, complete with arresting vignettes of numerous individuals, and stressed the continuities among successful American reform movements. Writing at the height of the Cold War, he also argued that the fundamental liberal tradition of the United States was moderate, centrist, and incrementalist, and decidedly non-socialist and non-totalitarian. While broadly sympathetic to the cause of American reform, Goldman was far from uncritical toward his subjects, faulting progressives of World War I for their lukewarm reception of the League of Nations, American reformers of the 1920s for their emphasis on freedom of lifestyles rather than economic reform, and those of the 1930s for overly tolerant attitude toward Soviet Russia.  His views of past American reformers encapsulated the conventional, liberal, centrist orthodoxy of the early 1950s, from its support for anti-communism and international activism abroad and New Deal-style big government at home, to its condemnation of McCarthyism.<ref>Priscilla M. Roberts, \"Goldman, Eric \" in Kelly Boyd, ed., ''Encyclopedia of historians and historical writing. Vol. 1'' (1999) pp. 474-75.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor the general public, [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] was the most widely read [[historian]], [[social critic]] and [[public intellectual]]. Schlesinger's work explored the history of Jacksonian era and especially 20th-century American liberalism. His major books focused on leaders such as Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. He was a White House aide to Kennedy and his ''[[A Thousand Days|A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House]]'' won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize. In 1968, Schlesinger wrote speeches for Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 and the biography, ''Robert Kennedy and His Times''. He later popularized the term [[imperial presidency]], warning against excessive power in the White House as typified by Richard Nixon. Late in his career, he came to oppose multiculturalism.<ref>John Patrick Diggins, ed., ''The Liberal Persuasion: Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and the Challenge of the American Past'' (1997) [https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Persuasion-Schlesinger-Challenge-American/dp/B008SM2AIW excerpt]</ref>\n\n== Proponents ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n; Politicians\n* [[William Jennings Bryan]] (1860\u20131925), Democrat from Nebraska and 1896, 1900 and 1908 Democratic presidential nominee\n* President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1858\u20131919), Republican president from 1901 to 1909 and 1912 Progressive Party presidential nominee\n* President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1856\u20131924), Democratic president from 1913 to 1921\n* Governor and Senator [[Robert M.

One of the greatest contrasts is between the usage in the United States and usage in Europe. According to [[Arthur M.

This classical liberalism sometimes more closely corresponds to the American definition of [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarianism]], although some may distinguish between classical liberalism and libertarianism.<ref>Tomasi, John ''Free Market Fairness'', PUP, 2012</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the general term \"liberalism\" almost always refer to modern liberalism, a more social variant of classical liberalism.

He holds that liberalism in the United States is aimed toward achieving [[equality of opportunity]] for all, but it is the means of achieving this that changes depending on the circumstances. He says that the \"process of redefining liberalism in terms of the social needs of the 20th century was conducted by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his [[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] and his [[The New Freedom|New Freedom]], and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and his [[New Deal]]. Out of these three reform periods there emerged the conception of a social [[welfare state]], in which the national government had the express obligation to maintain high levels of employment in the economy, to supervise standards of life and labor, to regulate the methods of business competition, and to establish comprehensive patterns of social security\".<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/>\n\nSome make the distinction between [[Liberalism in the United States|American classical liberalism]] and the new liberalism, better known as [[social liberalism]].<ref>Novak, William J.

''Lester Ward and the Welfare State'' (1967)</ref> These often supported the growing working-class labor unions and sometimes even the socialists to their left. The [[Social Gospel]] movement was a Protestant intellectual movement that helped shape liberalism especially from the 1890s to the 1920s. It applied Christian ethics to social problems, especially issues of social justice such as economic inequality, poverty, alcoholism, crime, racial tensions, slums, unclean environment, child labor, inadequate labor unions, poor schools and the danger of war.<ref>Ronald C. White, Jr. and C. Howard Hopkins, ''The Social Gospel. Religion and Reform in Changing America'' (1975).</ref> [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s parents were active in the Social Gospel and had a lifetime commitment to it, for he sought to transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice as exemplified by the [[Great Society]] and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach to a sort of Christian internationalism and nation building.<ref>Randall B.

They rallied behind Republicans led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Robert M. La Follette]] as well as Democrats led by [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] to fight corruption, waste and big [[Trust (business)|trusts]] (monopolies). They stressed ideals of social justice and the use of government to solve social and economic problems. Settlement workers such as [[Jane Addams]] were leaders of the liberal tradition.<ref>Joyce E.

Croly presented the case for a planned economy, increased spending on education and the creation of a society based on the \"brotherhood of mankind\". His highly influential 1909 book ''[[The Promise of American Life]]'' proposed to raise the general standard of living by means of economic planning. Croly opposed aggressive unionization. In ''[[The Techniques of Democracy]]'' (1915), he also argued against both dogmatic individualism and dogmatic socialism.<ref>Wilfred McClay, ''Croly's progressive America'' (1998)</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Vernon Louis Parrington]] in 1928 won the Pulitzer Prize for ''Main Currents in American Thought''.

Other liberal Republicans included Senator [[Robert M. La Follette]] and his sons in Wisconsin (from about 1900 to 1946) and Western leaders such as Senator [[Hiram Johnson]] in California, Senator [[George W. Norris]] in Nebraska, Senator [[Bronson M. Cutting]] in New Mexico, Congresswoman [[Jeannette Rankin]] in Montana and Senator [[William Borah]] in Idaho from about 1900 to about 1940. They were generally liberal in domestic policy as they supported unions<ref>Ruth O'Brien, ''Workers' Paradox: The Republican Origins of New Deal Labor Policy, 1886\u20131935'' (1998) p 15</ref> and much of the [[New Deal]]. However, they were intensely isolationist in foreign policy.<ref>Robert Johnson, ''The peace progressives and American foreign relations'' (1995)</ref> This element died out by the 1940s.

They promoted economic growth and high state and federal spending while accepting high taxes and much liberal legislation, with the provision they could administer it more efficiently. They opposed the Democratic big city machines while welcoming support from labor unions and big business alike. Religion was not high on their agenda, but they were strong believers in civil rights for African-Americans and women's rights and most liberals were [[pro-choice]].

Roosevelt]] came to office in 1933 amid the economic calamity of the [[Great Depression]], offering the nation a [[New Deal]] intended to alleviate economic desperation and joblessness, provide greater opportunities and restore prosperity. His presidency was the longest in American history, lasting from 1933 to 1945 and marked by an increased role for the federal government in addressing the nation's economic and social problems. Work relief programs provided jobs, ambitious projects such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] were created to promote economic development and a [[social security]] system was established. The Roosevelt administration was assisted in its endeavors by progressives in Congress, with the congressional midterm elections of 1934 returning a more radical House of Representatives that was prepared to support progressive, new liberal measures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4eg7dHZlFcC&pg=PT125&dq=peter+clements+1934+more+radical+house+of+representatives&hl=en&sa=X&ei=B4I9UrnyC_Ob0AW5r4GwCQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=peter%20clements%201934%20more%20radical%20house%20of%20representatives&f=false|title=Access to History for the IB Diploma: The Great Depression and the Americas ... - Peter Clements - Google Books|work=google.com}}</ref> As noted by J.

Full employment was reached with the total mobilization of the United States economic, social and military resources in World War II. At that point, the main relief programs such as the WPA and the CCC were ended. Arthur Herman argues that Roosevelt restored prosperity after 1940 by cooperating closely with big business,<ref>Arthur Herman, ''Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II'' (2012)</ref> although when asked \"Do you think the attitude of the Roosevelt administration toward business is delaying business recovery?\", the American people in 1939 responded \"yes\" by a margin of more than 2-to-1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_01_4_higgs.pdf|format=PDF|title=Regime Uncertainty : Why the Great Depression Lasted So Long and Why Prosperity Resumed after the War|author=Robert Higgs|website=Independent.org|accessdate=4 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe New Deal programs to relieve the Great Depression are generally regarded as a mixed success in ending unemployment. At the time, many New Deal programs, especially the CCC, were popular. Liberals hailed them for improving the life of the common citizen and for providing jobs for the unemployed, legal protection for labor unionists, modern utilities for rural America, living wages for the working poor and price stability for the family farmer. Economic progress for minorities, however, was hindered by discrimination, an issue often avoided by Roosevelt's administration.<ref>Harvard Sitkoff, ed. ''Fifty Years Later: The New Deal Evaluated'' (1985), a favorable liberal interpretation</ref>\n\n==== Relief, recovery and reform ====\nThe New Deal consisted of three types of programs designed to produce relief, recovery and reform:<ref>William E. Leuchtenburg, '' Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal: 1932-1940'' (1963)</ref>\n* Relief was the immediate effort to help the one-third of the population that was hardest hit by the depression. Roosevelt expanded [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA) work relief program and added the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC), the [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA) and starting in 1935 the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). Also in 1935, the [[Social Security Act]] (SSA) and [[unemployment benefit#United States|unemployment insurance]] programs were added. Separate programs such as the [[Resettlement Administration]] and the [[Farm Security Administration]] were set up for relief in rural America.\n* Recovery was the goal of restoring the economy to pre-Depression levels. It involved greater spending of government funds in an effort to stimulate the economy, including deficit spending, dropping the [[gold standard]] and efforts to increase farm prices and foreign trade by lowering tariffs. Many programs were funded through a Hoover program of loans and loan guarantees, overseen by the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC).\n* Reform was based on the assumption that the depression was caused by the inherent instability of the market and that government intervention was necessary to rationalize and stabilize the economy and to balance the interests of farmers, business and labor. Reform measures included the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA), regulation of [[Wall Street]] by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934|Securities Exchange Act]] (SEA), the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] (AAA) for farm programs, the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) insurance for bank deposits enacted through the [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] of 1933 and the 1935 [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA), also known as the Wagner Act, dealing with labor-management relations. Despite urgings by some New Dealers, there was no major antitrust program. Roosevelt opposed socialism in the sense of state ownership of the means of production and only one major program, namely the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA), involved government ownership of the means of production (that is power plants and electrical grids). The conservatives feared the New Deal meant socialism and Roosevelt noted privately in 1934 that the \"old line press harps increasingly on state socialism and demands the return to the good old days\".<ref>Gary Dean Best, ''Pride, Prejudice, and Politics: Roosevelt Versus Recovery, 1933-1938'' (1991), 179; quote on p. 61</ref>\n\n==== Race ====\nThe New Deal was racially segregated as blacks and whites rarely worked alongside each other in New Deal programs.

The critics emphasize the absence of a philosophy of reform to explain the failure of New Dealers to attack fundamental social problems. They demonstrate the New Deal's commitment to save capitalism and its refusal to strip away private property. They detect a remoteness from the people and indifference to participatory democracy and call instead for more emphasis on conflict and exploitation.<ref>Jerold S.

Roosevelt ===\nIn international affairs, Roosevelt's presidency until 1938 reflected the isolationism that dominated practically all of American politics at the time. After 1938, he moved toward interventionism as the world hurtled toward war.<ref>Alonzo Hamby, ''For the Survival of Democracy: Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s'' (2004)</ref> Liberals split on foreign policy as many followed Roosevelt while others such as [[John L. Lewis]] of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]], historian [[Charles A. Beard]] and the [[Kennedy Family]] opposed him. However, Roosevelt added new conservative supporters such as Republicans [[Henry Stimson]] (who became his Secretary of War in 1940) and [[Wendell Willkie]] (who worked closely with Roosevelt after losing to him in the 1940s election). Anticipating the post-war period, Roosevelt strongly supported proposals to create a [[United Nations]] organization as a means of encouraging mutual cooperation to solve problems on the international stage. His commitment to internationalist ideals was in the tradition of [[Woodrow Wilson]], except that Roosevelt learned from Wilson's mistakes regarding the [[League of Nations]]. For instance, Roosevelt included Republicans in shaping foreign policy and insisted the United States have a veto at the United Nations.<ref>Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, ''FDR and the creation of the UN'' (1997)</ref>\n\n=== Liberalism during the Cold War ===\nAmerican liberalism of the [[Cold War]] era was the immediate heir to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and the somewhat more distant heir to the [[Progressive Era|progressives]] of the early 20th century. Rossinow (2008) argues that after 1945 the left-liberal alliance that operated during the New Deal years split apart for good over the issue of Communism. Anti-Communist liberals led by [[Walter Reuther]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]] expelled the far-left from labor unions and the [[New Deal coalition]] and committed the Democratic Party to a strong Cold War policy typified by [[NATO]] and the containment of Communism. Liberals became committed to a quantitative goal of economic growth that accepted large near-monopolies such as [[General Motors]] and [[American Telephone & Telegraph|AT&T]] while rejecting the structural transformation dreamed of by earlier left-liberals. The far-left had its last hurrah in [[Henry A. Wallace]]'s 1948 third-party presidential campaign. Wallace supported further New Deal reforms and opposed the Cold War, but his campaign was taken over by the far-left and Wallace retired from politics in disgust.<ref name=\"Rossinow 2008; Hamby 1992\">Rossinow (2008); Hamby (1992)</ref>\n\nMost prominent and constant among the positions of Cold War liberalism were the following:<ref name=\"Rossinow 2008; Hamby 1992\"/>\n* Support for a domestic economy built on a balance of power between labor (in the form of organized [[trade union|unions]]) and management (with a tendency to be more interested in large corporations than in [[small business]]).\n* A foreign policy focused on containing the Soviet Union and its allies.\n* The continuation and expansion of New Deal social welfare programs (in the broad sense of welfare, including programs such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]).\n* An embrace of [[Keynesianism|Keynesian economics]]. By way of compromise with political groupings to their right, this often became in practice [[military Keynesianism]].<ref>Herbert Stein, ''Presidential Economics: The Making of Economic Policy From Roosevelt to Clinton'' (3rd ed. 1994)</ref>\n\nIn some ways, this resembled what in other countries was referred to as [[social democracy]]. However, American liberals never widely endorsed [[nationalization]] of industry like European social democrats, instead favoring regulation for public benefit.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, both major American political parties included liberal and conservative factions. The [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] included the Northern and Western liberals on one hand and the generally conservative Southern whites on the other. Difficult to classify were the Northern big city Democratic [[political machine]]s. The urban machines had supported New Deal economic policies, but they faded with the coming of prosperity and the assimilation of ethnic groups. Nearly all collapsed by the 1960s in the face of racial violence in the cities<ref>Jules Witcover, ''Party of the People: A History of the Democrats'' (2003)</ref> The [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] included the moderate-to-liberal [[Wall Street]] and the moderate-to-conservative [[Main street|Main Street]]. The more liberal wing, strongest in the Northeast, was far more supportive of New Deal programs, labor unions and an internationalist foreign policy.<ref>Richard Norton Smith, ''Thomas E. Dewey and His Times'' (1984)</ref> Support for anti-Communism sometimes came at the expense of [[civil liberties]]. For example, ADA co-founder and archetypal Cold War liberal [[Hubert Humphrey]] unsuccessfully sponsored in 1950 a Senate bill to establish detention centers where those declared subversive by the President could be held without trial.<ref>Carl Solberg, ''Hubert Humphrey: A Biography'' (2003)</ref> Nonetheless, liberals opposed [[McCarthyism]] and were central to McCarthy's downfall.<ref>Richard M. Fried, ''Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective'' (1991)</ref>\n\nIn domestic policy during the [[Fifth Party System]] (1932\u20131966), liberals seldom had full control of government, but conservatives never had full control in that period either. According to Jonathan Bernstein, neither liberals nor Democrats controlled the House of Representatives very often from 1939 through 1957, although a 1958 landslide gave liberals real majorities in both houses of Congress for the first time in twenty years. However, Rules Committee reforms and others were carried out following this landslide as liberals saw that House procedures \"still prevented them from using that majority\". The conservative coalition was also important (if not dominant) from 1967 through 1974, although Congress had a liberal Democratic majority from 1985 to 1994. As also noted by Bernstein, \"there have only been a handful of years (Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term, 1961-1966, Jimmy Carter's presidency, and the first two years of Clinton's and Barack Obama's presidencies) when there were clear, working liberal majorities in the House, the Senate and the White House\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-15/democratic-party-wasn-t-always-liberal|title=Democratic Party Wasn't Always Liberal|author=Jonathan Bernstein|date=September 15, 2014|work=BloombergView.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Harry S. Truman's Fair Deal ===\nUntil he became President, liberals generally did not see [[Harry S. Truman]] as one of their own, viewing him as a Democratic Party hack. However, liberal politicians and liberal organizations such as the unions and [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) supported Truman's liberal [[Fair Deal]] proposals to continue and expand the New Deal. [[Alonzo Hamby]] argues that the Fair Deal reflected the vital center approach to liberalism which rejected totalitarianism, was suspicious of excessive concentrations of government power and honored the New Deal as an effort to achieve a progressive capitalist system. Solidly based upon the New Deal tradition in its advocacy of wide-ranging social legislation, the Fair Deal differed enough to claim a separate identity. The depression did not return after the war and the Fair Deal faced prosperity and an optimistic future. The Fair Dealers thought in terms of abundance rather than depression scarcity. Economist [[Leon Keyserling]] argued that the liberal task was to spread the benefits of abundance throughout society by stimulating economic growth. Agriculture Secretary [[Charles F.

The liberalism of the early 1960s contained no hint of radicalism, little disposition to revive new deal era crusades against concentrated economic power, and no intention to fan class passions or redistribute wealth or restructure existing institutions. Internationally it was strongly anti-Communist. It aimed to defend the free world, to encourage economic growth at home, and to ensure that the resulting plenty was fairly distributed. Their agenda-much influenced by Keynesian economic theory-envisioned massive public expenditure that would speed economic growth, thus providing the public resources to fund larger welfare, housing, health, and educational programs.<ref>[[David Edwin Harrell Jr.]], Edwin S.

Beginning with ''[[To Secure These Rights]]'', an official report issued by the Truman White House in 1947, self-proclaimed liberals increasingly embraced the civil rights movement. In 1948, President Truman desegregated the armed forces and the Democrats inserted a strong civil rights plank or provision in the Democratic Party platform. Black activists, most prominently [[Martin Luther King]], escalated the bearer agitation throughout the South, especially in Birmingham, Alabama, where brutal police tactics outraged national television audiences. The civil rights movement climaxed in the [[March on Washington]] in August 1963, where King gave his dramatic \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech. The activism put civil rights at the very top of the liberal political agenda and facilitated passage of the decisive [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] which permanently ended segregation in the United States and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] which guaranteed blacks the right to vote, with strong enforcement provisions throughout the South handled by the federal Department of Justice.<ref>James T.

Hill and Wang, 2008), pp 152\u201353</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-1960s, relations between white liberals and the civil rights movement became increasingly strained as civil rights leaders accused liberal politicians of temporizing and procrastinating. Although President Kennedy sent federal troops to compel the [[University of Mississippi]] to admit African-American [[James Meredith]] in 1962 and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. toned down the 1963 March on Washington at Kennedy's behest, the failure to seat the [[Delegate (American politics)|delegate]]s of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] at the 1964 [[Democratic National Convention]] indicated a growing rift. President Johnson could not understand why the rather impressive civil rights laws passed under his leadership had failed to immunize Northern and Western cities from rioting. At the same time, the civil rights movement itself was becoming fractured. By 1966, a [[Black Power]] movement had emerged. Black Power advocates accused white liberals of trying to control the civil rights agenda. Proponents of Black Power wanted African-Americans to follow an ethnic model for obtaining power,{{citation needed|date=September 2008}} not unlike that of Democratic political machines in large cities. This put them on a collision course with urban machine politicians. On its most extreme edges, the Black Power movement contained racial separatists who wanted to give up on integration altogether\u2014a program that could not be endorsed by American liberals of any race. The mere existence of such individuals (who always got more media attention than their actual numbers might have warranted) contributed to white backlash against liberals and civil rights activists.<ref name=\"Harvard Sitkoff 2008\"/>\n\nLiberals were latecomers to the movement for equal rights for women. Generally, they agreed with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] that women needed special protections, especially regarding hours of work, night work and physically heavy work.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nancy Woloch|title=A Class by Herself: Protective Laws for Women Workers, 1890s-1990s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_R_3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA173|year=2015|publisher=Princeton UP|page=173}}</ref> The [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) had first been proposed in the 1920s by [[Alice Paul]] and appealed primarily to middle-class career women.

Many were animated by foreign policy, taking a strong anti-Soviet and pro-Israel position as typified by ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', a Jewish magazine.<ref>Benjamin V. Balint, ''Running Commentary: The Contentious Magazine that Transformed the Jewish Left into the Neoconservative Right'' (2010)</ref> Many had been supporters of Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]], who was noted for his strong positions in favor of labor and against Communism. Many neoconservatives joined the administrations of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]] and attacked liberalism vocally in both the popular media and scholarly publications.<ref>John Ehrman, ''The Rise of Neoconservatism: Intellectual and Foreign Affairs 1945\u20131994'' (2005)</ref>\n\n=== Under attack from the New Left ===\n{{see also|New Left}}\nLiberalism came under attack from both the New Left in the early 1960s and the right in the late 1960s. Kazin (1998) says: \"The liberals who anxiously turned back the assault of the postwar Right were confronted in the 1960s by a very different adversary: a radical movement led, in the main, by their own children, the white \"New Left\".<ref>Michael Kazin, ''The populist persuasion: an American history'' (1998) p 196</ref> This new element, says Kazin, worked to \"topple the corrupted liberal order\".<ref>Kazin, ''Populist persuasion'' p 197</ref> As Maurice Isserman notes, the New Left \"came to use the word 'liberal' as a political epithet\".<ref>Maurice Isserman, ''The other American: the life of Michael Harrington'' (2001) p. 276</ref> Slack (2013) argues that the New Left was more broadly speaking the political component of a break with liberalism that took place across several academic fields, namely philosophy, psychology and sociology. In philosophy, [[existentialism]] and [[neo-Marxism]] rejected the instrumentalism of [[John Dewey]]; in psychology, [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Norman O. Brown]] rejected [[Sigmund Freud]]'s teaching of repression and sublimation; and in sociology, [[C. Wright Mills]] rejected the pragmatism of Dewey for the teachings of [[Max Weber]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/08/liberalism-radicalized-the-sexual-revolution-multiculturalism-and-the-rise-of-identity-politics|title=Liberalism Radicalized: The Sexual Revolution, Multiculturalism, and the Rise of Identity Politics|first=Kevin|last=Slack|website=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.anamnesisjournal.com/issues/2-web-essays/88-the-false-genealogies-of-neo-progressivismk]{{dead link|date=April 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe attack was not confined to the United States as the New Left was a worldwide movement with strength in parts of Western Europe as well as Japan. For example, massive demonstrations in France denounced [[American imperialism]] and its helpers in Western European governments.<ref>George N. Katsiaficas, ''The Imagination of the New Left: A Global Analysis of 1968'' (1987) p 51</ref><ref>Jeremi Suri, ''Power and Protest: Global Revolution and the Rise of Detente'' (2005) [http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=%22against+the+centralized%22+inauthor:suri&num=10 p 129 online]</ref>\n\nThe main activity of the New Left became [[opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War]] as conducted by liberal President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. The anti-war movement escalated the rhetorical heat as violence broke out on both sides. The climax came in sustained protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Liberals fought back, with [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], chief foreign policy advisor of the 1968 Humphrey campaign, saying the New Left \"threatened American liberalism\" in a manner reminiscent of McCarthyism.<ref>Jeff Taylor, ''Where did the party go?: William Jennings Bryan, Hubert Humphrey, and the Jeffersonian legacy'' (2006) p. 125</ref> While the New Left considered Humphrey a war criminal, Nixon attacked him as the New Left's enabler\u2014a man with \"a personal attitude of indulgence and permissiveness toward the lawless\".<ref>Peter Beinart, ''The Good Fight: Why Liberals\u2014and Only Liberals\u2014Can Win the War on Terror and Make America Great Again'' p 49</ref> Beinart concludes that \"with the country divided against itself, contempt for Hubert Humphrey was the one thing on which left and right could agree\".<ref>Beinart, ''The Good Fight'' p 49</ref>\n\nAfter 1968, the New Left lost strength and the more serious attacks on liberalism came from the right. Nevertheless, the liberal ideology lost its attractiveness. Liberal commentator [[E. J. Dionne]] contends: \"If liberal ideology began to crumble intellectually in the 1960s it did so in part because the New Left represented a highly articulate and able wrecking crew\".<ref>[[E. J. Dionne]], ''Why Americans Hate Politics'' (1991) p 37</ref>\n\n=== Liberals and the Vietnam War ===\n{{see also|Vietnam War}}\nWhile the civil rights movement isolated liberals from their erstwhile allies, the [[Vietnam War]] threw a wedge into the liberal ranks, dividing pro-war [[War hawk|hawks]] such as Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]] from [[War dove|doves]] such as 1972 presidential candidate Senator [[George McGovern]]. As the war became the leading political issue of the day, agreement on domestic matters was not enough to hold the liberal consensus together.<ref>Melvin Small, ''At the Water's Edge: American Politics and the Vietnam War'' (2006)</ref>\n\nIn the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential campaign]], [[John F. Kennedy]] was liberal in domestic policy, but conservative on foreign policy, calling for a more aggressive stance against Communism than his opponent Richard Nixon.\n\nOpposition to the war first emerged from the New Left and from black leaders such as [[Martin Luther King]]. By 1967, there was growing opposition from within liberal ranks, led in 1968 by Senators [[Eugene McCarthy]] and [[Robert Kennedy]]. After Democratic President Lyndon Johnson announced in March 1968 that he would not run for re-election, Kennedy and McCarthy fought each other for the nomination, with Kennedy besting McCarthy in a series of Democratic primaries. The [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassination of Kennedy]] removed him from the race and Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] emerged from the disastrous [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] with the presidential nomination of a deeply divided party. Meanwhile, Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]] announced his third-party run and pulled in many working-class whites in the rural South and big-city North, most of whom had been staunch Democrats. Liberals led by the labor unions focused their attacks on Wallace while Nixon led a unified Republican Party to victory.\n\n=== Richard Nixon ===\nThe [[1968 United States presidential election|chaos of 1968]], a bitterly divided Democratic Party and bad blood between the New Left and the liberals gave Nixon the presidency. Nixon rhetorically attacked liberals, but in practice enacted many liberal policies and represented the more liberal wing of the Republican Party. Nixon established the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] by executive order, expanded the national endowments for the arts and the humanities, began affirmative action policies, opened diplomatic relations with [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], starting the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] to reduce [[ballistic missile]] availability and turned the war over to South Vietnam. He withdrew all American combat troops by 1972, signed a peace treaty in 1973 and ended the draft.<ref>Joan Hoff, ''Nixon Reconsidered'' (1995)</ref> Regardless of his policies, liberals hated Nixon and rejoiced when the [[Watergate scandal]] forced his resignation in 1974.\n\nWhile the differences between Nixon and the liberals are obvious\u2014the liberal wing of his own party favored politicians such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[William Scranton]] and Nixon overtly placed an emphasis on law and order over civil liberties, with [[Nixon's Enemies List]] being composed largely of liberals\u2014in some ways the continuity of many of Nixon's policies with those of the Kennedy\u2013Johnson years is more remarkable than the differences. Pointing at this continuity, New Left leader [[Noam Chomsky]] (himself on [[Master list of Nixon's political opponents|Nixon's enemies list]]) has called Nixon \"in many respects the last liberal president\".<ref>[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200006--.htm The Colombia Plan: April 2000] by Noam Chomsky, ''Z'' Magazine, June 2000.</ref>\n\nThe political dominance of the liberal consensus even into the Nixon years can best be seen in policies such as the successful establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency or his failed proposal to replace the welfare system with a guaranteed annual income by way of a [[negative income tax]]. [[Affirmative action]] in its most quota-oriented form was a Nixon administration policy. The Nixon [[War on Drugs]] allocated two-thirds of its funds for treatment, a far higher ratio than was to be the case under any subsequent President, Republican or Democrat. Additionally, Nixon's normalization of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and his policy of ''d\u00e9tente'' with the Soviet Union were probably more popular with liberals than with his conservative base.\n\nAn opposing view offered by [[Cass R. Sunstein]] in ''The Second Bill of Rights'' (Basic Books, 2004, {{ISBN|0-465-08332-3}}) argues that through his [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] appointments Nixon effectively ended a decades-long expansion of economic rights along the lines of those put forward in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].\n\n=== Labor unions ===\n{{main|Labor unions in the United States}}\nLabor unions were central components of liberalism, operating through the [[New Deal coalition]].<ref>Kevin Boyle, ''The UAW and the Heyday of American Liberalism 1945\u20131968'' (1995)</ref> The unions gave strong support to the Vietnam War, thereby breaking with the blacks and with the intellectual and student wings of liberalism. From time to time, dissident groups such as the Progressive Alliance, the Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition and the National Labor Committee broke from the dominant [[AFL\u2013CIO]] which they saw as too conservative. In 1995, the liberals managed to take control of the AFL\u2013CIO under the leadership of [[John Sweeney (labor leader)|John Sweeney]] of the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU). Union membership in the private sector has fallen from 33% to 7%, with a resulting decline in political weight. In 2005, the SEIU, now led by [[Andy Stern]], broke away from the AFL\u2013CIO to form its own coalition, the [[Change to Win Federation]], to support liberalism, including the [[Barack Obama]]'s agenda, especially health care reform. Stern retired in 2010.<ref>Andrew Battista, ''The Revival of Labor Liberalism'' (2008)</ref> Regardless of the loss of numbers, unions have a long tradition and deep experience in organizing and continue at the state and national level to mobilize forces for a liberal agenda, especially regarding votes for Democrats, taxes, spending, union representation and the threat to American jobs from foreign trade.<ref>Andrew Battista, ''The Revival of Labor Liberalism'' (University of Illinois Press, 2008) p 173</ref> Offsetting the decline in the private sector is a growth of unionization in the public sector.

The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African-Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough to make up for the loss of some Southern Democrats. A tide of conservatism rose in response to perceived failures of liberal policies.<ref name=\"Krugman\">Krugman, Paul (2007). ''[[The Conscience of a Liberal]]''. New York: [[W. W.

Kennedy was decisively defeated, and in turn Carter was defeated by [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\nHistorians often use 1979\u20131980 to date a philosophical realignment within the American electorate away from Democratic liberalism and toward [[Reagan Era]] conservatism.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Age of Reagan: A History 1974-2008'' (2008) p 125</ref><ref>[[Joseph R.

The success of liberalism in the first place, he argues, came from efforts of a [[liberal elite]] that had entrenched itself in key social, political and especially judicial positions. These elites, Abrams contends, imposed their brand of liberalism from within some of the least democratic and most insulated institutions, especially the universities, foundations, independent regulatory agencies and the Supreme Court. With only a weak popular base, liberalism was vulnerable to a populist counter-revolution by the nation's democratic or majoritarian forces.<ref>Richard M.

She was a vocal supporter and leader in the [[women's movement]] and Ford was also noted for bringing breast cancer awareness to national attention following her 1974 [[mastectomy]].

Reagan warned the United States of modern secularists who condoned abortion, excused teenage sexuality, opposed school prayer and attenuated traditional American values. His conviction that there existed a single proper personal behavior, religious worldview, economic system and proper attitude toward nations and peoples not supporting American interests worldwide is credited by [[comparative literature]] scholar Betty Jean Craige with polarizing the United States.

Bush recognized that motivating voters to fear Dukakis as a risky, non-mainstream candidate generated political support for his own campaign. Bush's campaign also used issues of prayer to arouse suspicions that Dukakis was less devout in his religious convictions.

Alterman points out that resistance to the label liberal is not surprising due to billions of dollars worth of investment poured into the denigration of the term. A 2004 poll conducted by the National Election Study found that only 35% of respondents questioned identifying as liberal compared to 55% identifying as conservative. A 2004 Pew poll found 19% of respondents identifying as liberal and 39% identifying as conservative, with the balance identifying as moderate. A 2006 poll found that 19% identified as liberal and 36% conservative. In 2005, self-identifying moderates polled by [[Harris Insights & Analytics|Louis Harris & Associates]] were found to share essentially the same political beliefs as self-identifying liberals, but instead rejected the world liberal because of the vilification heaped on the word itself by conservatives. Alterman acknowledges political scientist [[Drew Westen]]'s observation that for most Americans the word liberal now carries meanings such as \"elite\", \"tax and spend\" and \"out of touch\".<ref name=\"Alterman 2008\"/>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n=== Free speech ===\n{{main|Freedom of speech in the United States}}\nAmerican liberals describe themselves as open to change and receptive to new ideas.<ref>\"Fact Finders\" by Jonathan Chait, ''The New Republic'', February 22, 2005</ref> For example, liberals typically accept scientific ideas that some conservatives reject, such as evolution and global warming.<ref>Barack Obama, ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'', Three Rivers Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-307-23770-5}}. \"I believe in evolution, scientific inquiry, and global warming; I believe in free speech, whether politically correct or politically incorrect, and I am suspicious of using government to impose anybody's religious beliefs&nbsp;\u2013 including my own&nbsp;\u2013 on nonbelievers.\"</ref>\n\nLiberals tend to oppose the Supreme Court's ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|Citizens United]]'' ruling in 2010 that a corporation's First Amendment right to free speech encompasses freedom to make unlimited independent expenditures for any political party, politician or [[Lobbying|lobbyist]] as they see fit. President Obama called it \"a major victory for [[big oil]], Wall Street banks, health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans\".<ref>Adam Liptak, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/us/politics/22scotus.html \"Justices, 5-4, Reject Corporate Spending Limit\"], ''New York Times'', January 21, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Opposition to state socialism ===\n{{see also|History of the socialist movement in the United States}}\nIn general, liberalism opposes socialism when it is understood to mean an alternative to [[capitalism]] based on state ownership of the means of production. American liberals usually doubt that bases for political opposition and freedom can survive when power is vested in the state as it was under [[Socialist state|state-socialist regimes]]. In line with the \"general pragmatic, empirical basis\" of liberalism, American liberal philosophy embraces the idea that if substantial abundance and equality of opportunity can be achieved through a system of [[Mixed economy|mixed ownership]], then there is no need for a rigid and oppressive bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Schlesinger\"/> Since the 1950s, some liberal public intellectuals have moved further toward the allegation that [[free markets]] can provide better solutions than top-down economic planning when appropriately regulated. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued that in hitherto-state-dominated functions such as nation-scale energy distribution and telecommunications marketizations can improve efficiency dramatically.<ref>Paul Krugman, [http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/05/24/260257/index.htm \"The Ascent of E-Man R.I.P.: The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit\"], ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'', May 24, 1999.</ref> He also defended a monetary policy\u2014[[inflation targeting]]\u2014saying that it \"most nearly approaches the usual goal of modern stabilization policy, which is to provide adequate demand in a clean, unobtrusive way that does not distort the allocation of resources\". These distortions are of a kind that war-time and postwar Keynesian economists had accepted as an inevitable byproduct of fiscal policies that selectively reduced certain consumer taxes and directed spending toward government-managed stimulus projects, even where these economists theorized at a contentious distance from some of Keynes's own, more hands-off, positions which tended to emphasize stimulating of business investment.<ref>''The Cambridge Companion to Keynes'', Roger Backhouse, Bradley W.

Historian [[H. W. Brands]] notes that \"the growth of the state is, by perhaps the most common definition, the essence of modern American liberalism\".<ref>H. W. Brands, review, in ''Journal of American History'' March 2008, Vol. 94 Issue 4, p 1227</ref> According to [[Paul Starr]], \"[l]iberal constitutions impose constraints on the power of any single public official or branch of government as well as the state as a whole\".<ref>Paul Starr, ''Freedom's Power: The History and Promise of Liberalism'', Basic Books, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-465-08187-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Morality ===\nAccording to cognitive linguist [[George Lakoff]], liberal philosophy is based on five basic categories of morality. The first, the promotion of fairness, is generally described as an emphasis on empathy as a desirable trait. With this [[social contract]] based on the [[Golden Rule]] comes the rationale for many liberal positions. The second category is assistance to those who cannot assist themselves. A nurturing, philanthropic spirit is one that is considered good in liberal philosophy. This leads to the third category, namely the desire to protect those who cannot defend themselves. The fourth category is the importance of fulfilling one's life, allowing a person to experience all that they can. The fifth and final category is the importance of caring for oneself since only thus can one act to help others.<ref>George Lakeoff, ''Moral Politics,'' 2002</ref>\n\n== Historiography ==\nLiberalism increasingly shaped American intellectual life in the 1930s and 1940s, thanks in large part to two major two-volume studies that were widely read by academics, advanced students, intellectuals and the general public, namely [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary Beard's ''The Rise of American civilization'' (2 vol.; 1927)<ref>See [http://www.unz.org/Pub/BeardCharles-1927 Complete edition online]</ref> and [[Vernon L. Parrington]]'s ''Main Currents in American Thought'' (2 vol.; 1927). The Beards exposed the material forces that shaped American history while Parrington focused on the material forces that shaped American literature. According to the Beards, virtually all political history involved the bitter conflict between the agrarians, farmers and workers led by the Jeffersonians and the capitalists led by the Hamiltonians. The Civil War marked a great triumph of the capitalists and comprised the Second American Revolution. Younger historians welcome the realistic approach that emphasized hardcore economic interest as a powerful force and downplayed the role of ideas.<ref>Clyde W. Barrow, ''More Than a Historian: The Political and Economic Thought of Charles A. Beard'' (2000).</ref> Parrington spoke to the crises at hand. According to historian Ralph Gabriel: <blockquote>''Main Currents'' attempted to trace the history of liberalism  in the American scene for citizens who were caught in a desperate predicament. It was an age in which American liberalism set the United States, through the New Deal, on a Democratic middle-of-the-road course between the contemporary extremisms of Europe, that of Communism on one hand, and of Fascism on the other. [...] The style of ''Main Currents'' was powered by Parrington's dedication to the cause of humane liberalism, by his ultimate humanistic, democratic faith.  He saw the democratic dreams of the romantic first half of the 19th century as the climax of an epic story toward which early Americans moved and from which later Americans fell away.<ref>Ralph H. Gabriel, \"Vernon Lewis Parrington,\"  in Marcus Cunliffe and Robin W. Winks, eds., ''Pastmasters: Some essays on American historians'' (1969), pp 157, 161-62</ref></blockquote>\n\nLiberal readers immediately realized where they stood in the battle between Jeffersonian democracy and Hamiltonian privilege.<ref>John Higham, ''Writing American History'' (1970) p. 134</ref> Neither the Beards nor Parrington paid any attention to slavery, race relations, or minorities. For example, the Beards \"dismissed the agitations of the abolitionists as a small direct consequence because of their lack of appeal to the public\".<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington'' (1968) pp 302, 460.</ref>\n\nPrinceton historian [[Eric F. Goldman]] helped define American liberalism for postwar generations of university students. The first edition of his most influential work appeared in 1952 with the publication of ''Rendezvous with Destiny: A History of Modern American Reform'', covering reform efforts from the Grant years to the 1950s. For decades, it was a staple of the undergraduate curriculum in history, highly regarded for its style and its exposition of modern American liberalism. According to Priscilla Roberts: <blockquote>Lively, well-written, and highly readable, it provided an overview of eight decades of reformers, complete with arresting vignettes of numerous individuals, and stressed the continuities among successful American reform movements. Writing at the height of the Cold War, he also argued that the fundamental liberal tradition of the United States was moderate, centrist, and incrementalist, and decidedly non-socialist and non-totalitarian. While broadly sympathetic to the cause of American reform, Goldman was far from uncritical toward his subjects, faulting progressives of World War I for their lukewarm reception of the League of Nations, American reformers of the 1920s for their emphasis on freedom of lifestyles rather than economic reform, and those of the 1930s for overly tolerant attitude toward Soviet Russia.  His views of past American reformers encapsulated the conventional, liberal, centrist orthodoxy of the early 1950s, from its support for anti-communism and international activism abroad and New Deal-style big government at home, to its condemnation of McCarthyism.<ref>Priscilla M. Roberts, \"Goldman, Eric \" in Kelly Boyd, ed., ''Encyclopedia of historians and historical writing. Vol. 1'' (1999) pp. 474-75.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFor the general public, [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] was the most widely read [[historian]], [[social critic]] and [[public intellectual]]. Schlesinger's work explored the history of Jacksonian era and especially 20th-century American liberalism. His major books focused on leaders such as Andrew Jackson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. He was a White House aide to Kennedy and his ''[[A Thousand Days|A Thousand Days: John F. Kennedy in the White House]]'' won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize. In 1968, Schlesinger wrote speeches for Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 and the biography, ''Robert Kennedy and His Times''. He later popularized the term [[imperial presidency]], warning against excessive power in the White House as typified by Richard Nixon. Late in his career, he came to oppose multiculturalism.<ref>John Patrick Diggins, ed., ''The Liberal Persuasion: Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and the Challenge of the American Past'' (1997) [https://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Persuasion-Schlesinger-Challenge-American/dp/B008SM2AIW excerpt]</ref>\n\n== Proponents ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n; Politicians\n* [[William Jennings Bryan]] (1860\u20131925), Democrat from Nebraska and 1896, 1900 and 1908 Democratic presidential nominee\n* President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1858\u20131919), Republican President from 1901 to 1909 and 1912 Progressive Party presidential nominee\n* President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1856\u20131924), Democrat President from 1913 to 1921\n* Governor and Senator [[Robert M.

WAPL forms a complex with [[PDS5A]] or [[PDS5B]] and releases cohesin from DNA by opening the interface between SMC3 and RAD21.\n\n== Interphase ==\n[[File:Structure of PDS5B (blue), WAPL (green) and IP6 (PDB 5HDT) (Ouyang et al., 2016).png|thumb|left|Structure of PDS5B (blue), WAPL (green) and IP6 (PDB 5HDT) (Ouyang et al., 2016)]]\nCohesin loading begins in telophase and is mediated by [[NIPBL]] and its binding partner MAU2. In [[Cell cycle|G1]], WAPL forms a complex with PDS5 and removes cohesin from the DNA but it is reloaded by NIPBL-MAU2. The equilibrium between loading and release give cohesin a DNA residence time of 20 minutes. During DNA replication, a fraction of cohesin is acetylated and binds to [[CDCA5|Sororin]] making it resistant to WAPL and able to hold sister chromatids together. This is crucial for the maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion because onse the sister chromatids are separated, cohesion cannot be reestablished.\n\n== Prophase pathway ==\nWhen a cell enters mitosis, Sororin is phosphorylated causing it to dissociate from cohesin meaning WAPL can remove cohesin from the DNA. A complex of [[SGOL1]] and [[Protein phosphatase 2|PP2A]] dephosphorylates cohesin at the centromere protecting it from WAPL-mediated release. Sister chromatid cohesion is therefore maintained at the centromeres where it is required for mitosis but lost on the arms. This removal of cohesin is known as the Prophase Pathway and results in the X-shape sister chromatids observed in chromosome spreads.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nWAPL release cohesin from DNA by opening the SMC3-RAD21 interface thereby allowing DNA to pass out of the ring.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beckou\u00ebt F, Srinivasan M, Roig MB, Chan KL, Scheinost JC, Batty P, Hu B, Petela N, Gligoris T, Smith AC, Strmecki L, Rowland BD, Nasmyth K | display-authors = 6 | title = Releasing Activity Disengages Cohesin's Smc3/Scc1 Interface in a Process Blocked by Acetylation | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 563\u2013574 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26895425 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2016.01.026 | pmc = 4769318 }}</ref> Opening of this interface is regulated by ATP-binding by the SMC subunits.

WAPL forms a complex with [[PDS5A]] or [[PDS5B]] and releases cohesin from DNA by opening the interface between SMC3 and RAD21.\n\n== Interphase ==\n[[File:Structure of PDS5B (blue), WAPL (green) and IP6 (PDB 5HDT) (Ouyang et al., 2016).png|thumb|left|Structure of PDS5B (blue), WAPL (green) and IP6 (PDB 5HDT) (Ouyang et al., 2016)]]\nCohesin loading begins in telophase and is mediated by [[NIPBL]] and its binding partner MAU2. In [[Cell cycle|G1]], WAPL removes cohesin from the DNA but it is reloaded by NIPBL-MAU2. The equilibrium between loading and release give cohesin a DNA residence time of 20 minutes. When DNA is replicated, a fraction of cohesin is acetylated and binds to [[CDCA5|Sororin]] making it resistant to WAPL and able to hold sister chromatids together. This is crucial for the maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion because onse the sister chromatids are separated, cohesion cannot be reestablished.\n\n== Prophase pathway ==\nWhen a cell enters mitosis, Sororin is phosphorylated causing it to dissociate from cohesin meaning WAPL can remove cohesin from the DNA. A complex of [[SGOL1]] and [[Protein phosphatase 2|PP2A]] dephosphorylates cohesin at the centromere protecting it from WAPL-mediated release. Sister chromatid cohesion is therefore maintained at the centromeres where it is required for mitosis but lost on the arms. This removal of cohesin is known as the Prophase Pathway and results in the X-shape sister chromatids observed in chromosome spreads.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nWAPL release cohesin from DNA by opening the SMC3-RAD21 interface thereby allowing DNA to pass out of the ring.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Beckou\u00ebt F, Srinivasan M, Roig MB, Chan KL, Scheinost JC, Batty P, Hu B, Petela N, Gligoris T, Smith AC, Strmecki L, Rowland BD, Nasmyth K | display-authors = 6 | title = Releasing Activity Disengages Cohesin's Smc3/Scc1 Interface in a Process Blocked by Acetylation | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 61 | issue = 4 | pages = 563\u2013574 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26895425 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2016.01.026 | pmc = 4769318 }}</ref> Opening of this interface is regulated by ATP-binding by the SMC subunits.
