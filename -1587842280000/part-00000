It allowed a tracked vehicle to change direction while on the move with less loss of power than under other steering systems, and to perform a neutral turn on the spot by rotating its tracks in opposite directions. Merritt's invention suited the faster pace of tank warfare of the Second World War which contrasted with the more static trench warfare of the First World War for which earlier generations of British tanks had been optimised.\n\nHe wrote a number of books, including the standard texts ''Gears'' (1942), which received three editions, and its companion volume ''Gear Trains'' (1947) which included a Brocot table derived from the work of the French clockmaker and mathematician [[Achille Brocot]].<ref name=roeg/>\n\nHe complained that gearing was a field dominated by empiricism in which science had so far played little role, so that it had hardly progressed in 150 years, but [[Brian Hayes (scientist)|Brian Hayes]] found sophisticated mathematical concepts in use in the field and, for him, a surprising degree of interchange between mathematics and mechanics. By 2000, many of the problems that Merritt had wrestled with had been solved through the application of brute force calculations by electronic computers.\n\n==Early life==\nHenry Merritt was born in [[West Ham]],<ref>[https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2FHD-Y8V Henry Edward Merritt England and Wales Birth Registration Index, 1837\u20132008.] Family Search.

The Chargers finished the regular season with a record of 9\u20137, improving on their 7\u20139 record from [[2012 San Diego Chargers season|2012]]. Also, they qualified for the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]] for the first time since [[2009 San Diego Chargers season|2009]]. The Chargers defeated the [[2013 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] in the Wild Card round by a score of 27\u201310, but lost to the [[2013 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in the Divisional round by a score of 24\u201317. This was the Chargers' final playoff appearance in San Diego. They did not play in the postseason again until [[2018 Los Angeles Chargers season|2018]], after relocating to [[Los Angeles]].\n\nThe new head coach, Mike McCoy, along with [[offensive coordinator]] [[Ken Whisenhunt]], completed the Chargers' first winning season since [[2010 San Diego Chargers season|2010]]. Only two offensive coaches returned from 2012 in an overhauled coaching staff, and a revamped offensive system had [[quarterback]] [[Philip Rivers]] release the ball earlier and taking what opposing defenses conceded. Rivers was [[Quarterback sack|sacked]] 30 times, compared to 49 the previous year, and threw for 4,479 yards and 32 [[touchdown]]s while tying a career-high with a 105.5 [[passer rating]]. San Diego's rushing attack improved from the prior season's 1,461 yards and 3.6 yards per carry\u2014tied for the second worst in the league\u2014to 1,965 yards and a 4-yard average.<ref name=gehlken_02012014>{{cite news|last=Gehlken |first=Michael |title=Philip Rivers Comeback Player of Year |date=February 1, 2014 |newspaper=U-T San Diego |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/feb/01/philip-rivers-chargers-comeback-player-year/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6N56o4ZKR?url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/feb/01/philip-rivers-chargers-comeback-player-year/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> Although they were speculated to have a poor, disappointing season, and getting off to a shaky start, the Chargers finished in the top eight of the overall standings. Rivers was named [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]], and [[Keenan Allen]] broke out into the national scene as a [[rookie]] sensation, breaking multiple [[wide receiver]] rookie records. Whisenhunt left at the conclusion of the season to become the head coach of the [[2014 Tennessee Titans season|Titans]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Signings==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!

The Chargers finished the regular season with a record of 9\u20137, improving on their 7\u20139 record from [[2012 San Diego Chargers season|2012]]. Also, they qualified for the [[National Football League playoffs|playoffs]] for the first time since [[2009 San Diego Chargers season|2009]]. The Chargers defeated the [[2013 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] in the Wild Card round by a score of 27\u201310, but lost to the [[2013 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in the Divisional round by a score of 24\u201317. This was the Chargers' final playoff appearance in San Diego. They did not play in the postseason again until [[2018 Los Angeles Chargers season|2018]], after relocating to [[Los Angeles]].\n\nThe new head coach, Mike McCoy, along with [[offensive coordinator]] [[Ken Whisenhunt]], completed the Chargers' first winning season since [[2010 San Diego Chargers season|2010]]. Only two offensive coaches returned from 2012 in an overhauled coaching staff, and a revamped offensive system had [[quarterback]] [[Philip Rivers]] release the ball earlier and taking what opposing defenses conceded. Rivers was [[Quarterback sack|sacked]] 30 times, compared to 49 the previous year, and threw for 4,479 yards and 32 [[touchdown]]s while tying a career-high with a 105.5 [[passer rating]]. San Diego's rushing attack improved from the prior season's 1,461 yards and 3.6 yards per carry\u2014tied for the second worst in the league\u2014to 1,965 yards and a 4-yard average.<ref name=gehlken_02012014>{{cite news|last=Gehlken |first=Michael |title=Philip Rivers Comeback Player of Year |date=February 1, 2014 |newspaper=U-T San Diego |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/feb/01/philip-rivers-chargers-comeback-player-year/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6N56o4ZKR?url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2014/feb/01/philip-rivers-chargers-comeback-player-year/ |archivedate=February 2, 2014 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref> Although they were speculated to have a poor, disappointing season, and getting off to a shaky start, the Chargers finished in the top eight of the overall standings. Rivers was named [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]], and [[Keenan Allen]] broke out into the national scene as a [[rookie]] sensation, breaking multiple [[wide receiver]] rookie records. Whisenhunt left at the conclusion of the season to become the head coach of the [[2014 Tennessee Titans season|Titans]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Signings==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!
