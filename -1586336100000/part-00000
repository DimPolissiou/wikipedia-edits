The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name=\"Zelensky bowed until luck\" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].\n\nThe inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13\u20139 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23\u201317 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a near-party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).\n\nThe articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office.

The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name=\"Zelensky bowed until luck\" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].\n\nThe inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13\u20139 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23\u201317 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a near-party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).\n\nThe articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office.

Ebola virus disease (EVD) received either \"immediate\" or 21-day \"delayed\" vaccination.<ref name=\"FDA PR\" /> This noteworthy design was intended to capture a social network of individuals and

death.<ref name=\"FDA PR\" /> In a comparison of cases of EVD among 2,108 individuals in the \"immediate\" vaccination arm and 1,429 individuals in the \"delayed\" vaccination arm, Ervebo was determined to be 100% effective in preventing Ebola cases with symptom onset greater than ten days after vaccination.<ref name=\"FDA PR\" /> No cases of EVD with symptom onset greater than ten days after vaccination were observed in the \"immediate\" cluster group, compared with ten cases of EVD in the 21-day \"delayed\" cluster group.<ref name=\"FDA PR\" />\n\nIn additional studies, antibody responses were assessed in 477 individuals in Liberia, approximately 500 individuals in Sierra Leone and approximately 900 individuals in Canada, Spain and the U.S.<ref name=\"FDA PR\" /> The antibody responses among those in the study conducted in Canada, Spain and the U.S. were similar to those among individuals in the studies conducted in Liberia and Sierra Leone.<ref name=\"FDA PR\" /> \n\nThe safety was assessed in approximately 15,000 individuals in Africa, Europe and North America.<ref name=\"FDA PR\" /> The most commonly reported side effects were pain, swelling and redness at the

Non-human primates were challenged with different doses of VP35. This challenge resulted in the activation of the innate immune system and the production of anti-EBOV antibodies. The primates were then back-challenged with the wild type Ebola virus and survived.

The senators, led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and calling themselves [[Liberatores]], had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the [[Theatre of Pompey]], they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their [[toga]]s, killing him. Caesar's assassination led to a [[civil war]] for control of the [[Roman Republic|republic]], ending ultimately with the rise of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] and the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n== Armenia ==\nLegislative violence has happened in Armenia.<ref>[https://news.am/eng/news/141650.html Fight breaks in Armenian parliament]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arminfo.info/full_news.php?id=27607&lang=3|title=Arminfo: Another fight occurred in the Armenian parliament: At this time RPA deputy Artashes Geghamyan and oppositionist Nikol Pashinyan met in hand-to-hand fight|website=arminfo.info|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref><ref>[https://www.rferl.org/a/armenia-female-legislator-attacked-brawl-sewage-smell-city-council/29037927.html Female Legislator Attacked In Brawl Over Yerevan Sewage Water ]</ref>\n\n== Australia ==\n===13 February 2019 ===\n[[Brian Burston]] and [[James Ashby]] have clashed in The Great Hall amid claims of sexual harassment.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/14/blood-on-the-door-24-hours-of-chaos-australian-politics Blood on the door: 24 hours of chaos in Australian politics]</ref><ref>[https://www.news24.com/World/News/police-investigate-australia-parliament-brawl-20190214 Police investigate Australia parliament brawl]</ref><ref>[https://ewn.co.za/2019/02/14/police-investigate-aussie-parliament-brawl Police investigate Aussie Parliament brawl]</ref>\n\n== Bolivia ==\n=== 27 October 2007 ===\nIn 2007 a fight broke out in the lower chamber of the national legislature of [[Bolivia]], [[Chamber of Deputies of Bolivia|the Chamber of Deputies]].

Moments before the confrontation, Luka\u010d warned Stanivukovi\u0107 to cease his provocations aimed at the government, warning him in the process that he's going to end up on the floor, just like the flags of NATO-pact which he presented inside of the assembly hall. Following his statement, Luka\u010d had asked Stanivukovi\u0107, who had by now been walking around the National Assembly hall carrying hand-held flags of the NATO-pact, to approach him. Stanivukovi\u0107 did so, and after brief exchange words, Luka\u010d hit him on the head with his right fist. The event was broadcast live on the [[Radio Televizija Republike Srpske|Radio Television of the Republic of Srpska]]. This happened in the wake of events where the Bosnian three-men presidency had unanimously agreed to sign the Reform Program, which is widely speculated to be the ANP agreement under disguise.

Keitt]] of South Carolina was involved in another incident of legislative violence less than two years later, starting a massive brawl on the House floor during a tense late-night debate. Keitt became offended when [[Pennsylvania]] Congressman (and later [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]) [[Galusha A. Grow]] stepped over to the Democratic side of the House chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech. Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a \"black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] puppy\". Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that \"No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me\". Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would \"choke him for that\". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. [[Cadwallader Washburn]] of [[Wisconsin]] upended the [[hairpiece]] of Rep. [[William Barksdale]] of [[Mississippi]]. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Filibuster | author=Allan L.

As Lovejoy gave his speech condemning the evils of slavery, several of the Democrats present in the audience, such as [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]], grew irate and incensed over Lovejoy's anti-slavery remarks and threatened him with physical harm, brandishing pistols and canes, with several Republicans rushing to Lovejoy's defense.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMEv8DNXVbIC&pg=PA193|title=His Brother's Blood: Speeches and Writings, 1838\u201364|first1=Owen|last1=Lovejoy|first2=William Frederick|last2=Moore|first3=Jane Ann|last3=Moore|first4=Paul|last4=Simon|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Illinois|chapter=Debate on Slavery, Conducted under Hostile Conditions in Congress, 5 April 1860|pages=191\u2013200|isbn=0-252-02919-4|date=2004}}</ref>\n\n=== 24 February 1887 ===\nThe [[Indiana General Assembly]] experienced [[Black Day of the Indiana General Assembly|a massive brawl]] between Democrats and Republicans in the [[Indiana Senate]] and [[Indiana House of Representatives]]. The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor [[Isaac P. Gray]] to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party's attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a [[midterm election]] for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the [[Indiana Statehouse]]. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the [[Indianapolis Police Department]] to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|elected by popular vote]].\n\n=== 20 February 1902 ===\nDuring a debate on a bill dealing with the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] accused Senator [[John L. McLaurin]] of South Carolina of \"treachery\" for siding with the Republicans in support of Philippine annexation, and alleged that McLaurin had been granted control of government patronage in South Carolina. Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On 28 February, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to [[Censure]] both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.\n\n=== 4 March 1985 ===\nOn the House of Representatives chamber floor, Democrat [[Thomas Downey]] of New York confronted [[Robert Dornan]], a California Republican, and Dornan grabbed Downey's tie in response. Downey approached Dornan in response to a speech Dornan had given two days earlier before the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], in which he called Downey a \"[[Draft evasion|draft-dodging]] wimp\" because of Downey's repeated denouncement of US-backed antigovernment [[Contras]] rebels in [[Nicaragua]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], Downey received a medical deferment from the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] because of a [[perforated eardrum]]. Downey had also been active in protesting the war. The Dornan-Downey beef originated two years earlier, when Downey spoke against Dornan's nomination for a position at the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/03/06/duel-on-the-hill/a66a3746-68c3-471a-8314-c9a30390dd46/|title=Duel on the Hill|last=Romano|first=Lois|date=1985-03-06|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Downey speech was made on Saturday, 2 March. On Monday afternoon, 4 March, Downey confronted Dornan, attracting dozens of viewers. Dornan claims Downey grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around, asking if he had actually called him a wimp. Dornan answered \"I did and you are.\" The exchange became heated, and at some point Dornan accused Downey of having cost him the job two years earlier. According to Downey, as he began to walk away, Dornan grabbed him by the tie and collar and threatened him with \"bodily harm.\" Dornan claimed he was just straightening Downey's tie knot, saying later, \"I like all the members to look elegant on the floor, you know.\" Dornan, according to himself and other witnesses, then told Downey to \"get out of my face.\" After, Downey went to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] to tell him what had happened.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the incident, Downey released a statement and stated through a spokesman that he would not speak to reporters \"until Dornan apologizes.\" His spokesman also said that Downey was considering filing a complaint with the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|House Sergeant at Arms]]. Several witnesses spoke about the incident. Democratic Congressman [[Mike Lowry]] said, \"Dornan grabbed Downey roughly by the collar, and I mean aggressively. None of this straighten-the-tie baloney. And he told Downey, 'Don't let me catch you off the floor, where you are protected by the sergeant at arms.' I really think Downey restrained himself.\" Republican Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] of New Jersey, who witnessed the altercation, said, \"I found it humorous that Downey had to run up to the Speaker when it was over to tell all. It was like a little classroom act . . . Very childish . . . I think he's made much to-do about nothing.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, \"You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor.\" He also told reporters that \"discipline\" would ensue if \"anything like that\" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, \"Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology.\" Dornan responded, \"Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 7 June 2007 ===\nDuring the final day of the 2007 regular session of the [[Alabama State Senate]] Republican Sen.

The senators, led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and calling themselves [[Liberatores]], had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the [[Theatre of Pompey]], they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their [[toga]]s, killing him. Caesar's assassination led to a [[civil war]] for control of the [[Roman Republic|republic]], ending ultimately with the rise of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] and the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n== Armenia ==\nLegislative violence has happened in Armenia.<ref>[https://news.am/eng/news/141650.html Fight breaks in Armenian parliament]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arminfo.info/full_news.php?id=27607&lang=3|title=Arminfo: Another fight occurred in the Armenian parliament: At this time RPA deputy Artashes Geghamyan and oppositionist Nikol Pashinyan met in hand-to-hand fight|website=www.arminfo.info|language=en|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref><ref>[https://www.rferl.org/a/armenia-female-legislator-attacked-brawl-sewage-smell-city-council/29037927.html Female Legislator Attacked In Brawl Over Yerevan Sewage Water ]</ref>\n\n== Australia ==\n===13 February 2019 ===\n[[Brian Burston]] and [[James Ashby]] have clashed in The Great Hall amid claims of sexual harassment.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/14/blood-on-the-door-24-hours-of-chaos-australian-politics Blood on the door: 24 hours of chaos in Australian politics]</ref><ref>[https://www.news24.com/World/News/police-investigate-australia-parliament-brawl-20190214 Police investigate Australia parliament brawl]</ref><ref>[https://ewn.co.za/2019/02/14/police-investigate-aussie-parliament-brawl Police investigate Aussie Parliament brawl]</ref>\n\n== Bolivia ==\n=== 27 October 2007 ===\nIn 2007 a fight broke out in the lower chamber of the national legislature of [[Bolivia]], [[Chamber of Deputies of Bolivia|the Chamber of Deputies]].

Griswold then tripped Lyon and struck him in the face while he lay on the ground, at which point the two were separated. After a break of several minutes, however, Lyon unexpectedly pursued Griswold again with the tongs, and the brawl was re-ignited.\n\nThe two men had a prior history of conflict. On 30 January of that year, Griswold had publicly insulted Lyon by calling him a coward, and Lyon had retaliated by spitting in Griswold's face.

After having consulted with fellow South Carolina Congressman [[Laurence Keitt]] on the situation, Brooks and Keitt decided that Sumner had the social status of a \"drunkard\" and was thus unworthy of the traditional challenge to a [[duelling|duel]]. Brooks (accompanied by Keitt), approached and confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks began beating Sumner severely on the head with a thick [[gutta-percha]] cane with a gold head before he could reach his feet. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to bash Sumner until he ripped the desk from the floor. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks continued to beat the motionless Sumner until he broke his cane, then quietly left the chamber. Several other senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who had jumped into the aisle, brandishing a pistol and shouting, \"Let them be!\"<ref>Donald, David Herbert ''Charles Sumner and the Coming Civil War'' New York: Alfred A.

Keitt became offended when [[Pennsylvania]] Congressman (and later [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]) [[Galusha A.

Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a \"black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] puppy\". Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that \"No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me\". Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would \"choke him for that\". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep.

The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor [[Isaac P. Gray]] to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party's attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a [[midterm election]] for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the [[Indiana Statehouse]]. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the [[Indianapolis Police Department]] to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|elected by popular vote]].\n\n=== 20 February 1902 ===\nDuring a debate on a bill dealing with the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] accused Senator [[John L.

Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On 28 February, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to [[Censure]] both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.\n\n=== 4 March 1985 ===\nOn the House of Representatives chamber floor, Democrat [[Thomas Downey]] of New York confronted [[Robert Dornan]], a California Republican, and Dornan grabbed Downey's tie in response. Downey approached Dornan in response to a speech Dornan had given two days earlier before the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], in which he called Downey a \"[[Draft evasion|draft-dodging]] wimp\" because of Downey's repeated denouncement of US-backed antigovernment [[Contras]] rebels in [[Nicaragua]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], Downey received a medical deferment from the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] because of a [[perforated eardrum]]. Downey had also been active in protesting the war. The Dornan-Downey beef originated two years earlier, when Downey spoke against Dornan's nomination for a position at the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/03/06/duel-on-the-hill/a66a3746-68c3-471a-8314-c9a30390dd46/|title=Duel on the Hill|last=Romano|first=Lois|date=1985-03-06|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe Downey speech was made on Saturday, 2 March. On Monday afternoon, 4 March, Downey confronted Dornan, attracting dozens of viewers. Dornan claims Downey grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around, asking if he had actually called him a wimp. Dornan answered \"I did and you are.\" The exchange became heated, and at some point Dornan accused Downey of having cost him the job two years earlier. According to Downey, as he began to walk away, Dornan grabbed him by the tie and collar and threatened him with \"bodily harm.\" Dornan claimed he was just straightening Downey's tie knot, saying later, \"I like all the members to look elegant on the floor, you know.\" Dornan, according to himself and other witnesses, then told Downey to \"get out of my face.\" After, Downey went to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] to tell him what had happened.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the incident, Downey released a statement and stated through a spokesman that he would not speak to reporters \"until Dornan apologizes.\" His spokesman also said that Downey was considering filing a complaint with the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|House Sergeant at Arms]]. Several witnesses spoke about the incident. Democratic Congressman [[Mike Lowry]] said, \"Dornan grabbed Downey roughly by the collar, and I mean aggressively. None of this straighten-the-tie baloney. And he told Downey, 'Don't let me catch you off the floor, where you are protected by the sergeant at arms.' I really think Downey restrained himself.\" Republican Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] of New Jersey, who witnessed the altercation, said, \"I found it humorous that Downey had to run up to the Speaker when it was over to tell all. It was like a little classroom act . . . Very childish . . . I think he's made much to-do about nothing.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, \"You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor.\" He also told reporters that \"discipline\" would ensue if \"anything like that\" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, \"Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology.\" Dornan responded, \"Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 7 June 2007 ===\nDuring the final day of the 2007 regular session of the [[Alabama State Senate]] Republican Sen.

Venturi did nonetheless manage to continue in production for nearly sixteen years, declaring bankruptcy in 2000. The same year, Monegasque [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] purchased Venturi, and decided to focus on electric-powered engines. This change of direction led to the limited-production [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]], the first electric sports car in the world. Following the public's enthusiasm for this first electric model, the brand developed 5 other innovative concept cars.\n\nThe first team to commit to the [[Formula E|Formula E World Championship]], Venturi competes under the name of [[Venturi Racing|ROKiT Venturi Racing]] with its drivers [[Felipe Massa]] and [[Edoardo Mortara]].\n\nToday, Venturi is specialised in the development of high performance electric vehicles destined to break records or to operate in extreme conditions. Through its [[Venturi Automobiles#Venturi Global Challenges|Venturi Global Challenges,]] Venturi aims at demonstrating the efficiency and durability of electric vehicles. \n\n== History ==\n\n=== From 1984 to 2000 ===\n[[Image:Venturi 300 Atlantique 3.4 front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venturi Atlantique|Venturi 300 Atlantique]]]]\nThe first Venturi came out in 1984, created by Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy, two former engineers at [[Heuliez]]. The goal was to present the only \"[[grand tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" French car capable of competing with the English [[Aston Martin]], the Italian [[Ferrari]], and the German [[Porsche]]. The first car shown had a [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTi engine and the name was originally spelled \"Ventury\", with a \"y\" at the end. In 1985, the car was shown with a {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Peugeot 505]] Turbo engine, but by the 1986 [[Paris Motor Show]] it had reached its definitive form with the [[PRV engine|PRV V6]] engine. Production began in 1987, with five cars built in the first year with production increasing in the subsequent years. The headquarters of the company was located in [[Cou\u00ebron]], [[Pays de Loire]], where almost 750 cars were produced in the forthcoming 20 years.\n\n[[File:Venturi 260 LM, \u00be front.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 260 LM]]\nFrom 1987 to the mid-1990s, they built mid-engined [[coup\u00e9s]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]] with [[turbocharged]] [[PRV engine]]s and [[Renault]] [[gearboxes]]. Engine power ranged from {{convert|200|to|260|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the then offered MVS Venturi Coup\u00e9 and Transcup series. The naturally aspirated Venturi 160 used the catalyzed 2849&nbsp;cc version of the PRV V6; this was meant to be sold in Japan and was therefore also available with an automatic transmsission. Only a handful were built. There was also the {{convert|185|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Venturi 180, mainly developed for Italy, which used the turbocharged 1995-cc inline-four [[Douvrin engine]] from the [[Renault 21#Turbo|Renault 21 Turbo]].\n\nVenturi was also briefly involved with the [[Larrousse]] [[Formula One]] team. The team's 1992 car, which bore the Venturi name, was designed and built by Venturi Larousse UK, a British company formerly known as Fomet 1, which had previously designed the 1991 [[Fondmetal]] Formula One cars.<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Autocourse: the World's Leading Grand Prix Annual 1992-93 | publisher = Motorbooks Intl | page=83 | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-905138-96-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:Venturi 400GT S\u00e9rie 2 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi 400 GT rear view]]\n[[File:Venturi_400_GT_Red.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 400 GT]]\nThe Venturi 400 GT remains one of the highest performing French cars ever produced, and it is in fact the very first car in the world to have standard carbon brakes.<ref name=collector04>{{cite web | url = http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/400gt.php | title = Guide d'achat: Venturi 400-GT | trans-title = Buyers' Guide | publisher = l'Automobile Sportive | first = Nicolas | last = Liszewski | language = French | date = 2004-12-23 |accessdate = 7 March 2018}}</ref> True to that claim, the Atlantique 400 GT with a {{cvt|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valve]]s per cylinder [[twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|300|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] with a [[compression ratio]] of 7.3:1, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1995-venturi-400gt/|website=supercars.net|title=1995 Venturi 400GT|editor=NIck D|date=December 20, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> delivered excellent performance to put it on par with Ferraris of the early 90s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The 400 GT could hit {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and {{convert|291|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed, while the [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]] with a {{convert|310|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 could accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and could reach a top speed of {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/atlantique300.php|website=automobile-sportive.com|title=VENTURI ATLANTIQUE-300 (1996 - 2000)|editor=S\u00e9bastien Dupuis|language=fr-fr|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venturi Transcup 210.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi Transcup 210]]\nA limited-edition 400 GTR was built to satisfy the [[homologation]] requirements to compete [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].

St\u00e9phane Ratel, who would later found the [[FIA GT Championship]], was at the origin of the Venturi Gentlemen Drivers Trophy, which gathered an impressive array of 75 drivers. Venturi has also won fame through its brilliant performances in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], particularly in 1993 with [[Christophe Dechavanne]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] on Venturi Jaccadi team, and in 1995 with [[Paul Belmondo]] racing on the 600 SLM.\n\nHowever, it was in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] races that Venturi established its pedigree defeating Porsche and Ferrari on several occasions. In 1994 in [[Dijon-Prenois]], with Fert\u00e9 and Neugarten on the 600 LM Jaccadi, at the 1000&nbsp;km of Paris with [[Henri Pescarolo]] and Jean-Claude Basso on the 600 LM, and finally at the 4 Hours Spa race, once again with Michel Fert\u00e9 and Michel Neugarten.\n\n=== From 2000 to the present day ===\n\n[[Image:Stand Venturi Mondial 2006.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Venturi F\u00e9tish]] at the 2006 [[Paris Motor Show]]]]\n\nIn 2000, the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] millionaire [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] bought Venturi and decided to focus on electric-powered engines,<ref>https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/made-in-monaco/made-in-monaco-venturi-automobiles-experts-in-the-most-advanced-technologies/</ref> leading to the [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]] model.

There have been approximately 60-65 orders for the F\u00e9tish, but only about 30 have been delivered as of 2011.\n\nIn December 2009, Venturi announced its acquisition of French motorcycle manufacturer [[Voxan]]. The acquisition would effectively allow Venturi to enter the motorcycle market. In August 2011, Venturi announced the creation of Venturi North America, based in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Venturi North America was primarily created as a research and development center, and as such, maintains a close working relationship with the Center for Automotive Research.\n\n<br />\n\n== Venturi Global Challenges ==\nVenturi has launched a series of technological and human challenges aimed at demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of electric vehicles in extreme conditions.

Founded in 1984 by French engineers Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy as ''MVS (Manufacture de Voitures de Sport)'', the company's purpose was to compete in the \"[[Grand Tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" market. This was only the most recent post-war attempt at building a sporty luxury car in France, following in the footsteps of [[Facel Vega]], [[Monica (automobile)|Monica]], and [[Ligier]].<ref name=\"Retroviseur302\">{{cite journal | journal = R\u00e9troviseur | title = Requiem pour un nom | trans-title = Requiem for a name | language = French | last = Decker | first = Jean-Paul | page = 70 | ref = XCrv |date= July 2014 | number = 302 | publisher = \u00c9ditions LVA | location = Fontainebleu, France | issn = 0992-5007 }}</ref> As with its predecessors, Venturi was immediately faced with many challenges ranging from an unknown name to its under-capitalized and under-staffed state. Venturi did nonetheless manage to continue in production for nearly sixteen years, declaring bankruptcy in 2000. The same year, Monegasque [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] purchased Venturi, and decided to focus on electric-powered engines. This change of direction led to the limited-production [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]], the first electric sports car in the world. Following the public's enthusiasm for this first electric model, the brand developed 5 other innovative concept cars.\n\nThe first team to commit to the [[Formula E|Formula E World Championship]], Venturi competes under the name of [[Venturi Racing|ROKiT Venturi Racing]] with its drivers [[Felipe Massa]] and [[Edoardo Mortara]].\n\nToday, Venturi is specialised in the development of high performance electric vehicles destined to break records or to operate in extreme conditions. Through its [[Venturi Automobiles#Venturi Global Challenges|Venturi Global Challenges,]] Venturi aims at demonstrating the efficiency and durability of electric vehicles. \n\n== History ==\n\n=== From 1984 to 2000 ===\n[[Image:Venturi 300 Atlantique 3.4 front.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venturi Atlantique|Venturi 300 Atlantique]]]]\nThe first Venturi came out in 1984, created by Claude Poiraud and G\u00e9rard Godfroy, two former engineers at [[Heuliez]]. The goal was to present the only \"[[grand tourer|Grand Tourisme]]\" French car capable of competing with the English [[Aston Martin]], the Italian [[Ferrari]], and the German [[Porsche]]. The first car shown had a [[Volkswagen Golf]] GTi engine and the name was originally spelled \"Ventury\", with a \"y\" at the end. In 1985, the car was shown with a {{convert|200|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Peugeot 505]] Turbo engine, but by the 1986 [[Paris Motor Show]] it had reached its definitive form with the [[PRV engine|PRV V6]] engine. Production began in 1987, with five cars built in the first year with production increasing in the subsequent years. The headquarters of the company was located in [[Cou\u00ebron]], [[Pays de Loire]], where almost 750 cars were produced in the forthcoming 20 years.\n\n[[File:Venturi 260 LM, \u00be front.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 260 LM]]\nFrom 1987 to the mid-1990s, they built mid-engined [[coup\u00e9s]] and [[Roadster (automobile)|roadsters]] with [[turbocharged]] [[PRV engine]]s and [[Renault]] [[gearboxes]]. Engine power ranged from {{convert|200|to|260|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the then offered MVS Venturi Coup\u00e9 and Transcup series. The naturally aspirated Venturi 160 used the catalyzed 2849&nbsp;cc version of the PRV V6; this was meant to be sold in Japan and was therefore also available with an automatic transmsission. Only a handful were built. There was also the {{convert|185|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} Venturi 180, mainly developed for Italy, which used the turbocharged 1995-cc inline-four [[Douvrin engine]] from the [[Renault 21#Turbo|Renault 21 Turbo]].\n\nVenturi was also briefly involved with the [[Larrousse]] [[Formula One]] team. The team's 1992 car, which bore the Venturi name, was designed and built by Venturi Larousse UK, a British company formerly known as Fomet 1, which had previously designed the 1991 [[Fondmetal]] Formula One cars.<ref>{{cite book | last = Henry | first = Alan | title = Autocourse: the World's Leading Grand Prix Annual 1992-93 | publisher = Motorbooks Intl | page=83 | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-905138-96-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:Venturi 400GT S\u00e9rie 2 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi 400 GT rear view]]\n[[File:Venturi_400_GT_Red.jpg|thumb|right|Venturi 400 GT]]\nThe Venturi 400 GT remains one of the highest performing French cars ever produced, and it is in fact the very first car in the world to have standard carbon brakes.<ref name=collector04>{{cite web | url = http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/400gt.php | title = Guide d'achat: Venturi 400-GT | trans-title = Buyers' Guide | publisher = l'Automobile Sportive | first = Nicolas | last = Liszewski | language = French | date = 2004-12-23 |accessdate = 7 March 2018}}</ref> True to that claim, the Atlantique 400 GT with a {{cvt|2975|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Multi-valve#Four-valve cylinder head|4 valve]]s per cylinder [[twin-turbo]] [[V6 engine]] rated at {{convert|300|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and {{convert|520|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]] with a [[compression ratio]] of 7.3:1, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supercars.net/blog/1995-venturi-400gt/|website=supercars.net|title=1995 Venturi 400GT|editor=NIck D|date=December 20, 2015|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> delivered excellent performance to put it on par with Ferraris of the early 90s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The 400 GT could hit {{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and {{convert|291|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} top speed, while the [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]] with a {{convert|310|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 could accelerate from 0-{{convert|100|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} in 4.7 seconds and could reach a top speed of {{convert|275|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}}. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-sportive.com/guide/venturi/atlantique300.php|website=automobile-sportive.com|title=VENTURI ATLANTIQUE-300 (1996 - 2000)|editor=S\u00e9bastien Dupuis|language=fr-fr|accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Venturi Transcup 210.jpg|thumb|left|Venturi Transcup 210]]\nA limited-edition 400 GTR was built to satisfy the [[homologation]] requirements to compete [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]. High-level competition has also brought fame to the brand. St\u00e9phane Ratel, who would later found the [[FIA GT Championship]], was at the origin of the Venturi Gentlemen Drivers Trophy, which gathered an impressive array of 75 drivers. Venturi has also won fame through its brilliant performances in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], particularly in 1993 with [[Christophe Dechavanne]] and [[Jacques Laffite]] on Venturi Jaccadi team, and in 1995 with [[Paul Belmondo]] racing on the 600 SLM.\n\nHowever, it was in the [[BPR Global GT Series]] races that Venturi established its pedigree defeating Porsche and Ferrari on several occasions. In 1994 in [[Dijon-Prenois]], with Fert\u00e9 and Neugarten on the 600 LM Jaccadi, at the 1000&nbsp;km of Paris with [[Henri Pescarolo]] and Jean-Claude Basso on the 600 LM, and finally at the 4 Hours Spa race, once again with Michel Fert\u00e9 and Michel Neugarten.\n\n=== From 2000 to the present day ===\n\n[[Image:Stand Venturi Mondial 2006.jpg|thumb|240x240px|[[Venturi F\u00e9tish]] at the 2006 [[Paris Motor Show]]]]\n\nIn 2000, the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] millionaire [[Gildo Pallanca Pastor]] bought Venturi and decided to focus on electric-powered engines,<ref>https://www.hellomonaco.com/sightseeing/made-in-monaco/made-in-monaco-venturi-automobiles-experts-in-the-most-advanced-technologies/</ref> leading to the [[Venturi F\u00e9tish|F\u00e9tish]] model. More recent models are the [[Venturi Eclectic|Eclectic]], the world's first energy-autonomous vehicle, a low speed vehicle that has solar panels and a built-in wind charger and can be plugged in; and the [[Venturi Astrolab|Astrolab]], the world's first solar-electric hybrid car. There have been approximately 60-65 orders for the F\u00e9tish, but only about 30 have been delivered as of 2011.\n\nIn December 2009, Venturi announced its acquisition of French motorcycle manufacturer [[Voxan]]. The acquisition would effectively allow Venturi to enter the motorcycle market. In August 2011, Venturi announced the creation of Venturi North America, based in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Venturi North America was primarily created as a research and development center, and as such, maintains a close working relationship with the Center for Automotive Research.\n\n<br />\n\n== Venturi Global Challenges ==\nVenturi has launched a series of technological and human challenges aimed at demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of electric vehicles in extreme conditions. With its Global Challenges, the manufacturer is testing the technologies it develops in extraordinary conditions: excessive speeds, extreme weather conditions, difficult terrain in the most remote regions of the planet... As part of these challenges, Venturi has obtained several records and world firsts since 2009.\n\n== List of models ==\n\n* [[MVS Venturi]] (includes Coup\u00e9 and Cabriolet versions)\n\n::1987-1990 &ndash; Coup\u00e9 160 automatic, Transcup, Transcup automatic (six built)\n::1987-1990 &ndash; Coup\u00e9 200, Transcup\n::1991 &ndash; Coup\u00e9 210, Transcup\n::1992 &ndash;Coup\u00e8 111 Cup<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amblog.it/2019/12/05/venturi-111-cup-lauto-fantasma/|title=Venturi 111 Cup, l'auto fantasma|last=Andrea|website=AMblog|language=it-IT|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> (2-liter, four-cylinder export model, mainly for Italy)\n::1989-1996 &ndash; Coup\u00e9 260, Transcup (sold as the MVS 2.80 in 1989)\n::1991 &ndash; 260 Atlantique\n::1994-1996 &ndash; 260 LM\n::Trophy - 73 built for racing, ten later converted for street use by the factory<ref name=collector04/>\n[[File:VenturiConcept1.JPG|thumb|Venturi Eclectic]]\n*1994-1997 &ndash; 400 GT (15 built, 13 series 1 and two series 2)<ref name=collector04/>\n* [[Venturi Atlantique]] (rework of the MVS Venturi)\n::1996-1998 &ndash; [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300|Atlantique 300]]\n::1999-2000 &ndash; [[Venturi Atlantique#Atlantique 300 Biturbo|Atlantique 300 Biturbo]]\n::1999 &ndash; [[Venturi Atlantique#Venturi 300 GTR|Venturi 300 GTR]]\n* 500 LM - a limited number (~7) were produced and raced at Le Mans, Jarama and Zolder in 1993\n* 600 LM - further racing cars were produced later in 1993 with the newer engine<ref>[https://www.supercars.net/blog/1993-venturi-600-lm/ 1993 Venturi 600 LM] at supercars.net, accessed 29 March 2018</ref><ref>[https://columnm.com/venturi-lm600-supercar-lemans-country/ Abishek Dwaraknath, 4 July 2017 ''venture lm600 supercar lemans country''] at columnm.com, accessed 29 March 2018</ref>\n* 600 SLM - single example built in 1995, but other cars (originally 600 LM models) have been modified to similar specifications.

The asylum seekers have in many cases had their applications to remain in the Netherlands denied but they either cannot go back or refuse to return to their country of origin. They ask for access to social services such as medical care and housing.\n\nThe group is constantly in flux as a result of individually precarious legal situations. Since its members refuse to use the [[homeless shelter]]s offered by the city of Amsterdam, which can only be used from 5 pm until 9 am, the collective has [[Squatting|squatted]] a chain of buildings in and around the city since 2012. Most buildings are quickly evicted, some have led to offshoot projects. The group is mostly composed of men originally from Africa, although there have also been women only occupations. There have been some successes, such as the Vluchtmaat, where a longterm deal was negotiated with the owner, and some longterm squats such as the Vluchtgarage, where [[Amsterdam city council]] tolerated the occupation. As of 2017, roughly one hundred people from the group had gained Dutch residence permits.\n\nBy 2018, the new council had pledged to set up 24 hour shelters for up to 500 undocumented migrants, but We Are Here stated it was against the shelters since they were only for a short time period and it disputed the plan to send asylum seekers back to their country of origin at the end of the project. The collective by this point had diversified into different subgroups occupying different buildings, such as a women-only group, a [[Swahili language]] group, and a group composed of people mainly from [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Sudan]].\n\n== Background ==\nRefugees seeking asylum in the Netherlands are assessed by the [[Immigration and Naturalisation Service (Netherlands)|Immigration and Naturalisation Service]] and then either gain residency or fail to do so, based on their documentary evidence. For some who have fled warzones, it is difficult to provide documents or other proof for their claim. If the refugees fail to be granted asylum, they are given temporary housing and have 28 days to leave. Some people fall into \"the asylum gap\" since they are unable to return to their country of origin, whilst others want to go back but cannot because they do not possess the required visas or identity documents. In 2016, it was estimated there were 35,000 undocumented migrants in the Netherlands. Without a residence permit they are denied access to social services such as healthcare and housing.<ref name=\"Limbo\">{{cite news |last1=Merks |first1=Kelly |title=Life in Limbo in the Netherlands |url=https://access-nl.org/features/life-in-limbo-in-nl/ |accessdate=11 July 2019 |work=Access Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711164915/https://access-nl.org/features/life-in-limbo-in-nl/ |archivedate=11 July 2019 |language=EN}}</ref><ref name=\"Brechtje\">{{cite news |last1=Keulen |first1=Brechtje |title=\u2018Wij zijn allemaal moe\u2019 |url=https://www.groene.nl/artikel/wij-zijn-allemaal-moe|accessdate=12 July 2019 |work=Groene Amsterdammer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712153050/https://www.groene.nl/artikel/wij-zijn-allemaal-moe |archivedate=12 July 2019 |language=NL}}</ref>\n\nThe migrants of the We Are Here [[collective]] had by the end of 2017 occupied over 30 buildings and parks.<ref name=\"Koops\">{{cite news |last1=Wolthuizen |first1=Josien |last2=Koops |first2=Ruben |title=We Are Here: Vijf jaar later nog geen stap verder |url=https://www.parool.nl/nieuws/we-are-here-vijf-jaar-later-nog-geen-stap-verder~bdbdf167/ |accessdate=10 May 2019 |work=Parool |date=1 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510200206/https://www.parool.nl/nieuws/we-are-here-vijf-jaar-later-nog-geen-stap-verder~bdbdf167/ |archive-date=10 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> They argue that they should have access to basic needs such as housing and healthcare. The city council of Amsterdam refuses to accede to their demands.

The migrants reject this offer as insufficient and say it is in any case often over-subscribed.<ref name=\"Koops\" /> The city council in turn says that its hands are tied by the policy of the [[Dutch Government]].<ref name=\"Karman-1\">{{cite news |last1=Karman |first1=Jasper |title=Havenstraat biedt iedereen hoop |url=https://www.parool.nl/nieuws/havenstraat-biedt-iedereen-hoop~bbfc9f3d/ |accessdate=5 July 2019 |work=Parool |date=6 December 2013 |language=NL |quote=Dat tot frustratie van de burgemeester en de gemeenteraad, die allebei graag meer wilden doen, maar moesten blijven herhalen dat niet Amsterdam, maar Den Haag over het asielbeleid gaat en dat de stad geen asielzoekers m\u00e1g opvangen. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705210244/https://www.parool.nl/nieuws/havenstraat-biedt-iedereen-hoop~bbfc9f3d/ |archive-date=5 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Therefore, We Are Here have chosen to [[Squatting|squat]] a number of buildings to live in.

The asylum seekers have in many cases had their applications to remain in the Netherlands denied but they either cannot go back or refuse to return to their country of origin. They ask for access to social services such as medical care and housing.\n\nThe group is constantly in flux as a result of individually precarious legal situations. Since its members refuse to use the [[homeless shelter]]s offered by the city of Amsterdam, which can only be used from 5 pm until 9 am, the collective has [[Squatting|squatted]] a chain of buildings in and around the city since 2012. Most buildings are quickly evicted, some have led to offshoot projects. The group is mostly composed of men originally from Africa, although there have also been women only occupations. There have been some successes, such as the Vluchtmaat, where a longterm deal was negotiated with the owner, and some longterm squats such as the Vluchtgarage, where [[Amsterdam city council]] tolerated the occupation. As of 2017, roughly one hundred people from the group had gained Dutch residence permits.\n\nBy 2018, the new council had pledged to set up 24 hour shelters for up to 500 undocumented migrants, but We Are Here stated it was against the shelters since they were only for a short time period and it disputed the plan to send asylum seekers back to their country of origin at the end of the project. The collective by this point had diversified into different subgroups occupying different buildings, such as a women-only group, a [[Swahili language]] group, and a group composed of people mainly from [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Sudan]].\n\n== Background ==\nRefugees seeking asylum in the Netherlands are assessed by the [[Immigration and Naturalisation Service (Netherlands)|Immigration and Naturalisation Service]] and then either gain residency or fail to do so, based on their documentary evidence. For some who have fled warzones, it is difficult to provide documents or other proof for their claim. If the refugees fail to be granted asylum, they are given temporary housing and have 28 days to leave. Some people fall into \"the asylum gap\" since they are unable to return to their country of origin, whilst others want to go back but cannot because they do not possess the required visas or identity documents. In 2016, it was estimated there were 35,000 undocumented migrants in the Netherlands. Without a residence permit they are denied access to social services such as healthcare and housing.<ref name=\"Limbo\">{{cite news |last1=Merks |first1=Kelly |title=Life in Limbo in the Netherlands |url=https://access-nl.org/features/life-in-limbo-in-nl/ |accessdate=11 July 2019 |work=Access Magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711164915/https://access-nl.org/features/life-in-limbo-in-nl/ |archivedate=11 July 2019 |language=EN}}</ref><ref name=\"Brechtje\">{{cite news |last1=Keulen |first1=Brechtje |title=\u2018Wij zijn allemaal moe\u2019 |url=https://www.groene.nl/artikel/wij-zijn-allemaal-moe|accessdate=12 July 2019 |work=Groene Amsterdammer |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190712153050/https://www.groene.nl/artikel/wij-zijn-allemaal-moe |archivedate=12 July 2019 |language=NL}}</ref>\n\nThe migrants of the We Are Here [[collective]] had by the end of 2017 occupied over 30 buildings and parks.<ref name=\"Koops\">{{cite news |last1=Wolthuizen |first1=Josien |last2=Koops |first2=Ruben |title=We Are Here: Vijf jaar later nog geen stap verder |url=https://www.parool.nl/nieuws/we-are-here-vijf-jaar-later-nog-geen-stap-verder~bdbdf167/ |accessdate=10 May 2019 |work=Parool |date=1 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190510200206/https://www.parool.nl/nieuws/we-are-here-vijf-jaar-later-nog-geen-stap-verder~bdbdf167/ |archive-date=10 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> They argue that they should have access to basic needs such as housing and healthcare.

Spencer's biggest rival is her older sister, Melissa, and the two are constantly fighting over something. Their relationship is often strained by the fact that Spencer has a habit of crushing on Melissa's boyfriends. In the first season, she begins a relationship with fellow student and strained Rosewood student Toby Cavanaugh. Throughout the series, Spencer is revealed to be the biological daughter of Mary Drake and the sister of Charlotte Drake.\n\n===Aria Montgomery===\n{{main|Aria Montgomery}}\nConsidered the \"alternative\" one of the group, '''Aria Montgomery''', portrayed by [[Lucy Hale]], is more outgoing in fashion and what she sees as acceptable behavior. She moves back to Rosewood with her family after living in Iceland for a year. Before Alison's death, she and Alison discovered that Aria's father was having an affair with one of his former students, Meredith, who became his coworker at Hollis College. Alison encourages Aria to tell her mother the truth, but instead, Aria reluctantly agrees to keep her father's secret. On top of that, she finds herself involved with her high school English teacher, Ezra Fitz, after making out with him in a pub bathroom and discovering he was her English teacher on the first day of school.\n\n===Hanna Marin===\n{{main|Hanna Marin}}\nPretty and fierce, '''Hanna Marin''', portrayed by [[Ashley Benson]], is the diva and \"[[it girl]]\" of the group, having taken Alison's place as the most popular girl at Rosewood High. Prior to Alison's death, Hanna suffered from [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], which Alison frequently teased her over. Since her parents divorced, Hanna permanently lives with her mother. She feels betrayed by her father, who has remarried, and she does not get along well with his new wife and daughter. When Hanna's mother falls upon financial hardship, she steals thousands of dollars from the bank she worked at, which Hanna is forced to keep a secret.\n\n===Emily Fields===\n{{main|Emily Fields}}\nThe \"[[Jock (athlete)|jock]]\" of the group, '''Emily Fields''', portrayed by [[Shay Mitchell]], is a highly competitive swimmer, considered the star of Rosewood's swimming team. She is shown as a sweet and shy young. For a short time, Emily lives with Hanna, after her mother moves to Texas to live with Emily's father, who is stationed in Fort Hood. She begins to question her sexuality because of her feeling for Alison, but later accepts the fact that she is a lesbian and starts to date girls. She eventually begins a relationship with Sara Harvey, until she discovers that she is an ally of the antagonist.\n\n===Alison DiLaurentis===\n{{main|Alison DiLaurentis}}\nThe former \"[[Queen bee (sociology)|queen bee]]\" of her clique, '''Alison DiLaurentis''', portrayed by [[Sasha Pieterse]], used to be the most popular girl in school before her disappearance and alleged death. Although she cared for her friends, she enjoyed using their deepest secrets against them to keep them in line. Charming and manipulative, Alison was skilled at finding ways to blackmail everyone, and many people hated her. She knew everybody's secrets, but since she's been gone her friends are beginning to realize how little they really knew about her. She is revealed to be alive and on the run from \"A.\"\n\n===Mona Vanderwaal===\n{{main|Mona Vanderwaal}}\nA former \"unpopular\" girl at Rosewood, '''Mona Vanderwaal''', portrayed by [[Janel Parrish]], longed to be accepted into Alison's group and was continuously mocked by her. After Alison's disappearance, Mona befriended Hanna and they underwent an \"extreme makeover\" together; as a result, they both became popular students. When \"A\" appears, Mona becomes jealous of Hanna rekindling her friendships with the other Liars. She dislikes Caleb and makes attempts to break Hanna and Caleb up, though to no avail. She becomes romantically involved with Noel, much to Hanna's disapproval, but is later dumped by him for Jenna. When \"A\" begins sending Mona threatening notes, she grows closer to the Liars. In the second-season finale, she is in fact revealed to actually be \"A\" when she and Spencer travel to the Lost Woods Resort to uncover \"A\"'s lair. She is committed to a mental institution, Radley, after being diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]].\n\n===\"A\"{{anchor|A|A.D.|Uber A}}===\n{{main|A (Pretty Little Liars)}}\nThe main [[antagonist]], \"'''A'''\" is stalking and torturing the Liars in relentless and creative ways and also threatens their friends and family. In the second-season finale, it is revealed that Mona is \"A\". She is also the one who stalked Alison before her disappearance. However, when she is sent to Radley sanitarium, she is visited by CeCe Drake, who offers her a partnership and takes over the team of \"A's\", known as the A-Team. The team consists of Mona, Toby, Spencer, Sara, Lucas, Melissa, Wilden, Jenna, Noel, and Wren. Five years later, Alex Drake takes over and becomes Uber A, known as \"A.D.\", and forms the A.D.

Ella was unaware of her husband's affair with a student until \"A\" sent her a letter. After asking Byron to move out, and his refusal, she left the home. Eventually, Aria found out her parents were secretly getting back together, and Ella decides to move back in. When her son, Mike, is depressed, she doesn't feel he needs medication, and remains somewhat in denial about his illness. She finally receives her wake-up call when he attacks her in his bedroom. When Ella found out Aria was dating Ezra, she was angry, but she believed Aria when she said she had broken it off, and tried to win her back her freedom, which Byron didn't think she deserved. Later, she finds out that Aria and Ezra are still together, and decides she is going to try to understand their relationship. Ella is aware of A, and tries to send Aria to a boarding school to get away. Aria is furious, and blackmails her mother into not going through with it. Ella tearfully tells Aria how ashamed she is, and how she doesn't know how to save their relationship. In season 3, she and Byron have divorced and Ella tries to move on with her life not knowing how. Aria creates a profile for her on a dating website under the nickname \"Hot Mamma.\" Ella is furious at Aria but later she likes the idea and starts dating again.

After spending some time apart, Ella and Byron slowly begin to rebuild their relationship. When Mike becomes depressed, Byron reveals that his brother Scott, who committed suicide, also suffered from mental illness; Byron feels guilty for not doing anything to help his brother. Byron finds out that Ezra is involved in a relationship with Aria after they tell him and Ella and is furious about it. In an effort to get Ezra away from Aria, Byron recommends him for a job in New Orleans. He also plots to send Aria to an all girls boarding school in Vermont.

A lacrosse player, he suffers from a mental illness, which causes him to burst into fits of anger and later leads him to break into people's houses for fun, before he begins to shut down emotionally and withdraw completely from his family. He blames Aria for the trouble between their parents. Mike accidentally discovered that Jenna and Garrett knew each other when he stole a pot made Jenna from Garrett's house. Mike reveals to Aria that the only reason he punched Ezra was because after Ezra and Aria announced they are a couple, he feared what Byron would have done to hurt Ezra judging by the look on his face and thought, \"better I do it, than him.\" Throughout the rest of the series he appears to have improved after going to a therapist. It does not tell when or if he was still seeing his therapist. He seemed to forgive Aria and their relationship is better. He stopped being rebellious and more focused of his family's problems and helping them out.

We later find out that his secret is more serious than it seemed at first when he accidentally reveals a very large bruise on his stomach, but he tells Aria not to worry about it. He eventually tells her that he is doing Tae Kwan Do, a Korean martial art, and that his parents forbid him to keep training, that is why he needs a cover. The situation turns out to be more complicated, though, when Ella tells Aria that Holden has a heart condition that could kill him any time.

When he discovered that Aria was his student, he attempted to break things off, but found himself unable to do so. He broke up with Aria for a little while in order to take time to think about their relationship. He quit his teaching position at Rosewood just before Noel threatened to expose Aria and Ezra's relationship. Ezra later explains to Aria that he was engaged to a girl named Jackie when he was in college, but that she broke it off; Jackie later returns to Rosewood after getting a teaching position at Hollis. Although Ezra loves Aria, he seems to still have some lingering feelings for Jackie, and the two remain close. His relationship with Aria is often strained by the fact that they have to hide that they are together. He confesses to Ella that he loves Aria (though she misunderstands and believes he is talking about Spencer) when he comes to comfort Aria after her arrest. In \"Through Many Danger, Toils, and Snares\" we find out that Aria broke up with Ezra because of Jackie threatening to expose their relationship but they later get back together after Aria explains to Ezra that Jackie was the reason why she broke up with him. Ezra and Aria later tell Byron and Ella that they are a couple which leads him to getting punched by Mike (though it's told he only did it fearing what Byron what would have done instead). Ezra later tells Jackie, who comes into his office trying to convince him it'll never work out for him and Aria due to age difference and the fact she's still a teenager, to get out of his office, saying he will not let her do anything to harm or hurt Aria ever again and that he wants nothing more to do with Jackie herself. Aria continues to attempt to convince her parents to allow her to date Ezra but in the meantime they try to set her up with someone else. When Aria calls Ezra, he tells her not to call him again. The two later rekindle their relationship when Aria leaves him a voice mail telling Ezra that, if he doesn't meet up with her, their relationship is over for good. Ezra turns up at the last minute after a student tells him to 'be bold' and the two kiss in the rain. Aria decides not to tell her friends that the two are back together, hoping that, by keeping it from them, she can also keep it from \"A\". They later have sex in his apartment after Ezra finds out that he has been fired from Hollis. In season 3, Aria and Ezra celebrate their one-year anniversary. Their relationship seems to be going smoothly until Ezra's younger brother Wesley \"Wes\" drops by unexpectedly. Bumps are soon formed in their relationship when Aria learns of Ezra getting his high school girlfriend Maggie pregnant and his mother paying her to disappear from his life, even though he wanted to do the right thing. Aria tracks Maggie down and discovers that she kept the baby, who is now a healthy 7-year-old boy named Malcolm, whom Ezra finds out about from a distraught Spencer. This leads him to leave Rosewood and seek out Maggie and his son; Ezra is back in Rosewood but only one day after he's back he gets a phone call from Maggie; Mrs. Fitzgerald sold Maggie's condo. Maggie asked Ezra if she and Malcolm can stay in Rosewood near him for a couple of days. Later when Spencer is part of the A-team, she picks up Malcolm from his karate class but is actually kidnapping him. Aria frantically tries to find him and when she does he tells her that Aria's friend Alison picked him up. Ezra gets a job at Rosewood High as a substitute teacher. After all the incidents with Malcolm, Aria decides that it is best that her and Ezra break up just after kissing him on the school stairs. In season four Ezra starts teaching full-time at Rosewood High again. After Aria has a dream that Ezra got arrested because of her she decided they should see other people, something Ezra had already suggested. Ezra would still do anything for Aria, as whenever she is having trouble he still steps up to help her. Ezra finds out Malcolm isn't really his son. In the season four summer finale, the Liars find a lair that they believe belongs to \"A\" and we see that Ezra is the owner, leading fans to believe him to be \"A\". However, he reveals in \"Free Fall\" that he is writing a book about Alison. He is also Board Shorts but is not the guy Alison met with at Cape May known as \"Beach Hottie\".

Spencer's biggest rival is her older sister, Melissa, and the two are constantly fighting over something. Their relationship is often strained by the fact that Spencer has a habit of crushing on Melissa's boyfriends. In the first season, she begins a relationship with fellow student and strained Rosewood student Toby Cavanaugh. Throughout the series, Spencer is revealed to be the biological daughter of Mary Drake and the sister of Charlotte Drake.\n\n===Aria Montgomery===\n{{main|Aria Montgomery}}\nConsidered the \"alternative\" one of the group, '''Aria Montgomery''', portrayed by [[Lucy Hale]], is more outgoing in fashion and what she sees as acceptable behavior. She moves back to Rosewood with her family after living in Iceland for a year. Before Alison's death, she and Alison discovered that Aria's father was having an affair with one of his former students, Meredith, who became his coworker at Hollis College. Alison encourages Aria to tell her mother the truth, but instead, Aria reluctantly agrees to keep her father's secret. On top of that, she finds herself involved with her high school English teacher, Ezra Fitz, after making out with him in a pub bathroom and discovering he was her English teacher on the first day of school.\n\n===Hanna Marin===\n{{main|Hanna Marin}}\nPretty and fierce, '''Hanna Marin''', portrayed by [[Ashley Benson]], is the diva and \"[[it girl]]\" of the group, having taken Alison's place as the most popular girl at Rosewood High. Prior to Alison's death, Hanna suffered from [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], which Alison frequently teased her over. Since her parents divorced, Hanna permanently lives with her mother. She feels betrayed by her father, who has remarried, and she does not get along well with his new wife and daughter. When Hanna's mother falls upon financial hardship, she steals thousands of dollars from the bank she worked at, which Hanna is forced to keep a secret.\n\n===Emily Fields===\n{{main|Emily Fields}}\nThe \"[[Jock (athlete)|jock]]\" of the group, '''Emily Fields''', portrayed by [[Shay Mitchell]], is a highly competitive swimmer, considered the star of Rosewood's swimming team. She is shown as a sweet and shy young. For a short time, Emily lives with Hanna, after her mother moves to Texas to live with Emily's father, who is stationed in Fort Hood. She begins to question her sexuality because of her feeling for Alison, but later accepts the fact that she is a lesbian and starts to date girls. She eventually begins a relationship with Sara Harvey, until she discovers that she is an ally of the antagonist.\n\n===Alison DiLaurentis===\n{{main|Alison DiLaurentis}}\nThe former \"[[Queen bee (sociology)|queen bee]]\" of her clique, '''Alison DiLaurentis''', portrayed by [[Sasha Pieterse]], used to be the most popular girl in school before her disappearance and alleged death. Although she cared for her friends, she enjoyed using their deepest secrets against them to keep them in line. Charming and manipulative, Alison was skilled at finding ways to blackmail everyone, and many people hated her. She knew everybody's secrets, but since she's been gone her friends are beginning to realize how little they really knew about her. She is revealed to be alive and on the run from \"A.\"\n\n===Mona Vanderwaal===\n{{main|Mona Vanderwaal}}\nA former \"unpopular\" girl at Rosewood, '''Mona Vanderwaal''', portrayed by [[Janel Parrish]], longed to be accepted into Alison's group and was continuously mocked by her. After Alison's disappearance, Mona befriended Hanna and they underwent an \"extreme makeover\" together; as a result, they both became popular students. When \"A\" appears, Mona becomes jealous of Hanna rekindling her friendships with the other Liars. She dislikes Caleb and makes attempts to break Hanna and Caleb up, though to no avail. She becomes romantically involved with Noel, much to Hanna's disapproval, but is later dumped by him for Jenna. When \"A\" begins sending Mona threatening notes, she grows closer to the Liars. In the second-season finale, she is in fact revealed to actually be \"A\" when she and Spencer travel to the Lost Woods Resort to uncover \"A\"'s lair. She is committed to a mental institution, Radley, after being diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]].\n\n===\"A\"{{anchor|A|A.D.|Uber A}}===\n{{main|A (Pretty Little Liars)}}\nThe main [[antagonist]], \"'''A'''\" is stalking and torturing the Liars in relentless and creative ways and also threatens their friends and family. In the second-season finale, it is revealed that Mona is \"A\". She is also the one who stalked Alison before her disappearance. However, when she is sent to Radley sanitarium, she is visited by CeCe Drake, who offers her a partnership and takes over the team of \"A's\", known as the A-Team. The team consists of Mona, Toby, Spencer, Sara, Lucas, Melissa, Wilden, Jenna, Noel, and Wren. Five years later, Alex Drake takes over and becomes Uber A, known as \"A.D.\", and forms the A.D. Team, consisting of Jenna, Sydney, Aria, Wren, Mona, and Mary.\n\n==Acquaintances of Aria Montgomery==\nThe following characters are all family members and acquaintances of '''Aria Montgomery''', one of the protagonists of the series.\n\n===Family===\n* {{anchor|Ella Montgomery}}'''Ella Montgomery''' ([[Holly Marie Combs]]) (seasons 1 \u2013 7) is Aria's mother, as well as a teacher at Rosewood High. Ella believes in treating her children as friends, not as property. She has mentioned that she doesn't want to push into Aria's private life, and she thinks that Aria should be allowed to keep secrets. Ella was unaware of her husband's affair with a student until \"A\" sent her a letter. After asking Byron to move out, and his refusal, she left the home. Eventually, Aria found out her parents were secretly getting back together, and Ella decides to move back in. When her son, Mike, is depressed, she doesn't feel he needs medication, and remains somewhat in denial about his illness. She finally receives her wake-up call when he attacks her in his bedroom. When Ella found out Aria was dating Ezra, she was angry, but she believed Aria when she said she had broken it off, and tried to win her back her freedom, which Byron didn't think she deserved. Later, she finds out that Aria and Ezra are still together, and decides she is going to try to understand their relationship. Ella is aware of A, and tries to send Aria to a boarding school to get away. Aria is furious, and blackmails her mother into not going through with it. Ella tearfully tells Aria how ashamed she is, and how she doesn't know how to save their relationship. In season 3, she and Byron have divorced and Ella tries to move on with her life not knowing how. Aria creates a profile for her on a dating website under the nickname \"Hot Mamma.\" Ella is furious at Aria but later she likes the idea and starts dating again. She befriends and starts dating the owner of the brew who is much younger than her. In season 4, she leaves Rosewood so she can go live with her boyfriend in Europe but returns at the end of season 4.\n* {{anchor|Byron Montgomery}}'''Byron Montgomery''' ([[Chad Lowe]]) (seasons 1 \u2013 7) is Aria's father and a history professor at Hollis College. He asked Aria to keep his affair with a student, Meredith, a secret after Aria witnessed them kissing. Regretting the affair and wanting them to be a family again, Byron moves the family to Iceland for a year as a sabbatical. The relationship between Byron and Ella becomes strained after A sends her a letter revealing Byron's affair. After spending some time apart, Ella and Byron slowly begin to rebuild their relationship. When Mike becomes depressed, Byron reveals that his brother Scott, who committed suicide, also suffered from mental illness; Byron feels guilty for not doing anything to help his brother. Byron finds out that Ezra is involved in a relationship with Aria after they tell him and Ella and is furious about it. In an effort to get Ezra away from Aria, Byron recommends him for a job in New Orleans. He also plots to send Aria to an all girls boarding school in Vermont. When Aria threatens to reveal his affair to his boss, he backs off from her but gets Ezra fired from Hollis. In season 3, Byron and Ella have divorced and Ella has moved out of the house. Byron starts seeing Meredith again. He informs Aria that Meredith got a job at Rosewood High, were Aria attends and Ella teaches. In the Halloween episode, it is revealed by Garrett that Byron may have seen Alison on the night she died. Alison told him,\"you know what I'm capable of!\"\n* {{anchor|Mike Montgomery}}'''Mike Montgomery''' ([[Cody Christian]]) (seasons 1\u20132, 4\u20136) is Aria's younger brother. A lacrosse player, he suffers from a mental illness, which causes him to burst into fits of anger and later leads him to break into people's houses for fun, before he begins to shut down emotionally and withdraw completely from his family. He blames Aria for the trouble between their parents. Mike accidentally discovered that Jenna and Garrett knew each other when he stole a pot made Jenna from Garrett's house. Mike reveals to Aria that the only reason he punched Ezra was because after Ezra and Aria announced they are a couple, he feared what Byron would have done to hurt Ezra judging by the look on his face and thought, \"better I do it, than him.\" Throughout the rest of the series he appears to have improved after going to a therapist. It does not tell when or if he was still seeing his therapist. He seemed to forgive Aria and their relationship is better. He stopped being rebellious and more focused of his family's problems and helping them out. He is dating Mona Vanderwaal.\n\n===Friends===\n* {{anchor|Holden Strauss}}'''Holden Strauss''' ([[Shane Coffey]]) (seasons 2\u20133, 7) is a childhood friend of Aria's who returns with his family from a year abroad in Portugal in the middle of Season 2. He asks Aria out on a date, and discovers that she only agreed so she could get out of the house unsupervised and try to meet Ezra. Instead of becoming upset, he suggest that they continue the cover, though he remains secretive about what he does during their fake dates. We later find out that his secret is more serious than it seemed at first when he accidentally reveals a very large bruise on his stomach, but he tells Aria not to worry about it. He eventually tells her that he is doing Tae Kwan Do, a Korean martial art, and that his parents forbid him to keep training, that is why he needs a cover. The situation turns out to be more complicated, though, when Ella tells Aria that Holden has a heart condition that could kill him any time. Aria goes to watch one of Holden's fights and she sees how much he loves to fight. In the sixth episode in season 3, he attends the same church party as Hanna and when Emily arrives, he runs into her and sparks a conversation.

He quit his teaching position at Rosewood just before Noel threatened to expose Aria and Ezra's relationship.

Prior to Alison's death, she and Jenna had been rivals after Jenna turned down Alison's offer of friendship. Jenna was engaged in a power struggle with Alison before her death; after Jenna's accident, Alison visited her and blackmailed Jenna with the knowledge of her affair with Toby. Jenna claims to know \"exactly what kind of person [Alison] really was,\" hinting that she knows things about Alison that the girls did not. Jenna was a part of the N.A.T. club and later became romantically involved with Garrett Reynolds, as they both worked to \"take down\" the Liars. However, Jenna eventually breaks up with Garrett, and enters into a relationship with Noel Kahn. In the second season, Jenna undergoes surgery to fix her eyesight, and subsequently lies about the success of the surgery, leading everyone to believe she is still blind. The Liars discover that Jenna can see after Emily remembers being in Jenna's car, leading them to confront her. The Liars agree to keep her sight a secret; however, Jenna then reveals to everyone that she can \"now\" see. An accidental witness to Lyndon James' kidnapping of Maya, she leaves town after he discovers this. She returns in the Season 3 finale episode. It is then shown that she is in a relationship with Shana, to whom she reveals that her eyesight is getting worse and she will eventually lose her vision again. She is also linked to Melissa and Darren Wilden. In Season 4, it is revealed Melissa ordered Shana and Jenna to go to the lodge to spy on the Liars to see whom they were meeting, and that they didn't start the fire, Wilden did. At Wilden's funeral, she is shown wearing her sunglasses and holding hands with a man. It is revealed that man was a pilot named Nigel Wright, who flew Red Coat the night of the fire. He claims it was CeCe Drake. Later, he is seen making coffee for someone and says he's sorry and that he \"screwed up\". He also refers to this person as \"babe\", and she is revealed to be none other than Jenna, as we see Jenna's glasses and cane. Jenna was nearly drowned by \"A\"/Red Coat at Emily's birthday party. Shana seemed to believe it was CeCe and left town. Jenna returns in the 100th episode where she is revealed to be a part of Mona Vanderwaal's army and is friends with Sydney Driscoll. It is also revealed that Jenna truly cared for Shana. Sydney was volunteering at Jenna's blind school and when Jenna found out that Alison was returning she called Sydney for help. After Mona's supposed death Sydney and Jenna join Ali's army, believing that she was the one who killed Mona and fearing her. Jenna returns to Rosewood after Charlotte DiLaurentis' murder in 2017 and is now working for Uber A, as well working ''with'' Noel, Sydney, and Sara Harvey. It is also revealed that she was a part of the A-Team. She reveals that she was actually friends with Charlotte after her admission to Welby and was helping her track down Mary Drake. Jenna also knew Archer Dunhill and was working with him, as well. Jenna and Noel lure the Liars to a blind school to kill them, but their plan fails when Noel is killed and Jenna is knocked out by Mary Drake. Uber A rescues Jenna and takes her to an unknown lair, where she was assisting them in their final endgame. After the one year time jump, Jenna became a Life Skills Teacher at Rosewood High. She met with Alex Drake (who was pretending to be Spencer) and recognized her smell from when she was working for her. She called Toby and informed him that she didn't think Spencer was Spencer, leading them  to discover the truth about the twins.\n* {{anchor|Garrett Reynolds}}'''Garrett Reynolds''' ([[Yani Gellman]]) (seasons 1\u20133) is a police officer investigating the case of Alison DiLaurentis' death, who is initially assigned to trail Spencer, a suspect in Alison's death. Although he appears to be sympathetic towards the girls, in reality he is secretly dating and in an alliance with Jenna Marshall. He was a member of N.A.T along with Jason and Ian, whom he went to high school with. Garrett and Jenna broke up. Aria and Spencer see Garrett watching them after they talk to the guy who Alison owed money to prior to her murder. Garrett then gets arrested for Alison's murder in front of Melissa. Later in season 3, Garrett is willing to tell Spencer everything he knows and tells her he will leave town right after. As he begins to tell her, they get interrupted.

As Australian political parties traditionally vote along party lines, most legislation introduced by the party commanding a majority will pass through the Legislative Assembly.\n\n==History==\n{{recentism|date=April 2020|section}}\n[[File:The first Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, 1976.jpg|thumb|The first Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, 1976]]\nThe Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was created in 1974 by the ''Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1974'' (Cth), an act of the Australian federal parliament, which replaced the partly elected [[Northern Territory Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. The Legislative Assembly consisted of 19 fully elected members, but initially lacked significant powers, until limited self-government was granted in 1978.<ref>''Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978'' (Cth)</ref> For the [[1983 Northern Territory general election|1983 election]], the number of members was increased to 25.<ref>Section 138B of the ''Electoral Amendment Act 1982'' (No.73 of 1982)</ref>\n\nFrom its inception prior to the [[1974 Northern Territory general election|1974 election]] until the [[2001 Northern Territory general election|2001 election]], the Legislative Assembly was controlled by the conservative [[Country Liberal Party]], which since 1979 has been affiliated with the federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]\u2013[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]]. In 2001, the [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)|Labor Party]] won a one-seat majority, and [[Clare Martin]] became the Territory's first Labor and first female chief minister. At the [[2005 Northern Territory general election|2005 election]], the Martin-led ALP won 19 seats to the CLP's 4; however, Martin resigned in 2007 and was succeeded by [[Paul Henderson (politician)|Paul Henderson]] as ALP leader, and retained government with another one-seat majority at the [[2008 Northern Territory general election|2008 election]]. Labor lost its majority when [[Marion Scrymgour]] went to the cross-benches as an independent. She re-joined the party after [[Alison Anderson]] left the party to sit as an independent. Anderson joined the CLP in September 2011. The [[2012 Northern Territory general election|2012 election]] resulted in the return of the CLP under [[Terry Mills (Australian politician)|Terry Mills]] with 16 seats to the ALP's 8. Mills resigned in 2013 and [[Adam Giles]] became CLP leader. The CLP was reduced to a one-seat majority in 2014 when three CLP members defected to join the [[Palmer United Party]]. One defector later rejoined the CLP. After further defections, CLP numbers fell to [[minority government]] status in July 2015.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-20/kezia-purick-quits-country-liberals-nt-government-loses-majority/6632916 Kezia Purick quits Northern Territory Country Liberals party, Government loses one-seat majority: ABC 20 July 2015]</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-20/adam-giles-wants-early-election-after-kezia-purick-leaves-clp/6634496 Adam Giles would 'love to go to an early election' after Kezia Purick resigns Country Liberals party: ABC 20 July 2015]</ref>\n\nThe [[2016 Northern Territory general election|2016 election]] saw a landslide CLP defeat which brought Labor to power led by Chief Minister [[Michael Gunner]].

The leader of that party subsequently becomes the [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory]], and their senior colleagues become ministers responsible for various portfolios. As Australian political parties traditionally vote along party lines, most legislation introduced by the party commanding a majority will pass through the Legislative Assembly.\n\n==History==\n{{recentism|date=April 2020|section}}\n[[File:The first Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, 1976.jpg|thumb|The first Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, 1976]]\nThe Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was created in 1974 by the ''Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1974'' (Cth), an act of the Australian federal parliament, which replaced the partly elected [[Northern Territory Legislative Council|Legislative Council]]. The Legislative Assembly consisted of 19 fully elected members, but initially lacked significant powers, until limited self-government was granted in 1978.<ref>''Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978'' (Cth)</ref> For the [[1983 Northern Territory general election|1983 election]], the number of members was increased to 25.<ref>Section 138B of the ''Electoral Amendment Act 1982'' (No.73 of 1982)</ref>\n\nFrom its inception prior to the [[1974 Northern Territory general election|1974 election]] until the [[2001 Northern Territory general election|2001 election]], the Legislative Assembly was controlled by the conservative [[Country Liberal Party]], which since 1979 has been affiliated with the federal [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]\u2013[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|coalition]]. In 2001, the [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)|Labor Party]] won a one-seat majority, and [[Clare Martin]] became the Territory's first Labor and first female chief minister. At the [[2005 Northern Territory general election|2005 election]], the Martin-led ALP won 19 seats to the CLP's 4; however, Martin resigned in 2007 and was succeeded by [[Paul Henderson (politician)|Paul Henderson]] as ALP leader, and retained government with another one-seat majority at the [[2008 Northern Territory general election|2008 election]]. Labor lost its majority when [[Marion Scrymgour]] went to the cross-benches as an independent. She re-joined the party after [[Alison Anderson]] left the party to sit as an independent. Anderson joined the CLP in September 2011. The [[2012 Northern Territory general election|2012 election]] resulted in the return of the CLP under [[Terry Mills (Australian politician)|Terry Mills]] with 16 seats to the ALP's 8. Mills resigned in 2013 and [[Adam Giles]] became CLP leader. The CLP was reduced to a one-seat majority in 2014 when three CLP members defected to join the [[Palmer United Party]]. One defector later rejoined the CLP. After further defections, CLP numbers fell to [[minority government]] status in July 2015.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-20/kezia-purick-quits-country-liberals-nt-government-loses-majority/6632916 Kezia Purick quits Northern Territory Country Liberals party, Government loses one-seat majority: ABC 20 July 2015]</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-20/adam-giles-wants-early-election-after-kezia-purick-leaves-clp/6634496 Adam Giles would 'love to go to an early election' after Kezia Purick resigns Country Liberals party: ABC 20 July 2015]</ref>\n\nThe [[2016 Northern Territory general election|2016 election]] saw a landslide CLP defeat which brought Labor to power led by Chief Minister [[Michael Gunner]]. The position of [[Speaker of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] has been held by CLP-turned-independent MP [[Kezia Purick]] since 23 October 2012. Despite Labor's massive majority following the 2016 election, the incoming Labor government re-appointed Purick as Speaker.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-11/northern-territory-government-announces-new-cabinet/7834466 NT Labor Government announces female-dominated Cabinet: ABC 11 September 2016]</ref>\n\n==Chan Contemporary Artspace==\n[[File:Chan Contemporary ArtSpace Darwin May 2015.jpeg|thumb|Chan Contemporary ArtSpace Darwin May 2015]]\n\nChan Contemporary Artspace is an exhibition gallery located in [[Darwin, Northern Territory]], [[Australia]].
