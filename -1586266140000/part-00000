The book was regarded among his scholarly peers in Europe as the most authoritative treatise on the subject until the modern [[exploration of Africa]].{{sfn|Masonen|2001}} For this work, Leo became a household name among European geographers.\n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Var 132.jpg|thumb|300px|The courtyard of the [[University of al-Qarawiyyin]], [[Fez, Morocco]], where al-Hasan (future Leo Africanus) studied.]]\nMost of what is known about his life is gathered from autobiographical notes in his own work. Leo Africanus was born as al-Hasan, son of Muhammad in [[Granada]] around the year 1494.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}} The year of birth can be estimated from his self-reported age at the time of various historical events.<ref>{{harvnb|Leo Africanus|1896|loc=Vol man he accompanied an uncle on a [[diplomatic mission]], reaching as far as the city of [[Timbuktu]] (c. 1510), then part of the [[Songhai Empire]]. In 1517 when returning from a diplomatic mission to [[Istanbul]] on behalf of the [[Sultan of Fez]] [[Abu Abd Allah al-Burtuqali Muhammad ibn Muhammad|Muhammad II]] he found himself in the port of [[Rosetta]] during the [[History of Ottoman Egypt|Ottoman conquest of Egypt]]. He continued with his journey through [[Cairo]] and [[Aswan]] and across the [[Red Sea]] to [[Arabian Peninsula |Arabia]], where he probably performed a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. \n\nOn his way back to [[Tunis]] in 1518 he was captured by Spanish [[Privateer|corsairs]] either near the island of [[Djerba]] or more probably near [[Crete]]. He was taken to [[Rome]] and initially imprisoned in [[Rhodes]], the headquarters of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. During this period, the usual fate of unransomed Muslim captives was slavery in Christian [[galley]]s, but when his captors realized his intelligence and importance, he was moved to [[Castel Sant\u2019Angelo]] in Rome and was later presented to [[Pope Leo X]]. He was soon freed and given pension to persuade him to stay. He was [[baptized]] in the [[St. Peter's Basilica |Basilica of Saint Peter's]] in 1520. He took the Latin name ''Johannes Leo de Medicis'' (''Giovanni Leone'' in Italian). In Arabic, he preferred to translate this name as ''Yuhanna al-Asad al-Gharnati'' (literally means John the Lion of Granada). It is likely that Leo Africanus was welcomed to the [[papal court]] as the Pope feared that Turkish forces might invade Sicily and southern Italy, and a willing collaborator could provide useful information on North Africa.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\n[[File:Raffaello Sanzio - Ritratto di Leone X coi cardinali Giulio de' Medici e Luigi de' Rossi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Leo X]] (''center'') was Leo's initial benefactor in Rome. His cousin, Giulio de' Medici (''left'') later became [[Pope Clement VII]] and continued the papal patronage of Leo.]]\nLeo Africanus left Rome and spent the next three or four years traveling in Italy. The death of his patron Leo X in 1521, and suspicions from the new Pope [[Adrian VI]] against a Muslim in court, was likely the reason for his leaving Rome. While staying in [[Bologna]] he wrote an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical [[vocabulary]], of which only the Arabic part has survived, and a [[grammar]] of Arabic of which only an eight-page fragment has survived. He returned to Rome in 1526 under the protection of the new [[Pope Clement VII]], a cousin of Leo X who replaced Adrian. According to Leo, he completed his manuscript on African [[geography]] in the same year. The work was published in Italian with the title ''[[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Della descrittione dell\u2019Africa et delle cose notabili che iui sono, per Giovan Lioni Africano]]'' in 1550 by the [[Venice|Venetian]] publisher [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio]]. The book proved to be extremely popular and was reprinted five times. It was also translated into other languages. French and Latin editions were published in 1556 while an English version was published in 1600 with the title ''A Geographical Historie of Africa''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leo Africanus|1600}}; {{Harvnb|Leo Africanus|1896}}.</ref> The Latin edition, which contained many errors and mistranslations, was used as the source for the English translation.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\nThere are several theories of his later life, and none of them are certain. According to one theory, he spent it in Rome until he died around 1550, the year ''Description of Africa'' was published. This theory was based on indirect allusion in a later preface to this book. According to another theory, he left shortly before the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s troops in 1527. He then returned to North Africa and lived in Tunis until his death, some time after 1550. This was based on records by German orientalist [[Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter]], who arrived in Italy and planned (but ultimately failed) to travel to Tunis to meet Leo who had since reconverted to Islam. Yet another theory said that he left Tunis after [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|it was captured]] by Charles V in 1535 for Morocco, his second home country after Granada where his relatives were still living. This was based on the assumption that Leo, having left Granada, would not have wanted to live under Christian Spanish rule again, and his wish (recorded in ''Description of Africa'') that he wanted to ultimately return to his home country \"by God's assistance\".{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\n=== Veracity of Africa trip ===\nIt is unlikely that Leo Africanus visited all the places that he describes and he must therefore have relied on information obtained from other travellers. In particular, it is doubtful whether he ever visited [[Hausaland]] and [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]{{sfn|Fisher |1978}} and it is even possible that he never crossed the [[Sahara]] but relied on information from other travellers that he met in Morocco. The historian Pekka Masonen has argued that the belief of his further travels was based on misreadings by modern scholars who interpreted his book as an itinerary.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}} \n\nAt the time Leo visited the city of [[Timbuktu]], it was a thriving [[Islam]]ic city famous for its learning. Home to many scholars and learned men, Timbuktu also possessed a Great Mosque, renowned for its expansive library. The town was to become a byword in [[Europe]] as the most inaccessible of cities. At the time of Leo's journey there, it was the centre of a busy trade carried on by traders in African products, gold, printed [[cotton]]s and [[slavery|slaves]], and in Islamic books.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\n== Name ==\nIn an autograph in one of his surviving manuscripts, a fragment of an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical [[vocabulary]] he wrote for the Jewish physician [[Jacob Mantino]], he signed his name in Arabic as ''Yuhanna al-Asad al-Gharnati'' (literally means John the Lion of Granada), a translation of his Christian name, John-Leo, or ''Johannes Leo'' (Latin), or ''Giovanni Leone'' (Italian). He was also given the family name [[Medici]] after his patron, Pope Leo X's family. The same manuscript also contained his original name al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan al-Fasi. al-Hasan ibn Muhammad was a [[patronymic name]] meaning \"al-Hasan, son of Muhammad\", and ''al-Fasi'' is the Arabic demonym for someone from [[Fez, Morocco]].{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\n== Works ==\n[[Image:LeoAfricanus-JohnPory-GeoHistorieAfrica-1600.jpg|thumb|The title page of the 1600 English edition of Leo Africanus\u2019s book on Africa.]]\n{{Moroccan literature}}\n{{seealso|Description of Africa (1550 book)}}\n''Description of Africa'', published in 1550 by Giovanni Battista Ramusio, is Leo's most famous work. \n\nOther than this, he wrote an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical [[vocabulary]] for the Jewish physician [[Jacob Mantino]]. He also wrote an Arabic translation of the [[Epistles of St. Paul]], which is dated in January 1521, and the manuscript currently belongs to the [[Biblioteca Estense]] in Modena. Another surviving work is a biographical encyclopedia of 25 major Islamic scholars and 5 major Jewish scholars. It was completed in Rome before he left the city in 1527 and published for the first time in Latin by [[Johann Heinrich Hottinger]] in 1664. Unlike ''Description of Africa'', this biographical work was hardly noticed in Europe. It also contains various erroneous information, likely due to his lack of access to relevant sources when he was in Italy, forcing him to rely solely on memory.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\nIn ''Description of Africa'', he also referred to plans to write other books. He planned to write two other descriptions of places, one for places in the Middle East and another for places in Europe. He also planned to write an exposition of the Islamic faith and a history of North Africa. However, none of these books survived nor has there been any proof that he actually completed them. This might have been due to his possible return to North Africa.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\n== References in media ==\nA fictionalized account of his life, ''[[Leo Africanus (novel)|Leo Africanus]]'', by the Lebanese-French author [[Amin Maalouf]], fills in key gaps in the story and places Leo Africanus in prominent events of his time.\n\nThe BBC produced a documentary about his life called \"Leo Africanus: A Man Between Worlds\" in 2011. It was presented by [[Badr Sayegh]] and directed by Jeremy Jeffs. The film followed in Leo's footsteps from Granada, through Fez and Timbuktu, all the way to Rome.\n\nIt has been suggested that [[William Shakespeare]] may have been inspired by Leo Africanus' book to create the character of [[Othello (character)|Othello]].{{sfn|Verde|2008}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/217055| last=Fisher | first=Humphrey J. | title=Leo Africanus and the Songhay conquest of Hausaland | year=1978 | journal= International Journal of African Historical Studies| volume=11 | pages=86\u2013112| issue=1| publisher=[[Boston University African Studies Center]]| jstor=217055 | ref=harv }}\n*{{cite journal | last=Masonen | first=Pekka | title=Leo Africanus: the man with many names | journal= Al-Andalus Magreb | year=2001 | volume=8-9 | pages=115\u2013143 | url=http://revistas.uca.es/index.php/aam/article/download/852/719 | ref=harv}} Text also available [http://www.leoafricanus.com/pictures/bibliography/Masonen/Masonen.pdf here].\n*{{cite book | last=Rauchenberger | first=Dietrich | title=Johannes Leo der Afrikaner: seine Beschreibung des Raumes zwischen Nil und Niger nach dem Urtext | year=1999 | place=Wiesbaden | publisher=Harrassowitz | isbn=3-447-04172-2 | language=German | ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book | last=Leo Africanus | title=A Geographical Historie of Africa, written in Arabicke and Italian.

The book was regarded among his scholarly peers in Europe as the most authoritative treatise on the subject until the modern [[exploration of Africa]].{{sfn|Masonen|2001}} For this work, Leo became a household name among European geographers.\n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Var 132.jpg|thumb|300px|The courtyard of the [[University of al-Qarawiyyin]], [[Fez, Morocco]], where al-Hasan (future Leo Africanus) studied.]]\nMost of what is known about his life is gathered from autobiographical notes in his own work. Leo Africanus was born as al-Hasan, son of Muhammad in [[Granada]] around the year 1494.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}} The year of birth can be estimated from his self-reported age at the time of various historical events.<ref>{{harvnb|Leo Africanus|1896|loc=Vol. 1 [https://archive.org/stream/worksissuedbyha01unkngoog#page/n18/mode/1up p. v]}}. He was 12 years old when the Portuguese captured the port of Safi on the coast of Morocco in 1507 and 16 years old when he visited Timbuktu in 1509\u20131510.</ref> His family moved to [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] soon after his birth.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}{{sfn|Rauchenberger|1999|p=26}} In Fez he studied at the [[University of al-Qarawiyyin]] (also spelled al-Karaouine). As a young man he accompanied an uncle on a [[diplomatic mission]], reaching as far as the city of [[Timbuktu]] (c. 1510), then part of the [[Songhai Empire]]. In 1517 when returning from a diplomatic mission to [[Istanbul]] on behalf of the [[Sultan of Fez]] [[Abu Abd Allah al-Burtuqali Muhammad ibn Muhammad|Muhammad II]] he found himself in the port of [[Rosetta]] during the [[History of Ottoman Egypt|Ottoman conquest of Egypt]]. He continued with his journey through [[Cairo]] and [[Aswan]] and across the [[Red Sea]] to [[Arabian Peninsula |Arabia]], where he probably performed a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. \n\nOn his way back to [[Tunis]] in 1518 he was captured by Spanish [[Privateer|corsairs]] either near the island of [[Djerba]] or more probably near [[Crete]]. He was taken to [[Rome]] and initially imprisoned in [[Rhodes]], the headquarters of the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. During this period, the usual fate of unransomed Muslim captives was slavery in Christian [[galley]]s, but when his captors realized his intelligence and importance, he was moved to [[Castel Sant\u2019Angelo]] in Rome and was later presented to [[Pope Leo X]]. He was soon freed and given pension to persuade him to stay. He was [[baptized]] in the [[St. Peter's Basilica |Basilica of Saint Peter's]] in 1520. He took the Latin name ''Johannes Leo de Medicis'' (''Giovanni Leone'' in Italian). In Arabic, he preferred to translate this name as ''Yuhanna al-Asad al-Gharnati'' (literally means John the Lion of Granada). It is likely that Leo Africanus was welcomed to the [[papal court]] as the Pope feared that Turkish forces might invade Sicily and southern Italy, and a willing collaborator could provide useful information on North Africa.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\n[[File:Raffaello Sanzio - Ritratto di Leone X coi cardinali Giulio de' Medici e Luigi de' Rossi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Leo X]] (''center'') was Leo's initial benefactor in Rome. His cousin, Giulio de' Medici (''left'') later became [[Pope Clement VII]] and continued the papal patronage of Leo.]]\nLeo Africanus left Rome and spent the next three or four years traveling in Italy. The death of his patron Leo X in 1521, and suspicions from the new Pope [[Adrian VI]] against a Muslim in court, was likely the reason for his leaving Rome. While staying in [[Bologna]] he wrote an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical [[vocabulary]], of which only the Arabic part has survived, and a [[grammar]] of Arabic of which only an eight-page fragment has survived. He returned to Rome in 1526 under the protection of the new [[Pope Clement VII]], a cousin of Leo X who replaced Adrian. According to Leo, he completed his manuscript on African [[geography]] in the same year. The work was published in Italian with the title ''[[Description of Africa (1550 book)|Della descrittione dell\u2019Africa et delle cose notabili che iui sono, per Giovan Lioni Africano]]'' in 1550 by the [[Venice|Venetian]] publisher [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio]]. The book proved to be extremely popular and was reprinted five times. It was also translated into other languages. French and Latin editions were published in 1556 while an English version was published in 1600 with the title ''A Geographical Historie of Africa''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leo Africanus|1600}}; {{Harvnb|Leo Africanus|1896}}.</ref> The Latin edition, which contained many errors and mistranslations, was used as the source for the English translation.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\nThere are several theories of his later life, and none of them are certain. According to one theory, he spent it in Rome until he died around 1550, the year ''Description of Africa'' was published. This theory was based on indirect allusion in a later preface to this book. According to another theory, he left shortly before the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s troops in 1527. He then returned to North Africa and lived in Tunis until his death, some time after 1550. This was based on records by German orientalist [[Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter]], who arrived in Italy and planned (but ultimately failed) to travel to Tunis to meet Leo who had since reconverted to Islam. Yet another theory said that he left Tunis after [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|it was captured]] by Charles V in 1535 for Morocco, his second home country after Granada where his relatives were still living. This was based on the assumption that Leo, having left Granada, would not have wanted to live under Christian Spanish rule again, and his wish (recorded in ''Description of Africa'') that he wanted to ultimately return to his home country \"by God's assistance\".{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\n=== Veracity of Africa trip ===\nIt is unlikely that Leo Africanus visited all the places that he describes and he must therefore have relied on information obtained from other travellers. In particular, it is doubtful whether he ever visited [[Hausaland]] and [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]{{sfn|Fisher |1978}} and it is even possible that he never crossed the [[Sahara]] but relied on information from other travellers that he met in Morocco. The historian Pekka Masonen has argued that the belief of his further travels was based on misreadings by modern scholars who interpreted his book as an itinerary.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}} \n\nAt the time Leo visited the city of [[Timbuktu]], it was a thriving [[Islam]]ic city famous for its learning. Home to many scholars and learned men, Timbuktu also possessed a Great Mosque, renowned for its expansive library. The town was to become a byword in [[Europe]] as the most inaccessible of cities. At the time of Leo's journey there, it was the centre of a busy trade carried on by traders in African products, gold, printed [[cotton]]s and [[slavery|slaves]], and in Islamic books.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\n== Name ==\nIn an autograph in one of his surviving manuscripts, a fragment of an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical [[vocabulary]] he wrote for the Jewish physician [[Jacob Mantino]], he signed his name in Arabic as ''Yuhanna al-Asad al-Gharnati'' (literally means John the Lion of Granada), a translation of his Christian name, John-Leo, or ''Johannes Leo'' (Latin), or ''Giovanni Leone'' (Italian). He was also given the family name [[Medici]] after his patron, Pope Leo X's family. The same manuscript also contained his original name al-Hasan ibn Muhammad al-Wazzan al-Fasi. al-Hasan ibn Muhammad was a [[patronymic name]] meaning \"al-Hasan, son of Muhammad\", and ''al-Fasi'' is the Arabic demonym for someone from [[Fez, Morocco]].{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\n== Works ==\n[[Image:LeoAfricanus-JohnPory-GeoHistorieAfrica-1600.jpg|thumb|The title page of the 1600 English edition of Leo Africanus\u2019s book on Africa.]]\n{{Moroccan literature}}\n{{seealso|Description of Africa (1550 book)}}\n''Description of Africa'', published in 1550 by Giovanni Battista Ramusio, is Leo's most famous work. \n\nOther than this, he wrote an Arabic-Hebrew-Latin medical [[vocabulary]] for the Jewish physician [[Jacob Mantino]]. He also wrote an Arabic translation of the [[Epistles of St. Paul]], which is dated in January 1521, and the manuscript currently belongs to the [[Biblioteca Estense]] in Modena. Another surviving work is a biographical encyclopedia of 25 major Islamic scholars and 5 major Jewish scholars. It was completed in Rome before he left the city in 1527 and published for the first time in Latin by [[Johann Heinrich Hottinger]] in 1664. Unlike ''Description of Africa'', this biographical work was hardly noticed in Europe. It also contains various erroneous information, likely due to his lack of access to relevant sources when he was in Italy, forcing him to rely solely on memory.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\nIn ''Description of Africa'', he also referred to plans to write other books. He planned to write two other descriptions of places, one for places in the Middle East and another for places in Europe. He also planned to write an exposition of the Islamic faith and a history of North Africa. However, none of these books survived nor has there been any proof that he actually completed them. This might have been due to his possible return to North Africa.{{sfn|Masonen|2001}}\n\n== References in media ==\nA fictionalized account of his life, ''[[Leo Africanus (novel)|Leo Africanus]]'', by the Lebanese-French author [[Amin Maalouf]], fills in key gaps in the story and places Leo Africanus in prominent events of his time.\n\nThe BBC produced a documentary about his life called \"Leo Africanus: A Man Between Worlds\" in 2011. It was presented by [[Badr Sayegh]] and directed by Jeremy Jeffs. The film followed in Leo's footsteps from Granada, through Fez and Timbuktu, all the way to Rome.\n\nIt has been suggested that [[William Shakespeare]] may have been inspired by Leo Africanus' book to create the character of [[Othello (character)|Othello]].{{sfn|Verde|2008}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/217055| last=Fisher | first=Humphrey J. | title=Leo Africanus and the Songhay conquest of Hausaland | year=1978 | journal= International Journal of African Historical Studies| volume=11 | pages=86\u2013112| issue=1| publisher=[[Boston University African Studies Center]]| jstor=217055 | ref=harv }}\n*{{cite journal | last=Masonen | first=Pekka | title=Leo Africanus: the man with many names | journal= Al-Andalus Magreb | year=2001 | volume=8-9 | pages=115\u2013143 | url=http://revistas.uca.es/index.php/aam/article/download/852/719 | ref=harv}} Text also available [http://www.leoafricanus.com/pictures/bibliography/Masonen/Masonen.pdf here].\n*{{cite book | last=Rauchenberger | first=Dietrich | title=Johannes Leo der Afrikaner: seine Beschreibung des Raumes zwischen Nil und Niger nach dem Urtext | year=1999 | place=Wiesbaden | publisher=Harrassowitz | isbn=3-447-04172-2 | language=German | ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book | last=Leo Africanus | title=A Geographical Historie of Africa, written in Arabicke and Italian.
