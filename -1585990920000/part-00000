As a member of the Wallabies team, Gregan has attained the zenith of the rugby world, winning the Rugby World Cup in 1999. Gregan and his longtime Wallabies teammate, [[Fly-half (rugby union)|fly-half]] [[Stephen Larkham]], also hold the all-time record for Test appearances by a halfback partnership with 79.\n\n==Early and personal life==\nGregan was born in [[Zambia]] to an [[Australians|Australian]] father and a [[Zimbabweans|Zimbabwean]] mother,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgegregan.com/george/ggprofile.html |title=George Gregan - Player Profile |publisher=Georgegregan.com |accessdate=2008-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109095618/http://www.georgegregan.com/george/ggprofile.html |archivedate=9 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> coincidentally in the same hospital<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegoal.com/players/rugby/krige_corne/captain.html |title=Captain Courageous - Corne Kirge - TheGoal.com |publisher=Thegoal.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> where [[Corn\u00e9 Krige]], who would grow up to be the [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] captain during Gregan's Wallabies captaincy, would be born two years later. His family moved to Australia when he was two years old, and he grew up in [[Canberra]] where he was educated at [[St Edmund's College, Canberra|St Edmund's College]] and graduated with a Bachelor of Education (Physical Education) from the [[University of Canberra]].\n\nGregan and his wife Erica have three children, Max, Charlie and Jazz. Max was diagnosed with [[epilepsy]] in 2004; after spending time with Max in hospital and \"[experiencing] firsthand the needs of many sick children and their parents\" they set up the George Gregan Foundation in 2005.

He was subsequently capped in the victories over Italy again, and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Western Samoa]].\n\nLater that year, Gregan made a famous try-saving tackle on [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Black]] [[Jeff Wilson (sportsman)|Jeff Wilson]] that directly led to Australia winning the [[Bledisloe Cup]] that year and is much remembered as one of the greatest moments in the Wallabies-All Blacks rivalry.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Cricket/Wilson-swaps-a-rugby-jersey-for-a-Black-Cap/2005/01/12/1105423557790.html\n | title=Wilson swaps a rugby jersey for a Black Cap - Cricket\n | work = Sydney Morning Herald | publisher= Fairfax|date= 13 January 2005|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref>  After two caps against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] the following season, Gregan had so far been on the winning side in all of his international games as Australia entered the [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995 World Cup]] in South Africa as defending champions. However, Australia made their exit at the quarter finals, losing 25 to 22 to [[England national rugby union team|England]] at [[Newlands Stadium|Newlands]] in [[Cape Town]].\n\nThe game went professional post-1995 World Cup, and one outcome of this was the formation of the [[Super 12]], of which Gregan became a foundation player for the [[Brumbies Rugby|ACT Brumbies]] franchise. That season Gregan appeared eight times for the Wallabies, including solid wins over both [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]] in Brisbane, scoring a try in the Canadian clash. Another outcome of professionalism was the formation of the [[Tri Nations Series]] between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Gregan played in three of Australia's four fixtures at the [[1996 Tri Nations Series|first ever tournament]], scoring a try in the 25 to 32 loss to the All Blacks in Brisbane.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s' [[Super League war]], Gregan was approached to be the starting halfback for the new [[Adelaide Rams|Adelaide rugby league team]] for \"seriously more money\" than he would earn playing rugby union, but he opted to remain in the 15-man code.<ref>{{cite book\n|title= Halfback, Half Forward\n|last= Gregan\n|first= George\n|year= 2008\n|publisher= [[Pan Macmillan]]\n|location= Australia\n|isbn= 978-1-4050-3861-4\n|page= 65\n|pages= \n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gbJAIH35JvUC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|accessdate= 12 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nHe was elevated to the vice-captaincy of the Wallabies in 1997. In the [[1997 Tri Nations Series]], Gregan scored a try in the opening game against the All Blacks, which was eventually lost 18 to 33, and the Wallabies won only one game, against South Africa, finishing at the bottom of the table. By the end of the year, Gregan was capped another four times.\n\nAfter winning in two matches against the Irish, and one against England in the winter of 1999 at home, the Wallabies ended up finishing in the middle of the table for the [[1999 Tri Nations Series]] (with Gregan having played in every match), though they were still favourable entering the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 World Cup]] held in Wales. Australia finished at the top of Pool E, winning all their games, with Gregan playing in the matches against [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] and Ireland, though he was rested in the final pool game against the [[United States national rugby union team|USA]]. The Wallabies went on to defeat hosts Wales in the quarter finals at the new [[Millennium Stadium]] with Gregan scoring a try, putting Joe Roff into space and then taking the scoring pass, and enter the final after defeating defending champions South Africa in the semi-finals. The Wallabies became two-time World Champions after defeating [[France national rugby union team|France]] 35 to 12 in the final.\n\n===2001 to 2005===\nAfter the international retirement of [[John Eales]] in 2001, Gregan became the Wallabies captain. He was an obvious choice to fill the role, as it would be a natural progression from his position as vice-captain, as well as the fact that Gregan was a virtual automatic selection for the national team.<ref name=\"rugbyau\">{{cite web | work=rugby.com.au\n | title= Gregan named wallaby captain |url=http://www.qru.com.au/news/2001_september/gregan_named_wallaby_captain_12146,8502.html| accessdate=29 July 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060826173522/http://www.qru.com.au/news/2001_september/gregan_named_wallaby_captain_12146%2C8502.html |archivedate = 26 August 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nGregan played in all of Australia's 6 matches at the [[2003 rugby world cup|2003 Rugby World Cup]].

He also scored a try in the 33 to 16 win over [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] in the quarter-finals. Gregan led the Wallabies in defeating the [[All Blacks]] in the semi-final. This contest led to a controversy for Gregan when he taunted his opponents after defeating them the comment, \"Four more years boys, four more years\" i.e. New Zealand would have to wait another 4 years for an attempt at winning the World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65xd81cj7pA |title=Gregan bragging |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}</ref><ref name=\"Stuff.co.nz_2398842\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-news/opinion/2398842/Cup-won-t-be-empty-for-three-more-years |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515200314/http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-news/opinion/2398842/Cup-won-t-be-empty-for-three-more-years |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 May 2009 |title=Cup won't be empty for three more years |author=Devlin, Martin |authorlink=Martin Devlin |date=10 May 2009 |work=Sunday News |accessdate=1 October 2011 }}</ref>  Australia lost to England in the [[2003 rugby world cup#Final|final]].\n\nFollowing Australia's loss to the English in the World Cup, Gregan led the Wallabies on a massive winning campaign during the 2004 season. After defeating Scotland twice at home, the Wallabies faced the English in a World Cup replay in Brisbane, where they got their revenge, defeating England 51 to 15. Under Gregan, Australia lost just three matches in 2004, one against South Africa, one against New Zealand 16-7 in New Zealand and then against France in Paris.\nIn July during the [[2004 Tri Nations Series]], Gregan ran out at [[Subiaco Oval]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] against South Africa for his 100th Wallaby test.<ref name=\"century\">{{cite web|work=rugby.com.au |title=George Gregan to Play his 100th Test Match |url=http://www.rugby.com.au/news/george_gregan_to_play_his_100th_test_match,19902.html |accessdate=17 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825203438/http://www.rugby.com.au/news/george_gregan_to_play_his_100th_test_match,19902.html |archivedate=25 August 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref> In October 2004, Gregan announced that his four-year-old son had epilepsy and has launched an epilepsy awareness campaign in Australia with the slogan 'Get on the Team'. He also took up the role of patron of Brainwave Australia.\n\nGregan missed a lot of the [[2005 Super 12 season]] after breaking his leg during a game against the [[New South Wales Waratahs]] in Canberra. Gregan returned for the match against Italy in Melbourne, which the Wallabies won 61 to 29. Though after a win over the French and one over the Springboks, the Wallabies fell to the bottom of the [[2005 Tri Nations Series]] table, losing all of their games. With his start in the final match of the 2005 Tri Nations at [[Eden Park]] in [[Auckland]] against the [[All Blacks]], Gregan equalled England's [[Jason Leonard]] as the most-[[Cap (sport)|capped]] player for a national team in Test rugby, with 114 (Leonard also has five [[British and Irish Lions|Lions]] caps). Appropriately, when Australia made their entrance for that match, Gregan went out on the field by himself before any of his teammates entered the pitch.\n\nOn 5 November 2005, he earned his 115th [[Cap (sport)|cap]], surpassing Leonard, when he led out the Wallabies at [[Stade V\u00e9lodrome]] in [[Marseille]] against [[France national rugby union team|France]]. The Wallabies lost the match 16 to 26. The French loss was followed by a meeting with the English at Twickenham, where England's superior scrummaging saw them also win 26 to 16.\n\n===2006===\nIn June 2006, the Wallabies, under new coach [[John Connolly (rugby)|John Connolly]], completed a solid win over England.

He was subsequently capped in the victories over Italy again, and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Western Samoa]].\n\nLater that year, Gregan made a famous try-saving tackle on [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Black]] [[Jeff Wilson (sportsman)|Jeff Wilson]] that directly led to Australia winning the [[Bledisloe Cup]] that year and is much remembered as one of the greatest moments in the Wallabies-All Blacks rivalry.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Cricket/Wilson-swaps-a-rugby-jersey-for-a-Black-Cap/2005/01/12/1105423557790.html\n | title=Wilson swaps a rugby jersey for a Black Cap - Cricket\n | work = Sydney Morning Herald | publisher= Fairfax|date= 13 January 2005|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref>  After two caps against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] the following season, Gregan had so far been on the winning side in all of his international games as Australia entered the [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995 World Cup]] in South Africa as defending champions. However, Australia made their exit at the quarter finals, losing 25 to 22 to [[England national rugby union team|England]] at [[Newlands Stadium|Newlands]] in [[Cape Town]].\n\nThe game went professional post-1995 World Cup, and one outcome of this was the formation of the [[Super 12]], of which Gregan became a foundation player for the [[Brumbies Rugby|ACT Brumbies]] franchise. That season Gregan appeared eight times for the Wallabies, including solid wins over both [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]] in Brisbane, scoring a try in the Canadian clash. Another outcome of professionalism was the formation of the [[Tri Nations Series]] between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Gregan played in three of Australia's four fixtures at the [[1996 Tri Nations Series|first ever tournament]], scoring a try in the 25 to 32 loss to the All Blacks in Brisbane.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s' [[Super League war]], Gregan was approached to be the starting halfback for the new [[Adelaide Rams|Adelaide rugby league team]] for \"seriously more money\" than he would earn playing rugby union, but he opted to remain in the 15-man code.<ref>{{cite book\n|title= Halfback, Half Forward\n|last= Gregan\n|first= George\n|year= 2008\n|publisher= [[Pan Macmillan]]\n|location= Australia\n|isbn= 978-1-4050-3861-4\n|page= 65\n|pages= \n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gbJAIH35JvUC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|accessdate= 12 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nHe was elevated to the vice-captaincy of the Wallabies in 1997.

By the end of the year, Gregan was capped another four times.\n\nAfter winning in two matches against the Irish, and one against England in the winter of 1999 at home, the Wallabies ended up finishing in the middle of the table for the [[1999 Tri Nations Series]] (with Gregan having played in every match), though they were still favourable entering the [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999 World Cup]] held in Wales. Australia finished at the top of Pool E, winning all their games, with Gregan playing in the matches against [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]] and Ireland, though he was rested in the final pool game against the [[United States national rugby union team|USA]]. The Wallabies went on to defeat hosts Wales in the quarter finals at the new [[Millennium Stadium]] with Gregan scoring a try, putting Joe Roff into space and then taking the scoring pass, and enter the final after defeating defending champions South Africa in the semi-finals. The Wallabies became two-time World Champions after defeating [[France national rugby union team|France]] 35 to 12 in the final.\n\n===2001 to 2005===\nAfter the international retirement of [[John Eales]] in 2001, Gregan became the Wallabies captain.

Gregan returned for the match against Italy in Melbourne, which the Wallabies won 61 to 29. Though after a win over the French and one over the Springboks, the Wallabies fell to the bottom of the [[2005 Tri Nations Series]] table, losing all of their games. With his start in the final match of the 2005 Tri Nations at [[Eden Park]] in [[Auckland]] against the [[All Blacks]], Gregan equalled England's [[Jason Leonard]] as the most-[[Cap (sport)|capped]] player for a national team in Test rugby, with 114 (Leonard also has five [[British and Irish Lions|Lions]] caps). Appropriately, when Australia made their entrance for that match, Gregan went out on the field by himself before any of his teammates entered the pitch.\n\nOn 5 November 2005, he earned his 115th [[Cap (sport)|cap]], surpassing Leonard, when he led out the Wallabies at [[Stade V\u00e9lodrome]] in [[Marseille]] against [[France national rugby union team|France]]. The Wallabies lost the match 16 to 26.

Galvanized steel pallets are fireproof and rust resistant.]]\nA '''pallet''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|\u00e6|l|\u1d7b|t}}) (also called a '''skid''') is a flat transport structure, which supports goods in a stable fashion while being lifted by a [[forklift]], a [[pallet jack]], a [[Loader (equipment)|front loader]], a [[Jack (mechanical)|jacking device]], or an erect crane. A pallet is the structural foundation of a [[unit load]] which allows handling and storage efficiencies.{{cn|date=October 2019}} Goods or [[shipping container]]s are often placed on a pallet secured with [[strapping]], [[stretch wrap]] or [[shrink wrap]] and shipped. Since its invention in the twentieth century, its use has dramatically supplanted older forms of crating like the [[wooden box]] and the [[wooden barrel]], as it works well with modern packaging like [[corrugated box]]es and [[intermodal container]]s commonly used for bulk shipping.\n\nWhile most pallets are wooden, pallets can also be made of plastic, metal, paper, and [[recycled materials]]. Each material has advantages and disadvantages.\n\n==Overview==\n[[Containerization]] for transport has spurred the use of pallets because shipping containers have the smooth, level surfaces needed for easy pallet movement. Many pallets can handle a load of {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Today{{when|date=April 2020}}, about half a billion pallets are made each year and about two billion pallets are in use across the [[United States]] alone.\n\nPallets make it easier to move heavy stacks. Loads with pallets under them can be hauled by forklift trucks of different sizes, or even by hand-pumped and hand-drawn pallet jacks. Movement is easy on a wide, strong, flat floor: concrete is excellent. The greatest investment needed for economical pallet use is in the construction of commercial or industrial buildings. Passage through doors and buildings must be possible. To address this issue, some later pallet standards (the europallet and the U.S. Military {{convert|35|\u00d7|45.5|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are designed to pass through standard doorways.\n\nOrganizations using standard pallets for loading and unloading can have much lower costs for handling and storage, with faster material movement than businesses that do not. The exceptions are establishments that move small items such as jewelry or large items such as cars. But even they can be improved. For instance, the distributors of [[costume jewelry]] normally use pallets in their [[warehouse]]s and car manufacturers use pallets to move components and spare parts.\n\nThe lack of a single international standard for pallets causes substantial continuing expense in international trade. A single standard is difficult because of the wide variety of needs a standard pallet would have to satisfy: passing doorways, fitting in standard containers, and bringing low labor costs. For example, organizations already handling large pallets often see no reason to pay the higher handling cost of using smaller pallets that can fit through doors.\n\n[[File:Truckload of pallets.jpg|thumb|A truckload of used wooden pallets in California]]\nDue to cost and a need to focus on core business, pallet pooling becomes more and more common. Some pallet suppliers supply users with reusable pallets, sometimes with integral tracking devices. A pallet management company can help supply, clean, repair, and reuse pallets.\n\nHeavy duty pallets are a form of [[reusable packaging]] and are designed to be used multiple times. Light weight pallets are designed for a single use.   In the EU, government legislation based on the [[Waste Framework Directive]] requires the reuse of packaging items in preference to recycling and disposal.\n\n==Standardization and regulation==\n\n===Dimensions===\nWooden pallets typically consist of three or four stringers that support several deckboards, on top of which goods are placed. In a pallet measurement, the first number is the stringer length and the second is the deckboard length. Square or nearly square pallets help a load resist tipping.\n\nTwo-way pallets are designed to be lifted by the deckboards. The standard 48x40 North American pallet, or GMA pallet, has stringers of 48 inches and deckboards of 40 inches, and was standardized by the [[Grocery Manufacturers Association]]. A standard wooden pallet ({{convert|48 x 40 x 6|in|cm|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) with a static load bearing capacity of {{convert|3|ST|LT t}} and a {{convert|1|ST|LT t|adj=on}} dynamic capacity, will weigh approximately {{convert|33 to 48|lbs|kg|abbr=on}} Lightweight plastic pallets can weigh as little as {{convert|3 to 15|lb|kg}}, while heavier models may weight up to {{convert|300|lb}}. \"Standard GMA pallets can hold up to {{convert|4,60|lbs|kg}}. GMA pallets typically weighs {{convert|37|lbs}}, and are {{convert|6+1/2|in}} tall. Their deck boards measure {{convert|3+1/4|in}} wide and are {{convert|5/16|in|mm}} thick each. Other dimensions of pallets have different weight capacities.\n\nHeavy duty IPPC Pallets are approximately {{convert|44|in|mm|0}} wide by {{convert|48|in|mm|0}} long, have three wood stringers that are a nominal {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} high by {{convert|3|in|mm|0}} wide timber, and weigh about {{convert|135|lbs}}. Their deck is fully covered by {{convert|30|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} plywood, and is painted in blue in European and Russian countries .\n\nFour-way pallets, or pallets for heavy loads (or general-purpose systems that might have heavy loads) are best lifted by their more rigid stringers. These pallets are usually heavier, bigger and more durable than two-way pallets.\n\nPallet users want pallets to easily pass through buildings, to stack and fit in [[warehouse|racks]], to be accessible to forklifts and pallet jacks and to function in automated [[warehouse]]s. To avoid shipping air, pallets should also pack tightly inside intermodal containers and vans.\n\nNo universally accepted standards for pallet dimensions exist. Companies and organizations utilize hundreds of different pallet sizes around the globe.<ref>{{cite report |ssrn=665064 |title=How Do Differing Standards Increase Trade Costs?

Extensively used in storage and warehousing, they are popular pallets for racking, with the right shape and size to be removed from transport and directly onto warehouse racking for storage.\n\nThe Australian Standard Pallet dates back to [[World War II]], while ISO containers date to the late 1950s. Although the pallet's dimensions pre-date the ISO containers, it requires less [[dunnage]], is square, and leaves less wasted space than other pallets, including the GMA pallet. In 2010, Australia adopted the globally accepted [[ISPM 15]] wood packaging material regulations (before this time it was hardwood and more expensive).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/import/general-info/ian/10/18-2010 |title=18-2010 - Adoption of bark tolerance for imports defined in the wood packaging standard ISPM 15 |accessdate=2010-06-25 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627200106/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/import/general-info/ian/10/18-2010 |archivedate=2010-06-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Standard-setting organizations===\nA number of different organizations and associations around the world work towards establishing and promulgating standards for pallets. Some strive to develop universal standards for pallet dimensions, types of material used in construction, performance standards, and testing procedures. Other organizations choose to focus on pallet standards for a specific industry (such as groceries) or type of material (such as wood).\n\n====ISO Technical Committee 51: Pallets for unit load method of materials handling====\nISO TC 51 states its scope of work entailing the \"standardization of pallets in general use in the form of platforms or trays on which goods may be packed to form unit loads for handling by mechanical devices\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/committee/48928.html |title=ISO/TC 51 \u2013 Pallets for unit load method of materials handling |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2019-01-31 }}</ref> The Technical Committee works in conjunction with other Technical Committees focused on transportation infrastructure to develop interrelated standards.

They often use steel pallets, steel straps with notched seals, outdoor plywood, and plastic film. The standard describes tests for stacking, transport, sling, forklift and pallet jack, impact, drop tests, tip, water-retention, and disassembly.\n\n====European Committee for Standardization (Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation)====\nIn addition to the other standards it publishes, the [[European Committee for Standardization]], also known as the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation (CEN), produces standards for pallets.  While the standards are voluntary in nature, many companies and organizations involved in transportation have adopted them. The major standard for pallets produced by CEN is ''ICS: 55.180.20 General purpose pallets''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cenorm.be/catweb/55.180.20.htm|title=Home|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Phytosanitary compliance===\n[[File:IPPC standard.png|thumb|IPPC marks on a pallet from Germany (DE)]]\n[[File:Wooden pallet - TAG ID - palette bois de manutention - Alain Van den Hende - licence CC40 - SAM 2741.jpg|thumb|IPPC marks on a pallet from Germany (DE)]]\n\nDue to the [[International Plant Protection Convention]] (abbreviated IPPC), most pallets shipped across national borders must be made of materials that are incapable of being a carrier of [[invasive species]] of [[insects]] and [[plant disease]]s.

These pallets are simple stringer pallets, and liftable from two sides.\n\nSlightly more complex [[hardwood]] block pallets, plastic pallets and metal pallets can be lifted from all four sides.  These costlier pallets usually require a deposit and are returned to the sender or resold as used.  Many \"four way\" pallets are color-coded according to the loads they can bear, and other attributes. [[Wood]] pallets can pose serious bio-hazard risks as they are susceptible to bacterial and chemical contamination, such as ''[[E. coli]]'' problems in food and produce transportation,{{cn|date=October 2019}} and even insect infestation, and thus the need for ISPM 15.\n\nWooden pallet construction specifications can depend on the pallet's intended use: general, FDA, storage, chemical, export; the expected load weight; type of wood desired: recycled, hard, soft, kiln dried or combo (new & recycle); and even the type of fasteners desired to hold the pallet together: staples or nails.\n\n===== Types =====\nAlthough pallets come in all manner of sizes and configurations, all pallets fall into two very broad categories: \"stringer\" pallets and \"block\" pallets.  Various software packages exist to assist the pallet maker in designing an appropriate pallet for a specific load, and to evaluate wood options to reduce costs.\n\n'''Stringer pallet'''\n\nStringer pallets are one of the original models of wooden pallets. They use a frame of three or more parallel pieces of timber (called stringers).  The top deckboards are then affixed to the stringers to create the pallet structure.  Stringer pallets can have a notch cut into them allowing \"four-way\" entry. Forklifts can lift a stringer pallet from all four directions, though lifting by the stringers is more secure. Stringer pallets no longer need to be built in or permanently attached to the pallet, making it possible to customize the basic pallet. Stringer pallets can be made of both wood and plastic.\n\n'''Block pallet'''\n\nBlock pallets  are typically stronger than stringer pallets. Block pallets utilize both parallel and perpendicular stringers to better facilitate efficient handling. A block pallet is also known as a \"four-way\" pallet, since a pallet-jack may be used from any side to move it.\n\n'''Carrier block'''{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}\nCarrier blocks are specialized pallets for [[Straddle carrier#Lumber carriers|lumber carriers]]\n\n'''Flush pallet'''\n\nFlush pallets are pallets with deck boards that are flush with the stringers and stringer boards along the ends and sides of the pallet.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nPerimeter base pallet\n\nAll stringer and some block pallets have \"unidirectional bases,\" i.e. bottom boards oriented in one direction.  While automated handling equipment can be designed for this, often it can operate faster and more effectively if the bottom edges of a pallet have bottom boards oriented in both directions.  For example, it may not need to turn a pallet to rack it, and operation is less sensitive to pallet orientation.\n\n'''Quality improvements'''\n\nThe least expensive way to improve a pallet is usually to specify better nails. With non-wood pallets, a controlled coefficient of friction is often helpful to prevent the pallet from slipping from forks and racks. Stiffer pallets are more durable, and are handled more easily by automated equipment. If a pallet does not need to be lifted from all four sides, two-way pallets with unnotched stringers may be used, with the additional benefits of added rigidity and strength. Specifying tolerances on flatness and water content may help the supplier meet target requirements. Inspection of pallets, whether in person or by a third-party (such as \"SPEQ\" inspected pallets) offer additional assurance of quality.\n\n===== Manufacture =====\nHere are the main processes that are used to manufacture wooden pallets:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.beinglist.com/about-pallets.html|title=Three minutes to learn about pallets}}</ref>\n\n* Material selection\n* Cutting wood plate / block\n* *Chamfering (depends on the demand)\n* Notching\n* Nailing wooden pallet\n\n==== Plastic pallet ====\nPlastic pallets are often made of new [[HDPE]] or recycled [[polyethylene terphthalate|PET]] (drink bottles). They are usually extremely durable, lasting for a hundred trips or more,<ref name=\"Raballandibid\">Raballand, ibid., pg11</ref> and resist weathering, rot, chemicals and corrosion.  The benefits of plastic pallets over wood pallets include the ability to be easily sanitized, resistance to odor, fire retardancy, longer service life span, durability and better product protection, non-splintering, and lighter weight, thus saving on transportation and labor costs and making them safer and more environmentally friendly.They often stack.  Plastic pallets are exempt by inspection for biosafety concerns, and easily sanitize for international shipping.  HDPE is impervious to most acids and toxic chemicals clean from them more easily.  Some plastic pallets can collapse from plastic [[creep (deformation)|creep]] if used to store heavy loads for long periods.  Plastic pallets cannot easily be repaired, and can be ten times as expensive as hardwood,<ref name=\"Raballandibid\" /> so they are often used by logistics service providers who can profit from their durability and stackability.  The large supply chains have increased the use of plastic pallets as many organisations seek to reduce costs through waste, transport and health & safety.  Pallets and [[dolly (trailer)|dollies]] can be combined (for example the Pally)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsmsearch.com/stories/articles/-/handling_storing/goods_lifts/combined_pallet_and_dolly_unit/|title=HSM MAGAZINE - Home|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref> ,eliminating pallet instability and the need for additional lifting equipment along with creating valuable space in busy operating environments. They also deliver significant time and cost savings by reducing supply chain handling. Plastics' reusability has contributed to an increase in usage of plastic pallets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptonline.com/articles/plastic-pallets-gain-ground-in-an-eco-conscious-world|title=Plastic Pallets Gain Ground In an Eco-Conscious World|author=Grande, Joseph A.|date=September 2008|publisher=Plastics Technology|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nPlastic pallets are produced and used widely in the U.S. and Europe, spurred by the adoption of the ISPM 15.

[[Paper]] pallets are also used where recycling and easy disposal is important.  New designs of ecopallets have been made from just two flat pieces of corrugated board (no glue/staples) and weigh just {{convert|4.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, offering dramatic freight savings.  Ecopallets are also ISPM 15 exempt, negating fumigation and barrier \"slip\" sheets. They are cleaner, safer, and provide a cost-saving eco-friendly alternative to other pallet materials. Some engineered Corrugated pallets offer a significant reduced height, providing substantial freight cost reduction. Low profile hand pallet trucks allow picking up pallets as low as 25&nbsp;mm.\n\n==== Steel pallet ====\n[[Steel]] pallets are strong and are used for heavy loads, high-stacking loads, long term dry storage, and loads moved by abusive logistic systems. They are often used for military ammunition.<ref>MIL-STD-1660, ibid., 4.8.3</ref> Metal pallets make up less than 1% of the market. Materials include carbon steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. Of these, carbon steel offers excellent durability at the lowest cost. Stainless steel doesn\u2019t require a paint coating, and is preferred for such applications as clean room environments. Carbon steel units are expensive compared to wood, and stainless and aluminum cost about 2\u20133 times that of carbon steel. Long term costs, however, can be lower than wood. General advantages of metal pallets are high strength and stiffness, excellent durability, bug free, no splinters, sanitary, and recyclable. Disadvantages include a higher initial price, significant weight, low friction, and susceptibility to rusting (carbon steel). Metal is primarily used in captive or closed loop environments where durability and product protection are key performance requirements. Metal units today are increasingly price competitive and lighter in weight. Primary industries that use metal pallets include automotive, pharmaceutical, lawn tractors, motorcycles, and tires.<ref>Pallets \u2013 Where Form Meets Function By Peter Hamner, Center for Unit Loan Design, Virginia Tech</ref>\n\n[[Aluminum]] pallets are stronger than wood or plastic, lighter than steel, and resist weather, rotting, plastic creep and corrosion.  They are sometimes used for air-freight, long-term outdoor or at-sea storage, or military transport.\n\n==History==\nSkids date back to Ancient Egypt and Ancient Mesopotamia, at least as far back as the 1st millennium B.C.<ref>\"Remains of timber, the lengths laid upon the pavement parallel to one another (fig. 114) where a large number of blocks were found, suggest skids upon which they were moved\".

The earliest may be a U.S. patent on a skid from 1924 describing Howard T. Hallowell's \"Lift Truck Platform\".<ref>[[United States Patent Office]], [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1508183.pdf Lift-Truck Platform], accessed 21 January 2017</ref> In the late 1930s, pallets became more commonplace with the newer forklift types. George Raymond filed for a patent in 1938 (granted US Patent 2178646 in 1939<ref name=\"Raymond\">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2178646?dq=george+raymond+pallet&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oO--VI-zBc_isAS5hYH4Dg&ved=0CB4Q6wEwAA|title=US Patent 2178646 A|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>) for a pallet designed to complement a new pallet jack design; the essential features of both are still in common use today. A 1939 patent from Carl Clark shows type of pallet with steel stringers. Wartime developments were often just patented after the war, so there is a patent from Robert Braun on a four-way pallet in 1945, and a patent from Norman Cahners (a U.S. Navy supply officer) shows a disposable pallet in 1949. The principle of a modern four-way pallet is described by Darling Graeme in 1949.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org.in/sf/Pallets.pdf |title=Pallets \u2013 An efficient and safe way of material handling |last=Singh |first=R.

The [[National Fire Protection Association]] requires that both types \"shall be stored outside or in a detached structure\" unless protected by [[fire sprinkler system|fire sprinklers]].<ref>NFPA 13</ref>\n\n===Contamination risks===\nItems made from pallet wood are likely to be durable and demonstrate good weather resistance due to these treatments. However, close contact with pallet wood or inhalation of dusts from sanding or sawing can be a source of exposure to pesticide and fungicide chemicals. It is likely that the January 2010 recall of Johnson and Johnson Tylenol and other drugs was due to their being stored on wooden pallets that had been treated with the fungicide/pesticide 2,4,6-tribromophenol. This chemical can be degraded by molds to produce 2,4,6-tribromoanisole whose strong, musty odor caused consumers to complain.<ref>Chemical & Engineering News, January 25, 2010, p. 18</ref> There is no acute or chronic health data on 2,4,6-tribromoanisole,<ref>Sigma Aldrich, MSDS, 2009</ref> but it is believed that the contaminated drugs caused nausea and other health effects in some people.\n\nWood pallets used to transport food can possibly harbor pathogens such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and [[Listeria]]. A press release by the [[National Consumers League]] announced the testing of 70 wood pallets and 70 plastic pallets that have been loaded with perishable products and shipped to an end user was shipped overnight to an independent microbiology lab for testing. The results came back with 10 percent of the wood pallets (7 pallets) positive for ''E. coli'' and 1.4 percent (1 pallet) positive on the plastic pallets.<ref>[[CBS News]]</ref>\n\n== Pallet boxes ==\nPallet boxes are pallets with four pallet walls on top and possibly a lid. Unlike pallets, pallet boxes can be stacked when they are fully loaded. They may also be fitted with a lid during stacking for stability reasons.\n\nBy stacking pallet boxes on each other space can be used more efficiently, thus are able to save warehouse space and truck load capacity.\n\nAnother advantage of pallet boxes is that the goods are stored safely and are not easily damaged during logistic movements and transport.\n\nFurthermore, there are collapsible pallet boxes from which the pallet walls can be laid flat on the pallet. In this way, less space is required during empty return transport.\n\n[[Bulk box]]es are closely related;  they are usually large separate boxes shipped on pallets.\n\n==Alternative uses==\n[[File:EUR-pallets stacked 1.jpg|thumb|Stacked pallets]]\n[[File:NaplesBench.jpg|thumb|upright|Improvised street bench in [[Naples]] (Italy), made from wooden EuroPallet]]\nOld and discarded wooden pallets can be used in [[pallet crafts]] and various [[furniture]] pieces.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.decoist.com/2012-02-01/ultimate-pallet-furniture-collection-58-unique-ideas/ | title=Ultimate Pallet Furniture Collection: 58 Unique Ideas | publisher=Decoist | accessdate=19 May 2014 | author=Ion, Alex| date=February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDiscarded wooden pallets should not be used for firewood or crafts unless it has been determined that the wood in these pallets has not been treated with wood preservatives, fungicides and/or pesticides. Various [[pyrethrins]] and [[propiconazole]] are common treatments for wooden pallets. In addition, imported palletized goods are routinely fumigated with highly toxic pesticides. During use, harmful materials or chemicals also may spill on the pallet wood and be absorbed.\n\nCraft publications have advised readers to use pallets to build a [[skateboarding]] obstacle called a manual pad, barricades during amateur [[paintball]] games, or other sport-related items. Other publications have suggested using pallet wood for small animal cages or fences. Pallet wood has been recycled for use as furniture wood by at least one company.\n\nThe acoustic guitar maker [[Taylor Guitars]] once produced a high quality \"pallet guitar\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taylorguitars.com/Guitars/Archive/Older/pallet.html |title=Pallet Guitar |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120132847/http://taylorguitars.com/Guitars/Archive/Older/pallet.html |archivedate=November 20, 2008}}</ref> made from pallet wood, in order to demonstrate the importance of construction technique versus expensive exotic woods.\n\nI-Beam Design, an architecture and interior design firm based in New York, NY won an award in a 1999 competition sponsored by [[Architecture for humanity|Architecture for Humanity]] for their submission of \u201cThe Pallet House\u201d, a design solution to house the returning refugees of Kosovo. Full-scale prototypes of The Pallet House were featured in the \"Casa per Tutti\" Exhibit at the Milan Triennale and the Earth Awards in HRH Prince Charles\u2019 Royal Gardens as part of The Prince\u2019s Charities Foundation\u2019s Conference on a Sustainable Future organized in collaboration with IBM and The Financial Times. The Pallet House is an affordable transitional home that can become permanent over time. It can be used as refugee housing or as affordable housing as well. Due to the nature of the Pallet module, the wall cavity can be insulated with a variety of materials that are accessible to the user.\n\nThe two Austrian students ''Andreas Claus Schnetzer'' and ''Gregor Pils'' from the [[University of Vienna]] created a home entitled ''Pallet house'' and as the name suggests, reused pallets to form a modular, energy efficient and affordable housing. The idea was born in 2008 during a competition and the Pallet house has been exhibited in several European cities including Venice, Vienna, Linz and Grenoble. It could become a clever approach to low income housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/55205/pallet-house-schnetzer-andreas-claus-pils-gregor/|title=Pallet House / Schnetzer Andreas Claus + Pils Gregor|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Denver, Colorado]] was host to an Inaugural Pallet-Fest festival, which showcased the versatility of pallets and included large art structures made with [[Upcycling|upcycled]] materials, a pallet maze, a pallet [[amphitheater]] with live musical performances, sustainable living demonstrations, an upcycled fashion show, vendors and artists selling upcycled goods, and a [[parkour]] course.

Galvanized steel pallets are fireproof and rust resistant.]]\nA '''pallet''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|p|\u00e6|l|\u1d7b|t}}) (also called a '''skid''') is a flat transport structure, which supports goods in a stable fashion while being lifted by a [[forklift]], a [[pallet jack]], a [[Loader (equipment)|front loader]], a [[Jack (mechanical)|jacking device]], or an erect crane. A pallet is the structural foundation of a [[unit load]] which allows handling and storage efficiencies.{{cn|date=October 2019}} Goods or [[shipping container]]s are often placed on a pallet secured with [[strapping]], [[stretch wrap]] or [[shrink wrap]] and shipped. Since its invention in the twentieth century, its use has dramatically supplanted older forms of crating like the [[wooden box]] and the [[wooden barrel]], as it works well with modern packaging like [[corrugated box]]es and [[intermodal container]]s commonly used for bulk shipping.\n\nWhile most pallets are wooden, pallets can also be made of plastic, metal, paper, and [[recycled materials]]. Each material has advantages and disadvantages.\n\n==Overview==\n[[Containerization]] for transport has spurred the use of pallets because shipping containers have the smooth, level surfaces needed for easy pallet movement. Many pallets can handle a load of {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Today, about half a billion pallets are made each year and about two billion pallets are in use across the [[United States]] alone.\n\nPallets make it easier to move heavy stacks. Loads with pallets under them can be hauled by forklift trucks of different sizes, or even by hand-pumped and hand-drawn pallet jacks. Movement is easy on a wide, strong, flat floor: concrete is excellent. The greatest investment needed for economical pallet use is in the construction of commercial or industrial buildings. Passage through doors and buildings must be possible. To address this issue, some later pallet standards (the europallet and the U.S. Military {{convert|35|\u00d7|45.5|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are designed to pass through standard doorways.\n\nOrganizations using standard pallets for loading and unloading can have much lower costs for handling and storage, with faster material movement than businesses that do not. The exceptions are establishments that move small items such as jewelry or large items such as cars. But even they can be improved. For instance, the distributors of [[costume jewelry]] normally use pallets in their [[warehouse]]s and car manufacturers use pallets to move components and spare parts.\n\nThe lack of a single international standard for pallets causes substantial continuing expense in international trade. A single standard is difficult because of the wide variety of needs a standard pallet would have to satisfy: passing doorways, fitting in standard containers, and bringing low labor costs. For example, organizations already handling large pallets often see no reason to pay the higher handling cost of using smaller pallets that can fit through doors.\n\n[[File:Truckload of pallets.jpg|thumb|A truckload of used wooden pallets in California]]\nDue to cost and a need to focus on core business, pallet pooling becomes more and more common. Some pallet suppliers supply users with reusable pallets, sometimes with integral tracking devices. A pallet management company can help supply, clean, repair, and reuse pallets.\n\nHeavy duty pallets are a form of [[reusable packaging]] and are designed to be used multiple times. Light weight pallets are designed for a single use.   In the EU, government legislation based on the [[Waste Framework Directive]] requires the reuse of packaging items in preference to recycling and disposal.\n\n==Standardization and regulation==\n\n===Dimensions===\nWooden pallets typically consist of three or four stringers that support several deckboards, on top of which goods are placed. In a pallet measurement, the first number is the stringer length and the second is the deckboard length. Square or nearly square pallets help a load resist tipping.\n\nTwo-way pallets are designed to be lifted by the deckboards. The standard 48x40 North American pallet, or GMA pallet, has stringers of 48 inches and deckboards of 40 inches, and was standardized by the [[Grocery Manufacturers Association]]. A standard wooden pallet ({{convert|48 x 40 x 6|in|cm|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) with a static load bearing capacity of {{convert|3|ST|LT t}} and a {{convert|1|ST|LT t|adj=on}} dynamic capacity, will weigh approximately {{convert|33 to 48|lbs|kg|abbr=on}} Lightweight plastic pallets can weigh as little as {{convert|3 to 15|lb|kg}}, while heavier models may weight up to {{convert|300|lb}}. \"Standard GMA pallets can hold up to {{convert|4,60|lbs|kg}}. GMA pallets typically weighs {{convert|37|lbs}}, and are {{convert|6+1/2|in}} tall. Their deck boards measure {{convert|3+1/4|in}} wide and are {{convert|5/16|in|mm}} thick each. Other dimensions of pallets have different weight capacities.\n\nHeavy duty IPPC Pallets are approximately {{convert|44|in|mm|0}} wide by {{convert|48|in|mm|0}} long, have three wood stringers that are a nominal {{convert|4|in|mm|0}} high by {{convert|3|in|mm|0}} wide timber, and weigh about {{convert|135|lbs}}. Their deck is fully covered by {{convert|30|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} plywood, and is painted in blue in European and Russian countries .\n\nFour-way pallets, or pallets for heavy loads (or general-purpose systems that might have heavy loads) are best lifted by their more rigid stringers. These pallets are usually heavier, bigger and more durable than two-way pallets.\n\nPallet users want pallets to easily pass through buildings, to stack and fit in [[warehouse|racks]], to be accessible to forklifts and pallet jacks and to function in automated [[warehouse]]s. To avoid shipping air, pallets should also pack tightly inside intermodal containers and vans.\n\nNo universally accepted standards for pallet dimensions exist. Companies and organizations utilize hundreds of different pallet sizes around the globe.<ref>{{cite report |ssrn=665064 |title=How Do Differing Standards Increase Trade Costs?

It is a square pallet originally made of hardwood {{convert|1165|\u00d7|1165|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in size which fits perfectly in the [[RACE (container)|RACE container]] of the Australian Railway. They are ill-suited for the standard 20 feet (6.1 m) and 40 feet (12 m) ISO shipping containers used around the globe.[1] Australian standard pallets are usually manufactured in hardwood, but 1165 \u00d7 1165&nbsp;mm pallets can also be manufactured using lighter timber suitable for use as disposable pallets using 16 millimetre boards. Extensively used in storage and warehousing, they are popular pallets for racking, with the right shape and size to be removed from transport and directly onto warehouse racking for storage.\n\nThe Australian Standard Pallet dates back to [[World War II]], while ISO containers date to the late 1950s. Although the pallet's dimensions pre-date the ISO containers, it requires less [[dunnage]], is square, and leaves less wasted space than other pallets, including the GMA pallet. In 2010, Australia adopted the globally accepted [[ISPM 15]] wood packaging material regulations (before this time it was hardwood and more expensive).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/import/general-info/ian/10/18-2010 |title=18-2010 - Adoption of bark tolerance for imports defined in the wood packaging standard ISPM 15 |accessdate=2010-06-25 |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627200106/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/import/general-info/ian/10/18-2010 |archivedate=2010-06-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Standard-setting organizations===\nA number of different organizations and associations around the world work towards establishing and promulgating standards for pallets. Some strive to develop universal standards for pallet dimensions, types of material used in construction, performance standards, and testing procedures. Other organizations choose to focus on pallet standards for a specific industry (such as groceries) or type of material (such as wood).\n\n====ISO Technical Committee 51: Pallets for unit load method of materials handling====\nISO TC 51 states its scope of work entailing the \"standardization of pallets in general use in the form of platforms or trays on which goods may be packed to form unit loads for handling by mechanical devices\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/committee/48928.html |title=ISO/TC 51 \u2013 Pallets for unit load method of materials handling |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2019-01-31 }}</ref> The Technical Committee works in conjunction with other Technical Committees focused on transportation infrastructure to develop interrelated standards.

They often use steel pallets, steel straps with notched seals, outdoor plywood, and plastic film. The standard describes tests for stacking, transport, sling, forklift and pallet jack, impact, drop tests, tip, water-retention, and disassembly.\n\n====European Committee for Standardization (Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation)====\nIn addition to the other standards it publishes, the [[European Committee for Standardization]], also known as the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en de Normalisation (CEN), produces standards for pallets.  While the standards are voluntary in nature, many companies and organizations involved in transportation have adopted them. The major standard for pallets produced by CEN is ''ICS: 55.180.20 General purpose pallets''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cenorm.be/catweb/55.180.20.htm|title=Home|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Phytosanitary compliance===\n[[File:IPPC standard.png|thumb|IPPC marks on a pallet from Germany (DE)]]\n[[File:Wooden pallet - TAG ID - palette bois de manutention - Alain Van den Hende - licence CC40 - SAM 2741.jpg|thumb|IPPC marks on a pallet from Germany (DE)]]\n\nDue to the [[International Plant Protection Convention]] (abbreviated IPPC), most pallets shipped across national borders must be made of materials that are incapable of being a carrier of [[invasive species]] of [[insects]] and [[plant disease]]s.

These pallets are simple stringer pallets, and liftable from two sides.\n\nSlightly more complex [[hardwood]] block pallets, plastic pallets and metal pallets can be lifted from all four sides.  These costlier pallets usually require a deposit and are returned to the sender or resold as used.  Many \"four way\" pallets are color-coded according to the loads they can bear, and other attributes. [[Wood]] pallets can pose serious bio-hazard risks as they are susceptible to bacterial and chemical contamination, such as ''[[E. coli]]'' problems in food and produce transportation,{{cn|date=October 2019}} and even insect infestation, and thus the need for ISPM 15.\n\nWooden pallet construction specifications can depend on the pallet's intended use: general, FDA, storage, chemical, export; the expected load weight; type of wood desired: recycled, hard, soft, kiln dried or combo (new & recycle); and even the type of fasteners desired to hold the pallet together: staples or nails.\n\n===== Types =====\nAlthough pallets come in all manner of sizes and configurations, all pallets fall into two very broad categories: \"stringer\" pallets and \"block\" pallets.  Various software packages exist to assist the pallet maker in designing an appropriate pallet for a specific load, and to evaluate wood options to reduce costs.\n\n'''Stringer pallet'''\n\nStringer pallets are one of the original models of wooden pallets. They use a frame of three or more parallel pieces of timber (called stringers).  The top deckboards are then affixed to the stringers to create the pallet structure.  Stringer pallets can have a notch cut into them allowing \"four-way\" entry. Forklifts can lift a stringer pallet from all four directions, though lifting by the stringers is more secure. Stringer pallets no longer need to be built in or permanently attached to the pallet, making it possible to customize the basic pallet. Stringer pallets can be made of both wood and plastic.\n\n'''Block pallet'''\n\nBlock pallets  are typically stronger than stringer pallets. Block pallets utilize both parallel and perpendicular stringers to better facilitate efficient handling. A block pallet is also known as a \"four-way\" pallet, since a pallet-jack may be used from any side to move it.\n\n'''Carrier block'''{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}\nCarrier blocks are specialized pallets for [[Straddle carrier#Lumber carriers|lumber carriers]]\n\n'''Flush pallet'''\n\nFlush pallets are pallets with deck boards that are flush with the stringers and stringer boards along the ends and sides of the pallet.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nPerimeter base pallet\n\nAll stringer and some block pallets have \"unidirectional bases,\" i.e. bottom boards oriented in one direction.  While automated handling equipment can be designed for this, often it can operate faster and more effectively if the bottom edges of a pallet have bottom boards oriented in both directions.  For example, it may not need to turn a pallet to rack it, and operation is less sensitive to pallet orientation.\n\n'''Quality improvements'''\n\nThe least expensive way to improve a pallet is usually to specify better nails. With non-wood pallets, a controlled coefficient of friction is often helpful to prevent the pallet from slipping from forks and racks. Stiffer pallets are more durable, and are handled more easily by automated equipment. If a pallet does not need to be lifted from all four sides, two-way pallets with unnotched stringers may be used, with the additional benefits of added rigidity and strength. Specifying tolerances on flatness and water content may help the supplier meet target requirements. Inspection of pallets, whether in person or by a third-party (such as \"SPEQ\" inspected pallets) offer additional assurance of quality.\n\n===== Manufacture =====\nHere are the main processes that are used to manufacture wooden pallets:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.beinglist.com/about-pallets.html|title=Three minutes to learn about pallets}}</ref>\n\n* Material selection\n* Cutting wood plate / block\n* *Chamfering (depends on the demand)\n* Notching\n* Nailing wooden pallet\n\n==== Plastic pallet ====\nPlastic pallets are often made of new [[HDPE]] or recycled [[polyethylene terphthalate|PET]] (drink bottles). They are usually extremely durable, lasting for a hundred trips or more,<ref name=\"Raballandibid\">Raballand, ibid., pg11</ref> and resist weathering, rot, chemicals and corrosion.  The benefits of plastic pallets over wood pallets include the ability to be easily sanitized, resistance to odor, fire retardancy, longer service life span, durability and better product protection, non-splintering, and lighter weight, thus saving on transportation and labor costs and making them safer and more environmentally friendly.They often stack.  Plastic pallets are exempt by inspection for biosafety concerns, and easily sanitize for international shipping.  HDPE is impervious to most acids and toxic chemicals clean from them more easily.  Some plastic pallets can collapse from plastic [[creep (deformation)|creep]] if used to store heavy loads for long periods.  Plastic pallets cannot easily be repaired, and can be ten times as expensive as hardwood,<ref name=\"Raballandibid\" /> so they are often used by logistics service providers who can profit from their durability and stackability.  The large supply chains have increased the use of plastic pallets as many organisations seek to reduce costs through waste, transport and health & safety.  Pallets and [[dolly (trailer)|dollies]] can be combined (for example the Pally)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsmsearch.com/stories/articles/-/handling_storing/goods_lifts/combined_pallet_and_dolly_unit/|title=HSM MAGAZINE - Home|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref> ,eliminating pallet instability and the need for additional lifting equipment along with creating valuable space in busy operating environments. They also deliver significant time and cost savings by reducing supply chain handling. Plastics' reusability has contributed to an increase in usage of plastic pallets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptonline.com/articles/plastic-pallets-gain-ground-in-an-eco-conscious-world|title=Plastic Pallets Gain Ground In an Eco-Conscious World|author=Grande, Joseph A.|date=September 2008|publisher=Plastics Technology|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nPlastic pallets are produced and used widely in the U.S. and Europe, spurred by the adoption of the ISPM 15.

[[Paper]] pallets are also used where recycling and easy disposal is important.  New designs of ecopallets have been made from just two flat pieces of corrugated board (no glue/staples) and weigh just {{convert|4.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, offering dramatic freight savings.  Ecopallets are also ISPM 15 exempt, negating fumigation and barrier \"slip\" sheets. They are cleaner, safer, and provide a cost-saving eco-friendly alternative to other pallet materials. Some engineered Corrugated pallets offer a significant reduced height, providing substantial freight cost reduction. Low profile hand pallet trucks allow picking up pallets as low as 25&nbsp;mm.\n\n==== Steel pallet ====\n[[Steel]] pallets are strong and are used for heavy loads, high-stacking loads, long term dry storage, and loads moved by abusive logistic systems. They are often used for military ammunition.<ref>MIL-STD-1660, ibid., 4.8.3</ref> Metal pallets make up less than 1% of the market. Materials include carbon steel, stainless steel, and aluminum. Of these, carbon steel offers excellent durability at the lowest cost. Stainless steel doesn\u2019t require a paint coating, and is preferred for such applications as clean room environments. Carbon steel units are expensive compared to wood, and stainless and aluminum cost about 2\u20133 times that of carbon steel. Long term costs, however, can be lower than wood. General advantages of metal pallets are high strength and stiffness, excellent durability, bug free, no splinters, sanitary, and recyclable. Disadvantages include a higher initial price, significant weight, low friction, and susceptibility to rusting (carbon steel). Metal is primarily used in captive or closed loop environments where durability and product protection are key performance requirements. Metal units today are increasingly price competitive and lighter in weight. Primary industries that use metal pallets include automotive, pharmaceutical, lawn tractors, motorcycles, and tires.<ref>Pallets \u2013 Where Form Meets Function By Peter Hamner, Center for Unit Loan Design, Virginia Tech</ref>\n\n[[Aluminum]] pallets are stronger than wood or plastic, lighter than steel, and resist weather, rotting, plastic creep and corrosion.  They are sometimes used for air-freight, long-term outdoor or at-sea storage, or military transport.\n\n==History==\nSkids date back to Ancient Egypt and Ancient Mesopotamia, at least as far back as the 1st millennium B.C.<ref>\"Remains of timber, the lengths laid upon the pavement parallel to one another (fig. 114) where a large number of blocks were found, suggest skids upon which they were moved\". (Loud, 1936: 108).

The earliest may be a U.S. patent on a skid from 1924 describing Howard T. Hallowell's \"Lift Truck Platform\".<ref>[[United States Patent Office]], [http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1508183.pdf Lift-Truck Platform], accessed 21 January 2017</ref> In the late 1930s, pallets became more commonplace with the newer forklift types. George Raymond filed for a patent in 1938 (granted US Patent 2178646 in 1939<ref name=\"Raymond\">{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2178646?dq=george+raymond+pallet&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oO--VI-zBc_isAS5hYH4Dg&ved=0CB4Q6wEwAA|title=US Patent 2178646 A|accessdate=20 January 2015}}</ref>) for a pallet designed to complement a new pallet jack design; the essential features of both are still in common use today. A 1939 patent from Carl Clark shows type of pallet with steel stringers. Wartime developments were often just patented after the war, so there is a patent from Robert Braun on a four-way pallet in 1945, and a patent from Norman Cahners (a U.S. Navy supply officer) shows a disposable pallet in 1949. The principle of a modern four-way pallet is described by Darling Graeme in 1949.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bis.org.in/sf/Pallets.pdf |title=Pallets \u2013 An efficient and safe way of material handling |last=Singh |first=R.

The [[National Fire Protection Association]] requires that both types \"shall be stored outside or in a detached structure\" unless protected by [[fire sprinkler system|fire sprinklers]].<ref>NFPA 13</ref>\n\n===Contamination risks===\nItems made from pallet wood are likely to be durable and demonstrate good weather resistance due to these treatments. However, close contact with pallet wood or inhalation of dusts from sanding or sawing can be a source of exposure to pesticide and fungicide chemicals. It is likely that the January 2010 recall of Johnson and Johnson Tylenol and other drugs was due to their being stored on wooden pallets that had been treated with the fungicide/pesticide 2,4,6-tribromophenol. This chemical can be degraded by molds to produce 2,4,6-tribromoanisole whose strong, musty odor caused consumers to complain.<ref>Chemical & Engineering News, January 25, 2010, p. 18</ref> There is no acute or chronic health data on 2,4,6-tribromoanisole,<ref>Sigma Aldrich, MSDS, 2009</ref> but it is believed that the contaminated drugs caused nausea and other health effects in some people.\n\nWood pallets used to transport food can possibly harbor pathogens such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and [[Listeria]]. A press release by the [[National Consumers League]] announced the testing of 70 wood pallets and 70 plastic pallets that have been loaded with perishable products and shipped to an end user was shipped overnight to an independent microbiology lab for testing. The results came back with 10 percent of the wood pallets (7 pallets) positive for ''E. coli'' and 1.4 percent (1 pallet) positive on the plastic pallets.<ref>[[CBS News]]</ref>\n\n== Pallet boxes ==\nPallet boxes are pallets with four pallet walls on top and possibly a lid. Unlike pallets, pallet boxes can be stacked when they are fully loaded. They may also be fitted with a lid during stacking for stability reasons.\n\nBy stacking pallet boxes on each other space can be used more efficiently, thus are able to save warehouse space and truck load capacity.\n\nAnother advantage of pallet boxes is that the goods are stored safely and are not easily damaged during logistic movements and transport.\n\nFurthermore, there are collapsible pallet boxes from which the pallet walls can be laid flat on the pallet. In this way, less space is required during empty return transport.\n\n[[Bulk box]]es are closely related;  they are usually large separate boxes shipped on pallets.\n\n==Alternative uses==\n[[File:EUR-pallets stacked 1.jpg|thumb|Stacked pallets]]\n[[File:NaplesBench.jpg|thumb|upright|Improvised street bench in [[Naples]] (Italy), made from wooden EuroPallet]]\nOld and discarded wooden pallets can be used in [[pallet crafts]] and various [[furniture]] pieces.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.decoist.com/2012-02-01/ultimate-pallet-furniture-collection-58-unique-ideas/ | title=Ultimate Pallet Furniture Collection: 58 Unique Ideas | publisher=Decoist | accessdate=19 May 2014 | author=Ion, Alex| date=February 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDiscarded wooden pallets should not be used for firewood or crafts unless it has been determined that the wood in these pallets has not been treated with wood preservatives, fungicides and/or pesticides. Various [[pyrethrins]] and [[propiconazole]] are common treatments for wooden pallets. In addition, imported palletized goods are routinely fumigated with highly toxic pesticides. During use, harmful materials or chemicals also may spill on the pallet wood and be absorbed.\n\nCraft publications have advised readers to use pallets to build a [[skateboarding]] obstacle called a manual pad, barricades during amateur [[paintball]] games, or other sport-related items. Other publications have suggested using pallet wood for small animal cages or fences. Pallet wood has been recycled for use as furniture wood by at least one company.\n\nThe acoustic guitar maker [[Taylor Guitars]] once produced a high quality \"pallet guitar\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taylorguitars.com/Guitars/Archive/Older/pallet.html |title=Pallet Guitar |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120132847/http://taylorguitars.com/Guitars/Archive/Older/pallet.html |archivedate=November 20, 2008}}</ref> made from pallet wood, in order to demonstrate the importance of construction technique versus expensive exotic woods.\n\nI-Beam Design, an architecture and interior design firm based in New York, NY won an award in a 1999 competition sponsored by [[Architecture for humanity|Architecture for Humanity]] for their submission of \u201cThe Pallet House\u201d, a design solution to house the returning refugees of Kosovo. Full-scale prototypes of The Pallet House were featured in the \"Casa per Tutti\" Exhibit at the Milan Triennale and the Earth Awards in HRH Prince Charles\u2019 Royal Gardens as part of The Prince\u2019s Charities Foundation\u2019s Conference on a Sustainable Future organized in collaboration with IBM and The Financial Times. The Pallet House is an affordable transitional home that can become permanent over time. It can be used as refugee housing or as affordable housing as well. Due to the nature of the Pallet module, the wall cavity can be insulated with a variety of materials that are accessible to the user.\n\nThe two Austrian students ''Andreas Claus Schnetzer'' and ''Gregor Pils'' from the [[University of Vienna]] created a home entitled ''Pallet house'' and as the name suggests, reused pallets to form a modular, energy efficient and affordable housing. The idea was born in 2008 during a competition and the Pallet house has been exhibited in several European cities including Venice, Vienna, Linz and Grenoble. It could become a clever approach to low income housing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/55205/pallet-house-schnetzer-andreas-claus-pils-gregor/|title=Pallet House / Schnetzer Andreas Claus + Pils Gregor|date=7 April 2010|accessdate=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Denver, Colorado]] was host to an Inaugural Pallet-Fest festival, which showcased the versatility of pallets and included large art structures made with [[Upcycling|upcycled]] materials, a pallet maze, a pallet [[amphitheater]] with live musical performances, sustainable living demonstrations, an upcycled fashion show, vendors and artists selling upcycled goods, and a [[parkour]] course.
