The son of the admiral [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]], he had a distinguished naval career which spanned from 1932 to 1958. He served in the [[Second World War]] and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his role in the sinking of the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}}.\n\nAs a first-class cricketer, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm [[Seam bowling|medium pace bowler]]. He began his playing career with [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in 1936, but found his availability limited due to his commitments as a naval officer. With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]]. He played [[county cricket]] for Hampshire in 1947 and 1948, but played the majority of his first-class cricket after the war for the [[Combined Services cricket team]]. He scored over 1,000 runs in his first-class career, which included four centuries.\n\nIn September 2018, he became the [[Lists of oldest cricketers#Longest-lived first-class cricketers|longest-lived first-class cricketer]], surpassing the previous record of 103 years and 344 days held by [[Jim Hutchinson]], having been the oldest living first-class cricketer since September 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nThe son of the [[Royal Navy]] admiral and theologian [[Errol Manners|Sir Errol Manners]] (1883&ndash;1953) and his wife, Florence Maud Harrison (1883&ndash;1967), he was born in [[Exeter]] in September 1914.<ref name=\"TIMES\">{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-obituary-pwm9ntwlb |title=Lieutenant-Commander John Manners obituary |date=2020-03-16 |work=[[The Times]] |accessdate=2020-03-18 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was descended from [[John Manners, 2nd Duke of Rutland]].<ref name=\"OBIT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/03/09/lieutenant-commander-john-manners-naval-officer-sank-u-boat/ |title=Lieutenant Commander John Manners, naval officer who sank a U-boat and played cricket for Hampshire \u2013 obituary |date=2019-03-09 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2019-03-15 |url-access=subscription}}</ref> He was educated at Ferndown School,<ref name=\"IND\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/john-manners-death-cricket-royal-navy-second-world-war-a9408856.html |title=John Manners: Naval war hero and world\u2019s oldest former first-class cricketer |first=Kenneth |last=Shenton |date=2020-03-27 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2020-03-31}}</ref> before attending [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth College]] as a cadet from the age of 13, following in a family tradition of attending the college.<ref name=\"UNIT\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/cricket/story/_/id/24602746/john-manners-former-hampshire-batsman-becomes-oldest-living-first-class-cricketer |title=John Manners, former Hampshire batsman, becomes oldest living first-class cricketer |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=2018-09-13}}</ref> His time as a cadet saw him visit the [[British West Indies|West Indies]] and appear for the college in the schools' match at [[Lord's]] in 1930.<ref name=\"OBIT\"/>\n\n==Early naval and cricket career==\nManners was commissioned as a [[midshipman]] in the [[Royal Navy]] in September 1932, before being made an acting-[[sub-lieutenant]] in January 1935.

He served in the [[Second World War]] and held a number of commands, in addition to earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] for his role in the sinking of the [[German submarine U-1274|German submarine ''U-1274'']] in April 1945 while commanding officer aboard {{HMS|Viceroy|D91|6}}.\n\nAs a first-class cricketer, Manners was a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm [[Seam bowling|medium pace bowler]].

With his first-class career further interrupted by the war, Manners returned to first-class cricket in 1947 after securing a shore based position at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]].
