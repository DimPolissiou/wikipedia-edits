This project, initially a [[ship breaking]] facility, was approved by [[Li Xiannian]] on January 31, 1979. In April 1979, Xi Zhongxun and other Guangdong officials presented in [[Beijing]] a proposal to give broader flexibility to the coastal provinces of Guangdong and [[Fujian]] to attract [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]], with additional exemptions in four cities, namely [[Shenzhen Special Economic Zone|Shenzhen]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]] region, [[Zhuhai]] and [[Shantou]] in Guangdong and [[Xiamen]] (Amoy) in Fujian Province.

Since 1988, mainland [[Opening of China|China's opening]] to the outside world has been extended to its border areas, areas along the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and inland areas. First, the state decided to turn [[Hainan]] Island into mainland China's biggest special economic zone (approved by the 1st session of the 7th NPC in 1988) and to enlarge the other four special economic zones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] expanded the open coastal areas, extending into an open coastal belt the open economic zones of the [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Pearl River Delta]], Xiamen-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in south Fujian, the [[Shandong Peninsula]], the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (in [[Liaoning]] Province), [[Hebei]] Province and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region. In June 1990, the Chinese government opened the [[Pudong]] New Area in [[Shanghai]] to overseas investment, and additional cities along the Yangtze River valley, with Shanghai's Pudong New Area as its \"dragon head.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince 1992, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] has opened a number of [[Border city|border cities]], and in addition, opened all the capital cities of inland provinces and autonomous regions. In addition, 15 [[Free-trade zone|free trade zones]], 32 state-level economic and technological development zones, and 53 new and [[high-tech]] industrial development zones have been established in large and medium-sized cities. As these open areas adopt different preferential policies, they play the dual roles of \"windows\" in developing the [[Export-oriented economy|foreign-oriented economy]], generating foreign exchanges through exporting products and importing advanced technologies and of \"radiators\" in accelerating inland economic development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nPrimarily geared to exporting processed goods, the five SEZs are [[International trade|foreign trade]]-oriented areas which integrate science, industry and innovation with trade. Foreign firms benefit from preferential policies such as [[Tax incentive|lower tax rates]], reduced regulations and special managerial systems. In 1999, Shenzhen's new-and high-tech industry reached an output value of high-tech products of 81.98 billion [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]], making up 40.5% of the city's total industrial output value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nSince its founding in 1992, the Shanghai Pudong New Area has made progress in both absorbing foreign capital and accelerating the economic development of the Yangtze River valley. The government has extended special preferential policies to the Pudong New Area that are not currently enjoyed by the special economic zones. For instance, in addition to the preferential policies of reducing or eliminating [[Customs duties]] and [[income tax]] common to the economic and technological development zones, the state also permits the zone to allow foreign business people to open [[Financial institution|financial institutions]] and run [[Tertiary industry|tertiary industries]]. In addition, the state has given Shanghai permission to set up a [[stock exchange]], expand its examination and approval authority over investments and allow foreign-funded banks to engage in [[renminbi|RMB]] business.

Since 1988, mainland [[Opening of China|China's opening]] to the outside world has been extended to its border areas, areas along the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and inland areas. First, the state decided to turn [[Hainan]] Island into mainland China's biggest special economic zone (approved by the 1st session of the 7th NPC in 1988) and to enlarge the other four special economic zones.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nShortly afterwards, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] expanded the open coastal areas, extending into an open coastal belt the open economic zones of the [[Yangtze River Delta]], [[Pearl River Delta]], Xiamen-[[Zhangzhou]]-[[Quanzhou]] Triangle in south Fujian, the [[Shandong Peninsula]], the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (in [[Liaoning]] Province), [[Hebei]] Province and [[Guangxi]] autonomous region.

Chile's First National Fleet and the Academy for Young Midshipmen which was the predecessor of the current Naval Academy were founded, as well as the [[Chilean Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and the Supply Commissary.\n[[File:Zarpe de la Primera Escuadra Nacional.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Chilean Squadron [[Freedom Expedition of Per\u00fa|sails off for Per\u00fa]]]]\n\nThe first commander of the Chilean Navy was [[Manuel Blanco Encalada]]. However the famous British naval commander [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] who formerly had been a Captain in the Royal navy, was hired by Chileans to organize and command the Navy. Cochrane recruited an almost all-[[English language|anglophone]] complement of officers and midshipmen and crews of British, Irish and American seamen. He became a key figure in the war against loyalist forces in Peru and was instrumental in taking control of the [[Valdivian Fort System|fortresses of Valdivia]] even though he failed in his attempt to conquer [[Chilo\u00e9 Island]].\n\nIn March 1824, the Chilean Navy and Army undertook an expedition to expel the Spanish from [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]]. An expedition was dispatched to [[Chilo\u00e9 Island]] however ended in failure when the Chilean Army led by [[Jorge Beauchef]] was defeated at the [[Battle of Mocopulli]]. It was only after [[Ram\u00f3n Freire]]'s Chilo\u00e9 expedition in 1826 did the royalist forces at Chilo\u00e9 under the command of [[Antonio de Quintanilla]], surrender and Chilo\u00e9 joined the new Chilean nation.\n\n===Age of exploration, territorial expansion and wars (1830\u20131885)===\nAfter the wars of independence, a series of conflicts demonstrated the importance of the Navy to the nation. First of these conflicts were the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836\u20131839), the [[Chincha Islands War]] (1864\u20131866) and the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883). The founding of [[Fuerte Bulnes]] in the [[Strait of Magellan]] marked the starting point of a series of Chilean Navy explorations, led by navy hydrographers like [[Francisco Vidal Gormaz]] and [[Francisco Hudson]], in the unknown zone between the Strait of Magellan and [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago|Chilo\u00e9]]. To deal with this new area of activity the navy founded in 1874 the [[Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy|Hydrographic Office]] whose first director was [[Francisco Vidal Gormaz]].\n\nThe Chilean [[war hero]] and [[martyr]] [[Arturo Prat]] is regarded as the ultimate example of the commitment of the Navy to its country, after his death while leading a [[Boarding (attack)|boarding party]] onto the enemy ironclad {{ship||Hu\u00e1scar|ironclad|2}} at the [[Battle of Iquique|naval battle of Iquique]] on 21 May 1879, during the [[War of the Pacific|War against Peru and Bolivia]]. The anniversary of this battle is celebrated every year as a [[public holiday]] called ''D\u00eda de las Glorias Navales''. Prat is also considered to be one of the co-founders of the Naval Seaman Training School in 1868, which began operating a year later, and was one of the Naval Academy's finest graduate officers that in 1943 it became the National Naval School \"Arturo Prat\" in his honor.\n[[File:Chilean_Navy_officer's_uniform.jpg|thumb|left|Chilean Navy officer's uniform, circa 1890]]\nThe Navy further distinguished itself during the [[Battle of Pisagua]] in 1879, led by both the Navy and the Marine Artillery Groups and Marine Infantry, the world's first modern military landing operation, that resulted in Chilean victories in other parts of Peru's Tarapac\u00e1 region, and resulted to its annexation by Chile.\n\nAfter navy visits to [[Easter Island]] in 1875 and 1887, Chilean navy officer [[Policarpo Toro]] managed to negotiate an incorporation of the island into Chile with native [[Rapanui]] in 1888. By occupying Easter Island, Chile joined the imperial nations.<ref name=\"sater\">William Sater, ''Chile and the United States: Empires in Conflict'', 1990 by the University of Georgia Press, {{ISBN|0-8203-1249-5}}</ref>{{rp|page=53}}\n\nWith the [[Peruvian Navy]] destroyed, [[Bolivia]] becoming a [[landlocked country]] and Argentina having only a [[brown-water navy]] the Chilean Navy had a regional hegemony in the years following the [[War of the Pacific]]. To secure this advantage and not letting new Argentine acquisitions challenge Chilean Naval power the Chilean government decided to modernize its navy. The modernization plan included the ordering of two [[cruiser]]s, two [[destroyer|torpedo boat destroyer]]s and the modernization of two armoured ships in English docks.\n\n===Civil war and arms race (1885\u20131902)===\n{{see also|Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; width=70%; font-size:80%; border:1px solid darkgrey;\"\n|+Chilean Navy ship purchases and orders, 1887&ndash;1902\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Year\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"|Ships\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"|Builder\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|1887\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|1 [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] <br/> 2 [[protected cruiser]]s <br/> 2 [[torpedo boat]]s \n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e|La Seyne]] <br/> La Seyne <br/> ?\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1891 Chilean Civil War]] \n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|1892\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|1 [[protected cruiser]] \n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|[[Elswick, Tyne and Wear]]\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|1895\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|1 protected cruiser <br/> 1 armored cruiser\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|[[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] \n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|1896\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|1 [[armoured cruiser]]<br/> 6 torpedo boats \n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|Armstrong <br/> ?\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|1901\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|2 pre-dreadnought battleships <br/> 1 protected cruiser\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|Armstrong <br/> Armstrong\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1902 [[arms control]] treaty with Argentina\n|}\n\nA new pre-dreadnought battleship, {{ship|Chilean battleship|Capit\u00e1n Prat||2}}, was ordered under the new construction program in 1889. The advent of the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]] saw a breach between the two branches of the Chilean Armed forces, while the bulk of navy sided the congress side the majority of the [[Chilean Army]] remained loyal to [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda]]. When the majority of the national congress broke relations with the government [[Jorge Montt]] took control of the fleet at [[Valpara\u00edso]] and with notable politicians, like [[Ram\u00f3n Barros Luco]], on board the fleet sailed north to the nitrate-rich [[Tarapac\u00e1 Region|Tarapac\u00e1]] area which Chile had seized from Peru ten years earlier. Tarapac\u00e1 was by that time Chile's richest region in terms of natural resources and was without the fleet practically out of reach for the [[Chilean Army]]. From here the navy organized an army made of nitrate miners which they armed and trained to face the 40,000-men strong [[Army of Chile]]. In August 1891 the new army was disembarked in [[Quintero]] and defeated the Chilean Army at the [[Battle of Conc\u00f3n]] and the [[Battle of Placilla]] before the presidential faction disbanded and the congressional side took power. On the elections of October 1891 [[Jorge Montt]] was elected president.\n\nNot all navy officers sided with the congress. Some like [[Juan Williams Rebolledo]], [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Latorre]] and [[Policarpo Toro]] remained on the presidential side and [[Francisco Vidal Gormaz]] declared his neutrality. After the war these officers were removed from their offices. In contrast to these officers whose career or influence in the navy was truncated by the war, the 1891 Chilean Civil War served as a starting point of a successful career in the navy for a generation of young officers like [[Francisco Nef]] and others who sided with the congressionals who won the war.\n\nAfter incidents with Chile in 1872, 1877 and 1878 Argentina had decided that a brownwater navy, even if modern, was not enough to back up its ambitions in Patagonia and the South Atlantic. Both countries were distracted in the next few years by Argentina's internal [[Conquest of the Desert|military operations against natives]] and Chile's [[War of the Pacific]] against Bolivia and Peru, but by 1890 a full-fledged naval arms race was underway between the two.<ref>Schenia, ''Naval History'', 45\u201346; Garrent, \"Beagle Channel,\" 85\u201387.</ref> The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] had been a major success in laying the groundwork for nearly all of Chile's and Argentina's {{convert|5600|km|mi}} of shared borders, but the drawing a boundaries in the largely unexplored inland Patagonia soon became a major source of territorial disputes. Over the 1880s and 1890s Chile and Argentina engaged in an [[arms race]] fueled by nationalistic rhetoric and tax income from their blooming economies. Both countries signed a treaty in 1902 to end the arms race.\n\nDuring the 1890s, the Chilean Navy carried out many hydrographic surveys in the [[Fjords and channels of Chile|Patagonian channels]] aimed to improve navigation and explore the river basins of Patagonia. A German geographer, [[Hans Steffen]], led navy explorations to western Patagonia, laying the groundwork for colonization of what would be [[Ais\u00e9n Region]] years later. The Navy occasionally collaborated with European [[naturalist]]s such as [[Carl Skottsberg]] in their surveys of Chilean territory.\n\n===Depression, mutiny and political turmoils (1902\u20131950)===\n[[Image:Bombardeo de Coquimbo 1931.jpg|thumb|The Chilean Air Force bombs the Chilean Fleet at the port of [[Coquimbo]] during the [[Chilean naval mutiny of 1931]].(Probably a faked photo)]]\n{{see also|South American dreadnought race}}\nIn 1904 Brazil ordered two {{sclass-|Minas Gerais|battleship|0}} [[dreadnought]]s to be built by the United Kingdom.<ref name=Livermore32>Livermore, \"Battleship Diplomacy,\" 32.</ref> In response, Argentina ordered two {{sclass-|Rivadavia|battleship|0}} dreadnoughts with an option for a third from the United States. They also ordered twelve destroyers from three nations in Europe. With its major rival acquiring so many modern vessels,{{efn-ua|By 1911, the disparity between the navies of Chile, Argentina, and Brazil had grown; Brazil had nearly four times the tonnage of Chile, while Argentina had nearly three and a half times as much.<ref>Livermore, \"Battleship Diplomacy,\" 41.</ref>}} Chile was forced to respond, though this was delayed by a financial [[depression (economics)|depression]] brought on by a major earthquake and a drastic fall in the [[nitrate]] market in 1906 and 1907, respectively.<ref>Livermore, \"Battleship Diplomacy,\" 33\u201341.</ref>{{efn-ua|Livermore and Grant, who cites Livermore's work,<ref>Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 168; Livermore, \"Battleship Diplomacy,\" 40.</ref> both attribute part of this delay to a 1908 earthquake, but no major earthquake hit Chile in that year, cf. [[List of earthquakes in Chile]]. However, the Valpara\u00edso earthquake of 1906 caused nearly 4,000 deaths, a tsunami, and a wide swath of destruction over the Chilean capital and surrounding areas. Given this, it seems likely that Livermore's 1908 earthquake was a typographical error inadvertently repeated in Grant's account.}} Eventually Chile ordered two [[Almirante Latorre-class battleship|''Almirante Latorre''-class]] [[super-dreadnought]]s and six [[Almirante Lynch-class destroyer (1912)|''Almirante Lynch''-class destroyers]] from British shipyards, but received only two destroyers before the rest were purchased by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War I]]; of these Chile would finally receive three destroyers and one battleship, the [[Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre|''Almirante Latorre'']], after the War.\n\nChile also received six [[British H-class submarine]]s from the Royal Navy in 1917, and purchased three [[Capitan O'Brien-class submarine (1928)|''Capitan O'Brien''-class submarines]] and six [[Serrano-class destroyer|''Serrano''-class destroyers]] in the late 1920s. However its fleet of cruisers, all built in the 1890s, were totally outdated by the time the [[Great Depression]] forced their retirements without replacements.\n\nIn 1931, the navy once more made headlines in Chilean politics when large portions of it (26 ships) [[Chilean naval mutiny of 1931|began a mutiny]] that demanded the president to rescind a salary reduction. The demands were later expanded to include an agrarian reform, industrial \"solidarity\" and the payment of the [[external debt]] by the \"millionaires\". The mutineers had their ships located at [[Coquimbo]] and [[Talcahuano]]'s naval base which they controlled. Chilean government responded by sending the [[Chilean Air Force]] to bombard the ships in Coquimbo and [[Charge (warfare)|charging]] Talcahuano's naval base. After the quelling of the rebellion the navy was purged, even though the mutiny had its origin among the lower ranks.\n\nThese economic and political factors, along with Chile's neutrality for much of [[World War II]], meant that the navy did not acquire any warships until after the War.\n\n===Role in Antarctica, incidents with Argentina and the navy in the government (1950\u20131990)===\n{{expand section|date=November 2010}}\nChile formulated [[Chilean Antarctica|its Antarctic claim]] in 1940 and in 1947 the navy established the first Chilean base, [[Captain Arturo Prat Base]], in the continent before the Chilean Army or Air Force established their own bases. Since then the navy has played a major role in supplying Chilean bases and performing numerous rescue missions among them of {{MS|Explorer}} in 1972 and 2007.\n\nThe Navy's most recognizable sailing school ship, the [[Esmeralda (BE-43)|''Buque Escuela Esmeralda'']], began operations in 1952. It since has made various trips around the world, with selected cadet officers and NCO's on board trained in ship handling and operations, as a requirement for graduation. Prior to the Esmeralda, another sailing ship, the [[:es:Buque escuela General Baquedano|General Baquedano]] fulfilled the same functions.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the Chilean Navy began to be involved in a series of incidents with the Argentine Navy and Argentine civilians in the disputed area of [[Beagle Channel]] and [[Cape Horn]]. This incidents took both form of incursions into Chilean waters by Argentine fishing ships and provocations such the shelling of a Chilean lighthouse by the Argentine Navy during the [[Snipe incident]] of 1958.  During the critical phases of the [[Beagle conflict]] of the late 1970s the Chilean Navy played a decisive role in defending Chilean sovereignty over [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] islands that the Argentine Navy planned to seize. While Argentina aborted its invasion plan, ''[[Operation Soberan\u00eda]]'' in December 1978, Argentina went rather into [[Falklands War|war with the United Kingdom in the Falklands]] just after 4 years. During that conflict the Chilean Navy provided diversion to favour the British, as it was understood that if Argentina won the war they would once again try to seize [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] and [[Cape Horn]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n1964 would see the birth of the modern Chilean Marine Corps of today.\n\nNaval educational institutions were reformed in 1968 when president [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] created the ''Naval Specialities Schools System'' with headquarters in Las Salinas Naval Base in [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]]. One of its schools, the Naval Seaman Training School, became the Seamen's School of the Navy \"Captain Alejandro Navarrete Cisterna\" on the same year as its centenary, in honor of the first naval seaman to rise through the ranks to become a naval officer. The NSSS soon became the Naval Polytechnic Academy in 1995, through a merger of all its component schools, some of these schools staying as independent constituent academies.\n \nAfter the [[1973 Chilean coup d'etat]] together with the Army, the Air Force and the Carabiniers, the Navy, led by Admiral [[Jose Toribio Merino]] became part of the [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|Government Junta]] led by Army commander in chief [[Augusto Pinochet]], and upon the latter's resignation from the Junta leadership in 1981, Adm. Merino became its chairman until March 1990, presiding over its sessions and those of the Legislative Commission, and was also concurrently the National Defense Minister. The training ship {{ship||Esmeralda|BE-43|2}} functioned as a floating prison and torture chamber for political prisoners during the 1973\u20131980 period of the military dictatorship.<ref>[http://www.usip.org/files/resources/collections/truth_commissions/Chile90-Report/Chile90-Report.pdf Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201141603/http://www.usip.org/files/resources/collections/truth_commissions/Chile90-Report/Chile90-Report.pdf |date=2013-02-01 }} (English translation of the Rettig report, PDF file)</ref> It is claimed that probably over a hundred persons were kept there at times and subjected to hideous treatment.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080224044157/http://www.chile-esmeralda.com/ Esmeralda: The torture ship] Archived former site of a committee led by Germ\u00e1n F.

Of the fleet of sixty-six surface vessels (soon to be increased to seventy-four),{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} twenty-one are major combatant ships based in [[Valpara\u00edso]]. The navy operates its own aircraft for transport, patrol as well as surface and anti-submarine attack. The Navy also operates four submarines and a [[Submarine tender|tender ship]] to support them, all based in [[Talcahuano]].\n\nThe Navy also provides access to services for residents of Chile's Pacific and Southern island regions, thus integrating its disjointed geography. The transport of passengers, especially during the school year or in cases of emergency, together with the supply of provisions and fuel, are of key importance to the inhabitants of these insular zones.\n\nThe institution regularly carries out civil operations whereby Navy professionals provide social assistance and health care to the civilian population, and provide support in cases of natural catastrophe.\n[[File:Chilean Navy Saar 4.jpg|thumb|Sa'ar 4 type ship of the Chilean Navy]]\nIt also undertakes preventative education campaigns for Chile's population on issues that include security on beaches and seaside resorts and measures to be taken in the case of a [[tsunami]].\n\nThe most important naval bases and supply depots are (from north to south) in the [[Pacific Ocean]]: [[Iquique]], [[Easter Island]], [[Valpara\u00edso]], [[Talcahuano]], [[Puerto Montt]], in the Atlantic zone: [[Strait of Magellan]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]] : [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]], in the [[Beagle Channel]], [[Cape Horn]] and [[Drake Passage]]: [[Puerto Williams]], and in [[Antarctica]]: [[Captain Arturo Prat Base]].

Chile's First National Fleet and the Academy for Young Midshipmen which was the predecessor of the current Naval Academy were founded, as well as the [[Chilean Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and the Supply Commissary.\n[[File:Zarpe de la Primera Escuadra Nacional.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Chilean Squadron [[Freedom Expedition of Per\u00fa|sails off for Per\u00fa]]]]\n\nThe first commander of the Chilean Navy was [[Manuel Blanco Encalada]]. However the famous British naval commander [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] who formerly had been a Captain in the Royal navy, was hired by Chileans to organize and command the Navy. Cochrane recruited an almost all-[[English language|anglophone]] complement of officers and midshipmen and crews of British, Irish and American seamen. He became a key figure in the war against loyalist forces in Peru and was instrumental in taking control of the [[Valdivian Fort System|fortresses of Valdivia]] even though he failed in his attempt to conquer [[Chilo\u00e9 Island]].\n\nIn March 1824, the Chilean Navy and Army undertook an expedition to expel the Spanish from [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]]. An expedition was dispatched to [[Chilo\u00e9 Island]] however ended in failure when the Chilean Army led by [[Jorge Beauchef]] was defeated at the [[Battle of Mocopulli]]. It was only after [[Ram\u00f3n Freire]]'s Chilo\u00e9 expedition in 1826 did the royalist forces at Chilo\u00e9 under the command of [[Antonio de Quintanilla]], surrender and Chilo\u00e9 joined the new Chilean nation.\n\n===Age of exploration, territorial expansion and wars (1830\u20131885)===\nAfter the wars of independence, a series of conflicts demonstrated the importance of the Navy to the nation. First of these conflicts were the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836\u20131839), the [[Chincha Islands War]] (1864\u20131866) and the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883). The founding of [[Fuerte Bulnes]] in the [[Strait of Magellan]] marked the starting point of a series of Chilean Navy explorations, led by navy hydrographers like [[Francisco Vidal Gormaz]] and [[Francisco Hudson]], in the unknown zone between the Strait of Magellan and [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago|Chilo\u00e9]]. To deal with this new area of activity the navy founded in 1874 the [[Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy|Hydrographic Office]] whose first director was [[Francisco Vidal Gormaz]].\n\nThe Chilean [[war hero]] and [[martyr]] [[Arturo Prat]] is regarded as the ultimate example of the commitment of the Navy to its country, after his death while leading a [[Boarding (attack)|boarding party]] onto the enemy ironclad {{ship||Hu\u00e1scar|ironclad|2}} at the [[Battle of Iquique|naval battle of Iquique]] on 21 May 1879, during the [[War of the Pacific|War against Peru and Bolivia]]. The anniversary of this battle is celebrated every year as a [[public holiday]] called ''D\u00eda de las Glorias Navales''. Prat is also considered to be one of the co-founders of the Naval Seaman Training School in 1868, which began operating a year later, and was one of the Naval Academy's finest graduate officers that in 1943 it became the National Naval School \"Arturo Prat\" in his honor.\n[[File:Chilean_Navy_officer's_uniform.jpg|thumb|left|Chilean Navy officer's uniform, circa 1890]]\nThe Navy further distinguished itself during the [[Battle of Pisagua]] in 1879, led by both the Navy and the Marine Artillery Groups and Marine Infantry, the world's first modern military landing operation, that resulted in Chilean victories in other parts of Peru's Tarapac\u00e1 region, and resulted to its annexation by Chile.\n\nAfter navy visits to [[Easter Island]] in 1875 and 1887, Chilean navy officer [[Policarpo Toro]] managed to negotiate an incorporation of the island into Chile with native [[Rapanui]] in 1888. By occupying Easter Island, Chile joined the imperial nations.<ref name=\"sater\">William Sater, ''Chile and the United States: Empires in Conflict'', 1990 by the University of Georgia Press, {{ISBN|0-8203-1249-5}}</ref>{{rp|page=53}}\n\nWith the [[Peruvian Navy]] destroyed, [[Bolivia]] becoming a [[landlocked country]] and Argentina having only a [[brown-water navy]] the Chilean Navy had a regional hegemony in the years following the [[War of the Pacific]]. To secure this advantage and not letting new Argentine acquisitions challenge Chilean Naval power the Chilean government decided to modernize its navy. The modernization plan included the ordering of two [[cruiser]]s, two [[destroyer|torpedo boat destroyer]]s and the modernization of two armoured ships in English docks.\n\n===Civil war and arms race (1885\u20131902)===\n{{see also|Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; width=70%; font-size:80%; border:1px solid darkgrey;\"\n|+Chilean Navy ship purchases and orders, 1887&ndash;1902\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|Year\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"|Ships\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center;\"|Builder\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|1887\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|1 [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] <br/> 2 [[protected cruiser]]s <br/> 2 [[torpedo boat]]s \n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e|La Seyne]] <br/> La Seyne <br/> ?\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[1891 Chilean Civil War]] \n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|1892\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|1 [[protected cruiser]] \n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|[[Elswick, Tyne and Wear]]\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|1895\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|1 protected cruiser <br/> 1 armored cruiser\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|[[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] \n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|1896\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|1 [[armoured cruiser]]<br/> 6 torpedo boats \n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|Armstrong <br/> ?\n|-\n| valign=\"top\"|1901\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|2 pre-dreadnought battleships <br/> 1 protected cruiser\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|Armstrong <br/> Armstrong\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1902 [[arms control]] treaty with Argentina\n|}\n\nA new pre-dreadnought battleship, {{ship|Chilean battleship|Capit\u00e1n Prat||2}}, was ordered under the new construction program in 1889. The advent of the [[1891 Chilean Civil War]] saw a breach between the two branches of the Chilean Armed forces, while the bulk of navy sided the congress side the majority of the [[Chilean Army]] remained loyal to [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda]]. When the majority of the national congress broke relations with the government [[Jorge Montt]] took control of the fleet at [[Valpara\u00edso]] and with notable politicians, like [[Ram\u00f3n Barros Luco]], on board the fleet sailed north to the nitrate-rich [[Tarapac\u00e1 Region|Tarapac\u00e1]] area which Chile had seized from Peru ten years earlier. Tarapac\u00e1 was by that time Chile's richest region in terms of natural resources and was without the fleet practically out of reach for the [[Chilean Army]]. From here the navy organized an army made of nitrate miners which they armed and trained to face the 40,000-men strong [[Army of Chile]]. In August 1891 the new army was disembarked in [[Quintero]] and defeated the Chilean Army at the [[Battle of Conc\u00f3n]] and the [[Battle of Placilla]] before the presidential faction disbanded and the congressional side took power. On the elections of October 1891 [[Jorge Montt]] was elected president.\n\nNot all navy officers sided with the congress. Some like [[Juan Williams Rebolledo]], [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Latorre]] and [[Policarpo Toro]] remained on the presidential side and [[Francisco Vidal Gormaz]] declared his neutrality. After the war these officers were removed from their offices. In contrast to these officers whose career or influence in the navy was truncated by the war, the 1891 Chilean Civil War served as a starting point of a successful career in the navy for a generation of young officers like [[Francisco Nef]] and others who sided with the congressionals who won the war.\n\nAfter incidents with Chile in 1872, 1877 and 1878 Argentina had decided that a brownwater navy, even if modern, was not enough to back up its ambitions in Patagonia and the South Atlantic. Both countries were distracted in the next few years by Argentina's internal [[Conquest of the Desert|military operations against natives]] and Chile's [[War of the Pacific]] against Bolivia and Peru, but by 1890 a full-fledged naval arms race was underway between the two.<ref>Schenia, ''Naval History'', 45\u201346; Garrent, \"Beagle Channel,\" 85\u201387.</ref> The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] had been a major success in laying the groundwork for nearly all of Chile's and Argentina's {{convert|5600|km|mi}} of shared borders, but the drawing a boundaries in the largely unexplored inland Patagonia soon became a major source of territorial disputes. Over the 1880s and 1890s Chile and Argentina engaged in an [[arms race]] fueled by nationalistic rhetoric and tax income from their blooming economies. Both countries signed a treaty in 1902 to end the arms race.\n\nDuring the 1890s, the Chilean Navy carried out many hydrographic surveys in the [[Fjords and channels of Chile|Patagonian channels]] aimed to improve navigation and explore the river basins of Patagonia. A German geographer, [[Hans Steffen]], led navy explorations to western Patagonia, laying the groundwork for colonization of what would be [[Ais\u00e9n Region]] years later. The Navy occasionally collaborated with European [[naturalist]]s such as [[Carl Skottsberg]] in their surveys of Chilean territory.\n\n===Depression, mutiny and political turmoils (1902\u20131950)===\n[[Image:Bombardeo de Coquimbo 1931.jpg|thumb|The Chilean Air Force bombs the Chilean Fleet at the port of [[Coquimbo]] during the [[Chilean naval mutiny of 1931]].(Probably a faked photo)]]\n{{see also|South American dreadnought race}}\nIn 1904 Brazil ordered two {{sclass-|Minas Gerais|battleship|0}} [[dreadnought]]s to be built by the United Kingdom.<ref name=Livermore32>Livermore, \"Battleship Diplomacy,\" 32.</ref> In response, Argentina ordered two {{sclass-|Rivadavia|battleship|0}} dreadnoughts with an option for a third from the United States. They also ordered twelve destroyers from three nations in Europe. With its major rival acquiring so many modern vessels,{{efn-ua|By 1911, the disparity between the navies of Chile, Argentina, and Brazil had grown; Brazil had nearly four times the tonnage of Chile, while Argentina had nearly three and a half times as much.<ref>Livermore, \"Battleship Diplomacy,\" 41.</ref>}} Chile was forced to respond, though this was delayed by a financial [[depression (economics)|depression]] brought on by a major earthquake and a drastic fall in the [[nitrate]] market in 1906 and 1907, respectively.<ref>Livermore, \"Battleship Diplomacy,\" 33\u201341.</ref>{{efn-ua|Livermore and Grant, who cites Livermore's work,<ref>Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 168; Livermore, \"Battleship Diplomacy,\" 40.</ref> both attribute part of this delay to a 1908 earthquake, but no major earthquake hit Chile in that year, cf. [[List of earthquakes in Chile]]. However, the Valpara\u00edso earthquake of 1906 caused nearly 4,000 deaths, a tsunami, and a wide swath of destruction over the Chilean capital and surrounding areas. Given this, it seems likely that Livermore's 1908 earthquake was a typographical error inadvertently repeated in Grant's account.}} Eventually Chile ordered two [[Almirante Latorre-class battleship|''Almirante Latorre''-class]] [[super-dreadnought]]s and six [[Almirante Lynch-class destroyer (1912)|''Almirante Lynch''-class destroyers]] from British shipyards, but received only two destroyers before the rest were purchased by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War I]]; of these Chile would finally receive three destroyers and one battleship, the [[Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre|''Almirante Latorre'']], after the War.\n\nChile also received six [[British H-class submarine]]s from the Royal Navy in 1917, and purchased three [[Capitan O'Brien-class submarine (1928)|''Capitan O'Brien''-class submarines]] and six [[Serrano-class destroyer|''Serrano''-class destroyers]] in the late 1920s. However its fleet of cruisers, all built in the 1890s, were totally outdated by the time the [[Great Depression]] forced their retirements without replacements.\n\nIn 1931, the navy once more made headlines in Chilean politics when large portions of it (26 ships) [[Chilean naval mutiny of 1931|began a mutiny]] that demanded the president to rescind a salary reduction. The demands were later expanded to include an agrarian reform, industrial \"solidarity\" and the payment of the [[external debt]] by the \"millionaires\". The mutineers had their ships located at [[Coquimbo]] and [[Talcahuano]]'s naval base which they controlled. Chilean government responded by sending the [[Chilean Air Force]] to bombard the ships in Coquimbo and [[Charge (warfare)|charging]] Talcahuano's naval base. After the quelling of the rebellion the navy was purged, even though the mutiny had its origin among the lower ranks.\n\nThese economic and political factors, along with Chile's neutrality for much of [[World War II]], meant that the navy did not acquire any warships until after the War.\n\n===Role in Antarctica, incidents with Argentina and the navy in the government (1950\u20131990)===\n{{expand section|date=November 2010}}\nChile formulated [[Chilean Antarctica|its Antarctic claim]] in 1940 and in 1947 the navy established the first Chilean base, [[Captain Arturo Prat Base]], in the continent before the Chilean Army or Air Force established their own bases. Since then the navy has played a major role in supplying Chilean bases and performing numerous rescue missions among them of {{MS|Explorer}} in 1972 and 2007.\n\nThe Navy's most recognizable sailing school ship, the [[Esmeralda (BE-43)|''Buque Escuela Esmeralda'']], began operations in 1952. It since has made various trips around the world, with selected cadet officers and NCO's on board trained in ship handling and operations, as a requirement for graduation. Prior to the Esmeralda, another sailing ship, the [[:es:Buque escuela General Baquedano|General Baquedano]] fulfilled the same functions.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the Chilean Navy began to be involved in a series of incidents with the Argentine Navy and Argentine civilians in the disputed area of [[Beagle Channel]] and [[Cape Horn]]. This incidents took both form of incursions into Chilean waters by Argentine fishing ships and provocations such the shelling of a Chilean lighthouse by the Argentine Navy during the [[Snipe incident]] of 1958.  During the critical phases of the [[Beagle conflict]] of the late 1970s the Chilean Navy played a decisive role in defending Chilean sovereignty over [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] islands that the Argentine Navy planned to seize. While Argentina aborted its invasion plan, ''[[Operation Soberan\u00eda]]'' in December 1978, Argentina went rather into [[Falklands War|war with the United Kingdom in the Falklands]] just after 4 years. During that conflict the Chilean Navy provided diversion to favour the British, as it was understood that if Argentina won the war they would once again try to seize [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] and [[Cape Horn]].\n\n1964 would see the birth of the modern Chilean Marine Corps of today.\n\nNaval educational institutions were reformed in 1968 when president [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] created the ''Naval Specialities Schools System'' with headquarters in Las Salinas Naval Base in [[Vi\u00f1a del Mar]]. One of its schools, the Naval Seaman Training School, became the Seamen's School of the Navy \"Captain Alejandro Navarrete Cisterna\" on the same year as its centenary, in honor of the first naval seaman to rise through the ranks to become a naval officer. The NSSS soon became the Naval Polytechnic Academy in 1995, through a merger of all its component schools, some of these schools staying as independent constituent academies.\n \nAfter the [[1973 Chilean coup d'etat]] together with the Army, the Air Force and the Carabiniers, the Navy, led by Admiral [[Jose Toribio Merino]] became part of the [[Government Junta of Chile (1973)|Government Junta]] led by Army commander in chief [[Augusto Pinochet]], and upon the latter's resignation from the Junta leadership in 1981, Adm. Merino became its chairman until March 1990, presiding over its sessions and those of the Legislative Commission, and was also concurrently the National Defense Minister. The training ship {{ship||Esmeralda|BE-43|2}} functioned as a floating prison and torture chamber for political prisoners during the 1973\u20131980 period of the military dictatorship.<ref>[http://www.usip.org/files/resources/collections/truth_commissions/Chile90-Report/Chile90-Report.pdf Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201141603/http://www.usip.org/files/resources/collections/truth_commissions/Chile90-Report/Chile90-Report.pdf |date=2013-02-01 }} (English translation of the Rettig report, PDF file)</ref> It is claimed that probably over a hundred persons were kept there at times and subjected to hideous treatment.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080224044157/http://www.chile-esmeralda.com/ Esmeralda: The torture ship] Archived former site of a committee led by Germ\u00e1n F.

Of the fleet of sixty-six surface vessels (soon to be increased to seventy-four),{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} twenty-one are major combatant ships based in [[Valpara\u00edso]]. The navy operates its own aircraft for transport, patrol as well as surface and anti-submarine attack. The Navy also operates four submarines and a [[Submarine tender|tender ship]] to support them, all based in [[Talcahuano]].\n\nThe Navy also provides access to services for residents of Chile's Pacific and Southern island regions, thus integrating its disjointed geography. The transport of passengers, especially during the school year or in cases of emergency, together with the supply of provisions and fuel, are of key importance to the inhabitants of these insular zones.\n\nThe institution regularly carries out civil operations whereby Navy professionals provide social assistance and health care to the civilian population, and provide support in cases of natural catastrophe.\n[[File:Chilean Navy Saar 4.jpg|thumb|Sa'ar 4 type ship of the Chilean Navy]]\nIt also undertakes preventative education campaigns for Chile's population on issues that include security on beaches and seaside resorts and measures to be taken in the case of a [[tsunami]].\n\nThe most important naval bases and supply depots are (from north to south) in the [[Pacific Ocean]]: [[Iquique]], [[Easter Island]], [[Valpara\u00edso]], [[Talcahuano]], [[Puerto Montt]], in the Atlantic zone: [[Strait of Magellan]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]] : [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]], in the [[Beagle Channel]], [[Cape Horn]] and [[Drake Passage]]: [[Puerto Williams]], and in [[Antarctica]]: [[Captain Arturo Prat Base]].

She remarked that Collette's acting method references the components of [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski\u2019s System of Acting]]. In studying Collette's typecasting as mothers, Kingston wrote, \"[Collette] selectively chooses roles of women and mothers which she can portray in ways that are multidimensional and different from another.\" She also wrote that Collette makes conscious efforts to break from the typecasting, with leading roles in films like ''Miss You Already'' and ''Lucky Them''. At the end of her analysis, Kingston concluded, \"Collette truly is a chameleon in both the versatility of her acting style and in the kind of roles she is willing to approach with a physicality-based method.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mcgillchannelundergraduatereview.com/2018/04/toni-collette-character-as-craft/|title=Toni Collette: Character as Craft \u2013 The Channel|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Toni Collette by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|236x236px|Collette at the 2015 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic Con]] promoting [[Krampus (film)|''Krampus'']] (2015)|alt=]]\nIn 1998, she stayed in a flat in [[Brixton]] for a few months before leaving after she saw a man \"getting his head bashed in with a pole 30 metres away\".<ref name=\":11\" /> She briefly lived in [[Sydney]] in the 2000s before she moved to [[Los Angeles]], where she currently resides with her family.<ref name=\":11\" /> However, she has said that she and her husband plan to return to Sydney some day.<ref name=\":11\" /> Collette had dated ''Velvet Goldmine'' co-star [[Jonathan Rhys Meyers|Jonathan Rhys-Meyers]] for a year before ending their relationship.
