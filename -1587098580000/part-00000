Day was awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military award for valor, for heroism on [[Okinawa]] as a corporal while serving as a squad leader of Weapons Company, [[2nd Battalion 22nd Marine Regiment|2nd Battalion, 22nd Marines]], [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Division]].\n\n;Citation\n\n:The [[President of the United States]] in the name of the [[United States Congress|Congress]] takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to<br /><center>'''CORPORAL JAMES L. DAY'''<br />[[USMCR|UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE]]</center><br />for service as set forth in the following CITATION:<blockquote>For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a squad leader serving with the Second Battalion, Twenty-Second Marines, Sixth Marine Division, in sustained combat operations against Japanese forces on [[Okinawa, Japan|Okinawa]], [[Ryukyu Islands]] from 14 to 17 May 1945. On the first day, Corporal Day rallied his squad and the remnants of another unit and led them to a critical position forward of the front lines of Sugar Loaf Hill. Soon thereafter, they came under an intense [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] and [[artillery]] barrage that was quickly followed by a fanatical ground attack of about forty Japanese soldiers. Despite the loss of one-half of his men, Corporal Day remained at the forefront, shouting encouragement, hurling [[hand grenade]]s, and directing deadly fire thereby repelling the determined enemy. Reinforced by six men, he led his squad in repelling three fierce night attacks but suffered five additional Marines killed and one wounded whom he assisted to safety. Upon hearing nearby calls for [[Hospital Corpsman|corpsman]] assistance, Corporal Day braved heavy enemy fire to escort four seriously wounded Marines, one at a time, to safety. Corporal Day then manned a light [[machine gun]] assisted by a wounded Marine, and halted another frenzied night attack. In this ferocious action, his machine gun was destroyed, and he suffered multiple [[White phosphorus (weapon)|white phosphorus]] and fragmentation wounds. Assisted by only one partially effective man, he reorganized his defensive position in time to halt a fifth enemy attack with devastating small arms fire. On three separate occasions, Japanese soldiers closed to within a few feet of his foxhole, but were killed by Corporal Day. During the second day, the enemy conducted numerous unsuccessful swarming attacks against his exposed position. When the attacks momentarily subsided, over 70 enemy dead were counted around his position. On the third day, a wounded and exhausted Corporal Day repulsed the enemy's final attack and dispatched around 12 of the enemy at close range. Having yielded no ground and with more than 100 enemy dead around his position, Corporal Day preserved the lives of his fellow Marines and made a primal contribution to the success of the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]]. By his extraordinary heroism, repeated acts of valor, and quintessential battlefield leadership, Corporal Day inspired the efforts of his outnumbered Marines to defeat a much larger enemy force, reflecting great credit upon himself and upholding the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the [[Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].</blockquote>\n\n===First Silver Star citation===\n'''Citation:'''\n\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Second Lieutenant James Lewis Day (MCSN: 0-56003), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity as a Platoon Commander of the First Reconnaissance Company, Headquarters Battalion, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 23 January 1953. Skillfully leading his patrol deep into hostile territory to attack an enemy-held position from the rear, Second Lieutenant Day immediately proceeded to the head of the unit after contact was established, to control the action more effectively. After killing one hostile soldier and capturing another, he ordered his men to hold their fire until the enemy force had approached to within twenty yards of the patrol's position. Although painfully wounded during the ensuing firefight, he bravely directed the efforts of his men until the hostile force had been eliminated and steadfastly refused medical treatment until his patrol and the prisoner had withdrawn from the area. Throughout the disengagement, he remained with the rear guard to ensure the unit's safe return to the main line of resistance. By his courageous leadership, resolute determination and gallant devotion to duty, Second Lieutenant Day contributed immeasurably to the success of the mission and served to inspire all who observed him, thereby upholding the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=https://valor.militarytimes.com/hero/1594#77423 |title=James Lewis Day |work=[[Military Times]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Second Silver Star citation===\n'''Citation:'''\n\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Silver Star to Lieutenant Colonel [then Second Lieutenant] James Lewis Day (MCSN: 0-56003), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy while serving with a Marine reconnaissance company in Korea on 26 October 1952. Leading a patrol of four men in front of the main line of resistance, Colonel (then Second Lieutenant) Day displayed outstanding courage, initiative and devotion to duty. When contact was established with the advance element of a major enemy force his patrol killed ten of the enemy and captured two. Breaking off contact he returned to friendly lines with the two prisoners and continued to fight the enemy force beside the Marines on the front lines. He personally killed two of the enemy with his trench knife and directed the defense of the position after the platoon leader was killed. He continued his heroic defense action until relieved by friendly forces. Colonel Day's gallant and courageous actions served as an inspiration to all who observed him and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Third Silver Star citation===\n'''Citation:'''\n\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Second Gold Star in lieu of a Third Award of the Silver Star to Major James Lewis Day (MCSN: 0-56003), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Commanding Officer of the First Battalion, 9th Marines, THIRD Marine Division, in connection with combat operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. From 2 to 4 March 1967, during [[Operation Prairie II]], Major Day led his battalion on a search and destroy mission west of Cam Lo near the Demilitarized Zone, and consistently demonstrated exceptional courage, aggressiveness and sound judgment while engaged against well organized and heavily armed North Vietnamese Army forces. Late in the afternoon of 2 March, his battalion was moving from Hill 162 toward a nearby hill mass known as the \"Three Sisters,\" when the Marines suddenly came under intense mortar, rocket and automatic weapons fire from an estimated force of two reinforced companies, entrenched in fortified positions. Major Day immediately moved forward to assess the situation and quickly maneuvered two companies into the assault. During the next four hours, in which the enemy was repulsed and overrun in a series of savage actions, Major Day continuously exposed himself to withering enemy fire as he moved from one position to another directing and encouraging the lead companies in their many engagements against a ferocious and determined enemy. Despite numerous casualties and the fact that darkness was approaching, Major Day continued to maneuver his battalion forward in pursuit of the remnants of the enemy force. This action resulted in over 180 enemy killed, eighteen prisoners captured and nearly 200 weapons seized. Realizing that the enemy would attempt to withdraw from the area during the night and escape to the north, Major Day directed his unit into a blocking position, channelizing the enemy's withdrawal into a prearranged killing zone. Subsequent Marine air strikes and artillery fire accounted for an additional forty-four enemy killed. On the morning of 3 March, he received intelligence information that two large enemy forces, estimated at 500 men, were maneuvering northeast to attack an adjacent Marine battalion. Quickly evaluating the situation, Major Day deployed two companies to intercept the enemy forces. His skillful employment of supporting arms and air strikes disorganized the hostile force, enabling the Marines to achieve tactical surprise. During the ensuing fire fight which lasted for almost two hours, his unit killed or captured nearly 100 enemy while sustaining only minor Marine casualties. On 4 March, as the battalion continued its search and destroy mission, it came under an intense 82-mm. mortar attack. One round exploded near Major Day and knocked him into a bomb crater, seriously injuring his back. With complete disregard for his painful injury, he courageously continued to lead his battalion aggressively throughout the day, effectively utilizing supporting arms and ground forces to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy. Only after his battalion was consolidated into night defensive positions, re-supply was accomplished and casualties were evacuated, did he permit himself to be evacuated. By his dynamic leadership, exemplary initiative and selfless devotion to duty, Major Day inspired all who served with him and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n==Other honors==\nA Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to Day for [[Veterans Day]] in 1999, recognizing him as one of five Medal of Honor recipients from the Southern California desert area.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121208224143/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars%20by%20date/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars: By Date Dedicated]</ref>\nJames L.

Day was awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military award for valor, for heroism on [[Okinawa]] as a corporal while serving as a squad leader of Weapons Company, [[2nd Battalion 22nd Marine Regiment|2nd Battalion, 22nd Marines]], [[6th Marine Division (United States)|6th Marine Division]].\n\n;Citation\n\n:The [[President of the United States]] in the name of the [[United States Congress|Congress]] takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to<br /><center>'''CORPORAL JAMES L. DAY'''<br />[[USMCR|UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS RESERVE]]</center><br />for service as set forth in the following CITATION:<blockquote>For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as a squad leader serving with the Second Battalion, Twenty-Second Marines, Sixth Marine Division, in sustained combat operations against Japanese forces on [[Okinawa, Japan|Okinawa]], [[Ryukyu Islands]] from 14 to 17 May 1945. On the first day, Corporal Day rallied his squad and the remnants of another unit and led them to a critical position forward of the front lines of Sugar Loaf Hill. Soon thereafter, they came under an intense [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] and [[artillery]] barrage that was quickly followed by a fanatical ground attack of about forty Japanese soldiers. Despite the loss of one-half of his men, Corporal Day remained at the forefront, shouting encouragement, hurling [[hand grenade]]s, and directing deadly fire thereby repelling the determined enemy. Reinforced by six men, he led his squad in repelling three fierce night attacks but suffered five additional Marines killed and one wounded whom he assisted to safety. Upon hearing nearby calls for [[Hospital Corpsman|corpsman]] assistance, Corporal Day braved heavy enemy fire to escort four seriously wounded Marines, one at a time, to safety. Corporal Day then manned a light [[machine gun]] assisted by a wounded Marine, and halted another frenzied night attack. In this ferocious action, his machine gun was destroyed, and he suffered multiple [[White phosphorus (weapon)|white phosphorus]] and fragmentation wounds. Assisted by only one partially effective man, he reorganized his defensive position in time to halt a fifth enemy attack with devastating small arms fire. On three separate occasions, Japanese soldiers closed to within a few feet of his foxhole, but were killed by Corporal Day. During the second day, the enemy conducted numerous unsuccessful swarming attacks against his exposed position. When the attacks momentarily subsided, over 70 enemy dead were counted around his position. On the third day, a wounded and exhausted Corporal Day repulsed the enemy's final attack and dispatched around 12 of the enemy at close range. Having yielded no ground and with more than 100 enemy dead around his position, Corporal Day preserved the lives of his fellow Marines and made a primal contribution to the success of the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]]. By his extraordinary heroism, repeated acts of valor, and quintessential battlefield leadership, Corporal Day inspired the efforts of his outnumbered Marines to defeat a much larger enemy force, reflecting great credit upon himself and upholding the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the [[Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].</blockquote>\n\n===First Silver Star citation===\n'''Citation:'''\n\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Second Lieutenant James Lewis Day (MCSN: 0-56003), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity as a Platoon Commander of the First Reconnaissance Company, Headquarters Battalion, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on 23 January 1953. Skillfully leading his patrol deep into hostile territory to attack an enemy-held position from the rear, Second Lieutenant Day immediately proceeded to the head of the unit after contact was established, to control the action more effectively. After killing one hostile soldier and capturing another, he ordered his men to hold their fire until the enemy force had approached to within twenty yards of the patrol's position. Although painfully wounded during the ensuing firefight, he bravely directed the efforts of his men until the hostile force had been eliminated and steadfastly refused medical treatment until his patrol and the prisoner had withdrawn from the area. Throughout the disengagement, he remained with the rear guard to ensure the unit's safe return to the main line of resistance. By his courageous leadership, resolute determination and gallant devotion to duty, Second Lieutenant Day contributed immeasurably to the success of the mission and served to inspire all who observed him, thereby upholding the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=https://valor.militarytimes.com/hero/1594#77423 |title=James Lewis Day |work=[[Military Times]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Second Silver Star citation===\n'''Citation:'''\n\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Silver Star to Lieutenant Colonel [then Second Lieutenant] James Lewis Day (MCSN: 0-56003), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy while serving with a Marine reconnaissance company in Korea on 26 October 1952. Leading a patrol of four men in front of the main line of resistance, Colonel (then Second Lieutenant) Day displayed outstanding courage, initiative and devotion to duty. When contact was established with the advance element of a major enemy force his patrol killed ten of the enemy and captured two. Breaking off contact he returned to friendly lines with the two prisoners and continued to fight the enemy force beside the Marines on the front lines. He personally killed two of the enemy with his trench knife and directed the defense of the position after the platoon leader was killed. He continued his heroic defense action until relieved by friendly forces. Colonel Day's gallant and courageous actions served as an inspiration to all who observed him and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Third Silver Star citation===\n'''Citation:'''\n\n<blockquote>The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Second Gold Star in lieu of a Third Award of the Silver Star to Major James Lewis Day (MCSN: 0-56003), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Commanding Officer of the First Battalion, 9th Marines, THIRD Marine Division, in connection with combat operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. From 2 to 4 March 1967, during [[Operation Prairie II]], Major Day led his battalion on a search and destroy mission west of Cam Lo near the Demilitarized Zone, and consistently demonstrated exceptional courage, aggressiveness and sound judgment while engaged against well organized and heavily armed North Vietnamese Army forces. Late in the afternoon of 2 March, his battalion was moving from Hill 162 toward a nearby hill mass known as the \"Three Sisters,\" when the Marines suddenly came under intense mortar, rocket and automatic weapons fire from an estimated force of two reinforced companies, entrenched in fortified positions. Major Day immediately moved forward to assess the situation and quickly maneuvered two companies into the assault. During the next four hours, in which the enemy was repulsed and overrun in a series of savage actions, Major Day continuously exposed himself to withering enemy fire as he moved from one position to another directing and encouraging the lead companies in their many engagements against a ferocious and determined enemy. Despite numerous casualties and the fact that darkness was approaching, Major Day continued to maneuver his battalion forward in pursuit of the remnants of the enemy force. This action resulted in over 180 enemy killed, eighteen prisoners captured and nearly 200 weapons seized. Realizing that the enemy would attempt to withdraw from the area during the night and escape to the north, Major Day directed his unit into a blocking position, channelizing the enemy's withdrawal into a prearranged killing zone. Subsequent Marine air strikes and artillery fire accounted for an additional forty-four enemy killed. On the morning of 3 March, he received intelligence information that two large enemy forces, estimated at 500 men, were maneuvering northeast to attack an adjacent Marine battalion. Quickly evaluating the situation, Major Day deployed two companies to intercept the enemy forces. His skillful employment of supporting arms and air strikes disorganized the hostile force, enabling the Marines to achieve tactical surprise. During the ensuing fire fight which lasted for almost two hours, his unit killed or captured nearly 100 enemy while sustaining only minor Marine casualties. On 4 March, as the battalion continued its search and destroy mission, it came under an intense 82-mm. mortar attack. One round exploded near Major Day and knocked him into a bomb crater, seriously injuring his back. With complete disregard for his painful injury, he courageously continued to lead his battalion aggressively throughout the day, effectively utilizing supporting arms and ground forces to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy. Only after his battalion was consolidated into night defensive positions, re-supply was accomplished and casualties were evacuated, did he permit himself to be evacuated. By his dynamic leadership, exemplary initiative and selfless devotion to duty, Major Day inspired all who served with him and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n==Other honors==\nA Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to Day for [[Veterans Day]] in 1999, recognizing him as one of five Medal of Honor recipients from the Southern California desert area.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121208224143/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars%20by%20date/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars: By Date Dedicated]</ref>\nJames L.

Bong also collaborated on several works with his classmates, which included working as [[cinematographer]] on the highly acclaimed short ''2001 Imagine'' (1994), directed by his friend [[Jang Joon-hwan]].

Although passed over by the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Venice Film Festival]], the film eventually received its international premiere, again at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, where it picked up three awards including Best Director.

''Influenza'' (2004) is a 30-minute work acted out entirely in front of real [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras stationed throughout Seoul. The film, which charts a desperate man's turn to violent crime over the space of five years, was commissioned by the [[Jeonju International Film Festival]], together with works by Japanese director Sogo Ishii and Hong Kong-based [[Yu Lik-wai]]. ''Twentidentity'', meanwhile, is a 20-part anthology film made by alumni of the Korean Academy of Film Arts, on the occasion of the school's 20th anniversary.

After rushing to meet deadlines, the film received a rapturous premiere in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section of the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]. Although local audiences were slightly more critical of ''The Host'' than attendees at Cannes, the film was nonetheless a major summer hit. With theater owners calling for more and more prints, the film enjoyed South Korea's widest release ever (on over a third of the nation's 1,800 screens) and set a new [[List of highest-grossing films in South Korea|box office record]] with 13 million tickets sold.

He received a partial screenplay credit on the [[anthology film]] ''Seven Reasons Why Beer is Better Than a Lover'' (1996); both screenplay and assistant director credits on Park Ki-yong's debut ''Motel Cactus'' (1997); and is one of four writers (along with [[Jang Joon-hwan]]) credited for the screenplay of ''Phantom: The Submarine'' (1999).<ref name=\"page\" />\n\n===Early directing work===\nShortly afterwards, Bong began shooting his first feature ''[[Barking Dogs Never Bite]]'' (2000) under producer Cha Seung-jae, who had overseen the production of both ''Motel Cactus'' and ''Phantom: The Submarine''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bong Joon Ho: Writing New Chapter in Korean Film History |url=http://english.kbs.co.kr/Archives/index.html?sec=people&No=5391|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130219001116/http://english.kbs.co.kr/Archives/index.html?sec=people&No=5391|url-status=dead|archivedate=February 19, 2013 |publisher=[[Korean Broadcasting System]] |accessdate=November 18, 2012 |date=November 15, 2006}}</ref> The film, about a low-ranking university lecturer who abducts a neighbor's dog, was shot in the same apartment complex where Bong had lived after his marriage.<ref>{{cite web |last=Paquet |first=Darcy |title=Barking Dogs Never Bite |url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm00.html#dogs |publisher=Koreanfilm.org |accessdate=October 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003015832/http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm00.html#dogs|archivedate=October 3, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> At the time of its release in February 2000, it received little commercial interest but some positive critical reviews.

Although passed over by the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Venice Film Festival]], the film eventually received its international premiere, again at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, where it picked up three awards including Best Director. The film also received an unusually strong critical reception on its release in foreign territories, such as France and the U.S.<ref name=\"page\" />\n\n[[File:Bong Joon-Ho at 2010 Independent Spirit Awards.jpg|thumb|Bong at the [[25th Independent Spirit Awards]] on March 5, 2010]]\n\nFollowing this, Bong took some time to contribute short films to two anthology film projects. ''Influenza'' (2004) is a 30-minute work acted out entirely in front of real [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras stationed throughout Seoul. The film, which charts a desperate man's turn to violent crime over the space of five years, was commissioned by the [[Jeonju International Film Festival]], together with works by Japanese director Sogo Ishii and Hong Kong-based [[Yu Lik-wai]]. ''Twentidentity'', meanwhile, is a 20-part anthology film made by alumni of the Korean Academy of Film Arts, on the occasion of the school's 20th anniversary.

After rushing to meet deadlines, the film received a rapturous premiere in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section of the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]]. Although local audiences were slightly more critical of ''The Host'' than attendees at Cannes, the film was nonetheless a major summer hit. With theater owners calling for more and more prints, the film enjoyed South Korea's widest release ever (on over a third of the nation's 1,800 screens) and set a new [[List of highest-grossing films in South Korea|box office record]] with 13 million tickets sold.

Harris also said that \"if I was doing a scene and it was a couple of pages long, he would never shoot the whole thing one way. He'd shoot a few lines, like the first beat of the scene, and then he would turn the camera around and get my part for that part of the scene. Then he would change the angle a little bit\". He additionally noted that \"the editor was sitting right there on the stage, right below the set with a big tent, actually getting the footage as they were filming.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/ed-harris-snowpiercer-interview/ |title=Ed Harris Talks SNOWPIERCER, Joining the Film, Being a Fan of Bong Joon Ho and His Unusual Shooting Style, Editing While Shooting, and Working with Chris Evans |last=Radish |first=Christina |date=June 25, 2014 |publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |accessdate=June 25, 2014}}</ref> Fellow actor [[Daniel Henshall]] echoed Harris' sentiment calling Bong \"precise\" and \"very sure of what he wants\".

The film is about a [[theatrical producer|theater producer]] and his accountant who, as part of a scam, have to stage the worst [[stage musical]] they can create. They eventually base it on [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazis. Because of this theme ''The Producers'' was controversial from the start <ref>https://books.google.be/books?id=vOeYCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=the+producers+mel+brooks+controversial+release&source=bl&ots=ti4C7-mtd8&sig=ACfU3U2RZHToZQL0djrqZ_ef9I6xZt_q0A&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAypCTj-noAhWM16QKHQvID3Y4FBDoATADegQIDBAq#v=onepage&q=the%20producers%20mel%20brooks%20controversial%20release&f=false</ref> <ref>https://books.google.be/books?id=saNvAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=the+producers+mel+brooks+controversial+release&source=bl&ots=8LcJy7bac4&sig=ACfU3U3fHqD5k7bqZPQ-lvDhikBwD_Bhsw&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjIvbmCj-noAhWNLewKHQoLDMA4ChDoATAHegQIDBAq#v=onepage&q=the%20producers%20mel%20brooks%20controversial%20release&f=false</ref> and received mixed reviews. It became a [[cult movie]] <ref>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/16/comedy.theproducers</ref> and found a more positive critical reception later. \n\n''The Producers'' was Brooks's directorial debut. For the film, he won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. 25 years later, the film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] and placed eleventh on the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] list. It was later adapted by Brooks and [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]] as a [[The Producers (musical)|stage musical]], which itself was adapted into a [[The Producers (2005 film)|film]].\n\n==Plot==\nMax Bialystock ([[Zero Mostel]]) was once the toast of [[Broadway theater|Broadway]], but is now an aging, fraudulent, corruptible, and greedy Broadway [[Theatrical producer|producer]] who ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence romancing lascivious, wealthy elderly women in exchange for money for his next play. Accountant Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom ([[Gene Wilder]]), a nervous young man prone to hysterics, arrives at Max's office to audit his accounts and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively minor fraud, and while shuffling numbers, Leo has a revelation\u2014a producer can make a lot more money with a flop than a hit by overselling shares in the production, because no one will audit the books of a play presumed to have lost money. Max immediately puts this scheme into action. They will oversell shares on a massive scale and produce a play that will close on opening night, thus avoiding payouts and leaving the duo free to flee to [[Rio de Janeiro]] with the profits. Leo is afraid such a criminal venture will fail and they will go to prison, but Max eventually convinces him that his drab existence is no better than prison.\n\nThe partners find the ideal play for their scheme: ''[[Springtime for Hitler|Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden]].'' It is \"a love letter to Hitler\" written in total sincerity by deranged ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind ([[Kenneth Mars]]). Max and Leo persuade Liebkind to sign over the stage rights, telling him they want to show the world \"the Hitler you loved, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler with a song in his heart.\" To guarantee the show is a flop, they hire Roger De Bris ([[Christopher Hewett]]), a director whose plays \"close on the first day of rehearsal.\" The part of Hitler goes to a charismatic but barely coherent [[flower power]] [[hippie]] named Lorenzo Saint DuBois, also known as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|L.S.D.]] ([[Dick Shawn]]), who had mistakenly wandered into the theater during the [[Casting (performing arts)|casting call]]. Max sells 25,000% of the play to his regular investors. At the theatre on opening night, Max tries to ensure a truly terrible review by attempting to bribe the critic come to see the show. As expected, the man is outraged and hurls the money Max wrapped around the tickets he gave him at Max's feet. Max and Leo sneak off to a bar across the street to wait for the audience to storm out once they actually see the show.\n\nThe play opens with a lavish production of the title song, \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler]],\" which celebrates [[Nazi Germany]] crushing Europe (\"Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for [[Poland]] and [[France]]\"). The audience, initially horrified, (they rise, en masse after the number) ends up finding L.S.D.'s [[beatnik]]-like portrayal and constant [[ad-lib|misinterpretations of the story]] hilarious, and misinterprets the production as a [[satire]]. Meanwhile, L.S.D.'s portrayal of Hitler enrages and humiliates Franz, who \u2014 after dropping the curtain and rushing out on stage \u2014 confronts the audience and rants about the treatment of his beloved play. He is knocked out and removed from the stage, and the audience assumes that his rant was part of the act. ''Springtime For Hitler'' is declared a smash hit, which means that the investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out. Max laments, \u201cI was so careful... I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast... where did I go right?\u201d\n\nA gun-wielding Franz confronts Max and Leo, accusing them of breaking the \"[[Hitler oath|Siegfried Oath]]\". He tries to shoot himself, but runs out of bullets. The three then decide to blow up the theater to end the production, but they are injured, arrested, tried, and found \"incredibly guilty\" by the jury. Before sentencing, Leo makes an impassioned statement praising Max for changing his life and being his friend while also referring to him as \"the most selfish man I have ever met in my life\". Max tells the judge that they have learned their lesson.\n\nMax, Leo, and Franz are sent to the state penitentiary. There they produce a new play called ''Prisoners of Love'', a show which proves to be even worse than ''Springtime For Hitler'', mostly because Leo and Max are striving to make a good play instead of a bad one. While Max and Franz earnestly supervise rehearsals, Leo continues their old scam\u2014overselling shares of the play to their fellow prisoners, and even to the warden. The song \"Prisoners of Love\" plays while the credits roll.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of The Producers characters}}\n* [[Zero Mostel]] as Max Bialystock\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom\n* [[Dick Shawn]] as Lorenzo St. DuBois (L.S.D.)\n* [[Estelle Winwood]] as \"Hold Me!

Glazier laughed so much at Brooks' performance of the script, he accepted the project by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make it! I don\u2019t know how, but we\u2019re gonna make this movie!\u201d<ref name=billboard>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= 'Producers' Producer: The Man Behind a Classic|newspaper= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=White |first=Timothy|date= April 26, 1997|accessdate=January 9, 2010|page=87}}</ref>\n\nGlazier budgeted the film at $1 million, and sought financiers. Half the money came from philanthropist [[Louis Wolfson]], who liked the idea of laughing at a dictator,<ref name=guardian /> and the remainder, along with the distribution, was arranged by [[Joseph E. Levine]] of [[Embassy Pictures]]. Levine's only condition was to change the title, as he felt many distributors would not carry a picture named ''Springtime for Hitler.''<ref name=billboard /> Brooks renamed it ''The Producers,'' considering it [[ironic]] as \"these guys are anything but producers.\"<ref name=makingof /> As Brooks \"couldn't think of anybody to direct it,\" eventually he decided to take the task for himself, even though he himself had only directed one play before.<ref name=pb75 /> While Levine was insecure in having an inexperienced director, Brooks convinced him by saying it would be cost-effective, and he knew how to do physical comedy after being a [[stage manager]] in ''[[Your Show of Shows]].''<ref name=makingof /><ref name=billboard />\n\n=== Casting ===\nBrooks wanted [[Zero Mostel|Samuel \u201cZero\u201d Mostel]] as Max Bialystock, feeling he was an energetic actor who could convey such an egotistical character.<ref name=makingof /> Glazier sent the script to Mostel's lawyer, but the attorney hated it and never showed it to the actor. Eventually, Brooks had to send the script through Mostel's wife Kathryn Harkin. While Mostel did not like the prospect of playing \u201ca Jewish producer going to bed with old women on the brink of the grave,\u201d his wife liked the script so much, she eventually convinced him to accept the role.<ref name=vf /><ref name=billboard /> Mostel allowed all his pent-up hostilities towards all the sources of his professional disappointments to spill over into his performance as Bialystock, making his a bitter, hate-filled, and often angry interpretation.\n\nGene Wilder met Brooks in 1963, as Wilder performed with Brooks' then-girlfriend [[Anne Bancroft]] in a stage adaptation of ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children|Mother Courage]].'' Wilder complained that the audience was laughing at his serious performance, and Brooks replied that Wilder was \"a natural comic, you look like [[Harpo Marx]],\" and said he would cast him as Leo Bloom once he finished the then-titled ''Springtime for Hitler.''<ref name=billboard /> When production arrived, [[Peter Sellers]] accepted an invitation to play Leo Bloom, but he never contacted again, so Brooks remembered Wilder, who was about to make his film debut in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]].''<ref name=makingof /> Wilder received the script to ''The Producers'' as Brooks visited him backstage during a performance of ''[[Luv (play)|Luv]],'' and his co-star [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]] was brought for a brief appearance as Eva Braun.<ref name=vf />\n\n[[Dustin Hoffman]] was originally cast as Liebkind. According to Brooks, late on the night before shooting began, Hoffman begged Brooks to let him out of his commitment to do the role so he could audition for the starring role in ''[[The Graduate]].'' Brooks was aware of the film, which co-starred Brooks's now-wife, Anne Bancroft, and, skeptical that Hoffman would get the role, agreed to let him audition. When Hoffman did win the role of Ben Braddock, Brooks called in Kenneth Mars as Liebkind.<ref name=makingof /> Mars was originally invited because Brooks envisioned him as Roger De Bris, given he played a gay psychiatrist on Broadway. Instead, Mars was interested in Liebkind's role, which was his film debut and had him remain on the role while not filming as [[method acting]].<ref name=vf /> De Bris was instead portrayed by [[Christopher Hewett]], the first actor who read for the role.<ref name=makingof />\n\nOnce recent [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] graduate [[Lee Meredith]] was invited to audition, she was given the condition of knowing a Swedish accent. She borrowed a book from the AADA library to learn the accent, and won the role of Ulla with the screen test featuring the scene of her dancing. Bancroft suggested her friend [[Andr\u00e9as Voutsinas]] for the role of Carmen Ghia, feeling his thick Greek accent would fit. Brooks thought of [[Dick Shawn]] to play Lorenzo \u201cL.S.D.\u201d Saint DuBois, and the actor accepted for both liking the part and having no work. [[Bill Macy]], the husband in the TV series ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]],'' was brought for a cameo as a jury foreman.<ref name=\"makingof\">{{IMDb title|0425221|The Making of ''The Producers''}}</ref>  Writer-director Mel Brooks is heard briefly in the film, his voice dubbed over a dancer singing, \"Don't be stupid, be a smarty/Come and join the Nazi Party,\" in the song \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime For Hitler]]\". His version of the line is also dubbed into each performance of the musical, as well as the 2005 movie version.\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography for ''The Producers'' began on May 22, 1967. Filming had to be done in 40 days on a $941,000 budget, and Brooks managed to fit both requests.<ref name=guardian /> The primary location was the [[Chelsea Studios]] in [[New York City]], where the musical version (2005) was also shot.<ref>{{cite book| url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231#v=onepage&q&f=false |chapter=Union Square/Gramercy Park/Chelsea |page=231 |title= New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York| first= Richard |last=Alleman | year= 2005 |publisher= Broadway Books | isbn= 9780767916349 |location=New York}}</ref> The now-demolished [[Playhouse Theatre (New York City)|Playhouse Theatre]] hosted the ''Springtime for Hitler'' play, and various actors who heard the film was seeking an actor for Hitler were cast in the musical number. The crew tried to film on location whenever possible, filming on such midtown Manhattan locales as [[Central Park]], the [[Empire State Building]], and [[Lincoln Center]].<ref name=vf />\n\nBrooks's lack of knowledge of filmmaking had him committing many mistakes during production, requiring the help of assistant director [[Michael Hertzberg]].<ref name=pb75 /> Being both inexperienced and insecure, Brooks started to have tantrums and behave angrily. He got impatient with the slow development compared to how quick television production was, temporarily banned Glazier from the set, berated a visiting reporter from ''[[The New York Times]],'' and had clashes with cinematographer Joseph Coffey and main actor Zero Mostel.<ref name=vf /> Mostel also had a troublesome behavior caused by a leg injury received in a 1960 bus accident, which made his contract feature a clause dismissing Mostel from any work after 5:30 pm. Given the fact that the leg injury got worse in humid weather,<ref name=makingof /> the last scene, filmed at the [[Revson Fountain]] in Lincoln Center, had Mostel throwing a fit and giving up on production. Glazier had to leave a dentist's appointment and rush to the set where Mostel and Brooks were arguing, and once the producer managed to calm them down, the resulting scene had to be shot all night long.<ref name=vf />\n\nDespite being described as a lavish production number, \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler]]\" was not ready until the first rehearsals. Brooks sat with Olsen and first-time composer [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]] at the piano, and improvised some lyrics. Morris then developed the stage performance with choreographer Alan Johnson, instructed to do the number \"big, wonderful, flashy, but terrible.\" As Brooks kept suggesting bizarre costume ideas to enhance the [[burlesque]] nature of \"Springtime for Hitler\", such as women with clothes inspired by beer mugs and pretzels, Johnson decided to showcase them all in a parade.\n\nFew scenes had to be altered from the original script. Leo and Max would visit the [[Parachute Jump]] in [[Coney Island]], but the attraction was closed by the time filming began. Brooks filmed Liebkind making Max and Leo swear the Siegfried Oath, where they promised fealty to ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]],'' accompanied by ''[[The Ride of the Valkyries]]'' and wearing [[horned helmet]]s. But feeling that it \"went overboard,\" Brooks cut the scene, which was restored in the stage adaptation.<ref name=\"makingof\" />\n\nThe art direction and costumes emphasized the color yellow, which Brooks considered a funny color.

One of the mixed reviews came from [[Renata Adler]], who, writing for ''[[The New York Times]],'' stated: \"''The Producers'', which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is a violently mixed bag. Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way.\" About the acting, she writes that Mostel is \"overacting grotesquely under the direction of Mel Brooks\" and that, in the role of ''Max Bialystock,'' he is \"as gross and unfunny as only an enormous comedian bearing down too hard on some frail, tasteless routines can be.\" Co-star Wilder fares better and is called \"wonderful,\" thanks to doing \"fine,\" despite being \"forced to be as loud and as fast as Mostel\" and \"[g]oing through long, infinitely variegated riffs and arpeggios of neuroticism,\" and playing his part \"as though he were [[Dustin Hoffman]] being played by [[Danny Kaye]].\" She also puts the movie into the bigger context of \"contemporary\" comedy and that it has the same \"episodic, [[revue]] quality\" in the way it is \"not building laughter, but stringing it together skit after skit, some vile, some boffo.\" Her early conclusion, at the end of the first paragraph, is also a comparison to other comedic movies of the time, it reads: \"[''The Producers''] is less delicate than [[Lenny Bruce]], less funny than ''[[Dr. Strangelove]],'' but much funnier than ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]'' or ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]\"''<ref name=\"nyt68adler\">{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1968/03/19/archives/screen-the-producers-at-fine-arts.html | title=Screen: 'The Producers' at Fine Arts| date=March 19, 1968 | authorlink= Renata Adler |first=Renata |last=Alder |publisher=The New York Times Company | work= [[The New York Times]] | accessdate= May 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe more critical and negative reviews partly targeted the directorial style and broad ethnic humor,<ref name=\"hoberman\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/15/movies/film-when-the-nazis-became-nudniks.html?pagewanted=all| title=FILM; When The Nazis Became Nudniks| first=J. |last=Hoberman| date=April 15, 2001| work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=February 2, 2007|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref> but also commonly noted the bad taste and insensitivity of devising a broad comedy about two Jews conspiring to cheat theatrical investors by devising a designed-to-fail tasteless Broadway musical about [[Hitler]] only 23 years after the end of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Symons\">{{cite journal|title=An audience for Mel Brooks's The Producers: the avant-garde of the masses.(Critical essay) |first=Alex |last=Symons |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-17530754_ITM |work=Journal of Popular Film and Television |date=March 22, 2006 |accessdate=February 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153713/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-17530754_ITM |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Among the most harsh critics were [[Stanley Kauffmann]] in ''[[The New Republic]],'' who wrote that \"the film bloats into sogginess\" and \" Springtime for Hitler. . .doesn\u2019t even rise to the level of tastelessness,\u201d [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] wrote The Producers \"is a model of how not to make a comedy,\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Reverse Angle: A Decade of American Film|url=https://archive.org/details/reverseangledeca0000simo|url-access=registration|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=Crown Publishers Inc. |year=1982 |page=[https://archive.org/details/reverseangledeca0000simo/page/145 145]}}</ref> and [[Pauline Kael]] who called it \"amateurishly crude\" in ''[[The New Yorker]].''

The film is about a [[theatrical producer|theater producer]] and his accountant who, as part of a scam, have to stage the worst [[stage musical]] they can create. They eventually base it on [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazi's. Because of this theme ''The Producers'' was controversial from the start <ref>https://books.google.be/books?id=vOeYCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=the+producers+mel+brooks+controversial+release&source=bl&ots=ti4C7-mtd8&sig=ACfU3U2RZHToZQL0djrqZ_ef9I6xZt_q0A&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiAypCTj-noAhWM16QKHQvID3Y4FBDoATADegQIDBAq#v=onepage&q=the%20producers%20mel%20brooks%20controversial%20release&f=false</ref> <ref>https://books.google.be/books?id=saNvAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=the+producers+mel+brooks+controversial+release&source=bl&ots=8LcJy7bac4&sig=ACfU3U3fHqD5k7bqZPQ-lvDhikBwD_Bhsw&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjIvbmCj-noAhWNLewKHQoLDMA4ChDoATAHegQIDBAq#v=onepage&q=the%20producers%20mel%20brooks%20controversial%20release&f=false</ref> and received mixed reviews. It became a [[cult movie]] <ref>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/16/comedy.theproducers</ref> and found a more positive critical reception later. \n\n''The Producers'' was Brooks's directorial debut. For the film, he won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. 25 years later, the film was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] and placed eleventh on the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] list. It was later adapted by Brooks and [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]] as a [[The Producers (musical)|stage musical]], which itself was adapted into a [[The Producers (2005 film)|film]].\n\n==Plot==\nMax Bialystock ([[Zero Mostel]]) was once the toast of [[Broadway theater|Broadway]], but is now an aging, fraudulent, corruptible, and greedy Broadway [[Theatrical producer|producer]] who ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence romancing lascivious, wealthy elderly women in exchange for money for his next play. Accountant Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom ([[Gene Wilder]]), a nervous young man prone to hysterics, arrives at Max's office to audit his accounts and discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively minor fraud, and while shuffling numbers, Leo has a revelation\u2014a producer can make a lot more money with a flop than a hit by overselling shares in the production, because no one will audit the books of a play presumed to have lost money. Max immediately puts this scheme into action. They will oversell shares on a massive scale and produce a play that will close on opening night, thus avoiding payouts and leaving the duo free to flee to [[Rio de Janeiro]] with the profits. Leo is afraid such a criminal venture will fail and they will go to prison, but Max eventually convinces him that his drab existence is no better than prison.\n\nThe partners find the ideal play for their scheme: ''[[Springtime for Hitler|Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden]].'' It is \"a love letter to Hitler\" written in total sincerity by deranged ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind ([[Kenneth Mars]]). Max and Leo persuade Liebkind to sign over the stage rights, telling him they want to show the world \"the Hitler you loved, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler with a song in his heart.\" To guarantee the show is a flop, they hire Roger De Bris ([[Christopher Hewett]]), a director whose plays \"close on the first day of rehearsal.\" The part of Hitler goes to a charismatic but barely coherent [[flower power]] [[hippie]] named Lorenzo Saint DuBois, also known as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|L.S.D.]] ([[Dick Shawn]]), who had mistakenly wandered into the theater during the [[Casting (performing arts)|casting call]]. Max sells 25,000% of the play to his regular investors. At the theatre on opening night, Max tries to ensure a truly terrible review by attempting to bribe the critic come to see the show. As expected, the man is outraged and hurls the money Max wrapped around the tickets he gave him at Max's feet. Max and Leo sneak off to a bar across the street to wait for the audience to storm out once they actually see the show.\n\nThe play opens with a lavish production of the title song, \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler]],\" which celebrates [[Nazi Germany]] crushing Europe (\"Springtime for Hitler and Germany/Winter for [[Poland]] and [[France]]\"). The audience, initially horrified, (they rise, en masse after the number) ends up finding L.S.D.'s [[beatnik]]-like portrayal and constant [[ad-lib|misinterpretations of the story]] hilarious, and misinterprets the production as a [[satire]]. Meanwhile, L.S.D.'s portrayal of Hitler enrages and humiliates Franz, who \u2014 after dropping the curtain and rushing out on stage \u2014 confronts the audience and rants about the treatment of his beloved play. He is knocked out and removed from the stage, and the audience assumes that his rant was part of the act. ''Springtime For Hitler'' is declared a smash hit, which means that the investors will be expecting a larger financial return than can be paid out. Max laments, \u201cI was so careful... I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast... where did I go right?\u201d\n\nA gun-wielding Franz confronts Max and Leo, accusing them of breaking the \"[[Hitler oath|Siegfried Oath]]\". He tries to shoot himself, but runs out of bullets. The three then decide to blow up the theater to end the production, but they are injured, arrested, tried, and found \"incredibly guilty\" by the jury. Before sentencing, Leo makes an impassioned statement praising Max for changing his life and being his friend while also referring to him as \"the most selfish man I have ever met in my life\". Max tells the judge that they have learned their lesson.\n\nMax, Leo, and Franz are sent to the state penitentiary. There they produce a new play called ''Prisoners of Love'', a show which proves to be even worse than ''Springtime For Hitler'', mostly because Leo and Max are striving to make a good play instead of a bad one. While Max and Franz earnestly supervise rehearsals, Leo continues their old scam\u2014overselling shares of the play to their fellow prisoners, and even to the warden. The song \"Prisoners of Love\" plays while the credits roll.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{See also|List of The Producers characters}}\n* [[Zero Mostel]] as Max Bialystock\n* [[Gene Wilder]] as Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom\n* [[Dick Shawn]] as Lorenzo St. DuBois (L.S.D.)\n* [[Estelle Winwood]] as \"Hold Me!

Glazier laughed so much at Brooks' performance of the script, he accepted the project by saying, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna make it! I don\u2019t know how, but we\u2019re gonna make this movie!\u201d<ref name=billboard>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=DA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false |title= 'Producers' Producer: The Man Behind a Classic|newspaper= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=White |first=Timothy|date= April 26, 1997|accessdate=January 9, 2010|page=87}}</ref>\n\nGlazier budgeted the film at $1 million, and sought financiers. Half the money came from philanthropist [[Louis Wolfson]], who liked the idea of laughing at a dictator,<ref name=guardian /> and the remainder, along with the distribution, was arranged by [[Joseph E. Levine]] of [[Embassy Pictures]]. Levine's only condition was to change the title, as he felt many distributors would not carry a picture named ''Springtime for Hitler.''<ref name=billboard /> Brooks renamed it ''The Producers,'' considering it [[ironic]] as \"these guys are anything but producers.\"<ref name=makingof /> As Brooks \"couldn't think of anybody to direct it,\" eventually he decided to take the task for himself, even though he himself had only directed one play before.<ref name=pb75 /> While Levine was insecure in having an inexperienced director, Brooks convinced him by saying it would be cost-effective, and he knew how to do physical comedy after being a [[stage manager]] in ''[[Your Show of Shows]].''<ref name=makingof /><ref name=billboard />\n\n=== Casting ===\nBrooks wanted [[Zero Mostel|Samuel \u201cZero\u201d Mostel]] as Max Bialystock, feeling he was an energetic actor who could convey such an egotistical character.<ref name=makingof /> Glazier sent the script to Mostel's lawyer, but the attorney hated it and never showed it to the actor. Eventually, Brooks had to send the script through Mostel's wife Kathryn Harkin. While Mostel did not like the prospect of playing \u201ca Jewish producer going to bed with old women on the brink of the grave,\u201d his wife liked the script so much, she eventually convinced him to accept the role.<ref name=vf /><ref name=billboard /> Mostel allowed all his pent-up hostilities towards all the sources of his professional disappointments to spill over into his performance as Bialystock, making his a bitter, hate-filled, and often angry interpretation.\n\nGene Wilder met Brooks in 1963, as Wilder performed with Brooks' then-girlfriend [[Anne Bancroft]] in a stage adaptation of ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children|Mother Courage]].'' Wilder complained that the audience was laughing at his serious performance, and Brooks replied that Wilder was \"a natural comic, you look like [[Harpo Marx]],\" and said he would cast him as Leo Bloom once he finished the then-titled ''Springtime for Hitler.''<ref name=billboard /> When production arrived, [[Peter Sellers]] accepted an invitation to play Leo Bloom, but he never contacted again, so Brooks remembered Wilder, who was about to make his film debut in ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]].''<ref name=makingof /> Wilder received the script to ''The Producers'' as Brooks visited him backstage during a performance of ''[[Luv (play)|Luv]],'' and his co-star [[Ren\u00e9e Taylor]] was brought for a brief appearance as Eva Braun.<ref name=vf />\n\n[[Dustin Hoffman]] was originally cast as Liebkind. According to Brooks, late on the night before shooting began, Hoffman begged Brooks to let him out of his commitment to do the role so he could audition for the starring role in ''[[The Graduate]].'' Brooks was aware of the film, which co-starred Brooks's now-wife, Anne Bancroft, and, skeptical that Hoffman would get the role, agreed to let him audition. When Hoffman did win the role of Ben Braddock, Brooks called in Kenneth Mars as Liebkind.<ref name=makingof /> Mars was originally invited because Brooks envisioned him as Roger De Bris, given he played a gay psychiatrist on Broadway. Instead, Mars was interested in Liebkind's role, which was his film debut and had him remain on the role while not filming as [[method acting]].<ref name=vf /> De Bris was instead portrayed by [[Christopher Hewett]], the first actor who read for the role.<ref name=makingof />\n\nOnce recent [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] graduate [[Lee Meredith]] was invited to audition, she was given the condition of knowing a Swedish accent. She borrowed a book from the AADA library to learn the accent, and won the role of Ulla with the screen test featuring the scene of her dancing. Bancroft suggested her friend [[Andr\u00e9as Voutsinas]] for the role of Carmen Ghia, feeling his thick Greek accent would fit. Brooks thought of [[Dick Shawn]] to play Lorenzo \u201cL.S.D.\u201d Saint DuBois, and the actor accepted for both liking the part and having no work. [[Bill Macy]], the husband in the TV series ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]],'' was brought for a cameo as a jury foreman.<ref name=\"makingof\">{{IMDb title|0425221|The Making of ''The Producers''}}</ref>  Writer-director Mel Brooks is heard briefly in the film, his voice dubbed over a dancer singing, \"Don't be stupid, be a smarty/Come and join the Nazi Party,\" in the song \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime For Hitler]]\". His version of the line is also dubbed into each performance of the musical, as well as the 2005 movie version.\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography for ''The Producers'' began on May 22, 1967. Filming had to be done in 40 days on a $941,000 budget, and Brooks managed to fit both requests.<ref name=guardian /> The primary location was the [[Chelsea Studios]] in [[New York City]], where the musical version (2005) was also shot.<ref>{{cite book| url= https://books.google.ca/books?id=wDpSaPkSt-8C&pg=PA231#v=onepage&q&f=false |chapter=Union Square/Gramercy Park/Chelsea |page=231 |title= New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York| first= Richard |last=Alleman | year= 2005 |publisher= Broadway Books | isbn= 9780767916349 |location=New York}}</ref> The now-demolished [[Playhouse Theatre (New York City)|Playhouse Theatre]] hosted the ''Springtime for Hitler'' play, and various actors who heard the film was seeking an actor for Hitler were cast in the musical number. The crew tried to film on location whenever possible, filming on such midtown Manhattan locales as [[Central Park]], the [[Empire State Building]], and [[Lincoln Center]].<ref name=vf />\n\nBrooks's lack of knowledge of filmmaking had him committing many mistakes during production, requiring the help of assistant director [[Michael Hertzberg]].<ref name=pb75 /> Being both inexperienced and insecure, Brooks started to have tantrums and behave angrily. He got impatient with the slow development compared to how quick television production was, temporarily banned Glazier from the set, berated a visiting reporter from ''[[The New York Times]],'' and had clashes with cinematographer Joseph Coffey and main actor Zero Mostel.<ref name=vf /> Mostel also had a troublesome behavior caused by a leg injury received in a 1960 bus accident, which made his contract feature a clause dismissing Mostel from any work after 5:30 pm. Given the fact that the leg injury got worse in humid weather,<ref name=makingof /> the last scene, filmed at the [[Revson Fountain]] in Lincoln Center, had Mostel throwing a fit and giving up on production. Glazier had to leave a dentist's appointment and rush to the set where Mostel and Brooks were arguing, and once the producer managed to calm them down, the resulting scene had to be shot all night long.<ref name=vf />\n\nDespite being described as a lavish production number, \"[[Springtime for Hitler (song)|Springtime for Hitler]]\" was not ready until the first rehearsals. Brooks sat with Olsen and first-time composer [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]] at the piano, and improvised some lyrics. Morris then developed the stage performance with choreographer Alan Johnson, instructed to do the number \"big, wonderful, flashy, but terrible.\" As Brooks kept suggesting bizarre costume ideas to enhance the [[burlesque]] nature of \"Springtime for Hitler\", such as women with clothes inspired by beer mugs and pretzels, Johnson decided to showcase them all in a parade.\n\nFew scenes had to be altered from the original script. Leo and Max would visit the [[Parachute Jump]] in [[Coney Island]], but the attraction was closed by the time filming began. Brooks filmed Liebkind making Max and Leo swear the Siegfried Oath, where they promised fealty to ''[[Siegfried (opera)|Siegfried]],'' accompanied by ''[[The Ride of the Valkyries]]'' and wearing [[horned helmet]]s. But feeling that it \"went overboard,\" Brooks cut the scene, which was restored in the stage adaptation.<ref name=\"makingof\" />\n\nThe art direction and costumes emphasized the color yellow, which Brooks considered a funny color. For the posters in Bialystock's office, production designer [[Charles Rosen]] found a collector in the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] and doctored a few posters to include the character's name. Rosen also incorporated an anecdote of his life, as he had to share a small elevator with a flamboyant Broadway director, to design the lift at Roger De Bris's house.<ref name=makingof /> Post-production extended for months, as Brooks had gotten [[final cut privilege]], but still had complaints with [[Ralph Rosenblum]] regarding his editing.\n\n== Release ==\nAccording to Brooks, after the film was completed, Embassy executives refused to release it as being in \"bad taste.\" The film's premiere in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], on November 22, 1967,<ref name=\"tcm\">{{tcmdb title|id=87256|title=The Producers}}</ref> was a disaster and the studio considered shelving it. However, Peter Sellers saw the film privately and placed an advertisement in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in support of the film's wider release.<ref name=\"makingof\" /><ref name=\"dvdjourn\" />\nSellers was familiar with the film because, according to Brooks, Sellers \"had accepted the role of Bloom and then was never heard from again.\"<ref name=\"makingof\" /><ref name=\"dvdjourn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/reviews/p/producers68_de.shtml|title=The Producers (1968): Deluxe Edition|first=Mark |last=Bourne|work=The DVD Journal|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref> The film allegedly was \"banned in Germany.\"<ref>{{cite journal| title=Radio Times | date=24\u201330 November 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn Sweden, however, the title literally translates as \"Springtime for Hitler.\" As a result of its success, all but two of Mel Brooks movies in Swedish have been given similar titles: \"Springtime for Mother-In-Law\" (''[[The Twelve Chairs (1970 film)|The Twelve Chairs]]''); \"Springtime for the Sheriff\" (''[[Blazing Saddles]]''); \"Springtime for Frankenstein\" (''[[Young Frankenstein]]''); \"Springtime for the Silent Movies\" (''[[Silent Movie]]''); \"Springtime for the Lunatics\" (''[[High Anxiety]]''); \"Springtime for World History\" (''[[History of the World, Part I]]''); \"Springtime for Space\" (''[[Spaceballs]]''); and \"Springtime for the Slum\" (''[[Life Stinks]]'').<ref name=\"Entertainment\">{{Cite book\n|title= The Entertainment Weekly Guide to the Greatest Movies Ever Made I|year=1996|publisher=Warner Books|isbn=9780446670289|page=42|author=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|location=New York}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nWhen it was first released, the film received a mixed response and garnered some exceptionally harsh reviews, while others considered it a great success. One of the mixed reviews came from [[Renata Adler]], who, writing for ''[[The New York Times]],'' stated: \"''The Producers'', which opened yesterday at the Fine Arts Theater, is a violently mixed bag. Some of it is shoddy and gross and cruel; the rest is funny in an entirely unexpected way.\" About the acting, she writes that Mostel is \"overacting grotesquely under the direction of Mel Brooks\" and that, in the role of ''Max Bialystock,'' he is \"as gross and unfunny as only an enormous comedian bearing down too hard on some frail, tasteless routines can be.\" Co-star Wilder fares better and is called \"wonderful,\" thanks to doing \"fine,\" despite being \"forced to be as loud and as fast as Mostel\" and \"[g]oing through long, infinitely variegated riffs and arpeggios of neuroticism,\" and playing his part \"as though he were [[Dustin Hoffman]] being played by [[Danny Kaye]].\" She also puts the movie into the bigger context of \"contemporary\" comedy and that it has the same \"episodic, [[revue]] quality\" in the way it is \"not building laughter, but stringing it together skit after skit, some vile, some boffo.\" Her early conclusion, at the end of the first paragraph, is also a comparison to other comedic movies of the time, it reads: \"[''The Producers''] is less delicate than [[Lenny Bruce]], less funny than ''[[Dr. Strangelove]],'' but much funnier than ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]'' or ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]\"''<ref name=\"nyt68adler\">{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1968/03/19/archives/screen-the-producers-at-fine-arts.html | title=Screen: 'The Producers' at Fine Arts| date=March 19, 1968 | authorlink= Renata Adler |first=Renata |last=Alder |publisher=The New York Times Company | work= [[The New York Times]] | accessdate= May 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe more critical and negative reviews partly targeted the directorial style and broad ethnic humor,<ref name=\"hoberman\">{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/15/movies/film-when-the-nazis-became-nudniks.html?pagewanted=all| title=FILM; When The Nazis Became Nudniks| first=J. |last=Hoberman| date=April 15, 2001| work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate=February 2, 2007|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref> but also commonly noted the bad taste and insensitivity of devising a broad comedy about two Jews conspiring to cheat theatrical investors by devising a designed-to-fail tasteless Broadway musical about [[Hitler]] only 23 years after the end of [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Symons\">{{cite journal|title=An audience for Mel Brooks's The Producers: the avant-garde of the masses.(Critical essay) |first=Alex |last=Symons |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-17530754_ITM |work=Journal of Popular Film and Television |date=March 22, 2006 |accessdate=February 2, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153713/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-17530754_ITM |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Among the most harsh critics were [[Stanley Kauffmann]] in ''[[The New Republic]],'' who wrote that \"the film bloats into sogginess\" and \" Springtime for Hitler. . .doesn\u2019t even rise to the level of tastelessness,\u201d [[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] wrote The Producers \"is a model of how not to make a comedy,\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Reverse Angle: A Decade of American Film|url=https://archive.org/details/reverseangledeca0000simo|url-access=registration|last1=Simon|first1=John |publisher=Crown Publishers Inc. |year=1982 |page=[https://archive.org/details/reverseangledeca0000simo/page/145 145]}}</ref> and [[Pauline Kael]] who called it \"amateurishly crude\" in ''[[The New Yorker]].''
