Such codification occurred at the national level, such as with the publication of the [[Lieber Code]] in the United States, and at the international level with the adoption of the treaties during the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]]. Moreover, trials in national courts during this period further helped clarify the law.<ref name=\"Cassese\"/> Following the end of [[World War II]], major developments in the law occurred. Numerous trials of [[Axis powers|Axis]] war criminals established the [[Nuremberg principles]], such as notion that war crimes constituted [[International criminal law|crimes defined by international law]].

Every single member state of the United Nations has currently ratified the conventions, which are universally accepted as [[customary international law]], applicable to every situation of armed conflict in the world. However, the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions adopted in 1977 containing the most pertinent, detailed and comprehensive protections of [[international humanitarian law]] for persons and objects in modern warfare are still not ratified by a number of States continuously engaged in armed conflicts, namely the United States, Israel, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, and others. Accordingly, states retain different codes and values with regard to wartime conduct.

Crimes against peace include planning, preparing, initiating, or waging a [[war of aggression]], or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements, or assurances.  Because the definition of a state of \"war\" may be debated, the term \"war crime\" itself has seen different usage under different systems of international and military law.

Civilians ''cannot'' be made the object of an attack, but the death/injury of civilians while conducting an attack on a military objective are governed under principles such as of proportionality and [[military necessity]] and can be permissible. Military necessity \"permits the destruction of life of \u2026 persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable by the armed conflicts of the war; ... it does not permit the killing of innocent inhabitants for purposes of revenge or the satisfaction of a lust to kill. The destruction of property to be lawful must be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trials of war criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council law no. 10, Nuremberg, October 1946-April, 1949.|last=Germany (Territory under Allied occupation, 1945\u20131955 : U.S. Zone)|date=1997|publisher=William S.

On the other hand, an extraordinary military advantage would be necessary to justify an operation posing risks of collateral death or injury to thousands of civilians. In \"grayer cases\" the legal question of whether the expected incidental harm is excessive may be very subjective. For this reason, States have chosen to apply a \"clearly excessive\" standard for determining whether a criminal violation has occurred.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Department of Defense law of war manual|last=United States.

In the case of former [[Yugoslavia]], [[NATO]] pilots hit a civilian object ([[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]])  that was of no military significance, but the pilots had no idea of determining it aside from their orders. The committee ruled that \"the aircrew involved in the attack should not be assigned any responsibility for the fact they were given the wrong target and that it is inappropriate to attempt to assign criminal responsibility for the incident to senior leaders because they were provided with wrong information by officials of another agency.\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/en/press/final-report-prosecutor-committee-established-review-nato-bombing-campaign-against-federal|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|website=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia}}</ref> The report also notes that \"Much of the material submitted to the OTP consisted of reports that civilians had been killed, often inviting the conclusion to be drawn that crimes had therefore been committed.

Such codification occurred at the national level, such as with the publication of the [[Lieber Code]] in the United States, and at the international level with the adoption of the treaties during the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]]. Moreover, trials in national courts during this period further helped clarify the law.<ref name=\"Cassese\"/> Following the end of [[World War II]], major developments in the law occurred. Numerous trials of [[Axis powers|Axis]] war criminals established the [[Nuremberg principles]], such as notion that war crimes constituted [[International criminal law|crimes defined by international law]]. Additionally, the [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1949 defined new war crimes and established that states could exercise [[universal jurisdiction]] over such crimes.<ref name=\"Cassese\"/> In the late 20th century and early 21st century, following the creation of several [[international court]]s, additional categories of war crimes applicable to armed conflicts other than those between states, such as [[civil war]]s, were defined.<ref name=\"Cassese\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chinese killed by Japanese Army in a ditch, Hsuchow.jpg|thumb|[[Suzhou]], China, 1938.

Every single member state of the United Nations has currently ratified the conventions, which are universally accepted as [[customary international law]], applicable to every situation of armed conflict in the world.

Crimes against peace include planning, preparing, initiating, or waging a [[war of aggression]], or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements, or assurances.  Because the definition of a state of \"war\" may be debated, the term \"war crime\" itself has seen different usage under different systems of international and military law. It has some degree of application outside of what some may consider to be a state of \"war\", but in areas where conflicts persist enough to constitute social instability.\n\nThe legalities of war have sometimes been accused of containing favoritism toward the winners (\"[[Victor's justice]]\"),<ref>{{cite book|last=Zolo|first=Danilo|title=Victors' Justice: From Nuremberg to Baghdad|publisher=Verso|date=November 2, 2009|isbn=978-1-84467-317-9|url=https://archive.org/details/victorsjusticefr00zolo}}</ref> as some controversies have not been ruled as war crimes.

Civilians ''cannot'' be made the object of an attack, but the death/injury of civilians while conducting an attack on a military objective are governed under principles such as of proportionality and [[military necessity]] and can be permissible. Military necessity \"permits the destruction of life of \u2026 persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable by the armed conflicts of the war; ... it does not permit the killing of innocent inhabitants for purposes of revenge or the satisfaction of a lust to kill. The destruction of property to be lawful must be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trials of war criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council law no. 10, Nuremberg, October 1946-April, 1949.|last=Germany (Territory under Allied occupation, 1945\u20131955 : U.S. Zone)|date=1997|publisher=William S. Hein|isbn=1575882159|oclc=37718851}}</ref>\n\nFor example, conducting an operation on ammunition depot or a terrorist training camp would not be prohibited because a farmer is plowing a field in the area, the farmer is not the object of attack and the operations would adhere to proportionality and military necessity. On the other hand, an extraordinary military advantage would be necessary to justify an operation posing risks of collateral death or injury to thousands of civilians. In \"grayer cases\" the legal question of whether the expected incidental harm is excessive may be very subjective. For this reason, States have chosen to apply a \"clearly excessive\" standard for determining whether a criminal violation has occurred.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Department of Defense law of war manual|last=United States. Department of Defense. Office of General Counsel, author.|oclc=953877027}}</ref>\n\nWhen there is no justification for military action, such as civilians being made the object of attack, a proportionality analysis is unnecessary to conclude that the attack is unlawful.\n\n=== International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ===\nFor aerial strikes, pilots generally have to rely on information supplied external sources (Headquarters, ground troops) that a specific position is in fact a military target. In the case of former [[Yugoslavia]], [[NATO]] pilots hit a civilian object ([[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]])  that was of no military significance, but the pilots had no idea of determining it aside from their orders. The committee ruled that \"the aircrew involved in the attack should not be assigned any responsibility for the fact they were given the wrong target and that it is inappropriate to attempt to assign criminal responsibility for the incident to senior leaders because they were provided with wrong information by officials of another agency.\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/en/press/final-report-prosecutor-committee-established-review-nato-bombing-campaign-against-federal|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|website=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia}}</ref> The report also notes that \"Much of the material submitted to the OTP consisted of reports that civilians had been killed, often inviting the conclusion to be drawn that crimes had therefore been committed.

He overestimated the perceived risk but argued that [[Hague IV Convention|Hague IV]] authorized the destruction because if it's necessary to war.

In 2012 for a 25-performance run he played the titular role in his own ''The Further Adventures of Hedda Gabler'' in a production by New York company Exit, Pursued by a Bear, with [[Billy Porter (entertainer)|Billy Porter]] playing the co-leading role of Mammy.<ref>[http://hifibri.blogspot.com/2012/03/dinner-great-theatre-at-further.html The Further Adventures of Hedda Gabler]</ref> Both roles had been created for and played by women until this production.\n\nWhitty now lives in [[West Hollywood, California]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Broadway musical]]\n* [[LGBT culture in New York City]]\n* [[List of self-identified LGBTQ New Yorkers]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb name|nm1036221}}\n* [http://www.oregonlive.com/performance/index.ssf/2008/06/jenny_grahamoregon_shakespeare.html Finding his purpose: Jeff Whitty's road to 'Avenue Q']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070320140231/http://www.americantheatrewing.org/seminars/detail/avenue_q_09_03 Production: Avenue Q] - ''Working in the Theatre Seminar'' video at [[American Theatre Wing|American Theatre Wing.org]], September 2003\n*[http://advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid53039.asp Advocate.com]: Jeff Whitty\u2019s Broadway-bound Tales of the City musical: Just how gay will it be?\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for Jeffrey Whitty\n|list  =\n{{Independent Spirit Award for Best Screenplay}}\n{{Satellite Award Best Adapted Screenplay}}\n{{TonyAward MusicalBook 2001\u20132025}}\n{{Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Whitty, Jeffrey}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:21st-century American dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:American male stage actors]]\n[[Category:Gay writers]]\n[[Category:LGBT writers from the United States]]\n[[Category:University of Oregon alumni]]\n[[Category:Tisch School of the Arts alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Coos Bay, Oregon]]\n[[Category:LGBT dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:American male dramatists and playwrights]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 2 links to disambiguation pages -(You can help)-Michael Mayer,Tom Kitt", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Whitty"}
{"title_page": "Evolution as fact and theory", "text_new": "\n\nMany [[scientist]]s and [[Philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] have described '''evolution as fact and theory''', a phrase which was used as the title of an article by [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in 1981. He describes ''fact'' in science as meaning [[data]], not absolute certainty but \"confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent\". A [[scientific theory]] is a well-substantiated explanation of such facts. The facts of [[evolution]] come from observational evidence of current processes, from imperfections in organisms recording historical [[common descent]], and from transitions in the [[fossil]] record. Theories of evolution provide a provisional explanation for these facts.<ref>Gould, Stephen Jay (1981) [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html \"Evolution as Fact and Theory\"] ''Discover'' 2 (May): 34-37; Reprinted in ''[[Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes]]'' New York: W. W. Norton, 1994, [https://books.google.com/books?id=o6g2tvN0nJoC&pg=PA253 pp. 253-262.]</ref>\n\nEach of the words \"evolution\", \"fact\" and \"theory\" has several meanings in different contexts. ''Evolution'' means change over time, as in [[stellar evolution]].{{cn|date=August 2019}} In [[biology]] it refers to observed changes in organisms, to their descent from a common ancestor, and at a technical level to a change in [[gene frequency]] over time; it can also refer to explanatory theories (such as [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]]) which explain the mechanisms of evolution. To a scientist, ''fact'' can describe a repeatable observation that all can agree on; it can refer to something that is so well established that nobody in a community disagrees with it; and it can also refer to the truth or falsity of a proposition. To the public, ''theory'' can mean an opinion or conjecture (''e.g.'', \"it's only a theory\"), but among scientists it has a much stronger connotation of \"well-substantiated explanation\". With this number of choices, people can often talk past each other, and meanings become the subject of [[Ordinary language philosophy|linguistic analysis]].\n\nEvidence for evolution continues to be accumulated and tested. The scientific literature includes statements by evolutionary [[biologist]]s and philosophers of science demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact and theory.\n\n==Evolution, fact and theory==\nEvolution has been described as \"fact and theory\"; \"fact, not theory\"; \"only a theory, not a fact\"; \"multiple theories, not fact\"; and \"neither fact, nor theory.\"<ref>See [[#Evolution as theory and fact in the literature|section 2]]</ref> The disagreements among these statements, however, have more to do with the meaning of words than the substantial issues and this controversy is discussed below.\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Life timeline}}\n{{Main|Introduction to evolution|Evolution}}\nProfessor of biology [[Jerry Coyne]] sums up biological evolution succinctly:\n:''Life on Earth evolved gradually beginning with one primitive species\u2014perhaps a self-replicating molecule\u2014that lived more than 3.5 billion years ago; it then branched out over time, throwing off many new and diverse species; and the mechanism for most (but not all) of evolutionary change is natural selection.''{{sfn|Coyne|2009|p=3}}\n\nThis shows the breadth and scope of the issue, incorporating the scientific fields of [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[genetics]], [[geology]], and [[paleontology]], among many others.\n\nBut the central core of evolution is generally defined as changes in trait or gene frequency in a population of organisms from one generation to the next.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|p=400}} This has been dubbed the standard genetic definition of evolution. Natural selection is only one of several mechanisms in the theory of evolutionary change that explains how organisms historically adapt to changing environments. The principles of heredity were re-discovered in 1900, after Darwin's death, in [[Gregor Mendel]]'s research on the inheritance of simple trait variations in peas.{{sfn|Wright|1984}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Subsequent work into genetics, [[mutation]], paleontology, and [[developmental biology]] expanded the applicability and scope of Darwin's original theory.\n\nAccording to [[Douglas J. Futuyma]]:\n:''Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different [[allele]]s within a population (such as those determining [[blood type]]s) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest [[Obcell|proto-organism]] to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.''{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe word ''evolution'' in a broad sense refers to processes of change, from stellar evolution to changes in language. In biology, the meaning is more specific: heritable changes which accumulate over generations of a population. Individual organisms do not evolve in their lifetimes, but variations in the genes they inherit can become more or less common in the population of organisms. Any changes during the lifetime of organisms which are not inherited by their offspring are not part of biological evolution.<ref name=\"Moran_What\">{{cite web |url=http://talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html |title=What is Evolution? |last=Moran |first=Laurence |year=1993 |website=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-19}}</ref>\n\nTo [[Keith Stewart Thomson]], the word evolution has at least three distinct meanings:<ref name=\"Thomson_1982\">{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=Keith Stewart |authorlink=Keith Stewart Thomson |date=September\u2013October 1982 |title=Marginalia: The meanings of evolution |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=529\u2013531 |jstor=27851662 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n#The general sense of ''change over time''.\n#All life forms have descended with modifications from ancestors in a process of common descent.\n#The cause or mechanisms of these process of change, that are examined and explained by evolutionary theories.\n\nThomson remarks: \"Change over time is a fact, and descent from common ancestors is based on such unassailable logic that we act as though it is a fact. Natural selection provides the outline of an explanatory theory.\"<ref name=\"Thomson_1982\" />\n\nBiologists consider it to be a scientific fact that evolution has occurred in that modern organisms differ from past forms, and evolution is still occurring with discernible differences between organisms and their descendants. There is such strong quantitative support for the second that scientists regard common descent as being as factual as the understanding that in the [[Solar System]] the Earth orbits the Sun, although the examination of the fundamentals of these processes is still in progress. There are several theories about the mechanisms of evolution, and there are still active debates about specific mechanisms.<ref name=\"Moran_fact_theory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html |title=Evolution is a Fact and a Theory |last=Moran |first=Laurence |year=1993 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-19}}</ref>\n\nThere is a fourth meaning for the word ''evolution'' that is ''not'' used by biologists today. In 1857, the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] defined it as \"change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous.\" He claimed (before Darwin) that this was \"settled beyond dispute\" for organic evolution and applied it to the evolution of star systems, geology and human society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Spencer |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Spencer |date=January\u2013April 1857 |title=Progress: its Law and Cause |url=http://hsmt.history.ox.ac.uk/hsmt/courses_reading/undergraduate/authority_of_nature/week_3/spencer.pdf |journal=[[Westminster Review]] |series=New Series |volume=11 |page=446 |oclc=26747836 |ref=harv |access-date=2015-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150116183022/http://hsmt.history.ox.ac.uk/hsmt/courses_reading/undergraduate/authority_of_nature/week_3/spencer.pdf |archive-date=2015-01-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Even Spencer by 1865 was admitting that his definition was imperfect,{{sfn|Spencer|1865|p=[https://archive.org/stream/firstprinciples17spengoog#page/n188/mode/2up 176]}} but it remained popular throughout the nineteenth century before declining under the criticisms of [[William James]] and others.{{sfn|James|1911|loc=[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/j/james/william/memories/chapter6.html Chapter 6: \"Herbert Spencer's Autobiography\"]}}<ref>{{cite conference |url=http://www.american-philosophy.org/events/documents/2011_Program_files/S_brady_saap_2011_paper.doc |title=Evolutionary Opponents: William James and Herbert Spencer |last=Brady |first=Michael |date=March 12, 2011 |conference=Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy |conference-url=http://american-philosophy.org/events/saap_2011_program.htm |location=Cheney, WA |format=DOC |accessdate=2013-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403072509/http://www.american-philosophy.org/events/documents/2011_Program_files/S_brady_saap_2011_paper.doc |archive-date=April 3, 2016 |url-status=dead }} Paper presented at the 38th Annual Meeting.</ref>\n\n===Fact===\n{{Main|Scientific fact}}\nFact is often used by scientists to refer to experimental or empirical data or [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] verifiable observations.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[WordNet]] |title=scientific fact |url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=scientific+fact |accessdate=2013-02-21 |year=2010 |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |location=Princeton, NJ |quote=(an observation that has been confirmed repeatedly and is accepted as true (although its truth is never final))}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Views of the National Park Service Glossary |title=Fact |url=http://www2.nature.nps.gov/views/System/Glossary.htm#F |accessdate=2013-02-21 |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |location=Washington, D.C. |quote=In science, a fact is an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true.'

But scientists can also use fact to mean something that has been tested or observed so many times that there is no longer a compelling reason to keep testing or looking for examples.

Scientists continue to argue about particular explanations or mechanisms at work in specific instances of evolution \u2013 but the fact that evolution has occurred, and is still occurring, is undisputed.\n\nA common misconception is that evolution cannot be reliably observed because it all happened millions of years ago and the science therefore is not dependent on facts (in the initial sense above). However, both Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], the co-founders of the theory, and all subsequent biologists depend primarily on observations of living organisms; Darwin concentrated largely on the breeding of domesticated animals whereas Wallace started from the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] distribution of species in the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Malay Archipelago]]. In the early twentieth century, [[population genetics]] had centre stage, and more recently [[DNA]] has become the main focus of observation and experimentation.\n\nPhilosophers of science argue that we do not know mind-independent empirical truths with absolute certainty: even direct observations may be \"theory laden\" and depend on assumptions about our senses and the measuring instruments used.

He discussed this widely with many of his intellectual companions, and conducted further research in the background to his other writings and work.

A [[scientific theory]] is a well-substantiated explanation of such facts.

''Evolution'' means change over time, as in [[stellar evolution]].{{cn|date=August 2019}} In [[biology]] it refers to observed changes in organisms, to their descent from a common ancestor, and at a technical level to a change in [[gene frequency]] over time; it can also refer to explanatory theories (such as [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]]) which explain the mechanisms of evolution. To a scientist, ''fact'' can describe a repeatable observation that all can agree on; it can refer to something that is so well established that nobody in a community disagrees with it; and it can also refer to the truth or falsity of a proposition. To the public, ''theory'' can mean an opinion or conjecture (''e.g.'', \"it's only a theory\"), but among scientists it has a much stronger connotation of \"well-substantiated explanation\". With this number of choices, people can often talk past each other, and meanings become the subject of [[Ordinary language philosophy|linguistic analysis]].\n\nEvidence for evolution continues to be accumulated and tested. The scientific literature includes statements by evolutionary [[biologist]]s and philosophers of science demonstrating some of the different perspectives on evolution as fact and theory.\n\n==Evolution, fact and theory==\nEvolution has been described as \"fact and theory\"; \"fact, not theory\"; \"only a theory, not a fact\"; \"multiple theories, not fact\"; and \"neither fact, nor theory.\"<ref>See [[#Evolution as theory and fact in the literature|section 2]]</ref> The disagreements among these statements, however, have more to do with the meaning of words than the substantial issues and this controversy is discussed below.\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Life timeline}}\n{{Main|Introduction to evolution|Evolution}}\nProfessor of biology [[Jerry Coyne]] sums up biological evolution succinctly:\n:''Life on Earth evolved gradually beginning with one primitive species\u2014perhaps a self-replicating molecule\u2014that lived more than 3.5 billion years ago; it then branched out over time, throwing off many new and diverse species; and the mechanism for most (but not all) of evolutionary change is natural selection.''{{sfn|Coyne|2009|p=3}}\n\nThis shows the breadth and scope of the issue, incorporating the scientific fields of [[zoology]], [[botany]], [[genetics]], [[geology]], and [[paleontology]], among many others.\n\nBut the central core of evolution is generally defined as changes in trait or gene frequency in a population of organisms from one generation to the next.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|p=400}} This has been dubbed the standard genetic definition of evolution. Natural selection is only one of several mechanisms in the theory of evolutionary change that explains how organisms historically adapt to changing environments. The principles of heredity were re-discovered in 1900, after Darwin's death, in [[Gregor Mendel]]'s research on the inheritance of simple trait variations in peas.{{sfn|Wright|1984}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Subsequent work into genetics, [[mutation]], paleontology, and [[developmental biology]] expanded the applicability and scope of Darwin's original theory.\n\nAccording to [[Douglas J. Futuyma]]:\n:''Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different [[allele]]s within a population (such as those determining [[blood type]]s) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest [[Obcell|proto-organism]] to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions.''{{sfn|Futuyma|1998}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe word ''evolution'' in a broad sense refers to processes of change, from stellar evolution to changes in language. In biology, the meaning is more specific: heritable changes which accumulate over generations of a population. Individual organisms do not evolve in their lifetimes, but variations in the genes they inherit can become more or less common in the population of organisms. Any changes during the lifetime of organisms which are not inherited by their offspring are not part of biological evolution.<ref name=\"Moran_What\">{{cite web |url=http://talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-definition.html |title=What is Evolution? |last=Moran |first=Laurence |year=1993 |website=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-19}}</ref>\n\nTo [[Keith Stewart Thomson]], the word evolution has at least three distinct meanings:<ref name=\"Thomson_1982\">{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=Keith Stewart |authorlink=Keith Stewart Thomson |date=September\u2013October 1982 |title=Marginalia: The meanings of evolution |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=529\u2013531 |jstor=27851662 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n#The general sense of ''change over time''.\n#All life forms have descended with modifications from ancestors in a process of common descent.\n#The cause or mechanisms of these process of change, that are examined and explained by evolutionary theories.\n\nThomson remarks: \"Change over time is a fact, and descent from common ancestors is based on such unassailable logic that we act as though it is a fact. Natural selection provides the outline of an explanatory theory.\"<ref name=\"Thomson_1982\" />\n\nBiologists consider it to be a scientific fact that evolution has occurred in that modern organisms differ from past forms, and evolution is still occurring with discernible differences between organisms and their descendants. There is such strong quantitative support for the second that scientists regard common descent as being as factual as the understanding that in the [[Solar System]] the Earth orbits the Sun, although the examination of the fundamentals of these processes is still in progress. There are several theories about the mechanisms of evolution, and there are still active debates about specific mechanisms.<ref name=\"Moran_fact_theory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html |title=Evolution is a Fact and a Theory |last=Moran |first=Laurence |year=1993 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2015-01-19}}</ref>\n\nThere is a fourth meaning for the word ''evolution'' that is ''not'' used by biologists today.

Scientists continue to argue about particular explanations or mechanisms at work in specific instances of evolution \u2013 but the fact that evolution has occurred, and is still occurring, is undisputed.\n\nA common misconception is that evolution cannot be reliably observed because it all happened millions of years ago and the science therefore is not dependent on facts (in the initial sense above). However, both Darwin and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], the co-founders of the theory, and all subsequent biologists depend primarily on observations of living organisms; Darwin concentrated largely on the breeding of domesticated animals whereas Wallace started from the [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] distribution of species in the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Malay Archipelago]]. In the early twentieth century, [[population genetics]] had centre stage, and more recently [[DNA]] has become the main focus of observation and experimentation.\n\nPhilosophers of science argue that we do not know mind-independent empirical truths with absolute certainty: even direct observations may be \"theory laden\" and depend on assumptions about our senses and the measuring instruments used.

In the case of evolution through natural selection, Darwin conceived the hypothesis around 1839, and made a first draft of the concept three years later in 1842. He discussed this widely with many of his intellectual companions, and conducted further research in the background to his other writings and work.

Proof exists in [[formal science]]s, such as a [[mathematical proof]] where symbolic expressions can represent [[infinite set]]s and scientific laws having precise definitions and outcomes of the terms. Proof has other meanings as it descends from its Latin roots (provable, probable, ''probare'' L.) meaning ''to test''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sundholm |first=G\u00f6ran |date=July 1994 |title=Proof-Theoretical Semantics and Fregean Identity Criteria for Propositions |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/11990/9_054_019.pdf?sequence=1 |format=PDF |journal=[[The Monist]] |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=294\u2013314 |doi=10.5840/monist199477315 |ref=harv|hdl=1887/11990 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Bissell |first=Derek |date=September 1996 |title=Statisticians have a Word for it |url=http://www.teachingstatistics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/bissell1.pdf |journal=Teaching Statistics |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=87\u201389 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9639.1996.tb00300.x  |ref=harv|citeseerx=10.1.1.385.5823 }}</ref> In this sense a proof is an inference to the best or most parsimonious explanation through a publicly verifiable demonstration (a test) of the factual (i.e., observed) and causal evidence from carefully controlled experiments. Stephen Jay Gould argued that Darwin's research, for example, pointed to the coordination of so many pieces of evidence that no other configuration other than his theory could offer a conceivable causal explanation of the facts.
