The Bushy Run Battlefield marks the spot where Colonel Henry Boquet led the British and American troops to defeat the Indians in a battle on the 5th and 6 August that year.  This victory is credited with helping to prevent the capture of Fort Pitt, and it served the purpose of reopening communication and supply lines.  Today, this {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} historical landmark is the site of a museum, nature trails, picnic areas, and an annual reenactment of the Battle of Bushy Run.\n[[File:McKee Glass-Late-1880s-Jeannette-By-Terry-Perich-John-Howard-.png|thumb|McKee Glass Factory, late 1880s]]\nFirst incorporated as a borough on June 7, 1889,<ref name=\"pittsburghlive.com\">[http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/s_490133.html \"Jeannette hopes to reclaim glory of manufacturing heyday\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227234334/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/s_490133.html |date=2008-02-27 }}, Tribune Review, January 28, 2007</ref> Jeannette earned the nickname as \"the glass city\" in recognition of the numerous glass plants founded in the area, with those factories contributing to the city's original stature as the first large manufacturing town in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]].  In fact, the impact of the glass industry was so significant that the city's name actually comes from Jeannette E. Hartupee McKee, the wife of H. Sellers McKee, a local industrialist who cofounded the Chambers and McKee Glass Works<ref>{{cite web|url=https://substreet.org/mckee-glass/|title=SUBSTREET - McKee Glass WorksJeannette, PA|date=5 November 2015|publisher=}}</ref> and was a member of the elite [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]] of [[Johnstown Flood]] fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~mhender/jeanette.html|title=Jeanette, PA|website=homepages.rootsweb.com}}</ref>  Mckee and his partner J.A. Chambers also have the distinction of naming Jeannette's main street, Clay Avenue after their financial backer, Richard W. Clay.  On January 1, 1938, Jeannette became a third class city with Attorney John M. OConnell as the first mayor.<ref name=\"inwestmoreland.com\">[http://www.inwestmoreland.com/wclocalinfo/towns/jeannette/index.aspx Great Towns in Westmoreland, \"Jeannette A Great Town in Westmoreland County\"]</ref>\n\nAt times, there were as many as 7 significant factories operating in the city of Jeannette including some of the most well known in the history of the glass industry.   Names like Jeannette Glass; Fort Pitt Glass; the Pittsburgh Lamp, Brass and Glass Company; American-Saint Gobain, [[Westmoreland Glass Company|Westmoreland Glass]]; and others all supplied the country with everything from plate glass windows, to bottles, to milk glass, and much more for many decades.  Some estimates over the years indicate that Jeannette once produced somewhere between 70-85% of the world's glass.  Unfortunately, Jeannette's glass industry was one of the early United States industry victims of cheap, foreign competition that made it less expensive to produce glass overseas and today only two glass factories remain in the city.\n\nJeannette's manufacturing history doesn't end with the glass industry.  Today's [[Elliott Company]] represents an evolution dating back to 1914 when William Swan Elliott moved his company to Jeannette.  The Elliott Company, owned by the Carrier Corporation from 1957 until 1979 and by United Technologies Corporation until a 1987 buyout that returned the company to a privately owned status, only to become an [[Ebara Corporation]] subsidiary in 2000, has always had a solid reputation in the dynamo, turbine, and large rotating equipment industry.  In 1952, the company produced the first diesel-engine [[turbocharger]] used in a racecar and subsequently built more than 40,000 more of them for other diesel applications.  Throughout the 1970s, local residents routinely witnessed a revolving door of trains hauling parts into the plant on North 4th Street and hauling the huge turbine engines back down the tracks.<ref>A History of Accomplishments, Elliott Company Website</ref> Today, the Elliott Company is the city's largest employer.<ref name=\"inwestmoreland.com\"/>  Jeannette is also the manufacturing home of Jensen Steam Engine Mfg. Co., Inc., which produces small working models of steam engines and turbines.  The Jensen shop is only a few blocks from the Elliott plant.\n\nIn 2018, the Elliott Company was approved to purchase the former Jeannette Glass site and expand their operations to downtown Jeannette.<ref>[https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2018/07/27/Pennsylvania-s-glass-city-finds-footing-in-battle-against-Rust-Belt-hardships-1/stories/201805310161 \"Pennsylvania\u2019s \u2018glass city\u2019 finds footing in battle against Rust Belt hardships\"] ''Diana DiGangi''</ref> The facility could become operational by 2020.<ref>[https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/westmoreland-big-projects-big-changes-on-the-horizon/ \"Westmoreland: Big projects, big changes on the horizon\"], ''Signorini, Renatta''</ref>\n\nThe Pennsylvania Rubber Works, which moved to Jeannette from Erie, Pennsylvania, around 1903, was yet another key part of the city's significant industrial base.  Not only did this factory become a significant supplier of play balls (basketballs, footballs, tennis balls, etc.) and carpet underlay as part of General Tire in its later years; but the original Pennsylvania Rubber Works provided products for [[Jeep#The origins of the vehicle: the first jeeps|Jeeps]] and gas masks during World War II.<ref name=\"pittsburghlive.com\"/>\n\n== Notable people ==\n*Dr. Gerard Criner, Temple Lung Center.

The Bushy Run Battlefield marks the spot where Colonel Henry Boquet led the British and American troops to defeat the Indians in a battle on the 5th and 6 August that year.  This victory is credited with helping to prevent the capture of Fort Pitt, and it served the purpose of reopening communication and supply lines.  Today, this {{convert|200|acre|km2|adj=on}} historical landmark is the site of a museum, nature trails, picnic areas, and an annual reenactment of the Battle of Bushy Run.\n[[File:McKee Glass-Late-1880s-Jeannette-By-Terry-Perich-John-Howard-.png|thumb|McKee Glass Factory, late 1880s]]\nFirst incorporated as a borough on June 7, 1889,<ref name=\"pittsburghlive.com\">[http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/s_490133.html \"Jeannette hopes to reclaim glory of manufacturing heyday\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227234334/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/s_490133.html |date=2008-02-27 }}, Tribune Review, January 28, 2007</ref> Jeannette earned the nickname as \"the glass city\" in recognition of the numerous glass plants founded in the area, with those factories contributing to the city's original stature as the first large manufacturing town in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]].  In fact, the impact of the glass industry was so significant that the city's name actually comes from Jeannette E. Hartupee McKee, the wife of H. Sellers McKee, a local industrialist who cofounded the Chambers and McKee Glass Works<ref>{{cite web|url=https://substreet.org/mckee-glass/|title=SUBSTREET - McKee Glass WorksJeannette, PA|date=5 November 2015|publisher=}}</ref> and was a member of the elite [[South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club]] of [[Johnstown Flood]] fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~mhender/jeanette.html|title=Jeanette, PA|website=homepages.rootsweb.com}}</ref>  Mckee and his partner J.A. Chambers also have the distinction of naming Jeannette's main street, Clay Avenue after their financial backer, Richard W. Clay.  On January 1, 1938, Jeannette became a third class city with Attorney John M. OConnell as the first mayor.<ref name=\"inwestmoreland.com\">[http://www.inwestmoreland.com/wclocalinfo/towns/jeannette/index.aspx Great Towns in Westmoreland, \"Jeannette A Great Town in Westmoreland County\"]</ref>\n\nAt times, there were as many as 7 significant factories operating in the city of Jeannette including some of the most well known in the history of the glass industry.   Names like Jeannette Glass; Fort Pitt Glass; the Pittsburgh Lamp, Brass and Glass Company; American-Saint Gobain, [[Westmoreland Glass Company|Westmoreland Glass]]; and others all supplied the country with everything from plate glass windows, to bottles, to milk glass, and much more for many decades.  Some estimates over the years indicate that Jeannette once produced somewhere between 70-85% of the world's glass.  Unfortunately, Jeannette's glass industry was one of the early United States industry victims of cheap, foreign competition that made it less expensive to produce glass overseas and today only two glass factories remain in the city.\n\nJeannette's manufacturing history doesn't end with the glass industry.  Today's [[Elliott Company]] represents an evolution dating back to 1914 when William Swan Elliott moved his company to Jeannette.  The Elliott Company, owned by the Carrier Corporation from 1957 until 1979 and by United Technologies Corporation until a 1987 buyout that returned the company to a privately owned status, only to become an [[Ebara Corporation]] subsidiary in 2000, has always had a solid reputation in the dynamo, turbine, and large rotating equipment industry.  In 1952, the company produced the first diesel-engine [[turbocharger]] used in a racecar and subsequently built more than 40,000 more of them for other diesel applications.  Throughout the 1970s, local residents routinely witnessed a revolving door of trains hauling parts into the plant on North 4th Street and hauling the huge turbine engines back down the tracks.<ref>A History of Accomplishments, Elliott Company Website</ref> Today, the Elliott Company is the city's largest employer.<ref name=\"inwestmoreland.com\"/>  Jeannette is also the manufacturing home of Jensen Steam Engine Mfg. Co., Inc., which produces small working models of steam engines and turbines.  The Jensen shop is only a few blocks from the Elliott plant.\n\nIn 2018, the Elliott Company was approved to purchase the former Jeannette Glass site and expand their operations to downtown Jeannette.<ref>[https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2018/07/27/Pennsylvania-s-glass-city-finds-footing-in-battle-against-Rust-Belt-hardships-1/stories/201805310161 \"Pennsylvania\u2019s \u2018glass city\u2019 finds footing in battle against Rust Belt hardships\"] ''Diana DiGangi''</ref> The facility could become operational by 2020.<ref>[https://triblive.com/local/westmoreland/westmoreland-big-projects-big-changes-on-the-horizon/ \"Westmoreland: Big projects, big changes on the horizon\"], ''Signorini, Renatta''</ref>\n\nThe Pennsylvania Rubber Works, which moved to Jeannette from Erie, Pennsylvania, around 1903, was yet another key part of the city's significant industrial base.  Not only did this factory become a significant supplier of play balls (basketballs, footballs, tennis balls, etc.) and carpet underlay as part of General Tire in its later years; but the original Pennsylvania Rubber Works provided products for [[Jeep#The origins of the vehicle: the first jeeps|Jeeps]] and gas masks during World War II.<ref name=\"pittsburghlive.com\"/>\n\n== Notable people ==\n*Dr. Gerard Criner, Temple Lung Center.

It is the [[Capital city|administrative center]] of [[Rohatyn Raion]] ([[Raion|district]]). Population: {{Ua-pop-est2016|7,983}}.\n\nPrior to [[World War II]] the town was located in [[Poland]].\n\n==Name==\nIt was first mentioned in historical documents in 1184 as a part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]]. Its name seems to be derived from [[Ruthenia]], the name of the region of the location. However, the town emblem has a [[Antler|horn]] of a [[deer]] which gives the first part of the Slavic name of Rohatyn or Rogatyn \u2013 \"Rog\" (\"Horn\"). The second part \"Tyn\" can be connected with a word which means \"[[Stockade|Stacket]]\". Together these two words give us \"Horn Stacket\".\n\nAlso, there is a legend connected with the image of the deer horn of the town emblem. It is said that a wife of the [[Yaroslav Osmomysl|Duke Jaroslav Osmomysl]], being lost in a forest, met a deer. She survived by following the deer out of the forest. A fort was built with name \"Rogach\" (\"Deer\") on the place where the duchess supposedly stepped out of the forest.\n \nThe town name also can be connected with the Slavic word \"Rogatyna\" which means a heavy spear for martial arts or [[Eurasian brown bear|bear]] hunting (\"Bear Spear\"). It was first mentioned in 1149 (Laurentian Chronicle). In Polish heraldry \"Rogacina\" means \"Broadhead\".\n\n==History==\nIn 1415, under [[Poland|Polish]] rule, it was granted [[Magdeburg rights]], and subsequently developed into an important trading and manufacturing town.

It is the [[Capital city|administrative center]] of [[Rohatyn Raion]] ([[Raion|district]]). Population: {{Ua-pop-est2016|7,983}}.\n\nPrior to [[World War II]] the town was located in [[Poland]].\n\n==Name==\nIt was first mentioned in historical documents in 1184 as a part of the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]]. Its name seems to be derived from [[Ruthenia]], the name of the region of the location. However, the town emblem has a [[Antler|horn]] of a [[deer]] which gives the first part of the Slavic name of Rohatyn or Rogatyn \u2013 \"Rog\" (\"Horn\"). The second part \"Tyn\" can be connected with a word which means \"[[Stockade|Stacket]]\". Together these two words give us \"Horn Stacket\".\n\nAlso, there is a legend connected with the image of the deer horn of the town emblem. It is said that a wife of the [[Yaroslav Osmomysl|Duke Jaroslav Osmomysl]], being lost in a forest, met a deer. She survived by following the deer out of the forest. A fort was built with name \"Rogach\" (\"Deer\") on the place where the duchess supposedly stepped out of the forest.\n \nThe town name also can be connected with the Slavic word \"Rogatyna\" which means a heavy spear for martial arts or [[Eurasian brown bear|bear]] hunting (\"Bear Spear\"). It was first mentioned in 1149 (Laurentian Chronicle). In Polish heraldry \"Rogacina\" means \"Broadhead\".\n\n==History==\nIn 1415, under [[Poland|Polish]] rule, it was granted [[Magdeburg rights]], and subsequently developed into an important trading and manufacturing town. In 1520, the region was attacked by Crimean Tatars, [[H\u00fcrrem Sultan]], a native of Rohatyn, was captured there and sold to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] of which she became his concubine, then his legal wife and [[haseki sultan]].

In this regard, the Jauja hospital cared for many Spaniards. The wealth that they brought to Jauja helped it regain in popularity and strengthened the legend of \"the land of Cockaigne\". With the establishment of the sanatorium \"Domingo Olavegoya\" Jauja patients came from many parts of the world, making Jauja a cosmopolitan city.  This was described in the novel ''P\u00e1is de Jauja'', by [[Edgardo Rivera Mart\u00ednez]].

Montaro River valley forms the central highlands of Peru bounded by towering Cordillera ranges which has three tributary valleys known as the Masma, the Paca and the Yanamarca.

Its climate and its relative proximity to the capital of Lima ({{convert|250|km|mi}}) made it common for the inhabitants of the city of Lima to travel to this area continually. The weather is divided into three distinct seasons - the rainy season from November to April, winter from May to July and the dry sunny season, with strong winds from August to October.\n\n[[File:Jauja Hospital1.jpg|thumb|right|Hospital Domingo Olavegoya, Jauja]]\n\n==Culture==\nToday, Jauja is a city whose main activity is in the retail trade of agricultural products produced in the Mantaro Valley. Its streets are narrow and the houses are mainly built in the Republican Andean style from adobe plastered with plaster, with large wooden doors or hallways. \n[[File:Iglesia de Jauja.jpg|thumb|Iglesia matriz de la ciudad de Jauja.]]\nThe pristine town is famous for its Wednesday and Sunday markets.

The most popular festival is the Feast of San Sebastian and San Fabian (20 January) when ''Tunantada'' is celebrated for one week. Tunantada derives from the Spanish 'Tunantes'. Some believe that the origin of the dance lies at the end of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and the dawn of the Republican era of Peru. Through this dance of the festival, the natives imitate the Spanish, commemorating the years that the Spanish and natives existed alongside in Jauja.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaujinos.com/node/175 |title=Origen de la Tunantada |publisher=Jaujinos.com |accessdate=7 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713091204/http://www.jaujinos.com/node/175 |archivedate=13 July 2011 }}</ref> Locals dress up in the form of satirical wire mesh masks, eyes, whiskers and painted white complexion.

Over time, in folk song and legend, the Valley of Jauja became associated with the Land of Cockaigne. However, it was the riches of the real Jauja at the time of the Spanish conquest that created this myth. The myths sometimes depict Jauja as an island and other times as a city in a mythical land.

In this regard, the Jauja hospital cared for many Spaniards. The wealth that they brought to Jauja helped it regain in popularity and strengthened the legend of \"the land of Cockaigne\". With the establishment of the sanatorium \"Domingo Olavegoya\" Jauja patients came from many parts of the world, making Jauja a cosmopolitan city.  This was described in the novel ''P\u00e1is de Jauja'', by [[Edgardo Rivera Mart\u00ednez]].

No roadway connected the two parts of the county until one was built in 1935\u20131936. The still largely rural county is the major producer in the state of gas and oil, located in the southeast, and of timber, cattle, and poultry.\n\n==History==\nDeveloped during the period of [[Indian Removal]] from the Southeast and increasing settlement by European Americans in the region, Jasper County was formed in 1833 from the middle section of what was previously a much larger Jones County. It was named for Sgt. [[William Jasper]]<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print.

When a shell from a British warship shot away the flagstaff, he recovered the flag, raised it on a temporary staff, and held it under fire until a new staff was installed. Sgt. Jasper was killed in the [[Siege of Savannah]] in 1779.\n\nDuring the antebellum years, cotton was cultivated with [[Slavery in the United States|slave labor]] on large plantations in the county. This was the heyday of the county seat of [[Paulding, Mississippi]], called the \"Queen City of the East.\" It was a trading center for the plantations, as well as for yeomen farmers in the area. While some African Americans left the county in the early 20th century during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the rural South to northern cities, in 2010 Jasper County had a population that was 52.6 percent [[African American]], reflecting its history of cotton development and of people's ties to generations in this land.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, when local people declined to invest in railroad construction at Paulding, developers shifted the route to the west, stimulating growth at [[Bay Springs, Mississippi|Bay Springs]], where a sawmill had been built in 1880. About 1900 that community was incorporated as a city. In 1906 the state legislature designated Bay Springs as the second county seat. It attracted major timber companies, such as [[Georgia Pacific]], and other industries.\n\nIt was not until 1935\u20131936, during the [[Great Depression]] under a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project, that the first east\u2013west road was built across the county, connecting the city of Bay Springs in the west with [[Rose Hill, Jasper County, Mississippi|Rose Hill]], north of the community of Paulding, in the east.\n\nMedical facilities have been built at Bay Springs, with the Jasper General Hospital operating since 1962. Jasper General Patient Rehab was constructed on the hospital grounds in 2012 to supplement the offerings.\n\nRecreation in the county includes a 9-hole golf course at the Bay Springs Country Club. Fishing and hunting are available, including around Lake Claude Bennett near Rose Hill.\n\nIn the 21st century, the county is still largely rural, leading the state in timber, cattle, and poultry production. It is the state's major producer of gas and oil, with resources concentrated near the community of [[Heidelberg, Mississippi|Heidelberg]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|677|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|676|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.2|sqmi}} (0.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928074019/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=November 4, 2014 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files }}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:I-59.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 59 (Mississippi)|Interstate 59]]\n*[[Image:US 11.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 11 in Mississippi|U.S. Highway 11]]\n*[[Image:Circle sign 15.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 15]]\n*[[Image:Circle sign 18.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 18]]\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Newton County, Mississippi|Newton County]] (north)\n*[[Clarke County, Mississippi|Clarke County]] (east)\n*[[Wayne County, Mississippi|Wayne County]] (southeast)\n*[[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] (south)\n*[[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]] (west)\n\n===National protected area===\n*[[Bienville National Forest]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 3958\n|1850= 6184\n|1860= 11007\n|1870= 10884\n|1880= 12126\n|1890= 14785\n|1900= 15394\n|1910= 18498\n|1920= 18508\n|1930= 18634\n|1940= 19484\n|1950= 18912\n|1960= 16909\n|1970= 15994\n|1980= 17265\n|1990= 17114\n|2000= 18149\n|2010= 17062\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=16428\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 11, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 4, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ms190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

No roadway connected the two parts of the county until one was built in 1935-1936. The still largely rural county is the major producer in the state of gas and oil, located in the southeast, and of timber, cattle, and poultry.\n\n==History==\nDeveloped during the period of [[Indian Removal]] from the Southeast and increasing settlement by European Americans in the region, Jasper County was formed in 1833 from the middle section of what was previously a much larger Jones County. It was named for Sgt. [[William Jasper]]<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt. Print.

When a shell from a British warship shot away the flagstaff, he recovered the flag, raised it on a temporary staff, and held it under fire until a new staff was installed. Sgt. Jasper was killed in the [[Siege of Savannah]] in 1779.\n\nDuring the antebellum years, cotton was cultivated with [[Slavery in the United States|slave labor]] on large plantations in the county. This was the heyday of the county seat of [[Paulding, Mississippi]], called the \"Queen City of the East.\" It was a trading center for the plantations, as well as for yeomen farmers in the area. While some African Americans left the county in the early 20th century during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the rural South to northern cities, in 2010 Jasper County had a population that was 52.6 percent [[African American]], reflecting its history of cotton development and of people's ties to generations in this land.\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, when local people declined to invest in railroad construction at Paulding, developers shifted the route to the west, stimulating growth at [[Bay Springs, Mississippi|Bay Springs]], where a sawmill had been built in 1880. About 1900 that community was incorporated as a city. In 1906 the state legislature designated Bay Springs as the second county seat. It attracted major timber companies, such as [[Georgia Pacific]], and other industries.\n\nIt was not until 1935-1936, during the [[Great Depression]] under a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project, that the first east-west road was built across the county, connecting the city of Bay Springs in the west with [[Rose Hill, Jasper County, Mississippi|Rose Hill]], north of the community of Paulding, in the east.\n\nMedical facilities have been built at Bay Springs, with the Jasper General Hospital operating since 1962. Jasper General Patient Rehab was constructed on the hospital grounds in 2012 to supplement the offerings.\n\nRecreation in the county includes a 9-hole golf course at the Bay Springs Country Club. Fishing and hunting are available, including around Lake Claude Bennett near Rose Hill.\n\nIn the 21st century, the county is still largely rural, leading the state in timber, cattle, and poultry production. It is the state's major producer of gas and oil, with resources concentrated near the community of [[Heidelberg, Mississippi|Heidelberg]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|677|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|676|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1.2|sqmi}} (0.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928074019/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=November 4, 2014 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files }}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:I-59.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 59 (Mississippi)|Interstate 59]]\n*[[Image:US 11.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 11 in Mississippi|U.S. Highway 11]]\n*[[Image:Circle sign 15.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 15]]\n*[[Image:Circle sign 18.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 18]]\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Newton County, Mississippi|Newton County]] (north)\n*[[Clarke County, Mississippi|Clarke County]] (east)\n*[[Wayne County, Mississippi|Wayne County]] (southeast)\n*[[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones County]] (south)\n*[[Smith County, Mississippi|Smith County]] (west)\n\n===National protected area===\n*[[Bienville National Forest]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 3958\n|1850= 6184\n|1860= 11007\n|1870= 10884\n|1880= 12126\n|1890= 14785\n|1900= 15394\n|1910= 18498\n|1920= 18508\n|1930= 18634\n|1940= 19484\n|1950= 18912\n|1960= 16909\n|1970= 15994\n|1980= 17265\n|1990= 17114\n|2000= 18149\n|2010= 17062\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=16428\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 11, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 4, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ms190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 4, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

For decades, only a few major cities, such as  [[Moscow]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Madrid]], [[Warsaw]] and the transcontinental city of [[Istanbul]] contained skyscrapers. In recent years, however, construction has spread to many other cities on the continent, including [[Barcelona]], [[Benidorm]], [[Berlin]], [[Kiev]], [[Manchester]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Vienna]]. \n\nAs of 2020, seventeen European cities have more than 10 skyscrapers above {{convert|100|m|ft}}: [[Moscow]] (106), [[Istanbul]] (101), [[London]] (80), [[Paris]] (75), [[Frankfurt]] (36), [[Benidorm]] (26), [[Warsaw]] (26), [[Rotterdam]] (21), [[Milan]] (20), [[Kiev]] (18), [[Barcelona]] (16), [[Madrid]] (15), [[Manchester]] (15), [[Vienna]] (15), [[Berlin]] (12) and [[Naples]] (10) [[Cologne]] (10).\n\n==Tallest buildings==\n[[File:Third Ring Road near Moscow-City.png|alt=|thumb|The [[Moscow International Business Center]].]]\n[[File:London Skyline (125508655).jpeg|thumb|The [[City of London]].]]\n[[File:2019 London, Canary Wharf 01.jpg|thumb|[[Canary Wharf]] ([[London]]).]]\n[[File:Levent, Istanbul at night.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Levent]], [[Istanbul]].]]\n[[File:FrankfurtSkyline2014.jpg|thumb|[[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].]]\n[[File:La D\u00e9fense from the Arc de Triomphe, Paris 6 March 2015 003.jpg|thumb|[[La D\u00e9fense]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Warsaw panorama.png|alt=|thumb|[[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].]]\n[[File:Full Milan skyline from Duomo roof.jpg|thumb|[[Milan]], [[Italy]].]]\n[[File:Madrid-Azca-Castellana-170913.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\nThis lists ranks skyscrapers in Europe that stand at least {{convert|150|m|ft|0}} tall, based on standard height measurement. Architectural details does not include [[Radio masts and towers|antenna masts]]. The height data is subject to fluctuations due to simple changing of mast extensions. Existing structures are included for ranking purposes based on present height. Many non-architectural extensions (such as radio antennas) are easily added and removed from tall buildings without significantly changing the style and design of the building, which is seen as a significant part of the value of these buildings.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

For decades, only a few major cities, such as  [[Moscow]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Madrid]], [[Warsaw]] and the transcontinental city of [[Istanbul]] contained skyscrapers. In recent years, however, construction has spread to many other cities on the continent, including [[Barcelona]], [[Benidorm]], [[Berlin]], [[Kiev]], [[Manchester]], [[Milan]], [[Naples]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Vienna]]. \n\nAs of 2020, seventeen European cities have more than 10 skyscrapers above {{convert|100|m|ft}}: [[Moscow]] (106), [[Istanbul]] (101), [[London]] (80), [[Paris]] (75), [[Frankfurt]] (36), [[Benidorm]] (26), [[Warsaw]] (26), [[Rotterdam]] (21), [[Milan]] (20), [[Kiev]] (18), [[Barcelona]] (16), [[Madrid]] (15), [[Manchester]] (15), [[Vienna]] (15), [[Berlin]] (12) and [[Naples]] (10) [[Cologne]] (10).\n\n==Tallest buildings==\n[[File:Third Ring Road near Moscow-City.png|alt=|thumb|The [[Moscow International Business Center]].]]\n[[File:London Skyline (125508655).jpeg|thumb|The [[City of London]].]]\n[[File:2019 London, Canary Wharf 01.jpg|thumb|[[Canary Wharf]] ([[London]]).]]\n[[File:Levent, Istanbul at night.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Levent]], [[Istanbul]].]]\n[[File:FrankfurtSkyline2014.jpg|thumb|[[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]].]]\n[[File:La D\u00e9fense from the Arc de Triomphe, Paris 6 March 2015 003.jpg|thumb|[[La D\u00e9fense]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Warsaw panorama.png|alt=|thumb|[[Warsaw]], [[Poland]].]]\n[[File:Full Milan skyline from Duomo roof.jpg|thumb|[[Milan]], [[Italy]].]]\n[[File:Madrid-Azca-Castellana-170913.jpg|thumb|[[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\nThis lists ranks skyscrapers in Europe that stand at least {{convert|150|m|ft|0}} tall, based on standard height measurement. Architectural details does not include [[Radio masts and towers|antenna masts]]. The height data is subject to fluctuations due to simple changing of mast extensions. Existing structures are included for ranking purposes based on present height. Many non-architectural extensions (such as radio antennas) are easily added and removed from tall buildings without significantly changing the style and design of the building, which is seen as a significant part of the value of these buildings.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable

Instead, videos were hosted by third-party [[video sharing]] websites. The website was operated as a hobby by David Rock of [[Cheltenham]], [[England]].<ref name=\"imnocriminal\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/29/no_master_criminal/ |title=TV-Links man: 'I'm no master criminal' |publisher=The Register}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 October 2007, the website's servers, located in the [[Netherlands]], were raided and shut down by [[Gloucestershire]] police in cooperation with the [[Federation Against Copyright Theft]] (FACT) in response to complaints received from major [[United States|US]] [[film studio]]s about TV Links.<ref name=\"imnocriminal\"/><ref name=\"ds-tvlinksshutdown\" /> No official clarification has been made to date as to why the website was shut down.

He stated that the arrest and shutdown were initiated because TV Links allowed users \"[to view] any one of a large number of films and television programmes directly via the website.
