Schaya Iangar, a Madras University Professor, taken in the 1860s by a photographer from the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]]]]\nThe first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating \"some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.\" This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a \u2018university.\u2019 This university had twin departments&nbsp;\u2013 a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\n\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for \"creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.\" The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships \"for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.\" As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].\n\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] (1990), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University|Dr. M.G.R.

In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from [[Berhampur]] of Odisha in the North East, [[Trivandrum]] of Kerala in the South West, [[Bangalore]] and [[Mangalore]] of Karnataka in the West and [[Hyderabad]] of Andhra Pradesh in the North.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'' dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Kolappan \n  | first = B. \n  | title = Delay, howlers in Tamil Lexicon embarrass scholars \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | date = 22 June 2014 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus.JPG|thumb|University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus]]\n[[File:1937 Madras Legislative Assembly.jpg|thumb|In Senate House: A view of the [[Madras Legislative Assembly]] in 1937.]]\nThe description of the [[Coat of Arms]] of the university, designed in 1857, is:\n<blockquote>\n\"Argent ''(silver or white)'' on a Mount issuant from the basement a Tiger passant proper ''(walking and coloured naturally)'', on a Chief Sable ''(black across the top)'', a Pale Or ''(a gold or yellow vertical strip down the centre 1/3 of the top or chief)'', thereon, between two Elephants heads couped of the field, a lotus flower leaved and slipped of the third, together with this motto ''Doctrina Vim Promovet Insitam''\".\n</blockquote>\nThe coat of arms colours are: the base is light green, the tiger is yellow on a white background, the elephant is grey on a black background, the lotus is a white flower with olive green leaves, on a gold background.

Schaya Iangar, a Madras University Professor, taken in the 1860s by a photographer from the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]]]]\nThe first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating \"some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.\" This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a \u2018university.\u2019 This university had twin departments&nbsp;\u2013 a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\n\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for \"creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.\" The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships \"for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.\" As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].\n\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] (1990), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University|Dr. M.G.R.

In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923.

They released their first record together in 1958. Under the alias \"Little Ann,\" Tina Turner was featured alongside Ike Turner and fellow [[Kings of Rhythm]] vocalist Carlson Oliver on the single \"[[Boxtop (song)|Boxtop]].\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|title=Takin' Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turner|last=Turner, Ike.|date=1999|publisher=Virgin|others=Cawthorne, Nigel|isbn=1852278501|location=London|pages=|oclc=43321298}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, Ike formed the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. Their debut single \"[[A Fool in Love|A Fool In Love]]\" was released on [[Sue Records]] in July 1960. The success of the single was followed by a string of R&B hits within a 2-year span, including \"[[I Idolize You]],\" \"[[It's Gonna Work Out Fine]],\" and \"[[Poor Fool (Ike & Tina Turner song)|Poor Fool]].\" Between 1960 and 1975, the duo had 20 songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart which include 1 top 10 hit, and 26 songs on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|''Billboard'' Hot R&B]] chart which include 6 top 10 hits. They also had 12 albums on both the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums|Top R&B Albums]] charts. A few years after their dissolution, Ike Turner released \"Party Vibes\"/\"[[Shame, Shame, Shame (Shirley & Company song)|Shame, Shame, Shame]]\" taken from their last recording sessions. The single charted on the [[Dance Club Songs|''Billboard'' Dance]] chart in 1980.\n\nTheir best-selling single \"[[Proud Mary]]\" and their best-selling album ''[[What You Hear Is What You Get (Live at Carnegie Hall)|What You Hear Is What You Get]]'', both released in 1971 are certified [[Music recording certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=ike+and+tina+turner&col=certification_date&ord=asc#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - Ike & Tina Turner|last=|first=|date=|website=RIAA|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, their 1991 compilation album ''[[Proud Mary: The Best of Ike & Tina Turner]]'' was ranked No. 212 on ''Rolling Stone''<nowiki/>'s list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]] (No. 214 on 2012 revised list).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|publisher=Wenner Books|others=Levy, Joe.|year=2005|isbn=1932958010|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=|oclc=60596234}}</ref><ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Labels ===\nAfter four years with their first label Sue Records, Ike & Tina Turner signed to [[Kent Records]] in 1964. While releasing singles, the duo also toured extensively. To make sure he always had a record out while on tour, Ike Turner formed various labels to release singles such as [[Teena Records|Teena]], [[Prann Records|Prann]], [[Innis Records|Innis]], [[Sony Records|Sony]] and [[Sonja Records]]. Between 1964 and 1969, the duo signed with multiple labels, including [[Warner Records|Warner Bros.]], [[Loma Records|Loma]], [[Modern Records|Modern]], Cenco, [[Philles Records|Philles]], [[Tangerine Records (1963)|Tangerine]], [[Pompeii Records|Pompeii]], [[Blue Thumb Records|Blue Thumb]], [[Minit Records|Minit]] and [[A&M Records|A&M]].<ref name=\":10\" /> After the success of their single \"[[Come Together]],\" the duo were reassigned to Minit's parent label [[Liberty Records]] in 1970.

Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] provided a broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield\". Entrepreneurs create something new, something different\u2014they change or transmute values.<ref>Drucker, P. F. (1993). ''Innovation and entrepreneurship: practice and principles''. New York: HarperBusiness.</ref> Regardless of the firm size, big or small, they can partake in entrepreneurship opportunities. The opportunity to become an entrepreneur requires four criteria. First, there must be opportunities or situations to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people, such as preferential access to certain individuals or the ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, taking on risk is a necessity. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.<ref name=\"Shane\">Shane, S. A. (2003). ''A general theory of entrepreneurship: the individual-opportunity nexus''. Northampton, Massachusetts: E. Elgar.</ref>\n\nThe entrepreneur is a factor in and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of [[Richard Cantillon]] and [[Adam Smith]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, entrepreneurship was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics since the late 1970s. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful [[innovation]]. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of creative destruction\" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternative description posited by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the making of drinking straws.\n\nThe exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hisrich|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}</ref>\n* Developing a [[business plan]]\n* Hiring the [[human resources]]\n* Acquiring financial and material resources\n* Providing leadership\n* Being responsible for both the venture's success or failure\n* [[Risk aversion]]\n\nEconomist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883\u20131950) saw the role of the entrepreneur in the economy as \"[[creative destruction]]\" \u2013 launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches.

This institution was introduced in 1908 after a period of so-called freedom of trade (''Gewerbefreiheit'', introduced in 1871) in the [[German Reich]]. However, proof of competence was not required to start a business. In 1935 and in 1953, greater proof of competence was reintroduced (''Gro\u00dfer Bef\u00e4higungsnachweis Kuhlenbeck''), which required craftspeople to obtain a Meister apprentice-training certificate before being permitted to set up a new business.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00181-013-0773-7|title = Entry regulation and entrepreneurship: A natural experiment in German craftsmanship| journal=Empirical Economics| volume=47| issue=3| pages=1067\u20131101|year = 2013|last1 = Rostam-Afschar|first1 = Davud}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century, entrepreneurship was studied by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other [[Austrian school|Austrian economists]] such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. While the loan from French of the word \"entrepreneur\" dates to the 1850, the term \"entrepreneurship\" was coined around the 1920s. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is willing and able to convert a new idea or [[invention]] into a successful innovation.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1976\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter|title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6eM6YrMj46sC}}|year=1976|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10762-4}}</ref> Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of [[creative destruction]]\" to replace in whole or in part inferior offerings across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products and new [[business model]]s, thus creative destruction is largely responsible for long-term [[economic growth]].

An alternative description by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw that require no special qualities.\n\nFor Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries and in new combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation (i.e. the car) was transformational but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional [[microeconomic]] theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would find each other through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of [[x-efficiency]].\n\nFor Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did. Schumpeter believed that the equilibrium was imperfect. Schumpeter (1934) demonstrated that the changing environment continuously provides new information about the optimum allocation of resources to enhance profitability. Some individuals acquire the new information before others and recombine the resources to gain an entrepreneurial profit. Schumpeter was of the opinion that entrepreneurs shift the [[Production\u2013possibility frontier|production possibility curve]] to a higher level using innovations.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1934\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter |authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter |title=The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry Into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OZwWcOGeOwC}}|year=1934|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-698-4}}</ref>\n\nInitially, economists made the first attempt to study the entrepreneurship concept in depth.<ref name=\"Landstrom2007\">{{cite book|first=H.|last=Landstrom|title=Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=oSjccQt5zTsC}}|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23633-9}}</ref> Alfred Marshall viewed the entrepreneur as a multi-tasking capitalist and observed that in the equilibrium of a completely competitive market there was no spot for \"entrepreneurs\" as an economic activity creator.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Alfred|last1=Marshall|author1-link=Alfred Marshall|first2=C.

Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner\u2014or they have a small number of employees\u2014and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[Angel investor|angel investment]]s. In this way, the term \"entrepreneur\" may be more closely associated with the term \"[[Startup company|startup]]\".

Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected. Another type of project entrepreneurship involves entrepreneurs working with business students to get analytical work done on their ideas.\n\n=== Millennial ===\nThe term \"millennial entrepreneur\" refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media\u2014the products of [[Baby Boomers]], those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s.

The entrepreneur is willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take risks in the name of an idea, spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture. However, entrepreneurs often do not believe that they have taken an enormous amount of risks because they do not perceive the level of uncertainty to be as high as other people do. Knight classified three types of uncertainty:\n* [[Risk]], which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red color ball from a jar containing five red balls and five white balls)\n* [[Ambiguity]], which is hard to measure statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing five red balls but an unknown number of white balls)\n* [[Uncertainty|True uncertainty]] or Knightian uncertainty, which is impossible to estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar whose contents, in terms of numbers of coloured balls, are entirely unknown)\n\n[[File:Malala Yousafzai 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Malala Yousafzai]], a Pakistani activist, social entrepreneur and youngest-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner]]\nEntrepreneurship is often associated with true uncertainty, particularly when it involves the creation of a novel good or service, for a market that did not previously exist, rather than when a venture creates an incremental improvement to an existing product or service. A 2014 study at ETH Z\u00fcrich found that compared with typical managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laureiro-Mart\u00ednez|first1=Daniella|last2=Canessa|first2=Nicola|last3=Brusoni|first3=Stefano|last4=Zollo|first4=Maurizio|last5=Hare|first5=Todd|last6=Alemanno|first6=Federica|last7=Cappa|first7=Stefano F.|title=Frontopolar cortex and decision-making efficiency: comparing brain activity of experts with different professional background during an exploration-exploitation task|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=22 January 2014|volume=7|page=927|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927|pmid=24478664|pmc=3897871}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Coachability\" and advice taking ===\nThe ability of entrepreneurs to work closely with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e. their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161\u2013176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1|year=1986}}</ref> At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g. measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots and firm survival).

Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they do believe that there is a direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college knowledge does contribute to advancement in the workforce.\n\nMichelacci and Schivardi state there has been a rise in the number of self-employed people with a baccalaureate degree. However, their findings also show that those who are self-employed and possess a graduate degree has remained consistent throughout time at about 33 percent. They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs like [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the [[Opportunity cost|time that needs to be spent on it]]. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school. Their research shows that the higher the education level the greater the success. The reason is that college gives people additional skills that can be used within their business and to operate on a higher level than someone who only \"runs\" it.\n\n== Resources and financing ==\n\n=== Entrepreneurial resources ===\nAn entrepreneurial resource is any company-owned [[asset]] that has [[economic value]] creating capabilities. Economic value creating both tangible and intangible sources are considered as entrepreneurial resources. Their economic value is generating activities or services through mobilization by entrepreneurs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Organizing Entrepreneurship|author1=Anna Grandori |author2=Laura Gaillard Giordani |publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-57037-4|location=|pages=}}</ref> Entrepreneurial resources can be divided into two fundamental categories: tangible and intangible resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management Theory: An Integrated Approach|author1=Charles W.

One of the reasons that some entrepreneurs prefer to \"bootstrap\" is that obtaining [[equity financing]] requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early equity financing deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. If investors have a significant stake in the company, they may as well be able to exert influence on company strategy, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) choice and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company. An investor will generally aim for a profitable exit and therefore promotes a high-valuation sale of the company or IPO to sell their shares. Whereas the entrepreneur might have philanthropic intentions as their main driving force. Soft values like this might not go well with the short-term pressure on yearly and quarterly profits that publicly traded companies often experience from their owners.\n\nOne consensus definition of bootstrapping sees it as \"a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ebbena|first1=Jay|last2=Johnson|first2=Alec|title=Bootstrapping in small firms: An empirical analysis of change over time|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|publicationdate=November 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=851\u2013865|doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.06.007|quote=Bootstrapping has taken on many definitions in the literature, but there has been some recent consensus that it is a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors (Winborg and Landstrom, 2001 and Harrison and Mason, 1997).|year=2006}}</ref> The majority of businesses require less than $10,000 to launch,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} which means that personal savings are most often used to start.

Entrepreneurship is the process by which either an individual or a team identifies a business opportunity and acquires and deploys the necessary resources required for its exploitation. Early-19th-century French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] provided a broad definition of entrepreneurship, saying that it \"shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and into an area of higher productivity and greater yield\". Entrepreneurs create something new, something different\u2014they change or transmute values.<ref>Drucker, P. F. (1993). ''Innovation and entrepreneurship: practice and principles''. New York: HarperBusiness.</ref> Regardless of the firm size, big or small, they can partake in entrepreneurship opportunities. The opportunity to become an entrepreneur requires four criteria. First, there must be opportunities or situations to recombine resources to generate profit. Second, entrepreneurship requires differences between people, such as preferential access to certain individuals or the ability to recognize information about opportunities. Third, taking on risk is a necessity. Fourth, the entrepreneurial process requires the organization of people and resources.<ref name=\"Shane\">Shane, S. A. (2003). ''A general theory of entrepreneurship: the individual-opportunity nexus''. Northampton, Massachusetts: E. Elgar.</ref>\n\nThe entrepreneur is a factor in and the study of entrepreneurship reaches back to the work of [[Richard Cantillon]] and [[Adam Smith]] in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. However, entrepreneurship was largely ignored theoretically until the late 19th and early 20th centuries and empirically until a profound resurgence in business and economics since the late 1970s. In the 20th century, the understanding of entrepreneurship owes much to the work of economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other Austrian economists such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is a person who is willing and able to convert a new idea or invention into a successful [[innovation]]. Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of creative destruction\" to replace in whole or in part inferior innovations across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products including new business models. In this way, creative destruction is largely responsible for the dynamism of industries and long-run economic growth. The supposition that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in endogenous growth theory and as such is hotly debated in academic economics. An alternative description posited by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be much more incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the making of drinking straws.\n\nThe exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities may include:<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert D.|last=Hisrich|title=Entrepreneurship|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=s01P0agnLPUC}}|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07062-017-9}}</ref>\n* Developing a [[business plan]]\n* Hiring the [[human resources]]\n* Acquiring financial and material resources\n* Providing leadership\n* Being responsible for both the venture's success or failure\n* [[Risk aversion]]\n\nEconomist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883\u20131950) saw the role of the entrepreneur in the economy as \"[[creative destruction]]\" \u2013 launching innovations that simultaneously destroy old industries while ushering in new industries and approaches.

This institution was introduced in 1908 after a period of so-called freedom of trade (''Gewerbefreiheit'', introduced in 1871) in the [[German Reich]]. However, proof of competence was not required to start a business. In 1935 and in 1953, greater proof of competence was reintroduced (''Gro\u00dfer Bef\u00e4higungsnachweis Kuhlenbeck''), which required craftspeople to obtain a Meister apprentice-training certificate before being permitted to set up a new business.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s00181-013-0773-7|title = Entry regulation and entrepreneurship: A natural experiment in German craftsmanship| journal=Empirical Economics| volume=47| issue=3| pages=1067\u20131101|year = 2013|last1 = Rostam-Afschar|first1 = Davud}}</ref>\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn the 20th century, entrepreneurship was studied by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in the 1930s and other [[Austrian school|Austrian economists]] such as [[Carl Menger]], [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich von Hayek]]. While the loan from French of the word \"entrepreneur\" dates to the 1850, the term \"entrepreneurship\" was coined around the 1920s. According to Schumpeter, an entrepreneur is willing and able to convert a new idea or [[invention]] into a successful innovation.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1976\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter|title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6eM6YrMj46sC}}|year=1976|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-10762-4}}</ref> Entrepreneurship employs what Schumpeter called \"the gale of [[creative destruction]]\" to replace in whole or in part inferior offerings across markets and industries, simultaneously creating new products and new [[business model]]s, thus creative destruction is largely responsible for long-term [[economic growth]]. The idea that entrepreneurship leads to economic growth is an interpretation of the residual in [[endogenous growth theory]]{{clarify|date=October 2013}} and as such continues to be debated in academic economics. An alternative description by [[Israel Kirzner]] suggests that the majority of innovations may be incremental improvements such as the replacement of paper with plastic in the construction of a drinking straw that require no special qualities.\n\nFor Schumpeter, entrepreneurship resulted in new industries and in new combinations of currently existing inputs. Schumpeter's initial example of this was the combination of a steam engine and then current wagon making technologies to produce the horseless carriage. In this case, the innovation (i.e. the car) was transformational but did not require the development of dramatic new technology. It did not immediately replace the horse-drawn carriage, but in time incremental improvements reduced the cost and improved the technology, leading to the modern auto industry. Despite Schumpeter's early 20th-century contributions, the traditional [[microeconomic]] theory did not formally consider the entrepreneur in its theoretical frameworks (instead of assuming that resources would find each other through a price system). In this treatment, the entrepreneur was an implied but unspecified actor, consistent with the concept of the entrepreneur being the agent of [[x-efficiency]].\n\nFor Schumpeter, the entrepreneur did not bear risk: the capitalist did. Schumpeter believed that the equilibrium was imperfect. Schumpeter (1934) demonstrated that the changing environment continuously provides new information about the optimum allocation of resources to enhance profitability. Some individuals acquire the new information before others and recombine the resources to gain an entrepreneurial profit. Schumpeter was of the opinion that entrepreneurs shift the [[Production\u2013possibility frontier|production possibility curve]] to a higher level using innovations.<ref name=\"Schumpeter1934\">{{cite book|first=Joseph Alois |last=Schumpeter |authorlink=Joseph Schumpeter |title=The Theory of Economic Development: An Inquiry Into Profits, Capital, Credit, Interest, and the Business Cycle|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OZwWcOGeOwC}}|year=1934|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-87855-698-4}}</ref>\n\nInitially, economists made the first attempt to study the entrepreneurship concept in depth.<ref name=\"Landstrom2007\">{{cite book|first=H.|last=Landstrom|title=Pioneers in Entrepreneurship and Small Business Research|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=oSjccQt5zTsC}}|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-23633-9}}</ref> Alfred Marshall viewed the entrepreneur as a multi-tasking capitalist and observed that in the equilibrium of a completely competitive market there was no spot for \"entrepreneurs\" as an economic activity creator.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Alfred|last1=Marshall|author1-link=Alfred Marshall|first2=C.

While most entrepreneurial ventures start out as a small business, not all small businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense of the term. Many small businesses are sole proprietor operations consisting solely of the owner\u2014or they have a small number of employees\u2014and many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and they do not aim at growth. In contrast, entrepreneurial ventures offer an innovative product, process or service and the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking international sales and so on, a process which is financed by [[venture capital]] and [[Angel investor|angel investment]]s. In this way, the term \"entrepreneur\" may be more closely associated with the term \"[[Startup company|startup]]\".

Resolving the first challenge requires project-entrepreneurs to access an extensive range of information needed to seize new investment opportunities. Resolving the second challenge requires assembling a collaborative team that has to fit well with the particular challenges of the project and has to function almost immediately to reduce the risk that performance might be adversely affected. Another type of project entrepreneurship involves entrepreneurs working with business students to get analytical work done on their ideas.\n\n=== Millennial ===\nThe term \"millennial entrepreneur\" refers to a business owner who is affiliated with the generation that was brought up using digital technology and mass media\u2014the products of [[Baby Boomers]], those people born during the 1980s and early 1990s. Also known as [[Generation Y]], these business owners are well equipped with knowledge of new technology and new business models and have a strong grasp of its business applications.

The entrepreneur is willing to put his or her career and financial security on the line and take risks in the name of an idea, spending time as well as capital on an uncertain venture. However, entrepreneurs often do not believe that they have taken an enormous amount of risks because they do not perceive the level of uncertainty to be as high as other people do. Knight classified three types of uncertainty:\n* [[Risk]], which is measurable statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red color ball from a jar containing five red balls and five white balls)\n* [[Ambiguity]], which is hard to measure statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar containing five red balls but an unknown number of white balls)\n* [[Uncertainty|True uncertainty]] or Knightian uncertainty, which is impossible to estimate or predict statistically (such as the probability of drawing a red ball from a jar whose contents, in terms of numbers of coloured balls, are entirely unknown)\n\n[[File:Malala Yousafzai 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Malala Yousafzai]], a Pakistani activist, social entrepreneur and youngest-ever [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner]]\nEntrepreneurship is often associated with true uncertainty, particularly when it involves the creation of a novel good or service, for a market that did not previously exist, rather than when a venture creates an incremental improvement to an existing product or service. A 2014 study at ETH Z\u00fcrich found that compared with typical managers, entrepreneurs showed higher decision-making efficiency and a stronger activation in regions of frontopolar cortex (FPC) previously associated with explorative choice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Laureiro-Mart\u00ednez|first1=Daniella|last2=Canessa|first2=Nicola|last3=Brusoni|first3=Stefano|last4=Zollo|first4=Maurizio|last5=Hare|first5=Todd|last6=Alemanno|first6=Federica|last7=Cappa|first7=Stefano F.|title=Frontopolar cortex and decision-making efficiency: comparing brain activity of experts with different professional background during an exploration-exploitation task|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=22 January 2014|volume=7|page=927|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2013.00927|pmid=24478664|pmc=3897871}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Coachability\" and advice taking ===\nThe ability of entrepreneurs to work closely with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e. their coachability) has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161\u2013176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1|year=1986}}</ref> At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g. measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots and firm survival). This research also shows that older and larger founding teams, presumably those with more subject expertise, are less coachable than younger and smaller founding teams.\n\n===Strategies===\nStrategies that entrepreneurs may use include:\n* [[Innovation]] of new products, services or processes<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news|last1=Qureshi|first1=Hamid|title=Decoding Right Strategies for Entrepreneurship|url=http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/decoding-right-strategies-for-entrepreneurship/195820.html|accessdate=30 March 2016|work=Greater Kashmir|date=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n* Continuous process improvement (CPI)<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Exploration of new business models\n* Use of technology<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Use of [[business intelligence]]\n* Use of economical strategics\n* Development of future products and services<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Optimized talent management<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Designing individual/opportunity nexus ===\nAccording to Shane and Venkataraman, entrepreneurship comprises both \"enterprising individuals\" and \"entrepreneurial opportunities\", so researchers should study the nature of the individuals who identify opportunities when others do not, the opportunities themselves and the nexus between individuals and opportunities.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2000.2791611 | journal=Academy of Management Review | date=2000 | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=217\u2013226 | first=S. | last=Shane| title=The Promise of Entrepreneurship as a Field of Research }}</ref> On the other hand, Reynolds et al.<ref>Reynolds PD, Hay M, Bygrave WD et al.

However, in case of entrepreneurship research these notions are employed by academics{{which?|date=March 2020}} too, but vaguely. Cattell states that personality is a system that is related to the environment and further adds that the system seeks explanation to the complex transactions conducted by both\u2014traits and attitudes. This is because both of them bring about change and growth in a person. Personality is that which informs what an individual will do when faced with a given situation.

Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they do believe that there is a direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college knowledge does contribute to advancement in the workforce.\n\nMichelacci and Schivardi state there has been a rise in the number of self-employed people with a baccalaureate degree. However, their findings also show that those who are self-employed and possess a graduate degree has remained consistent throughout time at about 33 percent. They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs like [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]] who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the [[Opportunity cost|time that needs to be spent on it]]. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school. Their research shows that the higher the education level the greater the success. The reason is that college gives people additional skills that can be used within their business and to operate on a higher level than someone who only \"runs\" it.\n\n== Resources and financing ==\n\n=== Entrepreneurial resources ===\nAn entrepreneurial resource is any company-owned [[asset]] that has [[economic value]] creating capabilities. Economic value creating both tangible and intangible sources are considered as entrepreneurial resources. Their economic value is generating activities or services through mobilization by entrepreneurs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Organizing Entrepreneurship|author1=Anna Grandori |author2=Laura Gaillard Giordani |publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=978-0-415-57037-4|location=|pages=}}</ref> Entrepreneurial resources can be divided into two fundamental categories: tangible and intangible resources.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management Theory: An Integrated Approach|author1=Charles W.

One of the reasons that some entrepreneurs prefer to \"bootstrap\" is that obtaining [[equity financing]] requires the entrepreneur to provide ownership shares to the investors. If the start-up becomes successful later on, these early equity financing deals could provide a windfall for the investors and a huge loss for the entrepreneur. If investors have a significant stake in the company, they may as well be able to exert influence on company strategy, [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) choice and other important decisions. This is often problematic since the investor and the founder might have different incentives regarding the long-term goal of the company. An investor will generally aim for a profitable exit and therefore promotes a high-valuation sale of the company or IPO to sell their shares. Whereas the entrepreneur might have philanthropic intentions as their main driving force. Soft values like this might not go well with the short-term pressure on yearly and quarterly profits that publicly traded companies often experience from their owners.\n\nOne consensus definition of bootstrapping sees it as \"a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ebbena|first1=Jay|last2=Johnson|first2=Alec|title=Bootstrapping in small firms: An empirical analysis of change over time|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|publicationdate=November 2006|volume=21|issue=6|pages=851\u2013865|doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2005.06.007|quote=Bootstrapping has taken on many definitions in the literature, but there has been some recent consensus that it is a collection of methods used to minimize the amount of outside debt and equity financing needed from banks and investors (Winborg and Landstrom, 2001 and Harrison and Mason, 1997).|year=2006}}</ref> The majority of businesses require less than $10,000 to launch,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} which means that personal savings are most often used to start.

When the song was performed live in concert or played at a club or dance, people would shout a certain formulaic (and usually [[Obscenity|obscene]]) variation of a particular phrase in the two measures following each line, for example, \u201cHey, say what\u2026 get laid get fucked!\u201d Or \u201cHey, motherfucker\u2026 get laid get fucked!\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cross |first1=Alan |title=MAJOR UPDATE!

The live version was released as a single and went to No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], coincidentally displacing [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]]'s cover of another Tommy James song, \"[[I Think We're Alone Now]]\", from the top spot. It also finished directly behind the Tiffany song at #19 in the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1987|1987 year-end ''Billboard'' chart]].\n\nIdol's version gave rise to an interesting custom. When the song was performed live in concert or played at a club or dance, people would shout a certain formulaic (and usually [[Obscenity|obscene]]) variation of a particular phrase in the two measures following each line, for example, \u201cHey, say what\u2026 get laid get fucked!\u201d Or \u201cHey, motherfucker\u2026 get laid get fucked!\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cross |first1=Alan |title=MAJOR UPDATE!

His original studio version can be found on Idol's ''[[Greatest Hits (Billy Idol album)|Greatest Hits]]'' [[compilation album]], a 2001 [[Capitol Records]] release. That album has received positive critical reviews, with Idol's cover of the James tune specifically praised.\n\n===Uses in popular culture===\nThe song was sampled by Australian [[Seven Network]] to promote its 1992 (jobs) \"Yeah!\" campaign.<ref>{{Cite web| title=7 Network 1992 line up promo| website=YouTube| date=19 September 2012| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p45WadaSVLM| accessdate=7 September 2017}}</ref> This sample was also used by the Seven-affiliated regional TV network [[Prime Television]] (now Prime7).<ref>{{Cite web| title=Prime Television 1991 \"Yeah\" promo & Olympic Games ident| website=YouTube| date=29 December 2013| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCxT0rOy-Y| accessdate=7 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] wrote a parody of this song from his album ''[[Even Worse]]'', entitled \"Alimony\" (based on the live Idol version, complete with a live audience).

The women working in these munitions factories were called \"[[Munitionette]]s\"; another nickname for these women was the \"Canaries\" because of the yellow skin which came from working with toxic chemicals.

University of Alberta. Advances in Consumer Research. (1997): 322\u201326.</ref> The posters failed to represent an accurate account of reality by creating a satisfactory appeal for women who joined the workforce and did their part in the war. Designed for women to persuade their men to join the armed forces, one propaganda poster is a romantic setting as the women look out an open window into nature as the soldiers march off to war. The poster possesses a sentimental and romantic appeal when the reality of the situation was that many women endured extreme hardships when their husbands enlisted.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/>  It was this narrative of a false reality conveyed in the visual propaganda that aimed to motivate war effort.\nThe Edwardian social construction of gender was that women should be passive and emotional, and have moral virtue and domestic responsibility. Men on the other hand were expected to be active and intelligent, and to provide for their families. It was this idea of gender roles that poster propaganda aimed to reverse. In one war propaganda poster, titled \u201cThese Women Are Doing Their Bit\u201d, a woman is represented as making a sacrifice by joining the munitions industry while the men are at the front. The woman in this particular persuasive poster is depicted as cheerful and beautiful, ensuring that her patriotic duty will not reduce her femininity.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/> These posters do not communicate the reality that munitions labour entails. There is no reference to highly explosive chemicals or illnesses due to harsh work environments. The persuasive images of idealized female figures and idyllic settings were designed to solicit female involvement in the war and greatly influenced the idea of appropriate feminine behavior in the wartime Britain.

Through the discrimination of non-Muslim populations with policies such as the deportation of non-Muslims in 1915 this opened up a lot more jobs for Ottoman women for entrepreneurial roles within the country's economy. When the Ottoman Empire outlawed the use of any language except for Turkish in March 1916 also granted new opportunities for Ottoman women that knew Turkish and other foreign languages with a specific focus given to women through organizations such as the Ottoman School of Commerce which specifically opened a branch for women.

Raising prices of both staple items and consumer goods also rendered many women unable to subsist during these harsh conditions. Many homes were also commandeered by the military for various purposing forcing people, mostly women, because the vast majority of men were off fighting the war to sleep under trees and generally outside. To make this all worst there were deserters and refugees roaming vast areas in the Ottoman Empire plundering and stealing large stocks of goods such as maize and hazelnuts that were stockpiled to last the war. Worst of all perhaps was that state officials through the military were pressuring many village women to provide grain for the army at little to no compensation, grain that was once meant for their own subsistence would instead be taken away to feed the army. These war time conditions did not affect just women but did affect women most of all over men due to the forced conscription nature of the Ottoman Empire and the fact that women were the ones left to take care of villages and homes dotted throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ak\u0131n|first=Yi\u011fit|title=War, Women, and the State: The Politics of Sacrifice in the Ottoman Empire During the First World War|url=https://www.academia.edu/8349770|journal=Journal of Women's History|volume=26|issue=3|pages=12\u201335|issn=1527-2036|doi=10.1353/jowh.2014.0040|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother shocking look at the lives of Ottoman women during the war was the frequency of petitioners to underline the martyrdom (sehitlik) of their sons and husbands to show the contribution of their men to the war effort.

Concerned that if she needed medical attention her true gender would be discovered and the men who had befriended her would be in danger, after 10 days of service she presented herself to the commanding sergeant, who promptly placed her under military arrest.

University of Alberta. Advances in Consumer Research. (1997): 322\u201326.</ref> The posters failed to represent an accurate account of reality by creating a satisfactory appeal for women who joined the workforce and did their part in the war. Designed for women to persuade their men to join the armed forces, one propaganda poster is a romantic setting as the women look out an open window into nature as the soldiers march off to war. The poster possesses a sentimental and romantic appeal when the reality of the situation was that many women endured extreme hardships when their husbands enlisted.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/>  It was this narrative of a false reality conveyed in the visual propaganda that aimed to motivate war effort.\nThe Edwardian social construction of gender was that women should be passive and emotional, and have moral virtue and domestic responsibility. Men on the other hand were expected to be active and intelligent, and to provide for their families. It was this idea of gender roles that poster propaganda aimed to reverse. In one war propaganda poster, titled \u201cThese Women Are Doing Their Bit\u201d, a woman is represented as making a sacrifice by joining the munitions industry while the men are at the front. The woman in this particular persuasive poster is depicted as cheerful and beautiful, ensuring that her patriotic duty will not reduce her femininity.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/> These posters do not communicate the reality that munitions labour entails. There is no reference to highly explosive chemicals or illnesses due to harsh work environments. The persuasive images of idealized female figures and idyllic settings were designed to solicit female involvement in the war and greatly influenced the idea of appropriate feminine behavior in the wartime Britain. As a result, many women left their domestic lives to join munitions work as they were enticed by what they thought were better living conditions, patriotic duty and high pay.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/> According to Hupfer, the female role in the social sphere was expanded as they joined previously male-dominated and hazardous occupations (325).<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/> Hupfer remarks that attitudes regarding the capabilities of women through the war effort sank back into the previously idealized roles of women and men once the war was over. Women went back to their duty in the home as they lost their jobs to returning soldiers and female labour statistics decreased to pre-war levels. Not until 1939 would the expansion of the role of women once again occur.<ref name=\"Hupfer, Maureen 1997\"/>\n\n===Jobs on the home front other than in munitions factories===\n{{main|Home front during World War I#Britain}}\nMany women volunteered on the home front as nurses, teachers, and workers in traditionally male jobs.<ref>Gail Braybon, ''Women Workers in the First World War'' (Routledge, 2012)</ref> Wealthy women set up an organization called the [[American Women\u2019s War Relief Fund|American Women's War Relief Fund]] in England in 1914 order to buy ambulances, support hospitals and provide economic opportunities to women during the war.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19595784/|title=Every American Woman in England Working to Help Victims of War|last=Church|first=Hayden|date=6 October 1914|work=The Atlanta Constitution|access-date=2018-04-27|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19614489/|title=Women Found War Hospitals|last=|first=|date=21 June 1917|work=Harrisburg Telegraph|access-date=2018-04-27|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|title=Helping in Britain: The American Women's War Relief Fund.|last=|first=|date=2017-01-09|work=American Women in World War I|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170927022703/https://americanwomeninwwi.wordpress.com/2017/01/09/helping-in-britain-the-american-womens-war-relief-fund/|archive-date=27 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Australian women in World War I|Home front during World War I#Australia}}\nThe role of Australian women in World War I was focused mainly upon their involvement in the provision of [[Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps|nursing services]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/exhibitions/1918/medical/nurses.asp|title=1918: Australians in France&nbsp;\u2013 Nurses&nbsp;\u2013 \"The roses of No Man's Land\"|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref> 2,139 Australian nurses served during World War I.

These were:\n# On fruit or vegetable farms.\n# In the camps to cook for workers.\n# On mixed and dairy farms.\n# In the farmhouse to help feed those who are raising the crops.\n# In canneries, to preserve the fruit and vegetables.\n# To take charge of milk routes.<ref name=\"public\">Canada, Department of Public Works, Women\u2019s Work on the Land, (Ontario, Tracks and Labour Branch) www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/firstworldwar/025005-2100.005.07-e.html</ref>\n\nIn addition, many women were involved in charitable organization such as the [[Ottawa Women\u2019s Canadian Club]], which helped provide the needs of soldiers, families of soldiers and the victims of war.<ref name=\"Allan\" /> Women were deemed \u2018soldiers on the home front\u2019, encouraged to use less of nearly everything, and to be frugal in order to save supplies for the war efforts.<ref name=\"Allan\" />\n\n==Finland==\nIn the 1918 [[Finnish Civil War]], more than 2,000 women fought in the [[Women's Red Guards of the Finnish Civil War|Women's Red Guards]] formed in early February with more than 15 female guard units. As the commanders of the Red Guard were reluctant to commit female guards to combat most of the female guards were held in reserve for much of the civil war, only seeing combat towards the end of the war, in battles such as the Battle of Tampere where the city hall was held by the last pockets of Red Guard resistance, legends tell of how the male defenders wanted to surrender while the Tampere Women's Red Guard insisted on fighting to the bitter end. At the end of the civil war over 755 Red Guard women had died, with only 70 to 130 of them killed on the battlefield, over 20% or 400 to 500 members would be executed by the anti-communist White Guard victors and 80 to 110 died in prison camps with 150 to 200 members AWOL.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lintunen|first=Tiina|date=2014|title=The Finnish Civil War 1918: History, Memory, Legacy|chapter=Women at War|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2xCJBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=fi&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill Publishers|pages=201\u2013229|isbn=978-900-42436-6-8}}</ref>\n\nAs such it is clear that women played a role in the Finnish war both during the first world war when the women's military divisions would be conceptualized with some women already serving in the military and towards the end during the civil war when it would be formed by the Red Guard in reality.\n\n==Ottoman Empire==\n[[File:Red Crescent staff at Hafir el Aujah.jpg|thumb|Ottoman Red Crescent and Red Cross staff at [[Hafir el Aujah]].]]\nWomen had limited front line roles being nurses and provided a subsidiary work force of emergency medical personnel in substitution for the lack of manpower available as the empire was battling multiple fronts of enemies forcing the conscription of most of its male population, this medical workforce of women was all possible through organizations created by the government and international organizations such as the Red Cross.<ref>Elif Mahir Metinsoy, ''Ottoman Women during World War I: Everyday Experiences, Politics, and Conflict'' (Cambridge UP, 2017).

Through the discrimination of non-Muslim populations with policies such as the deportation of non-Muslims in 1915 this opened up a lot more jobs for Ottoman women for entrepreneurial roles within the country's economy. When the Ottoman Empire outlawed the use of any language except for Turkish in March 1916 also granted new opportunities for Ottoman women that knew Turkish and other foreign languages with a specific focus given to women through organizations such as the Ottoman School of Commerce which specifically opened a branch for women. The IOEW also provided women with administrative jobs and served as an intermediary for the school to allocate women students as interns in commercial and financial institutions throughout the country.<ref>{{Citation|chapter=CONCLUSION|pages=249\u2013254|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300241495|doi=10.2307/j.ctt2250vxg.22|title=Utopian Feminism|year=1992}}</ref>\n\nDuring the war the British press circulated false stories that Ottoman women took sniper roles in combat.

Raising prices of both staple items and consumer goods also rendered many women unable to subsist during these harsh conditions. Many homes were also commandeered by the military for various purposing forcing people, mostly women, because the vast majority of men were off fighting the war to sleep under trees and generally outside. To make this all worst there were deserters and refugees roaming vast areas in the Ottoman Empire plundering and stealing large stocks of goods such as maize and hazelnuts that were stockpiled to last the war. Worst of all perhaps was that state officials through the military were pressuring many village women to provide grain for the army at little to no compensation, grain that was once meant for their own subsistence would instead be taken away to feed the army. These war time conditions did not affect just women but did affect women most of all over men due to the forced conscription nature of the Ottoman Empire and the fact that women were the ones left to take care of villages and homes dotted throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ak\u0131n|first=Yi\u011fit|title=War, Women, and the State: The Politics of Sacrifice in the Ottoman Empire During the First World War|url=https://www.academia.edu/8349770|journal=Journal of Women's History|volume=26|issue=3|pages=12\u201335|issn=1527-2036|doi=10.1353/jowh.2014.0040|year=2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother shocking look at the lives of Ottoman women during the war was the frequency of petitioners to underline the martyrdom (sehitlik) of their sons and husbands to show the contribution of their men to the war effort.
