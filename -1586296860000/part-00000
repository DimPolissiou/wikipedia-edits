The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four.The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs.

Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant]]\n\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four.The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nOn 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

The flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to [[Munich-Riem Airport]]. To observers on the ground, WV-2Q seemed explode with the tail separating from the main fuselage over [[Markt Schwaben]], 17 km south of Munich Airport. The main fuselage and tail section crashed several hundred yards apart in fields southwest of the town. The aircraft was totally destroyed killing all twenty-two Navy and four Army aircrew.

Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived.

This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach.

Haviland and Bertha M. Esten. She grew up mainly in Massachusetts. During her childhood, she traveled abroad and spent time with two aunts who entertained international visitors in their home.

She was a branch librarian and children's librarian at Boston from 1948 to 1952, and a reader's adviser for children from 1952 to 1963. Haviland studied folklore under [[Albert Lord|Albert B.

While still a Boston librarian, Haviland submitted a proposal for her Favorite Fairy Tales series to Little, Brown and Company, who accepted and published her books in hard cover ca 1959\u201371. The books were republished in trade paperback by Beech Tree in the mid-1990s. To compile her series, Virginia Haviland traveled around the world meeting with librarians, authors, and authorities in fairy tales.

But in the 1950s, such a rich selection was not yet available. The classic fairy and folk tales were most often found in cumbersome books with small print and few illustrations. [[Helen Jones]], then children's book editor at [[Little, Brown and Company]], accepted a proposal from a [[Boston]] librarian for an ambitious series with a simple goal\u2014to put an international selection of stories into the hands of children. The tales would be published in slim volumes, with wide margins and ample leading, and illustrated by a cast of contemporary artists. The result was a unique series of books intended for children to read by themselves\u2014the [[Favorite Fairy Tales]] series. Available only in hardcover for many years, the books have now been reissued in paperbacks that feature new illustrations and covers. | The series embraces the stories of sixteen different countries: [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[India]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Scotland]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[Spain]] and [[Russia]]. Some of these stories may seem violent or fantastical to our modern sensibilities, yet they often reflect the deepest yearnings and imaginings of the human mind and heart. Virginia Haviland traveled abroad frequently and was able to draw upon librarians, storytellers, and writers in countries as far away as Japan to help her make her selections. But she was also an avid researcher with a keen interest in rare books, and most of the stories she included in the series were found through a diligent search of old collections. Ms. Haviland was associated with the [[Boston Public Library]] for nearly thirty years\u2014as a children's and branch librarian, and eventually as [[Readers Advisor to Children]]. She reviewed for ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' for almost thirty years and in 1963 was named [[Head of the Children's Book Section]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. Ms. Haviland remained with the [[Library of Congress]] for nearly twenty years, and wrote and lectured about children's literature throughout her career. She died in 1988.\"\n\nHaviland also organized ''[[The Fairy Tale Treasury]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Mother Goose Treasury]]'' (1966), both illustrated by [[Raymond Briggs]] and published by [[Hamish Hamilton]].

Haviland is also well known for her ''Favorite Fairy Tales'' series, featuring stories from sixteen countries.\n\n==Life and career==\nVirginia Haviland was born in [[Rochester, New York]], to William J. Haviland and Bertha M. Esten. She grew up mainly in Massachusetts. During her childhood, she traveled abroad and spent time with two aunts who entertained international visitors in their home. The early influence of contact with international visitors may have influenced her adult interest in traveling and working with international colleagues.<ref name=\"DALB\">Davis, Donald G., Jr (ed).

She became a children's librarian in 1934 for the Boston Public Library, under the tutelage of Alice Jordan, founder of children's services there. She was a branch librarian and children's librarian at Boston from 1948 to 1952, and a reader's adviser for children from 1952 to 1963. Haviland studied folklore under [[Albert Lord|Albert B. Lord]] at Harvard.\n\nIn 1949 Haviland gave the New England Library Association's [[Caroline Hewins#Legacy|Hewins Lecture]] for research in the history of children's literature about nineteenth-century travel books for children, and taught Library Service to Children and Reading Guidance for Children at [[Simmons College]] School of Library Science from 1957 to 1962 where there is now a Virginia Haviland Scholarship. She also reviewed for [[The Horn Book Magazine]] for about thirty years.<ref name=\"LOC\">[[Library of Congress]]</ref>\n\nHaviland chaired the Children's Services Division of the [[American Library Association]] (ALA) from 1954 to 1955, and as such attended conferences of the International Board on Books for Children (now called the International Board on Books for Young People), the International Federation of Library Associations, and the Institutions Roundtable for Children's Literature Documentation Centers.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nShe was also chair of the [[Newbery Medal|Newbery]]-[[Caldecott Medal|Caldecott Award]] Committee of the ALA from 1953\u20131954, and held positions of authority in other national and international professional organizations, including positions on many committees and juries that selected outstanding children's books. Her \"credo was 'The right book for the right child at the right time.' She had high standards by which to judge children's literature and also accepted newer forms.\"<ref name=\"DALB\" />\n\nHaviland judged the [[New York Herald Tribune#Awards|New York Herald Tribune Children's Spring Book Festival Awards]] from 1955 to 1957, as well as the International [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], the Book World Children's Spring Book Festival Awards, and the [[National Book Award]]s (1969).

Haviland]], fellow Regina Medal-winning author [[Jane Yolen]] wrote: \"''She was funny, acerbic, brilliant, and did not suffer fools at all. She was also gracious, never condescending, and saw her calling (as a librarian) as one of the highest callings of all. Her knowledge of American and British children's literature\u2014and folklore in particular\u2014was encyclopedic.

While still a Boston librarian, Haviland submitted a proposal for her Favorite Fairy Tales series to Little, Brown and Company, who accepted and published her books in hard cover ca 1959\u201371. The books were republished in trade paperback by Beech Tree in the mid-90's. To compile her series, Virginia Haviland traveled around the world meeting with librarians, authors, and authorities in fairy tales.

But in the 1950s, such a rich selection was not yet available. The classic fairy and folk tales were most often found in cumbersome books with small print and few illustrations. [[Helen Jones]], then children's book editor at [[Little, Brown and Company]], accepted a proposal from a [[Boston]] librarian for an ambitious series with a simple goal\u2014to put an international selection of stories into the hands of children. The tales would be published in slim volumes, with wide margins and ample leading, and illustrated by a cast of contemporary artists. The result was a unique series of books intended for children to read by themselves\u2014the [[Favorite Fairy Tales]] series. Available only in hardcover for many years, the books have now been reissued in paperbacks that feature new illustrations and covers. | The series embraces the stories of sixteen different countries: [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[India]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Ireland]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Japan]], [[Scotland]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Sweden]], [[Spain]] and [[Russia]]. Some of these stories may seem violent or fantastical to our modern sensibilities, yet they often reflect the deepest yearnings and imaginings of the human mind and heart. Virginia Haviland traveled abroad frequently and was able to draw upon librarians, storytellers, and writers in countries as far away as Japan to help her make her selections. But she was also an avid researcher with a keen interest in rare books, and most of the stories she included in the series were found through a diligent search of old collections. Ms. Haviland was associated with the [[Boston Public Library]] for nearly thirty years\u2014as a children's and branch librarian, and eventually as [[Readers Advisor to Children]]. She reviewed for ''[[The Horn Book Magazine]]'' for almost thirty years and in 1963 was named [[Head of the Children's Book Section]] of the [[Library of Congress]]. Ms. Haviland remained with the [[Library of Congress]] for nearly twenty years, and wrote and lectured about children's literature throughout her career. She died in 1988.\"\n\nHaviland also organized ''[[The Fairy Tale Treasury]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Mother Goose Treasury]]'' (1966), both illustrated by [[Raymond Briggs]] and published by [[Hamish Hamilton]]. ''[[The Mother Goose Treasury]]'' won the [[Kate Greenaway Medal]] in 1966.\n\n==Other works==\n\n* Haviland, Virginia (ed). ''The Fairy Tale Treasury.'' Illustrated by [[Raymond Briggs]].

Rake's brutal training methods are called into question and the superintendent of education, who also is Reardon's uncle, fires Rake.\n\nIn a letter revealed at Rake's funeral, the coach states the two regrets of his life were losing Scotty Reardon and for striking All-American quarterback Neely Crenshaw at halftime of the 1987 championship game against East Pike.\n\nAt the funeral, Neely ends up forgiving coach after all those years of debating whether he likes or dislikes Eddie Rake.\n\n{{Grisham}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bleachers (Novel)}}\n[[Category:2003 American novels]]\n[[Category: Novels by John Grisham]]\n\n[[Category:American football books]]\n[[Category:American sports novels]]\n[[Category:Doubleday (publisher) books]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Bleachers (disambiguation)}}\n{{unreferenced|date=October 2008}}\n\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name          = Bleachers\n| title_orig    = \n| translator    = \n| image         = Bleachers (novel).jpg\n| caption = First edition cover\n| author        = [[John Grisham]]\n| cover_artist  = \n| country       = United States\n| language      = English\n| series        = \n| genre         = Novel\n| publisher     = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date  = September 9, 2003\n| media_type    = Print (Hardcover, Paperback)\n| pages         = \n| isbn          = 0-385-51161-2\n| dewey= 813/.54 22\n| congress= PS3557.R5355 B58 2003\n| oclc= 52644759\n}}\n\n'''''Bleachers''''' was published on September 9, 2003.

North Sea Boats was founded in 2003 by John and Lizza Lundin as a trading name for '''PT. Lundin Industry Invest'''.<ref name=\"M\u00f6jligheter-2012\" />\n\n==History==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:North Sea Boats Shipyard.jpg|thumb|left|Shipyard {{Pufc|1=North Sea Boats Shipyard.jpg|date=2 December 2012}}]] -->\nJohn Lundin grew up with boats, as his father Allan Lundin founded the Swedeship company which operated shipyards including Gotland shipyard and [[:sv:Djupviks varv|Djupvik Shipyard]] in Sweden. After the [[:sv:Varvskrisen|Swedish shipyard crisis]] the Swedeship company was the largest privately owned boat building company in Sweden.  It was through Swedeship that John first came to Indonesia in the mid 1990s to investigate the company's expansion opportunities. Allan Lundin died from cancer in 1996, and Swedeship was sold.  However the family dream of a shipyard in Indonesia still remained, so John and his Indonesian wife Lizza moved there permanently. After some years of small-scale furniture manufacturing to gain experience of the business culture there, they founding the boat building company North Sea Boats in 2003.\n\n==Products==\nThe boats are constructed using modern composite production techniques such as dual surface vacuum core resin infusion. All materials used are LLoyds / DNV Class Approved, and include carbon [[Composite material|composite]] fibre and E Glass multi-axial non-woven stitched re-inforcings and Vinyl Ester resins.\n\nThe various models incorporate \"open architecture\" deck plans that can be configured to perform multi-role tasks in a broad range of operational environments. They can be powered by [[Inboard motor|inboard]] [[diesel engine]]s, [[outboard motor]]s or by transom drives and [[Pump-jet|waterjets]].\n\n=== X3K ===\nA 63 meter long carbon composite<ref>[http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=766 63m FMPV Trimaran - Stealth Fast Missile Patrol Vessel]</ref> [[Stealth ship|stealth]] [[trimaran]] missile ship.

In the interim period, advances in infusable vinylester resin chemistry have seen the incorporation of nano particles into the resin. These particles aid the transfer of the resin through the carbon/glass fibre matrix and allow the use of fire retardant grade vinylester for infusion. This makes the carbon fibre composite structure of the new vessel self-extinguishing.<ref>[[Jakarta Post]]: [http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/09/28/navy-vessel-catches-fire-banyuwangi.html Navy vessel catches fire in Banyuwangi] (28 September 2012).</ref>\n[[File:X3K Trimaran.jpg|thumb|X3K trimaran]]\n\n=== Bonefish USV ===\nSaab and PT Lundin (North Sea Boats) revealed a mockup of a trimaran Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) at Indo Defence 2014.\n\nIt was formally unveiled by Indonesia's defence minister General (ret.) Ryamizard Ryacudu and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Marsetio in a joint ribbon-cutting ceremony on the first day of the show.\n\nDevelopment of the Bonefish demonstrator began at the start of 2014, the concept marrying Saab Australia's mission systems integration expertise with a LOMOcean's trimaran hullform. The mockup was built in approximately six months at PT Lundin's composite boat production facility in Banyuwangi, East Java.\n\nCapable of speeds of up to 40kts, Bonefish is designed to incorporate a wide range of sensors, satellite-based control and a modular payload bay to enable role flexibility. Potential missions could include anti-piracy, maritime surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, mine countermeasures, search and rescue, and hydrography.\n\n=== X2K ===\nThe 10.3 X2K Range and the 11.3 m X2K RHIB ( Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat ) Range of models incorporate a double stepped hull design that is based on an offshore race boat design from Sweden. It is a high performance model capable of speeds in excess of 50 knots.\n\nThere are several X2K variants in production, which include:<ref name=\"scandasia-2010\" /><ref name=\"David-2011\" />\n*Sports / Fishing -  centre console recreational model\n*VIP Transfer - with an enclosed cabin for passenger transfers\n*Dive - configured for diving, or as a work boat.\n*Interceptor - designed for patrol and fast interception. \n*Sports RHIB -  centre console recreational model\n*Special Forces / Operations RHIB -  serving military and law enforcement roles.\n*Interceptor RHIB - designed for patrol and fast interception.\n*SAR / Pilot / Work RHIB - configured for Search & Rescue, Pilot and work boat roles.\n\n=== X10 RHIB ===\nThe X10 is a 10.5 m RHIB model with a Deep \"Vee\" hull design. It is designed for patrol or commercial duty and can be fitted with either inboard diesel engines and waterjets, conventional stern drives, or outboard motors.\n\n=== X38 Catamaran ===\nThe X38 is a 12.3 m, stepped-hull, power catamaran design that offers excellent sea-keeping, efficiency, speed, and safety. It is ideally suited for passenger transfers, diving, conservation, patrol, and combat operations. It can also be used for law enforcement, medical evacuations and rescue operations.\n\n=== Tankboat ===\nThe X18 Tank Boat is an innovative, fast, stealthy, and highly maneuverable catamaran design that provides a stable weapons platform for close-in and long range direct fire support in normally inaccessible coastal and riverine Environments.\n\nFitted with high performance diesel engines and water jet propulsion, the twin hull configuration has excellent sea keeping properties and the added advantage of shallow draft. Giving it the ability to execute beach and river landings and insert or extract squads of up to 20 Special Forces or Marines. The X18 Tank Boat has a crew of 6, and will also carry a High-speed Interdiction RIB for boarding and SEAL insertion.\n\nThe main weapon system of the X18 Tank Boat is the CMI Defence Cockerill 3105.  This system is based on a versatile and powerful high-pressure low recoil-force 105mm gun.  Fully stabilised, accurate by day or night, and able to use a wide range of NATO standard 105mm ammunition, this weapon system directly engages a broad spectrum of targets at up to 5,000m range, and indirectly engages targets to 10,000m range. The powerful, accurate and flexible Cockerill C3105 weapon system gives the X18 Tank Boat Commander a wide range of tactical options at all stages of his mission.\n\nThe 105mm is also capable of firing the Cockerill Falarick 105 Gun Launched Anti-Tank Guided Missile (GLATGM).  Elevating to +42\u00b0 the weapon delivers exceptional engagement capability in complex situations, and the GLATGM permits hard and Point target to be engaged at extended ranges (up to 5&nbsp;km). The mounting of this type of system allows for flexibility in logistics with the various calibres already in common use with NATO and other major military powers.\nThis is the first time that any company has conceived of mounting this type of system aboard a small, fast and stealthy catamaran that with only a 1-meter draught makes it ideally suited for the confines of coastal waterway operations.\n\nThe X18 can be augmented with a Bofors LEMUR Remote Weapons Systems incorporating 7.62 \u2013 30&nbsp;mm GPMG/ Cannon.\n\n=== Carbotech GT38 ===\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"David-2011\">{{cite news\n|title = Malaysia-Indonesia co-operation to build attack boats\n|url = http://www.nst.com.my/latest/malaysia-indonesia-co-operation-to-build-attack-boats-1.16746#\n|first = Adrian\n|last = David\n|date = 8 December 2011\n|work = [[New Straits Times]]\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hamdani-2010\">{{cite news\n|url = http://surabaya.detik.com/read/2010/10/14/164922/1465223/475/tni-al-akan-miliki-kapal-cepat-rudal-akhir-tahun-2011\n|title = TNI AL Akan Miliki Kapal Cepat Rudal Akhir Tahun 2011\n|trans-title=Navy Fast Missile Vessel By Year-End 2011\n|language = Indonesian\n|work = detikSurabaya\n|first = Irul\n|last = Hamdani\n|date = 2010-10-14\n|quote = ''TNI Angkatan Laut (AL) dipastikan akan segera memiliki Kapal Cepat Rudal (KCR) Trimaran.

However the family dream of a shipyard in Indonesia still remained, so John and his Indonesian wife Lizza moved there permanently. After some years of small-scale furniture manufacturing to gain experience of the business culture there, they founding the boat building company North Sea Boats in 2003.\n\n==Products==\nThe boats are constructed using modern composite production techniques such as dual surface vacuum core resin infusion. All materials used are LLoyds / DNV Class Approved, and include carbon [[Composite material|composite]] fibre and E Glass multi-axial non-woven stitched re-inforcings and Vinyl Ester resins.\n\nThe various models incorporate \"open architecture\" deck plans that can be configured to perform multi-role tasks in a broad range of operational environments. They can be powered by [[Inboard motor|inboard]] [[diesel engine]]s, [[outboard motor]]s or by transom drives and [[Pump-jet|waterjets]].\n\n=== X3K ===\nA 63 meter long carbon composite<ref>[http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=766 63m FMPV Trimaran - Stealth Fast Missile Patrol Vessel]</ref> [[Stealth ship|stealth]] [[trimaran]] missile ship.

In the interim period, advances in infusable vinylester resin chemistry have seen the incorporation of nano particles into the resin. These particles aid the transfer of the resin through the carbon/glass fibre matrix and allow the use of fire retardant grade vinylester for infusion. This makes the carbon fibre composite structure of the new vessel self-extinguishing.<ref>[[Jakarta Post]]: [http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/09/28/navy-vessel-catches-fire-banyuwangi.html Navy vessel catches fire in Banyuwangi] (28 September 2012).</ref>\n[[File:X3K Trimaran.jpg|thumb|X3K trimaran]]\n\n=== Bonefish USV ===\nSaab and PT Lundin (North Sea Boats) revealed a mockup of a trimaran Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) at Indo Defence 2014.\n\nIt was formally unveiled by Indonesia's defence minister General (ret.) Ryamizard Ryacudu and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Marsetio in a joint ribbon-cutting ceremony on the first day of the show.\n\nDevelopment of the Bonefish demonstrator began at the start of 2014, the concept marrying Saab Australia's mission systems integration expertise with a LOMOcean's trimaran hullform. The mockup was built in approximately six months at PT Lundin's composite boat production facility in Banyuwangi, East Java.\n\nCapable of speeds of up to 40kts, Bonefish is designed to incorporate a wide range of sensors, satellite-based control and a modular payload bay to enable role flexibility. Potential missions could include anti-piracy, maritime surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, mine countermeasures, search and rescue, and hydrography.\n\n=== X2K ===\nThe 10.3 X2K Range and the 11.3 m X2K RHIB ( Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat ) Range of models incorporate a double stepped hull design that is based on an offshore race boat design from Sweden. It is a high performance model capable of speeds in excess of 50 knots.\n\nThere are several X2K variants in production, which include:<ref name=\"scandasia-2010\" /><ref name=\"David-2011\" />\n*Sports / Fishing -  centre console recreational model\n*VIP Transfer - with an enclosed cabin for passenger transfers\n*Dive - configured for diving, or as a work boat.\n*Interceptor - designed for patrol and fast interception. \n*Sports RHIB -  centre console recreational model\n*Special Forces / Operations RHIB -  serving military and law enforcement roles.\n*Interceptor RHIB - designed for patrol and fast interception.\n*SAR / Pilot / Work RHIB - configured for Search & Rescue, Pilot and work boat roles.\n\n=== X10 RHIB ===\nThe X10 is a 10.5 m RHIB model with a Deep \"Vee\" hull design. It is designed for patrol or commercial duty and can be fitted with either inboard diesel engines and waterjets, conventional stern drives, or outboard motors.\n\n=== X38 Catamaran ===\nThe X38 is a 12.3 m, stepped-hull, power catamaran design that offers excellent sea-keeping, efficiency, speed, and safety. It is ideally suited for passenger transfers, diving, conservation, patrol, and combat operations. It can also be used for law enforcement, medical evacuations and rescue operations.\n\n=== Tankboat ===\nThe X18 Tank Boat is an innovative, fast, stealthy, and highly maneuverable catamaran design that provides a stable weapons platform for close-in and long range direct fire support in normally inaccessible coastal and riverine Environments.\n\nFitted with high performance diesel engines and water jet propulsion, the twin hull configuration has excellent sea keeping properties and the added advantage of shallow draft. Giving it the ability to execute beach and river landings and insert or extract squads of up to 20 Special Forces or Marines. The X18 Tank Boat has a crew of 6, and will also carry a High-speed Interdiction RIB for boarding and SEAL insertion.\n\nThe main weapon system of the X18 Tank Boat is the CMI Defence Cockerill 3105.  This system is based on a versatile and powerful high-pressure low recoil-force 105mm gun.  Fully stabilised, accurate by day or night, and able to use a wide range of NATO standard 105mm ammunition, this weapon system directly engages a broad spectrum of targets at up to 5,000m range, and indirectly engages targets to 10,000m range. The powerful, accurate and flexible Cockerill C3105 weapon system gives the X18 Tank Boat Commander a wide range of tactical options at all stages of his mission.\n\nThe 105mm is also capable of firing the Cockerill Falarick 105 Gun Launched Anti-Tank Guided Missile (GLATGM).  Elevating to +42\u00b0 the weapon delivers exceptional engagement capability in complex situations, and the GLATGM permits hard and Point target to be engaged at extended ranges (up to 5&nbsp;km). The mounting of this type of system allows for flexibility in logistics with the various calibres already in common use with NATO and other major military powers.\nThis is the first time that any company has conceived of mounting this type of system aboard a small, fast and stealthy catamaran that with only a 1-meter draught makes it ideally suited for the confines of coastal waterway operations.\n\nThe X18 can be augmented with a Bofors LEMUR Remote Weapons Systems incorporating 7.62 \u2013 30&nbsp;mm GPMG/ Cannon.\n\n=== Carbotech GT38 ===\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"David-2011\">{{cite news\n|title = Malaysia-Indonesia co-operation to build attack boats\n|url = http://www.nst.com.my/latest/malaysia-indonesia-co-operation-to-build-attack-boats-1.16746#\n|first = Adrian\n|last = David\n|date = 8 December 2011\n|work = [[New Straits Times]]\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Hamdani-2010\">{{cite news\n|url = http://surabaya.detik.com/read/2010/10/14/164922/1465223/475/tni-al-akan-miliki-kapal-cepat-rudal-akhir-tahun-2011\n|title = TNI AL Akan Miliki Kapal Cepat Rudal Akhir Tahun 2011\n|trans-title=Navy Fast Missile Vessel By Year-End 2011\n|language = Indonesian\n|work = detikSurabaya\n|first = Irul\n|last = Hamdani\n|date = 2010-10-14\n|quote = ''TNI Angkatan Laut (AL) dipastikan akan segera memiliki Kapal Cepat Rudal (KCR) Trimaran.

{"title_page": "Thermal copper pillar bump", "text_new": "The '''thermal copper pillar bump''', also known as the \"thermal bump\", is a thermoelectric device made from thin-film thermoelectric material embedded in [[flip chip]] interconnects (in particular copper pillar [[solder]] bumps) for use in electronics and optoelectronic  packaging, including: flip chip packaging of [[CPU]] and [[GPU]] [[integrated circuits]] (chips), [[laser diode]]s, and [[Optical amplifier#Semiconductor optical amplifier|semiconductor optical amplifiers]] (SOA). Unlike conventional solder bumps that provide an electrical path and a mechanical connection to the package, thermal bumps act as solid-state heat pumps and add thermal management functionality locally on the surface of a chip or to another electrical component. The diameter of a thermal bump is 238 \u03bcm and 60 \u03bcm high.\n\nThe thermal bump uses the [[thermoelectric effect]], which is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and vice versa. Simply put, a thermoelectric device creates a voltage when there is a different temperature on each side, or when a voltage is applied to it, it creates a temperature difference. This effect can be used to generate electricity, to measure temperature, to cool objects, or to heat them.\n\nFor each bump, thermoelectric cooling (TEC) occurs when a current is passed through the bump. The thermal bump pulls heat from one side of the device and transfers it to the other as current is passed through the material. This is known as the [[Thermoelectric effect|Peltier]] effect.<ref name=\"CRC\">D.M. Rowe, ed. CRC Handbook of Thermoelectrics. Boca Raton, CRC Press, 1994</ref> The direction of heating and cooling is determined by the direction of current flow and the sign of the [[Charge carrier|majority electrical carrier]] in the thermoelectric material.  Thermoelectric power generation (TEG) on the other hand occurs when the thermal bump is subjected to a temperature gradient (i.e., the top is hotter than the bottom).  In this instance, the device generates current, converting heat into electrical power. This is termed the [[Thermoelectric effect|Seebeck]] effect.<ref name=\"CRC\" />\n\nThe thermal bump was developed by Nextreme Thermal Solutions as a method for integrating active thermal management functionality at the chip level in the same manner that transistors, resistors and capacitors are integrated in conventional circuit designs today.   Nextreme chose the copper pillar bump as an integration strategy due to its widespread acceptance by [[Intel]], [[Amkor]] and other industry leaders as the method for connecting microprocessors and other advanced electronics devices to various surfaces during a process referred to as \u201cflip-chip\u201d packaging.  The thermal bump can be integrated as a part of the standard flip-chip process (Figure 1) or integrated as discrete devices.\n\nThe efficiency of a thermoelectric device is measured by the heat moved (or pumped) divided by the amount of electrical power supplied to move this heat. This ratio is termed the coefficient of performance or COP and is a measured characteristic of a thermoelectric device. The COP is inversely related to the temperature difference that the device produces. As you move a cooling device further away from the heat source, parasitic losses between the cooler and the heat source necessitate additional cooling power:  the further the distance between source and cooler, the more cooling is required.  For this reason, the cooling of electronic devices is most efficient when it occurs closest to the source of the heat generation.\n\nUse of the thermal bump does not displace system level cooling, which is still needed to move heat out of the system; rather it introduces a fundamentally new methodology for achieving temperature uniformity at the chip and board level.  In this manner, overall thermal management of the system becomes more efficient. In addition, while conventional cooling solutions scale with the size of the system (bigger fans for bigger systems, etc.), the thermal bump can scale at the chip level by using more thermal bumps in the overall design.\n\n[[Image:thermal-bump-substrate.png|thumb|Figure 1. Thermal and electrical bumps integrated on a single substrate.]]\n\n==A brief history of solder and flip chip/chip scale packaging==\nSolder bumping technology (the process of joining a chip to a [[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]] without shorting using solder) was first conceived and implemented by [[IBM]] in the early 1960s.  Three versions of this type of solder joining were developed.  The first was to embed copper balls in the solder bumps to provide a positive stand-off.  The second solution, developed by [[Delco Electronics]] (General Motors) in the late 1960s, was similar to embedding copper balls except that the design employed a rigid silver bump. The bump provided a positive stand-off and was attached to the substrate by means of solder that was screen-printed onto the substrate. The third solution was to use a screened glass dam near the [[electrode]] tips to act as a \u2018\u2018stop-off\u2019\u2019 to prevent the ball solder from flowing down the electrode. By then the Ball Limiting Metallurgy (BLM) with a high-lead (Pb) solder system and a copper ball had proven to work well. Therefore, the ball was simply removed and the solder evaporation process extended to form pure solder bumps that were approximately 125\u03bcm high. This system became known as the controlled collapse chip connection (C3 or C4).\n\nUntil the mid-1990s, this type of flip-chip assembly was practiced almost exclusively by IBM and Delco.  Around this time, Delco sought to commercialize its technology and formed [[Delco Electronics|Flip Chip Technologies]] with Kulicke & Soffa Industries as a partner.  At the same time, MCNC (which had developed a plated version of IBM\u2019s C4 process) received funding from [[DARPA]] to commercialize its technology. These two organizations, along with APTOS (Advanced Plating Technologies on Silicon), formed the nascent out-sourcing market.\n\nDuring this same time, companies began to look at reducing or streamlining their packaging, from the earlier multi-chip-on-ceramic packages that IBM had originally developed C4 to support, to what were referred to as [[chip scale package|Chip Scale Packages]] (CSP).  There were a number of companies developing products in this area.  These products could usually be put into one of two camps: either they were scaled down versions of the multi-chip on ceramic package (of which the Tessera package would be one example); or they were the streamlined versions developed by Unitive Electronics, et al. (where the package wiring had been transferred to the chip, and after bumping, they were ready to be placed).\n\nOne of the issues with the CSP type of package (which was intended to be soldered directly to an FR4 or flex circuit) was that for high-density interconnects, the soft solder bump provided less of a stand-off as the solder bump diameter and pitch were decreased.  Different solutions were employed including one developed by Focus Interconnect Technology (former APTOS engineers), which used a high aspect ratio plated copper post to provide a larger fixed standoff than was possible for a soft solder collapse joint.\n\nToday, flip chip is a well established technology and collapsed soft solder connections are used in the vast majority of assemblies.  The copper post stand-off developed for the CSP market has found a home in high-density interconnects for advanced micro-processors and is used today by IBM for its CPU packaging.\n\n==Copper pillar solder bumping==\nRecent trends in high-density interconnects have led to the use of copper pillar solder bumps (CPB) for CPU and GPU packaging.<ref>J. Kloeser and E. Weibach, \u201cHigh-Performance Flip Chip Packages with Copper Pillar Bumping,\u201d Global SMT & Packaging, May 2006.</ref>  CPBs are an attractive replacement for traditional solder bumps because they provide a fixed stand-off independent of pitch. This is extremely important as most of the high-end products are underfilled and a smaller standoff may create difficulties in getting the underfill adhesive to flow under the die.\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of a CPB fabricated by Intel and incorporated into their [[Pentium D|Presler]] line of microprocessors among others. The cross section shows copper and a copper pillar (approximately 60&nbsp;um high) electrically connected through an opening (or via) in the chip [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]] at the top of the picture.  At the bottom is another copper trace on the package substrate with solder between the two copper layers.\n\n[[Image:intel-presler-copper-pillar-bump.png|thumb|Figure 2.

Thin-film thermoelectric materials are grown by conventional semiconductor deposition methods and fabricated using conventional semiconductor micro-fabrication techniques.\n\nThin-film thermoelectrics have been demonstrated to provide high heat pumping capacity that far exceeds the capacities provided by traditional bulk pellet TE products.<ref>G.J.

Conner, \u201dHot Spot Cooling using Embedded Thermoelectric Coolers,\u201d  Proc. 22nd IEEE Semi-Therm Symp., 2006.</ref>  The benefit of thin-films versus bulk materials for thermoelectric manufacturing is expressed in Equation 1.  Here the Qmax (maximum heat pumped by a module) is shown to be inversely proportional to the thickness of the film, L.\n\n<math>Q_{max}=\\frac{S^2T^2}{2\\cdot R_{Total}}=\\frac{S^2T^2A}{2p_cL}</math>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eq. 1\n\nAs such, TE coolers manufactured with thin-films can easily have 10x \u2013 20x higher Qmax values for a given active area A. This makes thin-film TECs ideally suited for applications involving high heat-flux flows. In addition to the increased heat pumping capability, the use of thin films allows for truly novel implementation of TE devices. Instead of a bulk module that is 1\u20133&nbsp;mm in thickness, a thin-film TEC can be fabricated less than 100&nbsp;um in thickness.\n\nIn its simplest form, the P or N leg of a TE couple (the basic building block of all thin-film TE devices) is a layer of thin-film TE material with a solder layer above and below, providing electrical and thermal functionality.\n\n==Thermal copper pillar bump==\nThe thermal bump is compatible with the existing flip-chip manufacturing infrastructure, extending the use of conventional solder bumped interconnects to provide active, integrated cooling of a flip-chipped component using the widely accepted copper pillar bumping process. The result is higher performance and efficiency within the existing semiconductor manufacturing paradigm. The thermal bump also enables power generating capabilities within copper pillar bumps for energy recycling applications.\n\nThermal bumps have been shown to achieve a temperature differential of 60&nbsp;\u00b0C between the top and bottom headers; demonstrated power pumping capabilities exceeding 150 W/cm2; and when subjected to heat, have demonstrated the capability to generate up to 10&nbsp;mW of power per bump.\n\n==Thermal copper pillar bump structure==\nFigure 3 shows an SEM cross-section of a TE leg.  Here it is demonstrated that the thermal bump is structurally identical to a CPB with an extra layer, the TE layer, incorporated into the stack-up. The addition of the TE layer transforms a standard copper pillar bump into a thermal bump.  This element, when properly configured electrically and thermally, provides active thermoelectric heat transfer from one side of the bump to the other side.  The direction of heat transfer is dictated by the doping type of the thermoelectric material (either a P-type or N-type semiconductor) and the direction of electric current passing through the material. This type of thermoelectric heat transfer is known as the Peltier effect. Conversely, if heat is allowed to pass from one side of the thermoelectric material to the other, a current will be generated in the material in a phenomenon known as the Seebeck effect. The Seebeck effect is essentially the reverse of the Peltier effect. In this mode, electrical power is generated from the flow of heat in the TE element. The structure shown in Figure 3 is capable of operating in both the Peltier and Seebeck modes, though not simultaneously.\n\n[[Image:cross-section-thermal-bump.png|thumb|Figure 3.

These structures are similar, with both having copper pillars and solder connections.  The primary difference between the two is the introduction of either a P- or N-type thermoelectric layer between two solder layers.  The solders used with CPBs and thermal bumps can be any one of a number of commonly used solders including, but not limited to, Sn, SnPb eutectic, SnAg or AuSn.\n\n[[Image:cpb-thermal-bump.png|thumb|Figure 4.

These metal layers can be beneficial for gathering heat from larger areas and funneling it into the thermal bump, reducing the thermal constriction resistance in the circuit.  A thermal via is shown in the printed wire board for improved heat rejection path.]]\n\nThe metal traces shown in the figure for conducting electric current into the thermal bump may or may not be directly connected to the circuitry of the chip.  In the case where there are electrical connections to the chip circuitry, on-board temperature sensors and driver circuitry can be used to control the thermal bump in a closed loop fashion to maintain optimal performance.  Second, the heat that is pumped by the thermal bump and the additional heat created by the thermal bump in the course of pumping that heat will need to be rejected into the substrate or board.  Since the performance of the thermal bump can be improved by providing a good thermal path for the rejected heat, it is beneficial to provide high thermally conductive pathways on the backside of the thermal bump.  The substrate could be a highly conductive ceramic substrate like AlN or a metal (e.g., Cu, CuW, CuMo, etc.) with a dielectric. In this case, the high thermal conductance of the substrate will act as a natural pathway for the rejected heat. The substrate might also be a multilayer substrate like a printed wiring board (PWB) designed to provide a high-density interconnect.  In this case, the thermal conductivity of the PWB may be relatively poor, so adding thermal vias (e.g. metal plugs) can provide excellent pathways for the rejected heat.\n\n==Applications==\nThermal bumps can be used in a number of different ways to provide chip cooling and power generation.\n\n===General cooling===\nThermal bumps can be evenly distributed across the surface of a chip to provide a uniform cooling effect.  In this case, the thermal bumps may be interspersed with standard bumps that are used for signal, power and ground.  This allows the thermal bumps to be placed directly under the active circuitry of the chip for maximum effectiveness. The number and density of thermal bumps are based on the heat load from the chip.  Each P/N couple can provide a specific heat pumping (Q) at a specific temperature differential (\u0394T) at a given electric current.  Temperature sensors on the chip (\u201con board\u201d sensors) can provide direct measurement of the thermal bump performance and provide feedback to the driver circuit.\n\n===Precision temperature control===\nSince thermal bumps can either cool or heat the chip depending on the current direction, they can be used to provide precision control of temperature for chips that must operate within specific temperature ranges irrespective of ambient conditions.  For example, this is a common problem for many optoelectronic components.\n\n===Hotspot cooling===\nIn microprocessors, graphics processors and other high-end chips, hotspots can occur as power densities vary significantly across a chip.<ref>A. Bar-Cohen, University of Maryland, \u201cEnhanced Thermoelectric Cooler for On-Chip Hot Spot Cooling\u201d presentation, IntePACK\u201907: ASME/Pacific Rim Technical Conference and Exhibition on Packaging and Integration of Electronic and Photonic Systems, MEMS, and NEMS, July 8\u201312, 2007.</ref>  These hotspots can severely limit the performance of the devices.  Because of the small size of the thermal bumps and the relatively high density at which they can be placed on the active surface of the chip, these structures are ideally suited for cooling hotspots.  In such a case, the distribution of the thermal bumps may not need to be even.  Rather, the thermal bumps would be concentrated in the area of the hotspot while areas of lower heat density would have fewer thermal bumps per unit area.  In this way, cooling from the thermal bumps is applied only where needed, thereby reducing the added power necessary to drive the cooling and reducing the general thermal overhead on the system.\n\n===Power generation===\nIn addition to chip cooling, thermal bumps can also be applied to high heat-flux interconnects to provide a constant, steady source of power for energy scavenging applications. Such a source of power, typically in the mW range, can trickle charge batteries for wireless sensor networks and other battery operated systems.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.kns.com/ Kulicke & Soffa]\n*[http://www.mcnc.org/ MCNC]\n*[http://www.aptostechnology.com/ Aptos Technology]\n*[http://www.nextreme.com/ Nextreme Thermal Solutions]\n*[http://www.amkor.com/go/packaging/all-packages/fine-pitch-copper-pillar-flip-chip/fine-pitch-copper-pillar-flip-chip Amkor Technology Inc.]\n\n==White Papers, Articles and Application Notes==\n*[http://www.amkor.com/index.cfm?objectid=C55AF2CE-D1A3-1153-5E9522117EE0826C   \"Flip Chip Bump Electromigration Reliability A comparison of Cu Pillar, High Pb, SnAg and SnPb Bump Structures\", White Paper]\n\n{{emerging technologies|topics=yes|electronics=yes}}\n\n[[Category:Electronics manufacturing]]\n[[Category:Semiconductors]]\n[[Category:Thermodynamics]]\n[[Category:Emerging technologies]]\n", "text_old": "The '''thermal copper pillar bump''', also known as the \"thermal bump\", is a thermoelectric device made from thin-film thermoelectric material embedded in [[flip chip]] interconnects (in particular copper pillar [[solder]] bumps) for use in electronics and optoelectronic  packaging, including: flip chip packaging of [[CPU]] and [[GPU]] [[integrated circuits]] (chips), [[laser diode]]s, and [[Optical amplifier#Semiconductor optical amplifier|semiconductor optical amplifiers]] (SOA). Unlike conventional solder bumps that provide an electrical path and a mechanical connection to the package, thermal bumps act as solid-state heat pumps and add thermal management functionality locally on the surface of a chip or to another electrical component. The diameter of a thermal bump is 238 \u03bcm and 60 \u03bcm high.\n\nThe thermal bump uses the [[thermoelectric effect]], which is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and vice versa. Simply put, a thermoelectric device creates a voltage when there is a different temperature on each side, or when a voltage is applied to it, it creates a temperature difference. This effect can be used to generate electricity, to measure temperature, to cool objects, or to heat them.\n\nFor each bump, thermoelectric cooling (TEC) occurs when a current is passed through the bump. The thermal bump pulls heat from one side of the device and transfers it to the other as current is passed through the material. This is known as the [[Thermoelectric effect|Peltier]] effect.<ref name=\"CRC\">D.M. Rowe, ed. CRC Handbook of Thermoelectrics. Boca Raton, CRC Press, 1994</ref> The direction of heating and cooling is determined by the direction of current flow and the sign of the [[Charge carrier|majority electrical carrier]] in the thermoelectric material.  Thermoelectric power generation (TEG) on the other hand occurs when the thermal bump is subjected to a temperature gradient (i.e., the top is hotter than the bottom).  In this instance, the device generates current, converting heat into electrical power. This is termed the [[Thermoelectric effect|Seebeck]] effect.<ref name=\"CRC\" />\n\nThe thermal bump was developed by Nextreme Thermal Solutions as a method for integrating active thermal management functionality at the chip level in the same manner that transistors, resistors and capacitors are integrated in conventional circuit designs today.   Nextreme chose the copper pillar bump as an integration strategy due to its widespread acceptance by [[Intel]], [[Amkor]] and other industry leaders as the method for connecting microprocessors and other advanced electronics devices to various surfaces during a process referred to as \u201cflip-chip\u201d packaging.  The thermal bump can be integrated as a part of the standard flip-chip process (Figure 1) or integrated as discrete devices.\n\nThe efficiency of a thermoelectric device is measured by the heat moved (or pumped) divided by the amount of electrical power supplied to move this heat. This ratio is termed the coefficient of performance or COP and is a measured characteristic of a thermoelectric device. The COP is inversely related to the temperature difference that the device produces. As you move a cooling device further away from the heat source, parasitic losses between the cooler and the heat source necessitate additional cooling power:  the further the distance between source and cooler, the more cooling is required.  For this reason, the cooling of electronic devices is most efficient when it occurs closest to the source of the heat generation.\n\nUse of the thermal bump does not displace system level cooling, which is still needed to move heat out of the system; rather it introduces a fundamentally new methodology for achieving temperature uniformity at the chip and board level.  In this manner, overall thermal management of the system becomes more efficient. In addition, while conventional cooling solutions scale with the size of the system (bigger fans for bigger systems, etc.), the thermal bump can scale at the chip level by using more thermal bumps in the overall design.\n\n[[Image:thermal-bump-substrate.png|thumb|Figure 1. Thermal and electrical bumps integrated on a single substrate.]]\n\n==A brief history of solder and flip chip/chip scale packaging==\nSolder bumping technology (the process of joining a chip to a [[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]] without shorting using solder) was first conceived and implemented by [[IBM]] in the early \u201860s.  Three versions of this type of solder joining were developed.  The first was to embed copper balls in the solder bumps to provide a positive stand-off.  The second solution, developed by [[Delco Electronics]] (General Motors) in the late \u201860s, was similar to embedding copper balls except that the design employed a rigid silver bump. The bump provided a positive stand-off and was attached to the substrate by means of solder that was screen-printed onto the substrate. The third solution was to use a screened glass dam near the [[electrode]] tips to act as a \u2018\u2018stop-off\u2019\u2019 to prevent the ball solder from flowing down the electrode. By then the Ball Limiting Metallurgy (BLM) with a high-lead (Pb) solder system and a copper ball had proven to work well. Therefore, the ball was simply removed and the solder evaporation process extended to form pure solder bumps that were approximately 125\u03bcm high. This system became known as the controlled collapse chip connection (C3 or C4).\n\nUntil the mid-90\u2019s, this type of flip-chip assembly was practiced almost exclusively by IBM and Delco.  Around this time, Delco sought to commercialize its technology and formed [[Delco Electronics|Flip Chip Technologies]] with Kulicke & Soffa Industries as a partner.  At the same time, MCNC (which had developed a plated version of IBM\u2019s C4 process) received funding from [[DARPA]] to commercialize its technology. These two organizations, along with APTOS (Advanced Plating Technologies on Silicon), formed the nascent out-sourcing market.\n\nDuring this same time, companies began to look at reducing or streamlining their packaging, from the earlier multi-chip-on-ceramic packages that IBM had originally developed C4 to support, to what were referred to as [[chip scale package|Chip Scale Packages]] (CSP).  There were a number of companies developing products in this area.  These products could usually be put into one of two camps: either they were scaled down versions of the multi-chip on ceramic package (of which the Tessera package would be one example); or they were the streamlined versions developed by Unitive Electronics, et al. (where the package wiring had been transferred to the chip, and after bumping, they were ready to be placed).\n\nOne of the issues with the CSP type of package (which was intended to be soldered directly to an FR4 or flex circuit) was that for high-density interconnects, the soft solder bump provided less of a stand-off as the solder bump diameter and pitch were decreased.  Different solutions were employed including one developed by Focus Interconnect Technology (former APTOS engineers), which used a high aspect ratio plated copper post to provide a larger fixed standoff than was possible for a soft solder collapse joint.\n\nToday, flip chip is a well established technology and collapsed soft solder connections are used in the vast majority of assemblies.  The copper post stand-off developed for the CSP market has found a home in high-density interconnects for advanced micro-processors and is used today by IBM for its CPU packaging.\n\n==Copper pillar solder bumping==\nRecent trends in high-density interconnects have led to the use of copper pillar solder bumps (CPB) for CPU and GPU packaging.<ref>J. Kloeser and E. Weibach, \u201cHigh-Performance Flip Chip Packages with Copper Pillar Bumping,\u201d Global SMT & Packaging, May 2006.</ref>  CPBs are an attractive replacement for traditional solder bumps because they provide a fixed stand-off independent of pitch. This is extremely important as most of the high-end products are underfilled and a smaller standoff may create difficulties in getting the underfill adhesive to flow under the die.\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of a CPB fabricated by Intel and incorporated into their [[Pentium D|Presler]] line of microprocessors among others. The cross section shows copper and a copper pillar (approximately 60&nbsp;um high) electrically connected through an opening (or via) in the chip [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]] at the top of the picture.  At the bottom is another copper trace on the package substrate with solder between the two copper layers.\n\n[[Image:intel-presler-copper-pillar-bump.png|thumb|Figure 2.
