Founded in 1986 by brothers Francis and Moyses Howard under the name Incubus, Natives of Rio de Janeiro, the Howards emigrated to New Orleans and formed the band. The original incarnation featured bassist/lead vocalist Scot Latour, and the trio's 1987 demo ''Supernatural Death'' landed them a deal with the small Brutal Records imprint. Their official debut, ''Serpent Temptation'', was released in 1988; however, LaTour departed soon afterwards, leaving Francis to take over vocal duties. Incubus signed with [[Nuclear Blast]] in 1990 and soon released their follow-up ''Beyond the Unknown''; recording with Francis on bass as well, Incubus eventually tabbed Mark Lavenia as the full-time bassist. But shortly thereafter, in 1991, Incubus disbanded, then reappeared after a ten-year break from the music business, being forced to change their name in order to avoid confusion with newly emerging [[Rock music|rock]] band [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] from [[California]].

Its first public appearance was a celebration of the end of the 1980s. The three men wore blue masks and led a street procession that included the burning of a Rambo doll and a piece of the Berlin Wall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Welch|first=Liz|year=2008|title=THE BLUE MAN GROUP (Cover Story)|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080801/how-we-did-it-the-blue-man-group.html|journal=Inc|volume=30.8|pages=110\u2013112|via=}}</ref> MTV's [[Kurt Loder]], who covered the event, drew attention to the strange Blue Men\u2014and what began as creative \"disturbances\" on the streets of the city became a series of small shows at downtown clubs, and eventually a full performance at the [[Astor Place Theatre]] in 1991.\n\nIn July 2017, Blue Man Group was bought by [[Cirque du Soleil]], who announced that they would expand the concept.<ref name=\"Deb 2017\">{{Cite journal|last=Deb|first=Sopan|year=2017|title=Blue Man Group Is Bought by Cirque du Soleil, With Plans to Expand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/theater/cirque-du-soleil-buys-blue-man-group.html|journal=New York Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nThere are a number of different themes found in various Blue Man performances. These themes include:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite AV media |year=2006 |title=Blue Man Group: Inside the Tube |publisher=[[PBS]]}}</ref>\n* ''Science'' and ''technology'', especially the topics of [[plumbing]], [[fractals]], human [[Visual perception|sight]], [[DNA]], and the [[Internet]].\n* ''[[Information overload]]'' and ''[[information pollution]]'', such as when the audience is asked to choose one of three simultaneous streams of information to read.\n* ''[[Innocence]]'', as when the Blue Men appear to be surprised and perplexed by common artifacts of modern society or by audience reactions.\n* ''[[Self-conscious]]'' and ''na\u00efve'' imitation of cultural norms, such as attempting to stage an elegant dinner for an audience member with [[Twinkie]]s; or following the Rock Concert Instruction Manual with the expectation that following a series of instructions is all it takes to put on a rock concert.\n* ''The Outsider''.  Blue Men always appear as a group of three. This is because<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> not only are Blue Men viewed as outsiders to the rest of the world, but three is the smallest group possible when endeavoring to create a community. Many of the Blue Man skits involve one of the three Blue Men performing in a manner inconsistent with the other two.\n* ''Rooftops'', or otherwise climbing to the top. There are a number of references, both in visual pieces and in lyrics from the Complex tour, that have a common theme of getting to the roof. This theme is a metaphor for the advice Stanton, Wink, and Goldman drew from [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Bill Moyers]]'s [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program ''[[The Power of Myth]]''  and represents \"following your bliss\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nThe members of Blue Man Group met in 1986 while participating in an underground production of French symbolist writer [[Alfred Jarry]]\u2019s ''[[Ubu Roi]]'', an absurdist work which inspired many themes which the trio have continued to revisit in their work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> The main character of Ubu Roi\u2019s exaggerated childishness is arguably the inspiration behind some of the group\u2019s most enduring themes, such as their displays of naivete in the face of a complex web of modern social norms. Most memorably, we may think of their iconic \u201cstreet meat\u201d bit, in which they are unleashed onto the streets of New York, hungry for the city\u2019s world-renowned halal cart kebabs. However, their mimes to strange men for \u201cstreet meat\u201d are misconstrued, and the boys are met with quite a different kind of delight. \n\nRingleader Chris Wink has pointed to a further influence from Jarry\u2013 he is said to have biked the streets of Paris at night painted green, in homage to his favorite elixir, [[absinthe]]. Blue Man Group decided to paint themselves blue following this example, but with a twist of social activism. They chose to be Blue Men in honor of the blue of our oceans. One may say that, as humans with mortal life-spans, taking on this identity draws attention to the threatened futurity of the ocean\u2019s complex and vital ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> \n\nJarry is not the only figure to influence Blue Man Group\u2013 Wink has described himself as an artistic magpie, mining history for visionaries who explored the absurd.  The group see themselves as inheritors of the ethos of Greek cynic philosopher [[Diogenes]], who made his life his art, believing that virtue was better expressed through action than through theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> Diogenes\u2019 actions took the form of burlesques of \u201crational\u201d behavior and cultural practices, and radical rejections of received ideas of human decency. Famously, Diogenes masturbated openly in the market-place. When asked about his actions, he said,  \"If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly.\u201d Though Blue Man Group\u2019s shows are generally family-friendly (save for the raunchy \u201cstreet meat\u201d piece), this naive logic would not be out of place in a Blue Man Group show.

Although it contained some of the music from their stage productions, it was chiefly a collection of full-length instrumentals featuring new instruments.\n\nIn 2002, the group participated in [[Moby]]'s [[Area2]] tour, giving a more rock-oriented performance than in the theatrical shows.  Songs developed during this tour appeared on 2003's album ''[[The Complex (album)|The Complex]]''.\n\nUnlike ''Audio'', ''The Complex'', released in 2003, featured a variety of vocalists and guests including [[Tracy Bonham]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[Gavin Rossdale]] and [[Venus Hum]]. The record spawned its own 2003 tour, \"How to Be a Megastar,\" the first headlined by Blue Man Group.  The tour deconstructed the traditional [[rock concert]] experience into its often clich\u00e9d parts and was chronicled in a 2004 DVD release. The tour featured Tracy Bonham and Venus Hum as supporting acts. The DVD included a [[surround sound]] mix of some of the studio recordings.\n\nBlue Man Group launched its second tour, \"How to Be a Megastar Tour 2.0\", on September 26, 2006. It featured some new material as well as material from the original Complex Rock Tour, and featured Tracy Bonham as opening act and vocalist. DJ/[[VJ (video performance artist)|VJ]] [[Mike Relm]] was the opening act for the tour's second leg, which ended April 22, 2007 in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. The third leg of the tour began in May 2007 and included performances in [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], and [[Monterrey]], Mexico; [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina; [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil; and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], Chile. The fourth leg, using \"2.1\" in its title, included more U.S. and Canada dates. The tour visited France, [[Korea]], Canada, Germany, and a few other European countries through 2008. From August 19\u201323, it visited Taipei, Taiwan to promote its [[2009 Summer Deaflympics]], with most of the show's dialogue accompanied by subtitles. After [[Typhoon Morakot (2009)|Typhoon Morakot]] hit the island in mid-August, the group held an extra show to benefit flood victims.\n\nBlue Man Group performed with Ricky Martin at the [[2007 Latin Grammy Awards]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latingrammy.com/en/node/21589|title=Ricky Martin e Blue Man Group|website=Latin GRAMMYs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref> and again with Michael Telo at the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latingrammy.com/en/node/49681|title=Michel Telo y Blue Man Group|website=Latin GRAMMYs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, they collaborated on the track \"No More Heroes\" with Dutch DJ and producer [[Ti\u00ebsto]] for the remixed version of the ''[[Elements of Life]]'' album.\n\nAnnounced in 2009, Blue Man Group began performing for the first time at sea on Norwegian Cruise Line's ship ''Epic''.  From July 2010 to March 2015, ''Epic'' alternated 7-Day Eastern and Western Caribbean sailings from Miami with nightly Blue Man Group shows.\n\nA Blue Man Group national tour in 2010 visited various cities in the United States, Canada and Latin America.

A typical Blue Man production employs 7\u20139 full-time Blue Men who are selected by audition. In addition to the stage show, Blue Man Group has toured nationally and internationally, appeared on various TV programs as both characters and performers, released multiple studio albums, contributed to a number of [[film score]]s, performed with orchestras around the United States, and appeared in ad campaigns.\n\n==History==\nBlue Man Group grew out of a collaboration between three close friends, [[Chris Wink]], Matt Goldman and Phil Stanton, on [[Manhattan]]\u2019s [[Lower East Side]] in 1987. Its first public appearance was a celebration of the end of the 1980s. The three men wore blue masks and led a street procession that included the burning of a Rambo doll and a piece of the Berlin Wall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Welch|first=Liz|year=2008|title=THE BLUE MAN GROUP (Cover Story)|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20080801/how-we-did-it-the-blue-man-group.html|journal=Inc|volume=30.8|pages=110\u2013112|via=}}</ref> MTV's [[Kurt Loder]], who covered the event, drew attention to the strange Blue Men\u2014and what began as creative \"disturbances\" on the streets of the city became a series of small shows at downtown clubs, and eventually a full performance at the [[Astor Place Theatre]] in 1991.\n\nIn July 2017, Blue Man Group was bought by [[Cirque du Soleil]], who announced that they would expand the concept.<ref name=\"Deb 2017\">{{Cite journal|last=Deb|first=Sopan|year=2017|title=Blue Man Group Is Bought by Cirque du Soleil, With Plans to Expand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/theater/cirque-du-soleil-buys-blue-man-group.html|journal=New York Times|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nThere are a number of different themes found in various Blue Man performances. These themes include:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite AV media |year=2006 |title=Blue Man Group: Inside the Tube |publisher=[[PBS]]}}</ref>\n* ''Science'' and ''technology'', especially the topics of [[plumbing]], [[fractals]], human [[Visual perception|sight]], [[DNA]], and the [[Internet]].\n* ''[[Information overload]]'' and ''[[information pollution]]'', such as when the audience is asked to choose one of three simultaneous streams of information to read.\n* ''[[Innocence]]'', as when the Blue Men appear to be surprised and perplexed by common artifacts of modern society or by audience reactions.\n* ''[[Self-conscious]]'' and ''na\u00efve'' imitation of cultural norms, such as attempting to stage an elegant dinner for an audience member with [[Twinkie]]s; or following the Rock Concert Instruction Manual with the expectation that following a series of instructions is all it takes to put on a rock concert.\n* ''The Outsider''.  Blue Men always appear as a group of three. This is because<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> not only are Blue Men viewed as outsiders to the rest of the world, but three is the smallest group possible when endeavoring to create a community. Many of the Blue Man skits involve one of the three Blue Men performing in a manner inconsistent with the other two.\n* ''Rooftops'', or otherwise climbing to the top. There are a number of references, both in visual pieces and in lyrics from the Complex tour, that have a common theme of getting to the roof. This theme is a metaphor for the advice Stanton, Wink, and Goldman drew from [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Bill Moyers]]'s [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program ''[[The Power of Myth]]''  and represents \"following your bliss\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nThe members of Blue Man Group met in 1986 while participating in an underground production of French symbolist writer [[Alfred Jarry]]\u2019s ''[[Ubu Roi]]'', an absurdist work which inspired many themes which the trio have continued to revisit in their work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> The main character of Ubu Roi\u2019s exaggerated childishness is arguably the inspiration behind some of the group\u2019s most enduring themes, such as their displays of naivete in the face of a complex web of modern social norms. Most memorably, we may think of their iconic \u201cstreet meat\u201d bit, in which they are unleashed onto the streets of New York, hungry for the city\u2019s world-renowned halal cart kebabs. However, their mimes to strange men for \u201cstreet meat\u201d are misconstrued, and the boys are met with quite a different kind of delight. \n\nRingleader Chris Wink has pointed to a further influence from Jarry\u2013 he is said to have biked the streets of Paris at night painted green, in homage to his favorite elixir, [[absinthe]]. Blue Man Group decided to paint themselves blue following this example, but with a twist of social activism. They chose to be Blue Men in honor of the blue of our oceans. One may say that, as humans with mortal life-spans, taking on this identity draws attention to the threatened futurity of the ocean\u2019s complex and vital ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> \n\nJarry is not the only figure to influence Blue Man Group\u2013 Wink has described himself as an artistic magpie, mining history for visionaries who explored the absurd.  The group see themselves as inheritors of the ethos of Greek cynic philosopher [[Diogenes]], who made his life his art, believing that virtue was better expressed through action than through theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> Diogenes\u2019 actions took the form of burlesques of \u201crational\u201d behavior and cultural practices, and radical rejections of received ideas of human decency. Famously, Diogenes masturbated openly in the market-place. When asked about his actions, he said,  \"If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly.\u201d Though Blue Man Group\u2019s shows are generally family-friendly (save for the raunchy \u201cstreet meat\u201d piece), this naive logic would not be out of place in a Blue Man Group show. The group\u2019s music is heavily indebted to Italian Futurist composer [[Luigi Russolo]], who was known for his rejection of traditional melodic music and instruments in favor of [[Intonarumori]], experimental instruments which mimic the sounds of industrial life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://podtail.com/en/podcast/the-evolver/chris-wink-the-visionary-roots-of-blue-man-group/|title=Chris Wink - The Visionary Roots of Blue Man Group|website=podtail.com|access-date=2019-02-15}}</ref> Blue Man Group\u2019s instruments, often made of materials like pipes, are thoroughly within this tradition.

Although it contained some of the music from their stage productions, it was chiefly a collection of full-length instrumentals featuring new instruments.\n\nIn 2002, the group participated in [[Moby]]'s [[Area2]] tour, giving a more rock-oriented performance than in the theatrical shows.  Songs developed during this tour appeared on 2003's album ''[[The Complex (album)|The Complex]]''.\n\nUnlike ''Audio'', ''The Complex'', released in 2003, featured a variety of vocalists and guests including [[Tracy Bonham]], [[Dave Matthews]], [[Gavin Rossdale]] and [[Venus Hum]]. The record spawned its own 2003 tour, \"How to Be a Megastar,\" the first headlined by Blue Man Group.  The tour deconstructed the traditional [[rock concert]] experience into its often clich\u00e9d parts and was chronicled in a 2004 DVD release. The tour featured Tracy Bonham and Venus Hum as supporting acts. The DVD included a [[surround sound]] mix of some of the studio recordings.\n\nBlue Man Group launched its second tour, \"How to Be a Megastar Tour 2.0\", on September 26, 2006. It featured some new material as well as material from the original Complex Rock Tour, and featured Tracy Bonham as opening act and vocalist. DJ/[[VJ (video performance artist)|VJ]] [[Mike Relm]] was the opening act for the tour's second leg, which ended April 22, 2007 in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. The third leg of the tour began in May 2007 and included performances in [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], and [[Monterrey]], Mexico; [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina; [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil; and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], Chile. The fourth leg, using \"2.1\" in its title, included more U.S. and Canada dates. The tour visited France, [[Korea]], Canada, Germany, and a few other European countries through 2008. From August 19\u201323, it visited Taipei, Taiwan to promote its [[2009 Summer Deaflympics]], with most of the show's dialogue accompanied by subtitles. After [[Typhoon Morakot (2009)|Typhoon Morakot]] hit the island in mid-August, the group held an extra show to benefit flood victims.\n\nBlue Man Group performed with Ricky Martin at the [[2007 Latin Grammy Awards]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latingrammy.com/en/node/21589|title=Ricky Martin e Blue Man Group|website=Latin GRAMMYs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref> and again with Michael Telo at the 2012 Latin Grammy Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latingrammy.com/en/node/49681|title=Michel Telo y Blue Man Group|website=Latin GRAMMYs|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, they collaborated on the track \"No More Heroes\" with Dutch DJ and producer [[Ti\u00ebsto]] for the remixed version of the ''[[Elements of Life]]'' album.\n\nAnnounced in 2009, Blue Man Group began performing for the first time at sea on Norwegian Cruise Line's ship ''Epic''.  From July 2010 to March 2015, ''Epic'' alternated 7-Day Eastern and Western Caribbean sailings from Miami with nightly Blue Man Group shows.\n\nA Blue Man Group national tour in 2010 visited various cities in the United States, Canada and Latin America.

Along with [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender's]] [[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]] and [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]], it was one of the first mass-produced electric solid-body guitars.

In reaction to market demand, Gibson Guitar president [[Ted McCarty]] brought guitarist [[Les Paul]] into the company as a consultant.\n\nLes Paul was a respected innovator who had been experimenting with guitar design for years. He had hand-built a solid-body prototype nicknamed \"The Log\", often suggested as the first solid-body [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] ever built. \"The Log\" was given its name from the pine block running through the middle of the guitar whose width and depth are a little more than the width of the fretboard; conventional hollow guitar sides or \"wings\" were added for shape. In 1945 or 1946, Paul had approached Gibson with \"The Log\" [[prototype]], but his design was rejected.<ref name=Wheeler1992>\n{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Tom|title=American Guitars|year=1992|publisher=Harper|isbn=0-06-273154-8|page=140}}</ref><ref name=Freeth2004>{{cite book|last=Freeth|first=Nick|author2=Charles Alexander|editor=Ray Bonds|title=The Illustrated Directory of Guitars|year=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble, Inc.|isbn=0-7607-6317-8|pages=290&ndash;293}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, McCarty and his team at Gibson began work on what would eventually become the Les Paul Model.

McCarty stated that design discussions with Les Paul were limited to the tailpiece and the fitting of a maple cap over the mahogany body for increased density and sustain, which Les Paul had requested reversed. However, this reversal would have caused the guitar to become too heavy, and Paul's request was refused.<ref name=\"Duchossoir 1998\">{{cite book|last=Duchossoir|first=Andre|title=Gibson Electrics: The Classic Years|year=1998|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=0-7935-9210-0|pages=42\u201344}}</ref> Paul states that the original [[Gibson Les Paul Custom|Custom]] should have had the maple cap and the Goldtop was  to be all mahogany. The Custom did not appear on the market for another two years following the introduction of the Goldtop; it is possible that Gibson had planned a full model range of guitars (with a roll-out over the course of several years) at the time when initial specifications were being set. Les Paul's contributions to the guitar line bearing his name were more than cosmetic; for example, Paul specified that the guitar be offered in a gold finish, not only for flashiness, but to emphasize the high quality of the Gibson Les Paul instrument.<ref name=\"Duchossoir 1998\" /> Later Les Paul models included [[flame maple]] (tiger stripe) and [[quilt maple|\"quilted\" maple]] tops, again in contrast to the competing Fender line's range of car-like custom color finishes.\n\nThe 1952 Les Paul featured a mahogany body with a one-inch-thick maple cap, a mahogany neck with a rosewood fretboard, two [[P-90]] [[single coil]] pickups, and a one-piece, 'trapeze'-style bridge/tailpiece with strings fitted under (instead of over) a steel stop-bar.<ref group=\"note\">In the summer of 1952, Gibson Les Paul Goldtop was priced at US$209.</ref>\n\nThe guitar made its public debut when Paul used it onstage in June 1952 at the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount theatre]] in New York.

Called the Les Paul Custom, this black guitar with gold-plated hardware was dubbed the \"Black Beauty\". Various bridge and tailpiece designs were added in 1953 and 1954, including the popular [[Tune-o-matic]] bridge. The Goldtop and Custom models continued without significant changes until 1957. In 1957, P-90 pickups were no longer offered on Les Pauls. New [[humbucker]] pickups designed by [[Seth Lover]] in 1955 ({{US patent|2896491}}) debuted on Les Pauls in 1957. This innovation in pickups became the flagship pickup design most associated with Gibson. Many other guitar companies followed suit, outfitting their electrics with versions of the humbucking pickup.\n\n==={{vanchor|Sunburst failure and resurgence}} (1958\u20131968)===\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=horizontal\n | caption2 = 1959 Les Paul Standard Reissue\n | image2   = 2019 Gibson 1959 reissue.jpg |width2=107  \n}}\n{{multiple images|align=right|direction=horizontal\n |image1   = Fleetwood mac peter green 2.jpg|width1=114\n |caption1 = [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] (1970)\n |image2   = Jeff Beck 1968.jpg|width2=100\n |caption2 = [[Jeff Beck]] (1968)\n}}\nIn 1958, the Les Paul saw its first major design change. A new model, called the Standard, retained most features of the 1957 Goldtop. However, Standards featured a cherry-red sunburst finish. These guitars were priced higher than the Goldtop models, but lower than the Customs.  At this time, Gibson instruments were marketed toward an older, jazz-oriented audience rather than young burgeoning guitarists. As a result, over the three-year period of production, only c. 1,700 Standards were made.\n\nThese Les Pauls were considered to be too heavy and old-fashioned, and they initially did not find favor amongst guitarists. In 1961, Gibson stopped producing the traditional Les Paul in favor of a lighter redesign which was later called the [[Gibson SG|SG]]. The mid-1960s, however, brought a resurgence of interest in the Les Paul Standard. In 1964, The [[Rolling Stones]]' [[Keith Richards]] began using a sunburst, 1959 Les Paul Standard \u2013 becoming the first \"star-guitarist\" to play a Les Paul on the British scene.<ref name=Burrluck2007>{{cite journal|last=Burrluck|first=Dave|date=September 2007|title=The Keithburst Les Paul|journal=Guitarist Magazine|pages=55\u201358|id=|quote=}}</ref><ref name=\"firstpaul\">Bacon, Tony.

Les Paul designs were altered and a reinforced upper neck volute to decrease headstock breaks was added. Neck woods were changed from one-piece mahogany to a three-piece maple design. The body was also changed from one-piece mahogany with a maple top to multiple slabs of mahogany with multiple pieced maple tops. This is referred to as \"multipiece\" construction, and sometimes incorrectly referred to as a \"pancake\" body. The expression \"pancake body\" actually refers to a body made of a thin layer of maple sandwiched between two slabs of mahogany, with a maple cap. The grain of the maple was placed at 90 degrees to that of the mahogany. The \"pancake\"-like layers are clearly visible when looking at the edge of the guitar. This process is also known as \"crossbanding\", and was done to make use of less expensive and more readily available thinner mahogany. Crossbanding was phased out by 1977.\n\nIn this era, Gibson began experimenting with new models, such as the Les Paul Recording. This guitar was generally unpopular with guitarists because of its complex electronics. Less noticeable changes included, but were not limited to, optional maple fingerboards (added in 1976), pickup cavity shielding, and the crossover of the ABR1 Tune-o-matic bridge into the wide \"Nashville\" bridge. During the 1970s, the Les Paul body shape was incorporated into other Gibson models, including the [[Gibson S-1|S-1]], the [[Gibson Sonex|Sonex]], the [[Gibson L6-S|L6-S]], and other models that did not follow the classic Les Paul layout.\n\nIn January 1986, Gibson again changed ownership and began manufacturing a range of varied Les Paul models. The 1980s also saw the end to several design characteristics, including the volute and maple neck. However, because of consumer demand, the Gibson Les Paul guitar is available today in a wide array of choices, ranging from guitars equipped with modern digital electronics to classic re-issue models built to match the look and specifications of the guitar's earliest production runs from 1952 to 1960.\n\n{{as of|2017}}, Gibson offers several variations of the Les Paul guitar with differences in features, electronics and finishes. For example, the modern Standard offers split- coil pickups which offer a wider range of sounds. The 'Traditional' model offers more the more basic features of guitars available during the period 1950s to 1980s and the 'Classic' model offers yet other features. 'Special' and 'Studio' models have a more basic level of finish and Les Pauls are offered at different prices. These models are marketed as 'Gibson USA' guitars, capitalising on their American heritage.\n\nIn 1986, to respond to the high demand for vintage models, Gibson formed a Custom Shop division. Originally, the Custom Shop began producing accurate reproductions of early Les Pauls, as well as one-offs. Today, the Custom Shop produces numerous limited-run \"historic-spec\" models, as well as signature artist models. The first Custom Shop artist guitar was the 1996 Joe Perry Les Paul, and today, several artist models are offered \"reliced\" or \"aged\" models are made in the Custom Shop to replicate vintage models that have seen much use.\n\n=={{vanchor|Models}} and variations==\nThe post-1954 Les Paul guitar line included two models: the Classic (nicknamed the Goldtop), and the [[Gibson Les Paul Custom|Custom]] (which offered gold hardware and a more formal black finish). However, advancements in pickup, body, and hardware designs allowed the Les Paul to become a long-term series of electric solid-body guitars that targeted multiple price-points and market levels.\n\n==={{vanchor|Goldtop}} (1952\u20131958, 1968-present)===\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=horizontal\n| caption1 = 1952\u201353 Goldtop with trapeze bridge<ref group=\"note\">This guitar (1953 Goldtop exhibited at FUZZ Guitar Show 2008) was used by [[Carl Perkins]] on many of his early \"[[Sun Records]]\" Recordings</ref>\n| image1   = Gibson Les Paul 1953.jpg|width1=117\n| caption2 = 1953\u201355 Goldtop with [[stopbar]] bridge\n| image2   = Expo Pink Floyd - Les Paul.jpg|width2=104\n| caption3 = 1955\u201357 Goldtop with [[Tune-o-matic]] bridge and stopbar tailpiece\n| image3   = Gibson Les Paul Goldtop retrofit based on 1973 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe (SN 620310).jpg |width3=117\n| caption4 = 1957\u201358 Goldtop with [[PAF (pickup)|PAF pickups]]\n| image4   = Gibson Les Paul '57 Historic Reissue (2002).png |width4=117\n}}\nGoldtops, the first Les Paul model, were produced from 1952\u20131957. Early 1952 Les Pauls were not issued serial numbers, did not have bound fingerboards, and are considered by some as \"LP Model prototypes\". However, later 1952 Les Pauls were issued serial numbers and also came with bound fingerboards. The design scheme of some of these early models varied. For instance, some early Les Pauls were fitted with black covered P-90 pickups instead of the cream-colored plastic covers that are associated with this guitar. The weight and the tonal characteristics of the Goldtop Les Paul were largely due to the [[mahogany]] and [[maple]] construction.\n\nIn 1953, the trapeze tailpiece was dropped, and a new stopbar design was added. This design combined a pre-intonated bridge and tailpiece with two studs just behind the bridge pickup. This increased the sustain of the Goldtop noticeably; however, the intonation and string height adjustability were limited. A new design, the Tune-o-matic, replaced the stopbar in 1955. It consisted of a separate bridge and tailpiece attached directly to the top of the guitar, combining an easily adjustable bridge with a sustain-carrying tailpiece. This design has been used on most Les Pauls ever since. The tuners were produced by [[Kluson Manufacturing Company|Kluson]].\n\n==={{vanchor|Custom}} (1954\u20131960, 1968\u2013present)===\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal\n| caption1 = 1954 Custom with P90 and Alnico pickups\n| image1   = Gibson Les Paul 54 Custom.jpg |width1=67\n| <!-- image2   = Blank300.png |width2=10 -->\n| caption3 = 1960 Custom reissue with PAF pickups\n| image3   = Gibson Custom 50th Anniversary 1960 Les Paul Custom (clip).jpg |width3=79\n}}\n{{Main|Gibson Les Paul Custom}}\n\nThe Les Paul Custom features gold hardware, multilayer binding including the headstock, ebony fingerboard, real mother-of-pearl inlays and two or three-pickup layout. 1950s Customs were all-mahogany, rather than the mahogany-with-maple-cap of the Goldtop. The original Customs were fitted with a P-90 pickup in the bridge position and an Alnico V \"staple\" pickup in  the neck.

The traditional Les Paul Custom was discontinued in 1961 and its name transferred to the custom version of the then-new [[Gibson SG]].\n\nIn 1968, Gibson reintroduced the Les Paul Custom as a two-pickup-only model. The headstock angle was changed from 17 degrees to 14, and a wider headstock and a maple top (in lieu of the original 1953-1961 mahogany top construction) were added. White and two sunburst finish options were added to the color palette in 1974. Also new in 1974 was the optional TP-6 fine-tuner tailpiece, allowing for micro-adjustment of string tuning from the bridge. The mahogany neck was replaced with a three-piece maple neck in 1975 (though mahogany still saw limited use) with this change lasting until around 1982. Popular colors, such as wine red and \"silverburst,\" were added in the 1970s and '80s. Gibson currently produces several Custom models with various finishes and pickups.\n\n==={{vanchor|Standard}} (1958\u20131960, 1976\u2013present)===\n{{See also|Flame maple#Gibson Les Paul Standard|Burst 1958-1960 Gibson Les Paul Standard}}\n[[File:Paul McCartney on stage in Prague.jpg|left|upright|thumb|150px|[[Paul McCartney]] playing a 1960 left-handed cherryburst Les Paul]]\n[[File:Gibson Custom 50th Anniversary 1959 Les Paul Standard (2009) brighten.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Gibson Custom 50th Anniversary 1959 Les Paul Standard (2009)]]\nIn 1958, new Standard model retained most specifications of the 1957 Goldtop, including [[PAF (pickup)|PAF]] humbucker pickups, a maple top, and a [[tune-o-matic]] bridge with a stop tailpiece or [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece]].

To differentiate from the earlier Goldtop model, the new Les Paul was referred to as The Les Paul Standard. Specifications during 1958\u201360 varied from year to year and also from guitar to guitar. Typical 1958 Les Paul Standard necks had a thicker neck, thinner frets and lower fret height, which changed during the course of 1959 to develop into typical 1960 necks with a thinner cross-section and wider, higher frets.<ref name=VG2010 group=\"note\">{{citation|title=10 Most Valuable Guitars|journal=Vintage Guitar (2010)}}, mentioned on:{{citation|author=Paul Schille|date=Dec 17, 2010|title=Vintage Guitar Releases List of 10 Most Valuable Guitars|url=http://www.thegiggingmusician.com/2010/12/17/vintage-guitar-releases-list-of-10-most-valuable-guitars/|publisher=TheGiggingMusician.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102101615/http://www.thegiggingmusician.com/2010/12/17/vintage-guitar-releases-list-of-10-most-valuable-guitars/|archivedate=January 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Greenwood2011b group=\"note\" /> The cherry dye used on the 1958\u201359 models faded rapidly from ultraviolet light exposure, so in early 1960 Gibson switched to a new, fade-resistant formulation which was also less translucent and slightly more orange; this is sometimes called the \"tomato soup burst.\" Original production of the Standards lasted from 1958 to early 1961.

The Junior is characterized by its flat-top \"slab\" mahogany body, finished in sunburst. It had a single P-90 pickup, simple volume and tone controls, an unbound rosewood fingerboard with plain dot-shape [[position marker]]s, and a combination bridge/tailpiece unit similar to the Goldtop.\n\nIn 1955, Gibson launched the Les Paul TV model, which was identical to the Junior except for the name and a fashionable contemporary \"limed oak\" style finish, later more accurately named \"limed mahogany\". This natural wood finish with white grain filler often aged into a natural wood or dull yellow appearance, and eventually evolved into the opaque mustard yellow, popularly called \"TV yellow\". The model was not, as a popular myth says, to avoid glare from old TV cameras, but a modern look and a name to promote \"The Les Paul & Mary Ford Show\" then on television.\n\nGibson made a radical design change to their Junior and TV models in 1958: to accommodate player requests for more access to the top frets than the previous designs allowed, these electric guitar models were revamped with a new double-cutaway body shape.

In response, Gibson modified the Les Paul line. For 1961, the Les Paul was thinner and much lighter than earlier models, with two sharply pointed cutaways and a vibrato system. However, the redesign was done without Les Paul's knowledge, and he hated the design, so he asked Gibson to remove his name.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burrows|first=Terry|title=1001 Guitars To Dream of Playing Before Die|year=2013|publisher=Universe|isbn=978-0-7893-2701-7|page=262}}</ref> The single cutaway design retained the \"Les Paul\" name until 1963 when Les Paul's endorsement deal with Gibson ended. Without a contract, Gibson could no longer call its guitars \"Les Pauls', and it renamed them \"SGs\" (for \"Solid Guitars\").<ref>{{cite book|last=Freeth|first=Nick|title=The Complete Guitar Encyclopedia=2012|publisher=Parragon|isbn=978-1-4454-9313-8|page=56|date=September 7, 2012}}</ref>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n==={{vanchor|Deluxe}} (1968\u20131985)===\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=horizontal\n|caption1=1972 Deluxe &nbsp;with mini-humbuckers|width1=220\n|image1=1972 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe.jpg\n|caption2=1969 Deluxe|width2=118\n|image2=Gibson Les Paul Deluxe (SN 897292).jpg\n}}\n\nThe Deluxe was among the \"new\" 1968-1969 Les Pauls. This model featured \"mini-humbuckers\", also known as \"New York\" humbuckers, and did not initially prove popular. The mini-humbucker pickups fit into the pre-carved P-90 pickup cavity using an adaptor ring developed by Gibson in order to use a surplus supply of [[Epiphone]] mini-humbuckers. The Deluxe was introduced in late 1968 and helped to standardize production among Gibson's U.S.-built Les Pauls. The first incarnation of the Deluxe featured a one-piece body and slim three-piece neck. (It has been thought that some of these early \"one-piece\" bodies were actually leftovers from original 1950's Les Paul parts.) The multipiece body (a thin layer of maple on top of two layers of Honduran mahogany) arrived in 1969. In late 1969, a reinforcing neck volute was added. 1969 Deluxes feature the Gibson logo devoid of the dot over the \"i\" in Gibson. By late 1969/early 1970, the dot over the \"i\" had returned, plus a \"Made In USA\" stamp on the back of the headstock. Gibson produced 221 Deluxe Gold Top and other colors as specially-ordered guitars with full-size humbucker t-tops pickups between 1972 and 1974, and 1976 (179 in 1973, 28 in 1974, 9 in 1972 and 5 in 1976), is a Les Paul Standard pickup specification. These Gold Tops are quite rare to find today and are worth US$8,000 to US$10,000 in the collector's market, because they were the first guitars since the Gold Top 1958 fitted with humbucker pickups from the factory.\nUntil the end of the year 1974, 90% of the Gibson Les Paul Deluxe manufactured were Gold Top. New colors emerged from 1975, less valued than the Gold Top.  By 1975, the neck construction was changed from mahogany to maple, until the early 1980s, when the construction returned to mahogany. The body changed back to solid mahogany from the pancake design in late 1976 or early 1977. In 1985 the Gibson canceled the Deluxe model.\n\nAdrian Smith, of [[Iron Maiden]], uses a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Gold Top 1972, with the bridge pickup converted to a humbucker, and has been using it since joining [[Iron Maiden]] in 1980. [[Steve Lukather]], of Toto, owns a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Gold Top 1974, in the rare full-size humbucker format, which he plays live, in addition to a 1971 Deluxe Tobacco Sunburst with mini-humbuckers. [[Tom Scholz]], of Boston, has continually played a Deluxe Gold Top 1968 since the 1970s. [[Pete Townshend]] used Les Paul Deluxes onstage almost exclusively between 1973 and 1979, often with additional middle pickups.<ref>http://www.thewho.net/whotabs/gear/guitar/lpdeluxe.html</ref>\n\n[[Jimmy Page]], of [[Led Zeppelin]], used a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe 1969 Red, converted to humbuckers, during the 1970s, and reunion of 2007. [[Ace Frehley]], of Kiss, used a Deluxe Tobacco Sunburst 1973, also converted to humbuckers, in his first tours with the band. [[Vivian Campbell]], of [[Dio (band)|Dio]], used a Deluxe Black 1977, with a humbucker conversion, during his period in the band. \n\nScott Gorham and Brian Robertson, of [[Thin Lizzy]], also used Les Paul Deluxes in the 1970s (Brian converted his Deluxe Cherry Sunburst 1973 to humbuckers in 1977, and plays the guitar to this day). [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] has a Deluxe Cherry Sunburst 1975, converted to humbuckers, in its collection. [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] had a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Gold Top 1969 in his collection for more than 30 years, converted to humbuckers. It was sold for over U$$25,000 a few years ago.\n\n===Dark Fire===\n{{Infobox Guitar model|title=Gibson Dark Fire\n|image=\n|bgcolor=#FFFFFF\n|manufacturer=[[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]\n|period=2008\u20132010\n|bodytype=Solid, Single Cut\n|necktype=[[Set-in neck|Set-in]]\n|scale=24.75\"\n|woodbody=[[Mahogany]], [[Maple|Maple Top]]\n|woodneck=[[Mahogany]]\n|woodfingerboard=[[Ebony]]\n|bridge=[[Tune-o-matic]]\n|pickups=A Burstbucker 3 [[humbucker]] at the bridge, [[P-90]]H at the neck, and a [[Pick up (music technology)#Piezoelectric pickups|piezoelectric]] built into the bridge.\n|colors=Exclusive [[nitrocellulose]] finish consisting of dark red on the Maple body top; glossy finish on body top and headstock face, satin finish everywhere else.\n}}\nThe Gibson Dark Fire is a variant of the Les Paul. It was a second generation [[Gibson Robot Guitar|Robot Guitar]], using an updated version of the Powertune self-tuning system produced by [[Tronical Gmbh]]. The Dark Fire also introduced Gibson's Chameleon Tone Technology, a system consisting of onboard electronics designed to simulate various guitar tones. Additionally, the guitar included an [[Sound card#Professional soundcards (audio interfaces)|audio interface]] called the Robot Interface Pack or RIP.\n\n====Pickups====\nThe Dark Fire had one Burstbucker 3 humbucker in the bridge position, a [[P-90]]H at the neck, and a special Tronical-designed piezoelectric tune-o-matic sat in the place of the bridge. The Burstbucker 3 and P-90H were selected via the three-way selector switch. The piezoelectric could be activated via the MCK, blending the magnetic and piezoelectric together under a standard 1/4\" guitar cable. Gibson supplied a TRS stereo cable that allowed the piezo signal and the magnetic signal to be split between two different amps.\n\n==={{vanchor|Studio}} (1983\u2013present) ===\n{{See also|Gibson Les Paul Studio}}\n[[File:Gibson Les Paul Studio c.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Studio]]\n[[File:2001 Gibson Les Paul.jpg|thumb|right|130px|2001 Studio headstock]]\nThe Studio model was introduced in 1983, and is still in production. The guitar is intended for the studio musician; therefore, the design features of the \"Les Paul Studio\" are centered on optimal sound output and not on flashy appearance. This model retains only the elements of the Gibson Les Paul that contribute to tone and playability, including the carved maple top and standard mechanical and electronic hardware. However, the Studio design, until 2017, omits several stock Gibson ornamentations that do not affect sound quality, including body/neck binding. The first Studios from 1983 to 1986 were made with alder bodies rather than mahogany/maple. The current Studios come with a chambered mahogany body with either a maple or mahogany cap. The entry level Les Paul Studio \"faded\" has a weight relieved mahogany body and top and a satin finish. In 2018 were introduced neck binding and a pair of Gibson's most popular humbucking pickups, 57 Classic and 57 Classic+ and two push-pull pots. In order to guarantee the stability of the tuning and an excellent sustain were introduced the Grover tuners, the self-lubricating nut and the aluminium tune-o-matic bridge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/2018/USA/Les-Paul-Studio-2018.aspx|title=Les Paul Studio 2018}}</ref>\n\nGibson also offered the Studio in a \"standard\" model. This variant was adorned with neck and body binding, ebony fretboard and sunburst paint job. All Studios at the time had dot fretboard markers and a thinner body.\n\n===Memphis ES-Les Paul (2014\u20132016)===\n\nGibson released the Memphis ES-Les Paul in 2014. It is a semi-acoustic model with f-holes and most with two Alnico humbuckers.

Paul preferred his 1971 Gibson \"Recording\" model guitar, with different electronics and a one-piece mahogany body, and which, as an inveterate tinkerer and inventor, he had modified heavily to his liking over the years.

It featured two open-topped humbucker pickups, one with \"zebra coils\" (one white and one black bobbin). In 2009, Gibson released another Gary Moore signature guitar, the Gibson Gary Moore BFG Les Paul.

Its typical design features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top and a single [[cutaway (guitar)|cutaway]], a mahogany [[set-in neck]] with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and tone controls, and a [[stoptail bridge]], although variants exist.\n\nThe Les Paul was originally offered with a gold finish and two [[P-90]] pickups. In 1957, [[Humbucker|humbucking]] pickups were added, along with sunburst finishes in 1958. The sunburst 1958\u20131960 Les Paul \u2013 today one of the best-known electric guitar types in the world \u2013 was considered a failure,{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} with low production and sales. For 1961, the Les Paul was redesigned into what is now known as the [[Gibson SG]]. The original single-cutaway, carved top bodystyle was re-introduced in 1968. The Les Paul has been produced in many versions and editions since.  Along with [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender's]] [[Fender Telecaster|Telecaster]] and [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]], it was one of the first mass-produced electric solid-body guitars.

In reaction to market demand, Gibson Guitar president [[Ted McCarty]] brought guitarist [[Les Paul]] into the company as a consultant.\n\nLes Paul was a respected innovator who had been experimenting with guitar design for years. He had hand-built a solid-body prototype nicknamed \"The Log\", often suggested as the first solid-body [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] ever built. \"The Log\" was given its name from the pine block running through the middle of the guitar whose width and depth are a little more than the width of the fretboard; conventional hollow guitar sides or \"wings\" were added for shape. In 1945 or 1946, Paul had approached Gibson with \"The Log\" [[prototype]], but his design was rejected.<ref name=Wheeler1992>\n{{cite book|last=Wheeler|first=Tom|title=American Guitars|year=1992|publisher=Harper|isbn=0-06-273154-8|page=140}}</ref><ref name=Freeth2004>{{cite book|last=Freeth|first=Nick|author2=Charles Alexander|editor=Ray Bonds|title=The Illustrated Directory of Guitars|year=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble, Inc.|isbn=0-7607-6317-8|pages=290&ndash;293}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, McCarty and his team at Gibson began work on what would eventually become the Les Paul Model.

McCarty stated that design discussions with Les Paul were limited to the tailpiece and the fitting of a maple cap over the mahogany body for increased density and sustain, which Les Paul had requested reversed. However, this reversal would have caused the guitar to become too heavy, and Paul's request was refused.<ref name=\"Duchossoir 1998\">{{cite book|last=Duchossoir|first=Andre|title=Gibson Electrics: The Classic Years|year=1998|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=0-7935-9210-0|pages=42\u201344}}</ref> Paul states that the original [[Gibson Les Paul Custom|Custom]] should have had the maple cap and the Goldtop was  to be all mahogany. The Custom did not appear on the market for another two years following the introduction of the Goldtop; it is possible that Gibson had planned a full model range of guitars (with a roll-out over the course of several years) at the time when initial specifications were being set. Les Paul's contributions to the guitar line bearing his name were more than cosmetic; for example, Paul specified that the guitar be offered in a gold finish, not only for flashiness, but to emphasize the high quality of the Gibson Les Paul instrument.<ref name=\"Duchossoir 1998\" /> Later Les Paul models included [[flame maple]] (tiger stripe) and [[quilt maple|\"quilted\" maple]] tops, again in contrast to the competing Fender line's range of car-like custom color finishes.\n\nThe 1952 Les Paul featured a mahogany body with a one-inch-thick maple cap, a mahogany neck with a rosewood fretboard, two [[P-90]] [[single coil]] pickups, and a one-piece, 'trapeze'-style bridge/tailpiece with strings fitted under (instead of over) a steel stop-bar.<ref group=\"note\">In the summer of 1952, Gibson Les Paul Goldtop was priced at US$209.</ref>\n\nThe guitar made its public debut when Paul used it onstage in June 1952 at the [[Paramount Theatre (New York City)|Paramount theatre]] in New York. On July 24, 1952, at a special musicians clinic at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] hotel, it was previewed by prominent guitarists such as [[Tiger Haynes]], [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]], [[Mundell Lowe]], [[Tony Mottola]], and [[Billy Mure]].<ref name=\"Gibson Les Paul 2002. pg 21\">''50 Years of the Gibson Les Paul: Half a Century of the Greatest Electric Guitars'' by Tony Bacon.

Called the Les Paul Custom, this black guitar with gold-plated hardware was dubbed the \"Black Beauty\". Various bridge and tailpiece designs were added in 1953 and 1954, including the popular [[Tune-o-matic]] bridge. The Goldtop and Custom models continued without significant changes until 1957. In 1957, P-90 pickups were no longer offered on Les Pauls. New [[humbucker]] pickups designed by [[Seth Lover]] in 1955 ({{US patent|2896491}}) debuted on Les Pauls in 1957. This innovation in pickups became the flagship pickup design most associated with Gibson. Many other guitar companies followed suit, outfitting their electrics with versions of the humbucking pickup.\n\n==={{vanchor|Sunburst failure and resurgence}} (1958\u20131968)===\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=horizontal\n | caption2 = 1959 Les Paul Standard Reissue\n | image2   = 2019 Gibson 1959 reissue.jpg |width2=107  \n}}\n{{multiple images|align=right|direction=horizontal\n |image1   = Fleetwood mac peter green 2.jpg|width1=114\n |caption1 = [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]] (1970)\n |image2   = Jeff Beck 1968.jpg|width2=100\n |caption2 = [[Jeff Beck]] (1968)\n}}\nIn 1958, the Les Paul saw its first major design change. A new model, called the Standard, retained most features of the 1957 Goldtop. However, Standards featured a cherry-red sunburst finish. These guitars were priced higher than the Goldtop models, but lower than the Customs.  At this time, Gibson instruments were marketed toward an older, jazz-oriented audience rather than young burgeoning guitarists. As a result, over the three-year period of production, only c. 1,700 Standards were made.\n\nThese Les Pauls were considered to be too heavy and old-fashioned, and they initially did not find favor amongst guitarists. In 1961, Gibson stopped producing the traditional Les Paul in favor of a lighter redesign which was later called the [[Gibson SG|SG]]. The mid-1960s, however, brought a resurgence of interest in the Les Paul Standard.

Les Paul designs were altered and a reinforced upper neck volute to decrease headstock breaks was added. Neck woods were changed from one-piece mahogany to a three-piece maple design. The body was also changed from one-piece mahogany with a maple top to multiple slabs of mahogany with multiple pieced maple tops. This is referred to as \"multipiece\" construction, and sometimes incorrectly referred to as a \"pancake\" body. The expression \"pancake body\" actually refers to a body made of a thin layer of maple sandwiched between two slabs of mahogany, with a maple cap. The grain of the maple was placed at 90 degrees to that of the mahogany. The \"pancake\"-like layers are clearly visible when looking at the edge of the guitar. This process is also known as \"crossbanding\", and was done to make use of less expensive and more readily available thinner mahogany. Crossbanding was phased out by 1977.\n\nIn this era, Gibson began experimenting with new models, such as the Les Paul Recording. This guitar was generally unpopular with guitarists because of its complex electronics. Less noticeable changes included, but were not limited to, optional maple fingerboards (added in 1976), pickup cavity shielding, and the crossover of the ABR1 Tune-o-matic bridge into the wide \"Nashville\" bridge. During the 1970s, the Les Paul body shape was incorporated into other Gibson models, including the [[Gibson S-1|S-1]], the [[Gibson Sonex|Sonex]], the [[Gibson L6-S|L6-S]], and other models that did not follow the classic Les Paul layout.\n\nIn January 1986, Gibson again changed ownership and began manufacturing a range of varied Les Paul models. The 1980s also saw the end to several design characteristics, including the volute and maple neck. However, because of consumer demand, the Gibson Les Paul guitar is available today in a wide array of choices, ranging from guitars equipped with modern digital electronics to classic re-issue models built to match the look and specifications of the guitar's earliest production runs from 1952 to 1960.\n\n{{as of|2017}}, Gibson offers several variations of the Les Paul guitar with differences in features, electronics and finishes. For example, the modern Standard offers split- coil pickups which offer a wider range of sounds. The 'Traditional' model offers more the more basic features of guitars available during the period 1950s to 1980s and the 'Classic' model offers yet other features. 'Special' and 'Studio' models have a more basic level of finish and Les Pauls are offered at different prices. These models are marketed as 'Gibson USA' guitars, capitalising on their American heritage.\n\nIn 1986, to respond to the high demand for vintage models, Gibson formed a Custom Shop division. Originally, the Custom Shop began producing accurate reproductions of early Les Pauls, as well as one-offs. Today, the Custom Shop produces numerous limited-run \"historic-spec\" models, as well as signature artist models. The first Custom Shop artist guitar was the 1996 Joe Perry Les Paul, and today, several artist models are offered \"reliced\" or \"aged\" models are made in the Custom Shop to replicate vintage models that have seen much use.\n\n=={{vanchor|Models}} and variations==\nThe post-1954 Les Paul guitar line included two models: the Classic (nicknamed the Goldtop), and the [[Gibson Les Paul Custom|Custom]] (which offered gold hardware and a more formal black finish). However, advancements in pickup, body, and hardware designs allowed the Les Paul to become a long-term series of electric solid-body guitars that targeted multiple price-points and market levels.\n\n==={{vanchor|Goldtop}} (1952\u20131958, 1968-present)===\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=horizontal\n| caption1 = 1952\u201353 Goldtop with trapeze bridge<ref group=\"note\">This guitar (1953 Goldtop exhibited at FUZZ Guitar Show 2008) was used by [[Carl Perkins]] on many of his early \"[[Sun Records]]\" Recordings</ref>\n| image1   = Gibson Les Paul 1953.jpg|width1=117\n| caption2 = 1953\u201355 Goldtop with [[stopbar]] bridge\n| image2   = Expo Pink Floyd - Les Paul.jpg|width2=104\n| caption3 = 1955\u201357 Goldtop with [[Tune-o-matic]] bridge and stopbar tailpiece\n| image3   = Gibson Les Paul Goldtop retrofit based on 1973 Gibson Les Paul Deluxe (SN 620310).jpg |width3=117\n| caption4 = 1957\u201358 Goldtop with [[PAF (pickup)|PAF pickups]]\n| image4   = Gibson Les Paul '57 Historic Reissue (2002).png |width4=117\n}}\nGoldtops, the first Les Paul model, were produced from 1952\u20131957. Early 1952 Les Pauls were not issued serial numbers, did not have bound fingerboards, and are considered by some as \"LP Model prototypes\". However, later 1952 Les Pauls were issued serial numbers and also came with bound fingerboards. The design scheme of some of these early models varied. For instance, some early Les Pauls were fitted with black covered P-90 pickups instead of the cream-colored plastic covers that are associated with this guitar. The weight and the tonal characteristics of the Goldtop Les Paul were largely due to the [[mahogany]] and [[maple]] construction.\n\nIn 1953, the trapeze tailpiece was dropped, and a new stopbar design was added. This design combined a pre-intonated bridge and tailpiece with two studs just behind the bridge pickup. This increased the sustain of the Goldtop noticeably; however, the intonation and string height adjustability were limited. A new design, the Tune-o-matic, replaced the stopbar in 1955. It consisted of a separate bridge and tailpiece attached directly to the top of the guitar, combining an easily adjustable bridge with a sustain-carrying tailpiece. This design has been used on most Les Pauls ever since. The tuners were produced by [[Kluson Manufacturing Company|Kluson]].\n\n==={{vanchor|Custom}} (1954\u20131960, 1968\u2013present)===\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal\n| caption1 = 1954 Custom with P90 and Alnico pickups\n| image1   = Gibson Les Paul 54 Custom.jpg |width1=67\n| <!-- image2   = Blank300.png |width2=10 -->\n| caption3 = 1960 Custom reissue with PAF pickups\n| image3   = Gibson Custom 50th Anniversary 1960 Les Paul Custom (clip).jpg |width3=79\n}}\n{{Main|Gibson Les Paul Custom}}\n\nThe Les Paul Custom features gold hardware, multilayer binding including the headstock, ebony fingerboard, real mother-of-pearl inlays and two or three-pickup layout. 1950s Customs were all-mahogany, rather than the mahogany-with-maple-cap of the Goldtop. The original Customs were fitted with a P-90 pickup in the bridge position and an Alnico V \"staple\" pickup in  the neck.

The traditional Les Paul Custom was discontinued in 1961 and its name transferred to the custom version of the then-new [[Gibson SG]].\n\nIn 1968, Gibson reintroduced the Les Paul Custom as a two-pickup-only model. The headstock angle was changed from 17 degrees to 14, and a wider headstock and a maple top (in lieu of the original 1953-1961 mahogany top construction) were added. White and two sunburst finish options were added to the color palette in 1974. Also new in 1974 was the optional TP-6 fine-tuner tailpiece, allowing for micro-adjustment of string tuning from the bridge. The mahogany neck was replaced with a three-piece maple neck in 1975 (though mahogany still saw limited use) with this change lasting until around 1982. Popular colors, such as wine red and \"silverburst,\" were added in the 1970s and '80s. Gibson currently produces several Custom models with various finishes and pickups.\n\n==={{vanchor|Standard}} (1958\u20131960, 1976\u2013present)===\n{{See also|Flame maple#Gibson Les Paul Standard|Burst 1958-1960 Gibson Les Paul Standard}}\n[[File:Paul McCartney on stage in Prague.jpg|left|upright|thumb|150px|[[Paul McCartney]] playing a 1960 left-handed cherryburst Les Paul]]\n[[File:Gibson Custom 50th Anniversary 1959 Les Paul Standard (2009) brighten.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Gibson Custom 50th Anniversary 1959 Les Paul Standard (2009)]]\nIn 1958, new Standard model retained most specifications of the 1957 Goldtop, including [[PAF (pickup)|PAF]] humbucker pickups, a maple top, and a [[tune-o-matic]] bridge with a stop tailpiece or [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece]]. The gold color used since 1952 was replaced by a cherry-red version of the Sunburst finish long used on Gibson's flat-top and archtop acoustic and hollow electric guitars. Since the maple cap was now visible, tops were made either with a solid \"plaintop\" piece of maple or two bookmatched pieces of figured (curly or quilted) maple. To differentiate from the earlier Goldtop model, the new Les Paul was referred to as The Les Paul Standard. Specifications during 1958\u201360 varied from year to year and also from guitar to guitar. Typical 1958 Les Paul Standard necks had a thicker neck, thinner frets and lower fret height, which changed during the course of 1959 to develop into typical 1960 necks with a thinner cross-section and wider, higher frets.<ref name=VG2010 group=\"note\">{{citation|title=10 Most Valuable Guitars|journal=Vintage Guitar (2010)}}, mentioned on:{{citation|author=Paul Schille|date=Dec 17, 2010|title=Vintage Guitar Releases List of 10 Most Valuable Guitars|url=http://www.thegiggingmusician.com/2010/12/17/vintage-guitar-releases-list-of-10-most-valuable-guitars/|publisher=TheGiggingMusician.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102101615/http://www.thegiggingmusician.com/2010/12/17/vintage-guitar-releases-list-of-10-most-valuable-guitars/|archivedate=January 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=Greenwood2011b group=\"note\" /> The cherry dye used on the 1958\u201359 models faded rapidly from ultraviolet light exposure, so in early 1960 Gibson switched to a new, fade-resistant formulation which was also less translucent and slightly more orange; this is sometimes called the \"tomato soup burst.\" Original production of the Standards lasted from 1958 to early 1961.

The Junior is characterized by its flat-top \"slab\" mahogany body, finished in sunburst. It had a single P-90 pickup, simple volume and tone controls, an unbound rosewood fingerboard with plain dot-shape [[position marker]]s, and a combination bridge/tailpiece unit similar to the Goldtop.\n\nIn 1955, Gibson launched the Les Paul TV model, which was identical to the Junior except for the name and a fashionable contemporary \"limed oak\" style finish, later more accurately named \"limed mahogany\". This natural wood finish with white grain filler often aged into a natural wood or dull yellow appearance, and eventually evolved into the opaque mustard yellow, popularly called \"TV yellow\". The model was not, as a popular myth says, to avoid glare from old TV cameras, but a modern look and a name to promote \"The Les Paul & Mary Ford Show\" then on television.\n\nGibson made a radical design change to their Junior and TV models in 1958: to accommodate player requests for more access to the top frets than the previous designs allowed, these electric guitar models were revamped with a new double-cutaway body shape. In addition, Juniors were now available with a cherry red finish, while the re-shaped TV adopted a more yellow-tinged finish.\n\n==={{vanchor|Special}} (1955\u20131960)===\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=horizontal\n|caption1=1956 Les Paul Special Singlecut in TV Yellow\n|image1  =Epiphone Les Paul Special Singlecut TV Yellow body (modified as 1956 stopbar model).jpg |width1=105\n|caption2=1960 SG Special (''Les Paul Special Doublecut'')\n|image2  =1960 Les Paul Special Doublecut.jpg |width2=93\n|caption3=Recent Les Paul Special Faded <!-- in TV Yellow -->\n|image3  =Gibson Les Paul Special Faded TV Yellow - old speed knobs were swapped with SG Top Hat knobs.jpg |width3=53\n}}\n{{Main|Gibson Les Paul Special|Gibson Les Paul Doublecut}}\nThe Les Paul Special was released in 1955, featuring a slab body, two soapbar P-90 single coil pickups, and was finished in a color similar to TV Yellow (but not called a TV model).\n\nIn 1959, the Special was given the same new double-cutaway body shape as the Junior and the TV received in 1958.

This weakened the joint to the point that the neck could break after only moderate handling. The problem was soon resolved when Gibson designers moved the neck pickup farther down the body, producing a stronger joint and eliminating the breakage problem.\n\n=== The&nbsp;Paul (1978\u20131982) ===\n[[File:Gibson the Paul Electric Guitar (edit1 clip2).jpg|thumb|100px|{{nowrap|Gibson The Paul}}]]\n{{See also|Gibson The Paul}}\n\nA single sharp cutaway Les Paul-style walnut body, set walnut neck, 22-fret ebony fingerboard with pearl dot inlays, walnut&nbsp;[[headstock]]&nbsp;overlay with gold Gibson logo (1978-1981) or Gibson logo branded into the headstock (Firebrand, 1981-1982), three-per-side tuners, tune-o-matic bridge, stop tailpiece, two exposed humbucker pickups, four knobs (two volume, two tone), three-way pickup switch, chrome hardware, available in Natural Walnut finish, 24.75 in. scale, 1.6875 in. nut width, mfg. 1978-1982.

In response, Gibson modified the Les Paul line. For 1961, the Les Paul was thinner and much lighter than earlier models, with two sharply pointed cutaways and a vibrato system. However, the redesign was done without Les Paul's knowledge, and he hated the design, so he asked Gibson to remove his name.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burrows|first=Terry|title=1001 Guitars To Dream of Playing Before Die|year=2013|publisher=Universe|isbn=978-0-7893-2701-7|page=262}}</ref> The single cutaway design retained the \"Les Paul\" name until 1963 when Les Paul's endorsement deal with Gibson ended.

This model featured \"mini-humbuckers\", also known as \"New York\" humbuckers, and did not initially prove popular. The mini-humbucker pickups fit into the pre-carved P-90 pickup cavity using an adaptor ring developed by Gibson in order to use a surplus supply of [[Epiphone]] mini-humbuckers. The Deluxe was introduced in late 1968 and helped to standardize production among Gibson's U.S.-built Les Pauls. The first incarnation of the Deluxe featured a one-piece body and slim three-piece neck. (It has been thought that some of these early \"one-piece\" bodies were actually leftovers from original 1950's Les Paul parts.) The multipiece body (a thin layer of maple on top of two layers of Honduran mahogany) arrived in 1969. In late 1969, a reinforcing neck volute was added. 1969 Deluxes feature the Gibson logo devoid of the dot over the \"i\" in Gibson. By late 1969/early 1970, the dot over the \"i\" had returned, plus a \"Made In USA\" stamp on the back of the headstock. Gibson produced 221 Deluxe Gold Top and other colors as specially-ordered guitars with full-size humbucker t-tops pickups between 1972 and 1974, and 1976 (179 in 1973, 28 in 1974, 9 in 1972 and 5 in 1976), is a Les Paul Standard pickup specification. These Gold Tops are quite rare to find today and are worth US$8,000 to US$10,000 in the collector's market, because they were the first guitars since the Gold Top 1958 fitted with humbucker pickups from the factory.\nUntil the end of the year 1974, 90% of the Gibson Les Paul Deluxe manufactured were Gold Top. New colors emerged from 1975, less valued than the Gold Top.  By 1975, the neck construction was changed from mahogany to maple, until the early 1980s, when the construction returned to mahogany. The body changed back to solid mahogany from the pancake design in late 1976 or early 1977. In 1985 the Gibson canceled the Deluxe model.\n\nAdrian Smith, of [[Iron Maiden]], uses a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Gold Top 1972, with the bridge pickup converted to a humbucker, and has been using it since joining [[Iron Maiden]] in 1980. [[Steve Lukather]], of Toto, owns a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Gold Top 1974, in the rare full-size humbucker format, which he plays live, in addition to a 1971 Deluxe Tobacco Sunburst with mini-humbuckers. [[Tom Scholz]], of Boston, has continually played a Deluxe Gold Top 1968 since the 1970s.

Additionally, the guitar included an [[Sound card#Professional soundcards (audio interfaces)|audio interface]] called the Robot Interface Pack or RIP.\n\n====Pickups====\nThe Dark Fire had one Burstbucker 3 humbucker in the bridge position, a [[P-90]]H at the neck, and a special Tronical-designed piezoelectric tune-o-matic sat in the place of the bridge. The Burstbucker 3 and P-90H were selected via the three-way selector switch. The piezoelectric could be activated via the MCK, blending the magnetic and piezoelectric together under a standard 1/4\" guitar cable. Gibson supplied a TRS stereo cable that allowed the piezo signal and the magnetic signal to be split between two different amps.\n\n==={{vanchor|Studio}} (1983\u2013present) ===\n{{See also|Gibson Les Paul Studio}}\n[[File:Gibson Les Paul Studio c.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Studio]]\n[[File:2001 Gibson Les Paul.jpg|thumb|right|130px|2001 Studio headstock]]\nThe Studio model was introduced in 1983, and is still in production. The guitar is intended for the studio musician; therefore, the design features of the \"Les Paul Studio\" are centered on optimal sound output and not on flashy appearance. This model retains only the elements of the Gibson Les Paul that contribute to tone and playability, including the carved maple top and standard mechanical and electronic hardware. However, the Studio design, until 2017, omits several stock Gibson ornamentations that do not affect sound quality, including body/neck binding. The first Studios from 1983 to 1986 were made with alder bodies rather than mahogany/maple. The current Studios come with a chambered mahogany body with either a maple or mahogany cap. The entry level Les Paul Studio \"faded\" has a weight relieved mahogany body and top and a satin finish. In 2018 were introduced neck binding and a pair of Gibson's most popular humbucking pickups, 57 Classic and 57 Classic+ and two push-pull pots. In order to guarantee the stability of the tuning and an excellent sustain were introduced the Grover tuners, the self-lubricating nut and the aluminium tune-o-matic bridge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/2018/USA/Les-Paul-Studio-2018.aspx|title=Les Paul Studio 2018}}</ref>\n\nGibson also offered the Studio in a \"standard\" model. This variant was adorned with neck and body binding, ebony fretboard and sunburst paint job. All Studios at the time had dot fretboard markers and a thinner body.\n\n===Memphis ES-Les Paul (2014\u20132016)===\n\nGibson released the Memphis ES-Les Paul in 2014.

However, several witnesses testified that the term \"Les Paul\" denotes character in a guitar rather than a particular guitar model. The court also found it aggravating that Gibson had used Les Paul in the plural form and that the importer of Gibson guitars had used Les Paul as a common noun.

Today travel trailers are classified as a type of RV along with [[motorhome]]s, [[#Fifth-wheel trailers|fifth-wheel trailers]], [[Popup camper|pop-up trailer]]s, and [[truck camper]]s.\n\nSmaller travel trailers and [[Popup camper|pop-ups]] are still made with touring in mind. These generally are less than {{convert|18|ft|m}} long and contain simple amenities. By design, they are lightweight and quick to set up or prepare for travel. Most weigh less than {{convert|3000|lb|kg}} [[Much Does A Pop Up Camper Weight On Average|https://www.rvingknowhow.com/average-pop-up-camper-weight/]]and can be towed with a large car or small truck depending upon its [[towing capacity]]. Lightweight pop-up trailers weighing less than {{convert|700|lb|kg}}, such as the Combi-camper and Kamparoo can be towed even by small economy cars. Some exceptionally light travel trailers can be pulled by motorcycle or even bicycle.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=S.A.|title=Bike Campers: 12 Mini Mobile Homes for Nomadic Cyclists|url=http://weburbanist.com/2012/10/15/bike-campers-12-mini-mobile-homes-for-nomadic-cyclists/|website=WebUrbanist|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref> Fiberglass body construction entered the U.S. scene in 1971 with the introduction of the first U.S.-produced mini travel trailer, called the Playpac.\n\nThe Playpac, invented by Steven Whysel, was the answer to the needs of the growing horde of VW \"Bug\" and other small-car owners who wanted a hard-shelled camper, light enough to be pulled by a small car. It came with a private water closet, shower, and the ability to sleep six. Its ultramodern aerodynamic styling and domed skylight by the modernist industrial designer Toshihiko Sakow made it an instant hit. It was short-lived, however (1971\u20131973), as the first [[Arab Oil Embargo]] and the ensuing major slow-down of RV sales caused it to cease operations. The Boler travel trailer, was developed in Canada in 1968, soon joined the Playpac in the U.S. fiberglass light-weight class. The Hunter and Amerigo travel trailers were also on the scene by then.\n\nMid-range travel trailers are {{convert|18|to|25|ft|m}} long, can weigh {{convert|5000|lb|kg}} or more, and are generally towed with compact pickup trucks and SUVs. They have most of the amenities of the larger travel trailers, but sleep fewer people.\n\n[[Image:AirstreamTrailer.jpg|thumb|An [[Airstream]] travel trailer]]\nLarger travel trailers are made with the seasonal or full-time user in mind. These generally range from {{convert|25|to|40|ft|m}} long and contain all the comforts of a luxury condominium. These amenity-laden models can reach {{convert|12000|lb|kg}} or more, requiring a purpose-built tow vehicle, highway tractor or large truck or [[SUV]]. While trailers may weigh in even above that, most long-bed [[Pickup truck|pickups]] have a maximum tow-weight of {{convert|15500|lb|kg}}. Multiple televisions and air conditioners are common in units of this size. Slide-out rooms and screen porches add to [[livability]]. By law,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} travel trailers are limited to {{convert|400|ft2|m2}} of living area, and many models offer exactly that plus any optional slide-outs.<!--Which means they violate the law, no...?-->\n\nWith all of the disincentives inherent in municipal zoning bylaws and building codes to affordable, ecological (off-grid) and compact housing solutions, travel-trailers offer a possibility for those considering an ecological full-time home or seasonal cottage. Travel-trailers are often acceptable on flood-plains, areas outside of urban growth limits, etc. where regular buildings are not allowed. Among the virtues of a [[trailer park]] are its light infrastructure, low [[ecological footprint]], minimal land disturbance, abundant permeable surfaces (for stormwater drainage), and ease of site restoration.\n\nSome specialized brands of trailer, such as the hi-lo trailer, have an upper half (slightly larger than the lower half) that can be folded down over the lower half to a total height of about five feet for reduced [[wind resistance]] during travel; these otherwise contain everything other travel trailers have (except for a full-height closet).\n\n[[Image:KZHybridTrailer-2009-12-08.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Recreational vehicle#Hybrid trailer|hybrid]] travel trailer]]\n\nAn innovation in travel trailers is the [[Recreational vehicle#Hybrid trailer|hybrid]] travel trailer, combining the features of a pop-up and a hard-sided trailer. In its camping configuration, one or more bunks fold down from the side with canvas tent covers. When travelling, the bunks fold up, leaving four hard sides. Larger models allow the hybrid travel trailer to be used while \"turtled\", that is with the sides up. The primary advantage of a hybrid travel trailer is it offers a greater space-to-weight ratio. A disadvantage is the tent ends are not insulated and subject to heat loss and condensation.\n\nIn the United States, it is generally illegal for passengers to ride in a travel trailer, while in motion,<ref name=CAlaws>\"[[California]]: RV Road Laws\" (and for travel trailers and campers),\nLiz Curtis, ''RV Advice'', 2005, RVadvice.com webpage:\n[http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/CA.html RVadvice-CA-RoadLaws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019010247/http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/CA.html |date=19 October 2006 }}.</ref><ref name=TXlaws>\"[[Texas]]: RV Road Laws\" (and for travel trailers and campers),\nLiz Curtis, ''RV Advice'', 2005, RVadvice.com webpage:\n[http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/TX.html RVadvice-TX-RoadLaws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019010636/http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/TX.html |date=19 October 2006 }}:\npassengers allowed only in camper (not travel trailer).</ref><ref name=NYlaws>\"[[New York (state)|New York]]: RV Road Laws\" (and for travel trailers and campers),\nLiz Curtis, ''RV Advice'', 2005, RVadvice.com webpage:\n[http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/NY.html RVadvice-NY-RoadLaws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019010553/http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/NY.html |date=19 October 2006 }}:\npassengers allowed only in camper (not travel trailer).</ref><ref name=ALlaws>\"[[Alabama]]: RV Road Laws\" (and for travel trailers and campers),\nLiz Curtis, ''RV Advice'', 2005, RVadvice.com webpage:\n[http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/AL.html RVadvice-AL-RoadLaws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019010500/http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/AL.html |date=19 October 2006 }}:\npassengers allowed only in camper (not travel trailer).</ref><ref name=FLlaws>\"[[Florida]]: RV Road Laws\" (and for travel trailers and campers),\nLiz Curtis, ''RV Advice'', 2005, RVadvice.com webpage:\n[http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/FL.html RVadvice-FL-RoadLaws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019010622/http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/FL.html |date=19 October 2006 }}:\npassengers allowed only in camper (not travel trailer).</ref> unlike horse-drawn trailers and coaches.

The special hitch used for [[Fifth wheel coupling|fifth-wheels]] is a smaller version of the one used on [[Semi-trailer truck|18-wheeler trucks]] and can be connected by simply driving (backing) the tow vehicle under the trailer. Fifth wheel trailers are popular with full-time recreational vehicle enthusiasts, who often live in them for several months in one place, using their pickup truck tow vehicle for local errands. A fifth wheel trailer tows more securely than a traditional travel trailer because the hitch weight sits directly over the pickup truck's rear axle/tires. Since part of a fifth wheel sits in the bed of the pickup, it reduces the overall length of the vehicle/trailer package while allowing the same room as a comparable length travel trailer. Additionally, the hitch's location in the pickup's bed reduces the risk of [[jackknifing]] and allows for more maneuverability when backing. Because of the greater room available on the roads in North America, these vehicles are more popular in the United States and Canada than in Europe or other parts of the world. For uneven terrain a [[Trailer (vehicle)#Fifth wheel and gooseneck|gooseneck hitch]] is an option to fifth-wheel.\n\nThe downside is that the hitch takes up room in the pickup truck's cargo bed regardless of whether the trailer is hitched or not. The hitch can be unbolted from the bed but this takes a lot more time and effort than the unhitch operation.\n\n===Off-road trailers===\nOff-road travel trailers, also called 4x4 trailers, tentrax,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.4wdandsportutility.com/features/0206_4wd_tentrax_trailers_product_review/viewall.html |title=Tentrax Trailers - Product Review |date=June 2002 |work=4 Wheel Drive magazine |publisher=4 Wheel Drive, Source Interlink Media |accessdate=20 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430015644/http://www.4wdandsportutility.com/features/0206_4wd_tentrax_trailers_product_review/viewall.html |archive-date=30 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and jeep trailers, are built specifically for exploring the extreme backcountry without having the restriction of paved highways or gravel roads.

Half living area and half [[garage (residential)|garage]], these trailers allow \"toys\" to be brought to the countryside. A folding rear ramp give access for motorcycles, [[all-terrain vehicle]]s, [[personal watercraft]] or racecars. A generator provides power for the equipment.\n\n===Double-decker trailers===\n\nA 'double-decker trailer' is a two-level travel trailer. When traveling the trailer is only as high as a regular trailer, but when set up it increases in height to two full levels. Built by Jexcar and others, they are often used in motion picture production as portable dressing rooms.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n[[File:Tabbert Comtesse.JPG|thumb|High-end German made caravan from {{Interlanguage link multi|Tabbert|de|3=Knaus Tabbert}}.]]\n\nThe National Caravan Council estimates that the caravan industry which includes [[campervan|motorhomes]], touring caravans (caravans designed to be hitched to a car and towed to a site) and static caravans and mobile homes (caravans designed to be transported to a permanent site, where they are anchored to the ground) is now worth over \u00a31bn (\u20ac1.5bn/[[United States dollar|US$]]1.7bn) to the [[UK|British]] economy alone with the manufacture of caravans worth in excess of \u00a3650m (\u20ac975bn/[[United States dollar|US$]]1.1bn). The growth in popularity of caravanning has been enhanced by improvements in caravan quality and caravan site facilities, making caravan holidays possible at any time of the year.\n\nThere are two main organisations that many caravanners join in the United Kingdom, the [[Caravan and Motorhome Club]], established in 1907, and the [[Camping and Caravanning Club]], established in 1901. Both clubs offer a range of services including exclusive club sites, preferential rates, advice, services such as insurance and community activities including regional and national rallies.\n\nIn the UK Caravan Insurance is not a compulsory addition, but is however recommended due to its levels of speciality cover.\n\nUnder tax regulations, caravans are considered wasting chattel and are exempt from [[capital gains tax]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Principles of Taxation|publisher=ICAEW|isbn=978-1-78363-462-0|page=182}}</ref>\n\n==Australia==\n[[File:Custom camper.jpg|thumb|right|Custom camper trailer]]\n[[Image:1956 Propert 'Trailaway' Touring Caravan.jpg|thumb|1956 Propert 'Trailaway' Touring Caravan at the [[National Museum of Australia]].]]\n\nIn Australia, camper trailers are common alongside the traditional caravan.

Today travel trailers are classified as a type of RV along with [[motorhome]]s, [[#Fifth-wheel trailers|fifth-wheel trailers]], [[Popup camper|pop-up trailer]]s, and [[truck camper]]s.\n\nSmaller travel trailers and [[Popup camper|pop-ups]] are still made with touring in mind. These generally are less than {{convert|18|ft|m}} long and contain simple amenities. By design, they are lightweight and quick to set up or prepare for travel. Most weigh less than {{convert|3000|lb|kg}} and can be towed with a large car or small truck depending upon its [[towing capacity]]. Lightweight pop-up trailers weighing less than {{convert|700|lb|kg}}, such as the Combi-camper and Kamparoo can be towed even by small economy cars. Some exceptionally light travel trailers can be pulled by motorcycle or even bicycle.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=S.A.|title=Bike Campers: 12 Mini Mobile Homes for Nomadic Cyclists|url=http://weburbanist.com/2012/10/15/bike-campers-12-mini-mobile-homes-for-nomadic-cyclists/|website=WebUrbanist|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref> Fiberglass body construction entered the U.S. scene in 1971 with the introduction of the first U.S.-produced mini travel trailer, called the Playpac.\n\nThe Playpac, invented by Steven Whysel, was the answer to the needs of the growing horde of VW \"Bug\" and other small-car owners who wanted a hard-shelled camper, light enough to be pulled by a small car. It came with a private water closet, shower, and the ability to sleep six. Its ultramodern aerodynamic styling and domed skylight by the modernist industrial designer Toshihiko Sakow made it an instant hit. It was short-lived, however (1971\u20131973), as the first [[Arab Oil Embargo]] and the ensuing major slow-down of RV sales caused it to cease operations. The Boler travel trailer, was developed in Canada in 1968, soon joined the Playpac in the U.S. fiberglass light-weight class. The Hunter and Amerigo travel trailers were also on the scene by then.\n\nMid-range travel trailers are {{convert|18|to|25|ft|m}} long, can weigh {{convert|5000|lb|kg}} or more, and are generally towed with compact pickup trucks and SUVs. They have most of the amenities of the larger travel trailers, but sleep fewer people.\n\n[[Image:AirstreamTrailer.jpg|thumb|An [[Airstream]] travel trailer]]\nLarger travel trailers are made with the seasonal or full-time user in mind. These generally range from {{convert|25|to|40|ft|m}} long and contain all the comforts of a luxury condominium. These amenity-laden models can reach {{convert|12000|lb|kg}} or more, requiring a purpose-built tow vehicle, highway tractor or large truck or [[SUV]]. While trailers may weigh in even above that, most long-bed [[Pickup truck|pickups]] have a maximum tow-weight of {{convert|15500|lb|kg}}. Multiple televisions and air conditioners are common in units of this size. Slide-out rooms and screen porches add to [[livability]]. By law,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} travel trailers are limited to {{convert|400|ft2|m2}} of living area, and many models offer exactly that plus any optional slide-outs.<!--Which means they violate the law, no...?-->\n\nWith all of the disincentives inherent in municipal zoning bylaws and building codes to affordable, ecological (off-grid) and compact housing solutions, travel-trailers offer a possibility for those considering an ecological full-time home or seasonal cottage. Travel-trailers are often acceptable on flood-plains, areas outside of urban growth limits, etc. where regular buildings are not allowed. Among the virtues of a [[trailer park]] are its light infrastructure, low [[ecological footprint]], minimal land disturbance, abundant permeable surfaces (for stormwater drainage), and ease of site restoration.\n\nSome specialized brands of trailer, such as the hi-lo trailer, have an upper half (slightly larger than the lower half) that can be folded down over the lower half to a total height of about five feet for reduced [[wind resistance]] during travel; these otherwise contain everything other travel trailers have (except for a full-height closet).\n\n[[Image:KZHybridTrailer-2009-12-08.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Recreational vehicle#Hybrid trailer|hybrid]] travel trailer]]\n\nAn innovation in travel trailers is the [[Recreational vehicle#Hybrid trailer|hybrid]] travel trailer, combining the features of a pop-up and a hard-sided trailer. In its camping configuration, one or more bunks fold down from the side with canvas tent covers. When travelling, the bunks fold up, leaving four hard sides. Larger models allow the hybrid travel trailer to be used while \"turtled\", that is with the sides up. The primary advantage of a hybrid travel trailer is it offers a greater space-to-weight ratio. A disadvantage is the tent ends are not insulated and subject to heat loss and condensation.\n\nIn the United States, it is generally illegal for passengers to ride in a travel trailer, while in motion,<ref name=CAlaws>\"[[California]]: RV Road Laws\" (and for travel trailers and campers),\nLiz Curtis, ''RV Advice'', 2005, RVadvice.com webpage:\n[http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/CA.html RVadvice-CA-RoadLaws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019010247/http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/CA.html |date=19 October 2006 }}.</ref><ref name=TXlaws>\"[[Texas]]: RV Road Laws\" (and for travel trailers and campers),\nLiz Curtis, ''RV Advice'', 2005, RVadvice.com webpage:\n[http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/TX.html RVadvice-TX-RoadLaws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019010636/http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/TX.html |date=19 October 2006 }}:\npassengers allowed only in camper (not travel trailer).</ref><ref name=NYlaws>\"[[New York (state)|New York]]: RV Road Laws\" (and for travel trailers and campers),\nLiz Curtis, ''RV Advice'', 2005, RVadvice.com webpage:\n[http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/NY.html RVadvice-NY-RoadLaws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019010553/http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/NY.html |date=19 October 2006 }}:\npassengers allowed only in camper (not travel trailer).</ref><ref name=ALlaws>\"[[Alabama]]: RV Road Laws\" (and for travel trailers and campers),\nLiz Curtis, ''RV Advice'', 2005, RVadvice.com webpage:\n[http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/AL.html RVadvice-AL-RoadLaws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019010500/http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/AL.html |date=19 October 2006 }}:\npassengers allowed only in camper (not travel trailer).</ref><ref name=FLlaws>\"[[Florida]]: RV Road Laws\" (and for travel trailers and campers),\nLiz Curtis, ''RV Advice'', 2005, RVadvice.com webpage:\n[http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/FL.html RVadvice-FL-RoadLaws] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019010622/http://www.rvadvice.com/travel/FL.html |date=19 October 2006 }}:\npassengers allowed only in camper (not travel trailer).</ref> unlike horse-drawn trailers and coaches.

The special hitch used for [[Fifth wheel coupling|fifth-wheels]] is a smaller version of the one used on [[Semi-trailer truck|18-wheeler trucks]] and can be connected by simply driving (backing) the tow vehicle under the trailer. Fifth wheel trailers are popular with full-time recreational vehicle enthusiasts, who often live in them for several months in one place, using their pickup truck tow vehicle for local errands. A fifth wheel trailer tows more securely than a traditional travel trailer because the hitch weight sits directly over the pickup truck's rear axle/tires. Since part of a fifth wheel sits in the bed of the pickup, it reduces the overall length of the vehicle/trailer package while allowing the same room as a comparable length travel trailer. Additionally, the hitch's location in the pickup's bed reduces the risk of [[jackknifing]] and allows for more maneuverability when backing. Because of the greater room available on the roads in North America, these vehicles are more popular in the United States and Canada than in Europe or other parts of the world. For uneven terrain a [[Trailer (vehicle)#Fifth wheel and gooseneck|gooseneck hitch]] is an option to fifth-wheel.\n\nThe downside is that the hitch takes up room in the pickup truck's cargo bed regardless of whether the trailer is hitched or not. The hitch can be unbolted from the bed but this takes a lot more time and effort than the unhitch operation.\n\n===Off-road trailers===\nOff-road travel trailers, also called 4x4 trailers, tentrax,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.4wdandsportutility.com/features/0206_4wd_tentrax_trailers_product_review/viewall.html |title=Tentrax Trailers - Product Review |date=June 2002 |work=4 Wheel Drive magazine |publisher=4 Wheel Drive, Source Interlink Media |accessdate=20 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430015644/http://www.4wdandsportutility.com/features/0206_4wd_tentrax_trailers_product_review/viewall.html |archive-date=30 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and jeep trailers, are built specifically for exploring the extreme backcountry without having the restriction of paved highways or gravel roads.

Half living area and half [[garage (residential)|garage]], these trailers allow \"toys\" to be brought to the countryside. A folding rear ramp give access for motorcycles, [[all-terrain vehicle]]s, [[personal watercraft]] or racecars. A generator provides power for the equipment.\n\n===Double-decker trailers===\n\nA 'double-decker trailer' is a two-level travel trailer. When traveling the trailer is only as high as a regular trailer, but when set up it increases in height to two full levels.

The growth in popularity of caravanning has been enhanced by improvements in caravan quality and caravan site facilities, making caravan holidays possible at any time of the year.\n\nThere are two main organisations that many caravanners join in the United Kingdom, the [[Caravan and Motorhome Club]], established in 1907, and the [[Camping and Caravanning Club]], established in 1901. Both clubs offer a range of services including exclusive club sites, preferential rates, advice, services such as insurance and community activities including regional and national rallies.\n\nIn the UK Caravan Insurance is not a compulsory addition, but is however recommended due to its levels of speciality cover.\n\nUnder tax regulations, caravans are considered wasting chattel and are exempt from [[capital gains tax]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Principles of Taxation|publisher=ICAEW|isbn=978-1-78363-462-0|page=182}}</ref>\n\n==Australia==\n[[File:Custom camper.jpg|thumb|right|Custom camper trailer]]\n[[Image:1956 Propert 'Trailaway' Touring Caravan.jpg|thumb|1956 Propert 'Trailaway' Touring Caravan at the [[National Museum of Australia]].]]\n\nIn Australia, camper trailers are common alongside the traditional caravan.
