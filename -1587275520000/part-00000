The original Minamata disease and [[Niigata Minamata disease]] are considered two of the [[Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan]].\n\n== 1908\u20131955 ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Minamata disease}}\n\nThe [[Chisso Corporation]] first opened a chemical factory in Minamata in 1908. Initially producing fertilisers, the factory followed the nationwide expansion of Japan's chemical industry, branching out into production of [[acetylene]], [[acetaldehyde]], [[acetic acid]], [[vinyl chloride]], and [[octanol]], among others. The Minamata factory became the most advanced in all of Japan, both before and after [[World War II]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Toxic Effects of Mercury|last=Nabi|first=Shabnum|date=2014|publisher=Springer, New Delhi|isbn=9788132219217|pages=187\u2013199|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-81-322-1922-4_25|chapter = Methylmercury and Minamata Disease}}</ref> The waste products resulting from the manufacture of these chemicals were released into Minamata Bay through the factory [[wastewater]]. These pollutants had an environmental impact. Fisheries were damaged in terms of reduced catches, and in response Chisso reached two separate compensation agreements with the fishery cooperative in 1926 and 1943.<ref>Harada, p15</ref>\n\nThe rapid expansion of the Minamata factory spurred on the local economy, and as Chisso prospered so did Minamata. This fact, combined with the lack of other industry, meant that Chisso had great influence in Minamata. At one point, over half of the tax revenue of Minamata City authority came from Chisso and its employees, and the company and its subsidiaries were responsible for creating a quarter of all jobs in Minamata.<ref>George, pp35-36</ref> Minamata was even dubbed Chisso's \"castle town\", in reference to the capital cities of feudal lords who ruled Japan during the [[Edo period]].<ref>George, p26</ref>\n\nThe Chisso Minamata factory first started [[acetaldehyde]] production in 1932, producing 210&nbsp;tons that year. By 1951, production had jumped to 6,000&nbsp;tons per year and reached a peak of 45,245 tons in 1960.<ref>Report of the Social Scientific Study Group on Minamata Disease, ''[http://www.nimd.go.jp/syakai/webversion/SSSGMDreport.html In the Hope of Avoiding Repetition of a Tragedy of Minamata Disease]'', National Institute for Minamata Disease, p. 13.</ref> Throughout, the Chisso factory's output amounted to between a quarter and a third of Japan's total acetaldehyde production. The [[chemical reaction]] used to produce the acetaldehyde used [[Mercury(II) sulfate|mercury sulfate]] as a catalyst. Starting in August 1951, the co-catalyst was changed from manganese dioxide to ferric sulfide.<ref>Eto et al.

The physicians were puzzled by her symptoms: difficulty walking, difficulty speaking, and [[convulsions]]. Two days later, her younger sister also began to exhibit the same symptoms and she, too, was hospitalised. The girls' mother informed doctors that her neighbour's daughter was also experiencing similar problems. After a house-to-house investigation, eight further patients were discovered and hospitalised. On May 1, the hospital director reported to the local public health office the discovery of an \"[[epidemic]] of an unknown disease of the [[central nervous system]]\", marking the official discovery of Minamata disease.<ref>Harada, p10</ref>\n\nTo investigate the epidemic, the city government and various medical practitioners formed the {{nihongo|Strange Disease Countermeasures Committee|\u5947\u75c5\u5bfe\u7b56\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a|Kiby\u014d Taisaku Iinkai}} at the end of May 1956. Owing to the localised nature of the disease, it was suspected to be [[Infectious disease|contagious]] and as a precaution patients were isolated and their homes disinfected. Although contagion was later disproved, this initial response contributed to the [[Social stigma|stigmatisation]] and [[discrimination]] experienced by Minamata victims from the local community. During its investigations, the committee uncovered surprising anecdotal evidence of the strange behaviour of cats and other wildlife in the areas surrounding patients' homes. From around 1950 onward, cats had been seen to have convulsions, go mad, and die. Locals called it the {{nihongo|\"cat dancing disease\"|\u732b\u8e0a\u308a\u75c5|neko odori by\u014d}}, owing to their erratic movement.<ref name=\"withrow\" /> Crows had fallen from the sky, seaweed no longer grew on the sea bed, and fish floated dead on the surface of the sea. As the extent of the outbreak was understood, the committee invited researchers from [[Kumamoto University]] to help in the research effort.<ref>Nicol, C.W., \"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fe20121007cw.html Minamata: a saga of suffering and hope]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 7 October 2012, p. 10</ref>\n\nThe Kumamoto University Research Group was formed on August 24, 1956. Researchers from the School of Medicine began visiting Minamata regularly and admitted patients to the university hospital for detailed examinations. A more complete picture of the symptoms exhibited by patients was gradually uncovered. The disease developed without any prior warning, with patients complaining of a loss of sensation and numbness in their hands and feet. They became unable to grasp small objects or fasten buttons. They could not run or walk without stumbling, their voices changed in pitch, and many patients complained of difficulties seeing, hearing, and swallowing. In general, these symptoms deteriorated and were followed by severe convulsions, [[coma]], and eventually death. By October 1956, 40 patients had been discovered, 14 of whom had died: an alarming [[case fatality rate]] of 35%.<ref>Harada, pp23-24</ref>\n\n=== Finding the cause ===\n\nResearchers from Kumamoto University also began to focus on the cause of the strange disease. They found that the victims, often members of the same family, were clustered in fishing hamlets along the shore of Minamata Bay. The [[staple food]] of victims was invariably [[fish]] and [[shellfish]] from Minamata Bay. The cats in the local area, which tended to eat scraps from the family table, had died with symptoms similar to those now discovered in humans. This led the researchers to believe that the outbreak was caused by some kind of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]], with contaminated fish and shellfish being the prime suspects.\n\nOn November 4, the research group announced its initial findings: \"Minamata disease is rather considered to be poisoning by a heavy metal, presumably it enters the human body mainly through fish and shellfish.\"<ref>Harada, pp26-27</ref>\n\n=== Identification of mercury ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" width=\"200px\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"float: right; clear: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[Image:Methylmercury-cation-3D-vdW.png|150px]]<br>[[Image:Methyl mercury.svg|150px]]\n|-\n| [[Methylmercury]], an [[Organic compound|organic]] [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] compound released in factory [[wastewater]] and the cause of Minamata disease\n|}\n\nAs soon as the investigation identified a [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] as the causal substance, the wastewater from the Chisso plant was immediately suspected as the origin. The company's own tests revealed that its wastewater contained many heavy metals in concentrations sufficiently high to bring about serious environmental degradation, including [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[manganese]], [[arsenic]], [[thallium]], and [[copper]], plus the [[chalcogen]] [[selenium]]. Identifying which particular poison was responsible for the disease proved to be extremely difficult and time-consuming. During 1957 and 1958, many different theories were proposed by different researchers. At first, manganese was thought to be the causal substance due to the high concentrations found in fish and the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] of the deceased. Thallium, selenium, and a multiple contaminant theory were also proposed, but in March 1958, visiting British [[neurologist]] [[Douglas McAlpine]] suggested that Minamata symptoms resembled those of [[Organic compound|organic]] [[mercury poisoning]], so the focus of the investigation centered on mercury.\n\nIn February 1959, the mercury distribution in Minamata Bay was investigated. The results shocked the researchers involved. Large quantities of mercury were detected in fish, shellfish, and [[sludge]] from the bay. The highest concentrations centred around the Chisso factory wastewater canal in [[Hyakken Harbour]] and decreased going out to sea, clearly identifying the plant as the source of contamination. Pollution was so heavy at the mouth of the wastewater canal, a figure of 2&nbsp;kg of mercury per ton of sediment was measured: a level that would be economically viable to mine. Indeed, Chisso did later set up a subsidiary to reclaim and sell the mercury recovered from the sludge.<ref name=\"Harada, p50\">Harada, p50</ref>\n\nHair samples were taken from the victims of the disease and also from the Minamata population in general. In patients, the maximum mercury level recorded was 705&nbsp;[[parts per million]] (ppm), indicating very heavy exposure and in nonsymptomatic Minamata residents, the level was 191&nbsp;ppm. This compared to an average level of 4&nbsp;ppm for people living outside the Minamata area.<ref name=\"Harada, p50\"/>\n\nOn November 12, 1959, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]]'s Minamata Food Poisoning Subcommittee published its results:\n\n{{quote|Minamata disease is a poisoning disease that affects mainly the central nervous system and is caused by the consumption of large quantities of fish and shellfish living in Minamata Bay and its surroundings, the major causative agent being some sort of organic mercury compound.<ref>Harada, p52</ref>}}\n\n== 1959 ==\n\n[[Image:Minamata map illustrating Chisso factory effluent routes2.png|thumb|right|The Chisso factory and its wastewater routes]]\n\nDuring the investigation by researchers at [[Kumamoto University]], the causal substance had been identified as a heavy metal and it was widely presumed that the Chisso plant was the source of the contamination. Chisso was coming under closer scrutiny and to deflect criticism, the wastewater output route was changed. Chisso knew of the environmental damage caused by its wastewater and was well aware that it was the prime suspect in the Minamata disease investigation. Despite this, from September 1958, instead of discharging its waste into Hyakken Harbour (the focus of investigation and source of original contamination), it discharged wastewater directly into Minamata River. The immediate effect was the death of fish at the mouth of the river, and from that point on, new Minamata disease victims began to appear in other fishing villages up and down the coast of the [[Shiranui Sea]], as the pollution spread over an even greater area.<ref>Harada, pp38-39</ref>\n\nChisso failed to co-operate with the investigation team from Kumamoto University. It withheld information on its industrial processes, leaving researchers to speculate what products the factory was producing and by what methods.<ref>Ui, Chapter 4 \u2013 section IV</ref> The Chisso factory's hospital director, [[Hajime Hosokawa]], established a laboratory in the research division of the plant to carry out his own experiments into Minamata disease in July 1959. Food to which factory wastewater had been added was fed to healthy cats. Seventy-eight days into the experiment, cat 400 exhibited symptoms of Minamata disease and [[pathological]] examinations confirmed a diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning. The company did not reveal these significant results to the investigators and ordered Hosokawa to stop his research.<ref>George, pp60-61</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to undermine Kumamoto University researchers' organic mercury theory, Chisso and other parties with a vested interest that the factory remain open (including the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] and the [[Japan Chemical Industry Association]]) funded research into alternative causes of the disease, other than its own waste.<ref>See [http://www.soshisha.org/english/soshisha_e/stockholm_appeal.htm \"The Stockholm Appeal\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125085622/http://www.soshisha.org/english/soshisha_e/stockholm_appeal.htm |date=2013-01-25 }} by Soshisha \u2013 The Supporting Center for Minamata Disease, retrieved 08 January 2011</ref>\n\n=== Compensation of fishermen and patients, 1959 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{Details|Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959}}\n\nPolluting wastewater had damaged the fisheries around Minamata ever since the opening of the Chisso factory in 1908. The Minamata Fishing Cooperative had managed to win small payments of {{nihongo|\"sympathy money\"|\u898b\u821e\u3044\u91d1|mimaikin}} from the company in 1926 and again in 1943, but after the outbreak of Minamata disease, the fishing situation was becoming critical. Fishing catches had declined by 91% between  1953 and 1957. The [[Kumamoto Prefecture|Kumamoto]] prefectural government issued a partial ban on the sale of fish caught in the heavily polluted Minamata Bay, but not an all-out ban, which would have legally obliged it to compensate the fishermen. The fishing cooperative protested against Chisso and angrily forced their way into the factory on 6 August and 12 August, demanding compensation. A committee was set up by Minamata Mayor [[Todomu Nakamura]] to mediate between the two sides, but this committee was stacked heavily in the company's favour. On 29 August, the fishing cooperative agreed to the mediation committee's proposal, stating: \"In order to end the anxiety of the citizens, we swallow our tears and accept\". The company paid the cooperative [[\u00a5]]20 million (US$183,477) and set up a \u00a515 million ($137,608) fund to promote the recovery of fishing.\n\n[[Image:Minamata protesters.jpg|thumb|right|Protestors at the gates of the Chisso factory (''[[W. Eugene Smith]]'')]]\n\nSince the change of route of wastewater output in 1958, pollution had spread up and down the Shiranui Sea, damaging fisheries there, too. Emboldened by the success of the small Minamata cooperative, the Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives also decided to seek compensation from Chisso. On 17 October, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory to demand negotiations. When this produced no results, the alliance members took their campaign to [[Tokyo]], securing an official visit to Minamata by members of the Japanese [[Diet of Japan|Diet]]. During the visit on 2 November, alliance members forced their way into the factory and rioted, causing many injuries and \u00a510 million ($100,000) worth of damage. The violence was covered widely in the media, bringing the nation's attention to the Minamata issue for the first time since the outbreak began. Another mediation committee was set up, and an agreement was hammered out and signed on 17 December. Some \u00a525 million of \"sympathy money\" was paid to the alliance and a \u00a565 million fishing recovery fund was established.\n\nIn 1959, the victims of Minamata disease were in a much weaker position than the fishermen. The recently formed Minamata Disease Patients Families Mutual Aid Society was much more divided than the fishing cooperatives. Patients' families were the victim of [[discrimination]] and [[ostracism]] from the local community. Local people felt that the company (and their city that depended upon it) was facing economic ruin. To some patients, this ostracism by the community represented a greater fear than the disease itself. After beginning a [[sit-in]] at the factory gates in November 1959, the patients asked [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] Governor [[Hirosaku Teramoto]] to include the patients' request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance. Chisso agreed and after a few weeks' further negotiation, another \"sympathy money\" agreement was signed. Patients who were certified by a [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] committee would be compensated: adult patients received \u00a5100,000 ($917) per year; children \u00a530,000 ($275) per year, and families of dead patients would receive a one-off \u00a5320,000 ($2935) payment.\n\n=== Wastewater treatment ===\n\nOn October 21, 1959, Chisso was ordered by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to switch back its wastewater drainage from the Minamata River to Hyakken Harbour and to speed up the installation of wastewater treatment systems at the factory. Chisso installed a [[Cyclator]] purification system on December 19, 1959, and opened it with a special ceremony. Chisso's president [[Kiichi Yoshioka]] drank a glass of water supposedly treated through the Cyclator to demonstrate that it was safe. In fact, the wastewater from the acetaldehyde plant, which the company knew still contained mercury and led to Minamata disease when fed to cats, was not treated through the Cyclator at the time. Testimony at a later [[Niigata Minamata disease]] trial proved that Chisso knew the Cyclator to be completely ineffective: \"The purification tank was installed as a social solution and did nothing to remove organic mercury.\"<ref>Harada, p56</ref>\n\nThe deception was successful and almost all parties involved in Minamata disease were duped into believing that the factory's wastewater had been made safe from December 1959 onward. This widespread assumption meant that doctors were not expecting new patients to appear, resulting in numerous problems in the years to follow, as the pollution continued. In most people's minds, the issue of Minamata disease had been resolved.\n\n== 1959\u20131969 ==\n\nThe years between the first set of \"sympathy money\" agreements in 1959 and the start of the first legal action to be taken against Chisso in 1969 are often called the \"ten years of silence\". In fact, much activity on the part of the patients and fishermen took place during this period, but nothing had a significant impact on the actions of the company or the coverage of Minamata in the national media.\n\n=== Continued pollution ===\n\nDespite the almost universal assumption to the contrary, the wastewater treatment facilities installed in December 1959 had no effect on the level of organic mercury being released into the Shiranui Sea. The pollution and the disease it caused continued to spread. The Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectural governments conducted a joint survey in late 1960 and early 1961 into the level of mercury in the hair of people living around the Shiranui Sea. The results confirmed that organic mercury had spread all around the inland sea and that people were still being poisoned by contaminated fish. Hundreds of people were discovered to have levels greater than 50 ppm of mercury in their hair, the level at which people are likely to experience nerve damage. The highest result recorded was that of a woman from [[Goshonoura, Kumamoto|Goshonoura]] island who had 920 ppm in her sample.\n\nThe prefectural governments did not publish the results and did nothing in response to these surveys. The participants who had donated hair samples were not informed of their result, even when they requested it. A follow-up study ten years later discovered that many had died from \"unknown causes\".<ref>George, pp144-145</ref>\n\n=== Congenital Minamata disease ===\n\nLocal doctors and medical officials had noticed for a long time an abnormally high frequency of [[cerebral palsy]] and other infantile disorders in the Minamata area. In 1961, a number of medical professionals including [[Masazumi Harada]] (later to receive an [[Global 500 Roll of Honour|honour from the United Nations]] for his body of work on Minamata disease) set about re-examining children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The symptoms of the children closely mirrored those of adult Minamata disease patients, but many of their mothers did not exhibit symptoms. The fact that these children had been born after the initial outbreak and had never been fed contaminated fish also led their mothers to believe they were not victims. At the time the medical establishment believed the [[placenta]] would protect the <!--This article is in Commonwealth English - please do not change foetus to fetus-->[[foetus]] from toxins in the bloodstream, which is indeed the case with most chemicals. What was not known at the time was that exactly the opposite is the case with methylmercury: the placenta removes it from the mother's bloodstream and concentrates the chemical in the <!--This article is in Commonwealth English - please do not change foetus to fetus-->foetus.\n\nAfter several years of study and the [[autopsies]] of two children, the doctors announced that these children were suffering from an as yet unrecognised [[congenital]] form of Minamata disease. The certification committee convened on 29 November 1962 and agreed that the two dead children and the 16 children still alive should be certified as patients, and therefore liable for \"sympathy\" payments from Chisso, in line with the 1959 agreement.<ref>Harada, pp68-77</ref>\n\n=== Outbreak of Niigata Minamata disease ===\n{{Details|Niigata Minamata disease}}\n\nMinamata disease broke out again in 1965, this time along the banks of the [[Agano River]] in [[Niigata Prefecture]]. The polluting factory (owned by [[Showa Denko]]) employed a chemical process using a mercury catalyst very similar to that used by Chisso in Minamata. As in Minamata, from the autumn of 1964 to the spring of 1965, cats living along the banks of the Agano River had been seen to go mad and die. Before long, patients appeared with identical symptoms to patients living on the Shiranui Sea, and the outbreak was made public on 12 June 1965. Researchers from the Kumamoto University Research Group and [[Hajime Hosokawa]] (who had retired from Chisso in 1962) used their experience from Minamata and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. In September 1966, a report was issued proving Showa Denko's pollution to be the cause of this second Minamata disease.\n\nUnlike the patients in Minamata, the victims of Showa Denko's pollution lived a considerable distance from the factory and had no particular link to the company. As a result, the local community was much more supportive of patients' groups and a lawsuit was filed against the company in March 1968, only three years after discovery.\n\nThe events in Niigata catalysed a change in response to the original Minamata incident. The scientific research carried out in Niigata forced a re-examination of that done in Minamata and the decision of Niigata patients to sue the polluting company allowed the same response to be considered in Minamata. Masazumi Harada has said that, \"It may sound strange, but if this second Minamata disease had not broken out, the medical and social progress achieved by now in Kumamoto... would have been impossible.\"<ref>Harada, p90</ref>\n\nAround this time, two other pollution-related diseases were also grabbing headlines in Japan. Victims of [[Yokkaichi Asthma|Yokkaichi asthma]] and [[Itai-itai disease]] were forming citizens' groups and filed lawsuits against the polluting companies in September 1967 and March 1968, respectively. As a group, these diseases came to be known as the [[four big pollution diseases of Japan]].<ref>George, pp174-175</ref>\n\nSlowly but surely, the mood in Minamata and Japan as a whole was shifting. Minamata patients found the public gradually becoming more receptive and sympathetic as the decade wore on. This culminated in 1968 with the establishment in Minamata of the Citizens' Council for Minamata Disease Countermeasures, which was to become the chief citizens' support group to the Minamata patients. A founding member of the citizens' council was [[Michiko Ishimure]], a local housewife and poet who later that year published {{nihongo|''Pure Land, Poisoned Sea: Our Minamata disease''|\u82e6\u6d77\u6d44\u571f\u2015\u308f\u304c\u6c34\u4fe3\u75c5|Kugai J\u014ddo: Waga Minamataby\u014d}} a book of poetic essays that received national acclaim.\n\n== 1969\u20131973 ==\n\n=== Official government recognition ===\n\nFinally on 26 September 1968 \u2013 12 years after the discovery of the disease (and four months after Chisso had stopped production of acetaldehyde using its mercury catalyst) \u2013 the government issued an official conclusion as to the cause of Minamata disease:\n\n{{quote|Minamata disease is a disease of the central nervous system, a poisoning caused by long-term consumption, in large amounts, of fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay. The causative agent is methylmercury. Methylmercury produced in the acetaldehyde acetic acid facility of Shin Nihon Chisso's Minamata factory was discharged in factory wastewater... Minamata disease patients last appeared in 1960, and the outbreak has ended. This is presumed to be because consumption of fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay was banned in the fall of 1957, and the fact that the factory had waste-treatment facilities in place from January 1960.}}\n\nThe conclusion contained many factual errors: eating fish and shellfish from other areas of the Shiranui Sea, not just Minamata Bay, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, as well as large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time also produced symptoms; the outbreak had not, in fact, ended in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many victims and their families. Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso to accept responsibility for causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by their social superiors. The struggle now focused on to what extent the victims should be compensated.<ref>George, pp187-190</ref>\n\n=== Struggle for a new agreement ===\n\nIn light of the government announcement, the patients of the Mutual Aid Society decided to ask for a new compensation agreement with Chisso and submitted the demand on the 6th of October. The company replied that it was unable to judge what would be fair compensation and asked the national government to set up a binding arbitration committee to decide. This proposal split the members of the patients' society, many of whom were extremely wary of entrusting their fate to a third party, as they had done in 1959 with unfortunate results. At a meeting on the 5th of April 1969, the opposing views within the society could not be reconciled and the organisation split into the arbitration group (who were willing to accept binding arbitration) and the litigation group (who decided to sue the company). That summer, Chisso sent gifts to the families who opted for arbitration rather than litigation.\n\n[[Image:Patients and family members hold photographs of their dead.jpg|thumb|right|Minamata patients and family members hold photographs of their dead during a demonstration (W. E. Smith)]]\n\nAn arbitration committee was duly set up by the Ministry of Health and Welfare on 25 April, but it took almost a year to draw up a draft compensation plan. A newspaper leak in March 1970 revealed that the committee would ask Chisso to pay only \u00a52 million ($5,600) for dead patients and \u00a5140,000 to \u00a5200,000 ($390 to $560) per year to surviving patients. The arbitration group were dismayed by the sums on offer. They petitioned the committee, together with patients and supporters of the litigation group, for a fairer deal. The arbitration committee announced their compensation plan on 25 May in a disorderly session at the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. Thirteen protesters were arrested. Instead of accepting the agreement as they had promised, the arbitration group asked for increases. The committee was forced to revise its plan and the patients waited inside the ministry building for two days while they did so. The final agreement was signed on 27 May. Payments for deaths ranged from \u00a51.7 million to \u00a54 million ($4,700 to $11,100), one-time payments from \u00a51 million to \u00a54.2 million ($2,760 to $11,660) and annual payments between \u00a5170,000 and \u00a5380,000 ($470 to $1,100) for surviving patients. On the day of the signing, the Minamata Citizens' Council held a protest outside the Minamata factory gates. One of the Chisso [[trade unions]] held an eight-hour strike in protest at the poor treatment of the arbitration group by their own company.<ref name=arb>George, pp191-202 (Arbitration Group)</ref>\n\nThe litigation group, representing 41 certified patients (17 already deceased) in 28 families, submitted their suit against Chisso in the [[Kumamoto District Court]] on 14 June 1969. The leader of the group, [[Eiz\u014d Watanabe]] (a former leader of the Mutual Aid Society), declared, \"Today, and from this day forth, we are fighting against the power of the state.\" Those who decided to sue the company came under fierce pressure to drop their lawsuits. One woman was visited personally by a Chisso executive and harassed by her neighbours. She was ignored, her family's fishing boat used without permission, their fishing nets were cut, and human faeces were thrown at her in the street.<ref>George, p205</ref>\n\nThe litigation group and their lawyers were helped substantially by an informal national network of citizens' groups that had sprung up around the country in 1969. The {{nihongo|Associations to Indict [Those Responsible for] Minamata Disease|\u6c34\u4fe3\u75c5\u3092\u544a\u767a\u3059\u308b\u4f1a|Minamata-by\u014d o Kokuhatsu Suru Kai}} were instrumental in raising awareness and funds for the lawsuit. The Kumamoto branch, in particular, was especially helpful to the case. In September 1969, they set up a Trial Research Group, which included law professors, medical researchers (including [[Masazumi Harada]]), sociologists and even the housewife and poet Michiko Ishimure to provide useful material to the lawyers to improve their legal arguments. In fact, their report, ''Corporate Responsibility for Minamata Disease: Chisso's Illegal Acts'',<ref>{{nihongo|''Corporate Responsibility for Minamata Disease: Chisso's Illegal Acts''|\u6c34\u4fe3\u75c5\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u4f01\u696d\u306e\u8cac\u4efb\uff1a\u30c1\u30c3\u30bd\u306e\u4e0d\u6cd5\u884c\u70ba|Minamata-by\u014d ni Tai Suru Kigy\u014d no Sekinin: Chisso no Fuh\u014d K\u014di}}</ref> published in August 1970, formed the basis of the ultimately successful lawsuit.<ref name=arb/>\n\nThe trial lasted almost four years. The litigation group lawyers sought to prove Chisso's [[Negligence|corporate negligence]]. Three main legal points had to be overcome to win the case. First, the lawyers had to show that methylmercury caused Minamata disease and that the company's factory was the source of pollution. The extensive research by Kumamoto University and the government conclusion meant that this point was proved quite easily. Second, could and should the company have anticipated the effect of its wastewater and should it have taken steps to prevent the tragedy (i.e., was the company negligent in its [[duty of care]])? Third, was the \"sympathy money\" agreement of 1959, which forbade the patients from claiming any further compensation, a legally binding contract?\n\nThe trial heard from patients and their families, but the most important testimony came from Chisso executives and employees. The most dramatic testimony came from Hajime Hosokawa, who spoke on 4 July 1970 from his hospital bed where he was dying of cancer. He explained his experiments with cats, including the infamous \"cat 400\", which developed Minamata disease after being fed factory wastewater. He also spoke of his opposition to the 1958 change in wastewater output route from Hyakken Harbour to Minamata River. His testimony was backed up by a colleague who also told how company officials had ordered them to halt their cat experiments in the autumn of 1959. Hajime Hosokawa died three months after giving his testimony. Former factory manager [[Eiichi Nishida]] admitted that the company put profits ahead of safety, resulting in dangerous working conditions and a lack of care with mercury. Former Chisso President [[Kiichi Yoshioka]] admitted that the company promoted a theory of dumped [[World War II]] explosives, though it knew it to be unfounded. \n\nThe verdict handed down on 20 March 1973 represented a complete victory for the patients of the litigation group:\n\n{{quote|The defendant's factory was a leading chemical plant with the most advanced technology and ... should have assured the safety of its wastewater. The defendant could have prevented the occurrence of Minamata disease or at least have kept it at a minimum. We cannot find that the defendant took any of the precautionary measures called for in this situation whatsoever. The presumption that the defendant had been negligent from beginning to end in discharging wastewater from its acetaldehyde plant is amply supported. The defendant cannot escape liability for negligence.}}\n\nThe \"sympathy money\" agreement was found to be invalid and Chisso was ordered to make one-time payments of \u00a518 million ($66,000) for each deceased patient and from \u00a516 million to \u00a518 million ($59,000 to $66,000) for each surviving patient. The total compensation of \u00a5937 million ($3.4 million) was the largest sum ever awarded by a Japanese court.<ref>George, pp241-249</ref>\n\n=== Uncertified patients' fight to be recognised ===\n\nWhile the struggles of the arbitration and litigation groups against Chisso were continuing, a new group of Minamata disease sufferers emerged. To qualify for compensation under the 1959 agreement, patients had to be officially recognised by various ''ad hoc'' certification committees according to their symptoms. However, in an effort to limit the liability and financial burden on the company, these committees were sticking to a rigid interpretation of Minamata disease. They required that patients must exhibit all symptoms of [[Hunter-Russell syndrome]] \u2013 the standard diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning at the time \u2013 which originated from an industrial accident in the United Kingdom in 1940. The committee certified only patients exhibiting explicit symptoms of the British syndrome, rather than basing their diagnosis on the disease in Japan. This resulted in many applicants being rejected by the committee, leaving them confused and frustrated.<ref>Harada, pp156-157 and George, p208</ref>\n\n== Epidemiology ==\n\nAs of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially certified (1,784 of whom have died)<ref name=officialnumbers/> and over 10,000 people had received financial compensation from Chisso,<ref name=compensationnumbers/> although they were not recognised as official victims. The issue of quantifying the impact of Minamata disease is complicated, as a full [[epidemiological study]] has never been conducted and patients were recognised only if they voluntarily applied to a certification council to seek financial compensation.<ref name=Guardian1>See [https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,574782,00.html \"Mercury poisoning of thousands confirmed\"] by Jonathan Watts, ''The Guardian'', 16 October 2001, retrieved 24 October 2006.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kawamura|first=Hiroki|date=2017|title=The relation between law and technology in Japan: liability for technology-related mass damage in the cases of Minamata disease, asbestos, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|journal=Contemporary Japan|volume=30 |issue=1|pages=3\u201327|doi=10.1080/18692729.2018.1423459}}</ref> Many victims of Minamata disease faced discrimination and ostracism from the local community if they came out into the open about their symptoms. Some people feared the disease to be contagious, and many local people were fiercely loyal to Chisso, depending on the company for their livelihoods. In this atmosphere, sufferers were reluctant to come forward and seek certification. Despite these factors, over 17,000 people have applied to the council for certification. Also, in recognising an applicant as a Minamata disease sufferer, the certification council qualified that patient to receive financial compensation from Chisso. For that reason, the council has always been under immense pressure to reject claimants and minimise the financial burden placed on Chisso. Rather than being a council of medical recognition, the decisions of the council were always affected by the economic and political factors surrounding Minamata and the Chisso corporation. Furthermore, compensation of the victims led to continued strife in the community, including unfounded accusations that some of the people who sought compensation did not actually suffer from the disease.<ref>See [http://soshisha.org/english/10tishiki_e/10chishiki_e.htm \"Ten Things to Know about Minamata Disease\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725010737/http://soshisha.org/english/10tishiki_e/10chishiki_e.htm |date=2012-07-25 }} by Soshisha \u2013 The Supporting Center for Minamata Disease</ref> More properly, the impact should be called a criminal 'poisoning', not a clinical 'disease'.

Instead, the afflicted were ostracised from their community due to ignorance about the disease, as people were afraid that it was contagious.\n\nThe people directly impacted by the pollution of Minamata Bay were not originally allowed to participate in actions that would affect their future. Disease victims, fishing families, and company employees were excluded from the debate. Progress occurred when Minamata victims were finally allowed to come to a meeting to discuss the issue. As a result, postwar Japan took a small step toward democracy.\n\nThrough the evolution of public sentiments, the victims and environmental protesters were able to acquire standing and proceed more effectively in their cause. The involvement of the press also aided the process of democratization because it caused more people to become aware of the facts of Minamata disease and the pollution that caused it.\n\nAlthough the environmental protests did result in Japan becoming more democratized, it did not completely rid Japan of the system that first suppressed the fishermen and victims of Minamata disease.\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n[[Toshiko Akiyoshi]], touched by the plight of the fishing village, wrote a jazz suite, \"Minamata\", that was to be the central piece of the Toshiko Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin Big Band's 1976 album on RCA, [[Insights (album)|''Insights'']].  The piece was constructed in three parts, to musically reflect the tragedy \u2013 \"Peaceful Village\", \"Prosperity & Consequence\", and \"Epilogue\".  Akiyoshi used Japanese vocalists to sing the Japanese lyrics of a tone poem that were part of the composition.  The album won many awards in jazz circles, including ''Downbeat'''s best album award, largely on the strength of this piece, which brought some further attention to the tragedy.<ref>Record Review magazine vol 2 no 3 August 1978 \u2013 Scott Yanow; Downbeat (http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=704); liner notes for Toshiko Akiyoshi/Lew Tabackin Big Band LP, Insights 1976 RCA VICTOR   AFL1-2678  STEREO</ref> [[Insights (Toshiko Akiyoshi \u2013 Lew Tabackin Big Band)]]\n\nThe song \"Kepone Factory\" on [[Dead Kennedys]]' ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' makes reference to the disaster in its chorus.\n\nThe song \"The Disease of the Dancing Cats\" by the band [[Bush (band)|Bush]] on \"The Science of Things\" album is in reference to the disaster.\n\n=== Media ===\nPhotographic documentation of Minamata started in the early 1960s. One photographer who arrived in 1960 was [[Shisei Kuwabara]], straight from university and photo school, who had his photographs published in ''[[Weekly Asahi]]'' as early as May 1960. The first exhibition of his photographs of Minamata was held in the [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] Photo Salon in Tokyo in 1962, and the first of his book-length anthologies, ''Minamata Disease'', was published in Japan in 1965. He has returned to Minamata many times since.<ref name=\"kmopa\">\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20011223130736/http://www.kmopa.com/minamata/minamata.htm Shisei Kuwabara \u2013 'Minamata': The Starting point of the work of the photojournalist, Shisei Kuwabara]\", KMoPA.

His Japanese wife and he lived in Minamata from 1971 to 1973. The most famous and striking photo of the essay, ''[[Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath]]'' (1972), shows Ryoko Uemura, holding her severely deformed daughter, Tomoko, in a Japanese bath chamber. Tomoko was poisoned by methylmercury while still in the womb. The photo was very widely published. It was posed by Smith with the co-operation of Ryoko and Tomoko to dramatically illustrate the consequences of the disease. It has subsequently been withdrawn from circulation at the request of Tomoko's family, so does not appear in recent anthologies of Smith's works.<ref name=Tomoko>Read the thoughts of a photography magazine editor surrounding the controversy of the photograph's withdrawal: [http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0007/hughes.htm \"Tomoko Uemura, R.I.P.\"] by Jim Hughes, ''The Digital Journalist,'' retrieved 24 October 2006.</ref> Smith and his wife were extremely dedicated to the cause of the victims of Minamata disease, closely documenting their struggle for recognition and right to compensation. Smith was himself attacked and seriously injured by Chisso employees in an incident in Goi, [[Ichihara, Chiba|Ichihara]] city, near Tokyo on January 7, 1972, in an attempt to stop the photographer from further revealing the issue to the world.<ref>Smith, pp94-95</ref> The 54-year-old Smith survived the attack, but his sight in one eye deteriorated and his health never fully recovered before his death in 1978.<!-- Well, no, it didn't; but while I don't want to whitewash the disgusting actions of Chissos' goons, plenty of other factors  hastened Smith's death.

These pollutants had an environmental impact. Fisheries were damaged in terms of reduced catches, and in response Chisso reached two separate compensation agreements with the fishery cooperative in 1926 and 1943.<ref>Harada, p15</ref>\n\nThe rapid expansion of the Minamata factory spurred on the local economy, and as Chisso prospered so did Minamata. This fact, combined with the lack of other industry, meant that Chisso had great influence in Minamata. At one point, over half of the tax revenue of Minamata City authority came from Chisso and its employees, and the company and its subsidiaries were responsible for creating a quarter of all jobs in Minamata.<ref>George, pp35-36</ref> Minamata was even dubbed Chisso's \"castle town\", in reference to the capital cities of feudal lords who ruled Japan during the [[Edo period]].<ref>George, p26</ref>\n\nThe Chisso Minamata factory first started [[acetaldehyde]] production in 1932, producing 210&nbsp;tons that year.

The physicians were puzzled by her symptoms: difficulty walking, difficulty speaking, and [[convulsions]]. Two days later, her younger sister also began to exhibit the same symptoms and she, too, was hospitalised. The girls' mother informed doctors that her neighbour's daughter was also experiencing similar problems. After a house-to-house investigation, eight further patients were discovered and hospitalised. On May 1, the hospital director reported to the local public health office the discovery of an \"[[epidemic]] of an unknown disease of the [[central nervous system]]\", marking the official discovery of Minamata disease.<ref>Harada, p10</ref>\n\nTo investigate the epidemic, the city government and various medical practitioners formed the {{nihongo|Strange Disease Countermeasures Committee|\u5947\u75c5\u5bfe\u7b56\u59d4\u54e1\u4f1a|Kiby\u014d Taisaku Iinkai}} at the end of May 1956. Owing to the localised nature of the disease, it was suspected to be [[Infectious disease|contagious]] and as a precaution patients were isolated and their homes disinfected. Although contagion was later disproved, this initial response contributed to the [[Social stigma|stigmatisation]] and [[discrimination]] experienced by Minamata victims from the local community. During its investigations, the committee uncovered surprising anecdotal evidence of the strange behaviour of cats and other wildlife in the areas surrounding patients' homes. From around 1950 onward, cats had been seen to have convulsions, go mad, and die. Locals called it the {{nihongo|\"cat dancing disease\"|\u732b\u8e0a\u308a\u75c5|neko odori by\u014d}}, owing to their erratic movement.<ref name=\"withrow\" /> Crows had fallen from the sky, seaweed no longer grew on the sea bed, and fish floated dead on the surface of the sea. As the extent of the outbreak was understood, the committee invited researchers from [[Kumamoto University]] to help in the research effort.<ref>Nicol, C.W., \"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fe20121007cw.html Minamata: a saga of suffering and hope]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 7 October 2012, p. 10</ref>\n\nThe Kumamoto University Research Group was formed on August 24, 1956. Researchers from the School of Medicine began visiting Minamata regularly and admitted patients to the university hospital for detailed examinations. A more complete picture of the symptoms exhibited by patients was gradually uncovered. The disease developed without any prior warning, with patients complaining of a loss of sensation and numbness in their hands and feet. They became unable to grasp small objects or fasten buttons. They could not run or walk without stumbling, their voices changed in pitch, and many patients complained of difficulties seeing, hearing, and swallowing. In general, these symptoms deteriorated and were followed by severe convulsions, [[coma]], and eventually death. By October 1956, 40 patients had been discovered, 14 of whom had died: an alarming [[case fatality rate]] of 35%.<ref>Harada, pp23-24</ref>\n\n=== Finding the cause ===\n\nResearchers from Kumamoto University also began to focus on the cause of the strange disease. They found that the victims, often members of the same family, were clustered in fishing hamlets along the shore of Minamata Bay. The [[staple food]] of victims was invariably [[fish]] and [[shellfish]] from Minamata Bay. The cats in the local area, which tended to eat scraps from the family table, had died with symptoms similar to those now discovered in humans. This led the researchers to believe that the outbreak was caused by some kind of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]], with contaminated fish and shellfish being the prime suspects.\n\nOn November 4, the research group announced its initial findings: \"Minamata disease is rather considered to be poisoning by a heavy metal, presumably it enters the human body mainly through fish and shellfish.\"<ref>Harada, pp26-27</ref>\n\n=== Identification of mercury ===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" width=\"200px\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"float: right; clear: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[Image:Methylmercury-cation-3D-vdW.png|150px]]<br>[[Image:Methyl mercury.svg|150px]]\n|-\n| [[Methylmercury]], an [[Organic compound|organic]] [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] compound released in factory [[wastewater]] and the cause of Minamata disease\n|}\n\nAs soon as the investigation identified a [[Heavy metals|heavy metal]] as the causal substance, the wastewater from the Chisso plant was immediately suspected as the origin. The company's own tests revealed that its wastewater contained many heavy metals in concentrations sufficiently high to bring about serious environmental degradation, including [[lead]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[manganese]], [[arsenic]], [[thallium]], and [[copper]], plus the [[chalcogen]] [[selenium]]. Identifying which particular poison was responsible for the disease proved to be extremely difficult and time-consuming. During 1957 and 1958, many different theories were proposed by different researchers. At first, manganese was thought to be the causal substance due to the high concentrations found in fish and the [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] of the deceased. Thallium, selenium, and a multiple contaminant theory were also proposed, but in March 1958, visiting British [[neurologist]] [[Douglas McAlpine]] suggested that Minamata symptoms resembled those of [[Organic compound|organic]] [[mercury poisoning]], so the focus of the investigation centered on mercury.\n\nIn February 1959, the mercury distribution in Minamata Bay was investigated. The results shocked the researchers involved. Large quantities of mercury were detected in fish, shellfish, and [[sludge]] from the bay. The highest concentrations centred around the Chisso factory wastewater canal in [[Hyakken Harbour]] and decreased going out to sea, clearly identifying the plant as the source of contamination. Pollution was so heavy at the mouth of the wastewater canal, a figure of 2&nbsp;kg of mercury per ton of sediment was measured: a level that would be economically viable to mine. Indeed, Chisso did later set up a subsidiary to reclaim and sell the mercury recovered from the sludge.<ref name=\"Harada, p50\">Harada, p50</ref>\n\nHair samples were taken from the victims of the disease and also from the Minamata population in general. In patients, the maximum mercury level recorded was 705&nbsp;[[parts per million]] (ppm), indicating very heavy exposure and in nonsymptomatic Minamata residents, the level was 191&nbsp;ppm. This compared to an average level of 4&nbsp;ppm for people living outside the Minamata area.<ref name=\"Harada, p50\"/>\n\nOn November 12, 1959, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]]'s Minamata Food Poisoning Subcommittee published its results:\n\n{{quote|Minamata disease is a poisoning disease that affects mainly the central nervous system and is caused by the consumption of large quantities of fish and shellfish living in Minamata Bay and its surroundings, the major causative agent being some sort of organic mercury compound.<ref>Harada, p52</ref>}}\n\n== 1959 ==\n\n[[Image:Minamata map illustrating Chisso factory effluent routes2.png|thumb|right|The Chisso factory and its wastewater routes]]\n\nDuring the investigation by researchers at [[Kumamoto University]], the causal substance had been identified as a heavy metal and it was widely presumed that the Chisso plant was the source of the contamination. Chisso was coming under closer scrutiny and to deflect criticism, the wastewater output route was changed. Chisso knew of the environmental damage caused by its wastewater and was well aware that it was the prime suspect in the Minamata disease investigation. Despite this, from September 1958, instead of discharging its waste into Hyakken Harbour (the focus of investigation and source of original contamination), it discharged wastewater directly into Minamata River. The immediate effect was the death of fish at the mouth of the river, and from that point on, new Minamata disease victims began to appear in other fishing villages up and down the coast of the [[Shiranui Sea]], as the pollution spread over an even greater area.<ref>Harada, pp38-39</ref>\n\nChisso failed to co-operate with the investigation team from Kumamoto University. It withheld information on its industrial processes, leaving researchers to speculate what products the factory was producing and by what methods.<ref>Ui, Chapter 4 \u2013 section IV</ref> The Chisso factory's hospital director, [[Hajime Hosokawa]], established a laboratory in the research division of the plant to carry out his own experiments into Minamata disease in July 1959. Food to which factory wastewater had been added was fed to healthy cats. Seventy-eight days into the experiment, cat 400 exhibited symptoms of Minamata disease and [[pathological]] examinations confirmed a diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning. The company did not reveal these significant results to the investigators and ordered Hosokawa to stop his research.<ref>George, pp60-61</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to undermine Kumamoto University researchers' organic mercury theory, Chisso and other parties with a vested interest that the factory remain open (including the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] and the [[Japan Chemical Industry Association]]) funded research into alternative causes of the disease, other than its own waste.<ref>See [http://www.soshisha.org/english/soshisha_e/stockholm_appeal.htm \"The Stockholm Appeal\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125085622/http://www.soshisha.org/english/soshisha_e/stockholm_appeal.htm |date=2013-01-25 }} by Soshisha \u2013 The Supporting Center for Minamata Disease, retrieved 08 January 2011</ref>\n\n=== Compensation of fishermen and patients, 1959 ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n{{Details|Minamata disease compensation agreements of 1959}}\n\nPolluting wastewater had damaged the fisheries around Minamata ever since the opening of the Chisso factory in 1908. The Minamata Fishing Cooperative had managed to win small payments of {{nihongo|\"sympathy money\"|\u898b\u821e\u3044\u91d1|mimaikin}} from the company in 1926 and again in 1943, but after the outbreak of Minamata disease, the fishing situation was becoming critical. Fishing catches had declined by 91% between  1953 and 1957. The [[Kumamoto Prefecture|Kumamoto]] prefectural government issued a partial ban on the sale of fish caught in the heavily polluted Minamata Bay, but not an all-out ban, which would have legally obliged it to compensate the fishermen. The fishing cooperative protested against Chisso and angrily forced their way into the factory on 6 August and 12 August, demanding compensation. A committee was set up by Minamata Mayor [[Todomu Nakamura]] to mediate between the two sides, but this committee was stacked heavily in the company's favour. On 29 August, the fishing cooperative agreed to the mediation committee's proposal, stating: \"In order to end the anxiety of the citizens, we swallow our tears and accept\". The company paid the cooperative [[\u00a5]]20 million (US$183,477) and set up a \u00a515 million ($137,608) fund to promote the recovery of fishing.\n\n[[Image:Minamata protesters.jpg|thumb|right|Protestors at the gates of the Chisso factory (''[[W. Eugene Smith]]'')]]\n\nSince the change of route of wastewater output in 1958, pollution had spread up and down the Shiranui Sea, damaging fisheries there, too. Emboldened by the success of the small Minamata cooperative, the Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives also decided to seek compensation from Chisso. On 17 October, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory to demand negotiations. When this produced no results, the alliance members took their campaign to [[Tokyo]], securing an official visit to Minamata by members of the Japanese [[Diet of Japan|Diet]]. During the visit on 2 November, alliance members forced their way into the factory and rioted, causing many injuries and \u00a510 million ($100,000) worth of damage. The violence was covered widely in the media, bringing the nation's attention to the Minamata issue for the first time since the outbreak began. Another mediation committee was set up, and an agreement was hammered out and signed on 17 December. Some \u00a525 million of \"sympathy money\" was paid to the alliance and a \u00a565 million fishing recovery fund was established.\n\nIn 1959, the victims of Minamata disease were in a much weaker position than the fishermen. The recently formed Minamata Disease Patients Families Mutual Aid Society was much more divided than the fishing cooperatives. Patients' families were the victim of [[discrimination]] and [[ostracism]] from the local community. Local people felt that the company (and their city that depended upon it) was facing economic ruin. To some patients, this ostracism by the community represented a greater fear than the disease itself. After beginning a [[sit-in]] at the factory gates in November 1959, the patients asked [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] Governor [[Hirosaku Teramoto]] to include the patients' request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance. Chisso agreed and after a few weeks' further negotiation, another \"sympathy money\" agreement was signed. Patients who were certified by a [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] committee would be compensated: adult patients received \u00a5100,000 ($917) per year; children \u00a530,000 ($275) per year, and families of dead patients would receive a one-off \u00a5320,000 ($2935) payment.\n\n=== Wastewater treatment ===\n\nOn October 21, 1959, Chisso was ordered by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to switch back its wastewater drainage from the Minamata River to Hyakken Harbour and to speed up the installation of wastewater treatment systems at the factory. Chisso installed a [[Cyclator]] purification system on December 19, 1959, and opened it with a special ceremony. Chisso's president [[Kiichi Yoshioka]] drank a glass of water supposedly treated through the Cyclator to demonstrate that it was safe. In fact, the wastewater from the acetaldehyde plant, which the company knew still contained mercury and led to Minamata disease when fed to cats, was not treated through the Cyclator at the time. Testimony at a later [[Niigata Minamata disease]] trial proved that Chisso knew the Cyclator to be completely ineffective: \"The purification tank was installed as a social solution and did nothing to remove organic mercury.\"<ref>Harada, p56</ref>\n\nThe deception was successful and almost all parties involved in Minamata disease were duped into believing that the factory's wastewater had been made safe from December 1959 onward. This widespread assumption meant that doctors were not expecting new patients to appear, resulting in numerous problems in the years to follow, as the pollution continued. In most people's minds, the issue of Minamata disease had been resolved.\n\n== 1959\u20131969 ==\n\nThe years between the first set of \"sympathy money\" agreements in 1959 and the start of the first legal action to be taken against Chisso in 1969 are often called the \"ten years of silence\". In fact, much activity on the part of the patients and fishermen took place during this period, but nothing had a significant impact on the actions of the company or the coverage of Minamata in the national media.\n\n=== Continued pollution ===\n\nDespite the almost universal assumption to the contrary, the wastewater treatment facilities installed in December 1959 had no effect on the level of organic mercury being released into the Shiranui Sea. The pollution and the disease it caused continued to spread. The Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectural governments conducted a joint survey in late 1960 and early 1961 into the level of mercury in the hair of people living around the Shiranui Sea. The results confirmed that organic mercury had spread all around the inland sea and that people were still being poisoned by contaminated fish. Hundreds of people were discovered to have levels greater than 50 ppm of mercury in their hair, the level at which people are likely to experience nerve damage. The highest result recorded was that of a woman from [[Goshonoura, Kumamoto|Goshonoura]] island who had 920 ppm in her sample.\n\nThe prefectural governments did not publish the results and did nothing in response to these surveys. The participants who had donated hair samples were not informed of their result, even when they requested it. A follow-up study ten years later discovered that many had died from \"unknown causes\".<ref>George, pp144-145</ref>\n\n=== Congenital Minamata disease ===\n\nLocal doctors and medical officials had noticed for a long time an abnormally high frequency of [[cerebral palsy]] and other infantile disorders in the Minamata area. In 1961, a number of medical professionals including [[Masazumi Harada]] (later to receive an [[Global 500 Roll of Honour|honour from the United Nations]] for his body of work on Minamata disease) set about re-examining children diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The symptoms of the children closely mirrored those of adult Minamata disease patients, but many of their mothers did not exhibit symptoms. The fact that these children had been born after the initial outbreak and had never been fed contaminated fish also led their mothers to believe they were not victims. At the time the medical establishment believed the [[placenta]] would protect the <!--This article is in Commonwealth English - please do not change foetus to fetus-->[[foetus]] from toxins in the bloodstream, which is indeed the case with most chemicals. What was not known at the time was that exactly the opposite is the case with methylmercury: the placenta removes it from the mother's bloodstream and concentrates the chemical in the <!--This article is in Commonwealth English - please do not change foetus to fetus-->foetus.\n\nAfter several years of study and the [[autopsies]] of two children, the doctors announced that these children were suffering from an as yet unrecognised [[congenital]] form of Minamata disease. The certification committee convened on 29 November 1962 and agreed that the two dead children and the 16 children still alive should be certified as patients, and therefore liable for \"sympathy\" payments from Chisso, in line with the 1959 agreement.<ref>Harada, pp68-77</ref>\n\n=== Outbreak of Niigata Minamata disease ===\n{{Details|Niigata Minamata disease}}\n\nMinamata disease broke out again in 1965, this time along the banks of the [[Agano River]] in [[Niigata Prefecture]]. The polluting factory (owned by [[Showa Denko]]) employed a chemical process using a mercury catalyst very similar to that used by Chisso in Minamata. As in Minamata, from the autumn of 1964 to the spring of 1965, cats living along the banks of the Agano River had been seen to go mad and die. Before long, patients appeared with identical symptoms to patients living on the Shiranui Sea, and the outbreak was made public on 12 June 1965. Researchers from the Kumamoto University Research Group and [[Hajime Hosokawa]] (who had retired from Chisso in 1962) used their experience from Minamata and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. In September 1966, a report was issued proving Showa Denko's pollution to be the cause of this second Minamata disease.\n\nUnlike the patients in Minamata, the victims of Showa Denko's pollution lived a considerable distance from the factory and had no particular link to the company. As a result, the local community was much more supportive of patients' groups and a lawsuit was filed against the company in March 1968, only three years after discovery.\n\nThe events in Niigata catalysed a change in response to the original Minamata incident. The scientific research carried out in Niigata forced a re-examination of that done in Minamata and the decision of Niigata patients to sue the polluting company allowed the same response to be considered in Minamata. Masazumi Harada has said that, \"It may sound strange, but if this second Minamata disease had not broken out, the medical and social progress achieved by now in Kumamoto... would have been impossible.\"<ref>Harada, p90</ref>\n\nAround this time, two other pollution-related diseases were also grabbing headlines in Japan. Victims of [[Yokkaichi Asthma|Yokkaichi asthma]] and [[Itai-itai disease]] were forming citizens' groups and filed lawsuits against the polluting companies in September 1967 and March 1968, respectively. As a group, these diseases came to be known as the [[four big pollution diseases of Japan]].<ref>George, pp174-175</ref>\n\nSlowly but surely, the mood in Minamata and Japan as a whole was shifting. Minamata patients found the public gradually becoming more receptive and sympathetic as the decade wore on. This culminated in 1968 with the establishment in Minamata of the Citizens' Council for Minamata Disease Countermeasures, which was to become the chief citizens' support group to the Minamata patients. A founding member of the citizens' council was [[Michiko Ishimure]], a local housewife and poet who later that year published {{nihongo|''Pure Land, Poisoned Sea: Our Minamata disease''|\u82e6\u6d77\u6d44\u571f\u2015\u308f\u304c\u6c34\u4fe3\u75c5|Kugai J\u014ddo: Waga Minamataby\u014d}} a book of poetic essays that received national acclaim.\n\n== 1969\u20131973 ==\n\n=== Official government recognition ===\n\nFinally on 26 September 1968 \u2013 12 years after the discovery of the disease (and four months after Chisso had stopped production of acetaldehyde using its mercury catalyst) \u2013 the government issued an official conclusion as to the cause of Minamata disease:\n\n{{quote|Minamata disease is a disease of the central nervous system, a poisoning caused by long-term consumption, in large amounts, of fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay. The causative agent is methylmercury. Methylmercury produced in the acetaldehyde acetic acid facility of Shin Nihon Chisso's Minamata factory was discharged in factory wastewater... Minamata disease patients last appeared in 1960, and the outbreak has ended. This is presumed to be because consumption of fish and shellfish from Minamata Bay was banned in the fall of 1957, and the fact that the factory had waste-treatment facilities in place from January 1960.}}\n\nThe conclusion contained many factual errors: eating fish and shellfish from other areas of the Shiranui Sea, not just Minamata Bay, could cause the disease; eating small amounts, as well as large amounts of contaminated fish over a long time also produced symptoms; the outbreak had not, in fact, ended in 1960 nor had mercury-removing wastewater facilities been installed in January 1960. Nevertheless, the government announcement brought a feeling of relief to a great many victims and their families. Many felt vindicated in their long struggle to force Chisso to accept responsibility for causing the disease and expressed thanks that their plight had been recognised by their social superiors. The struggle now focused on to what extent the victims should be compensated.<ref>George, pp187-190</ref>\n\n=== Struggle for a new agreement ===\n\nIn light of the government announcement, the patients of the Mutual Aid Society decided to ask for a new compensation agreement with Chisso and submitted the demand on the 6th of October. The company replied that it was unable to judge what would be fair compensation and asked the national government to set up a binding arbitration committee to decide. This proposal split the members of the patients' society, many of whom were extremely wary of entrusting their fate to a third party, as they had done in 1959 with unfortunate results. At a meeting on the 5th of April 1969, the opposing views within the society could not be reconciled and the organisation split into the arbitration group (who were willing to accept binding arbitration) and the litigation group (who decided to sue the company). That summer, Chisso sent gifts to the families who opted for arbitration rather than litigation.\n\n[[Image:Patients and family members hold photographs of their dead.jpg|thumb|right|Minamata patients and family members hold photographs of their dead during a demonstration (W. E. Smith)]]\n\nAn arbitration committee was duly set up by the Ministry of Health and Welfare on 25 April, but it took almost a year to draw up a draft compensation plan. A newspaper leak in March 1970 revealed that the committee would ask Chisso to pay only \u00a52 million ($5,600) for dead patients and \u00a5140,000 to \u00a5200,000 ($390 to $560) per year to surviving patients. The arbitration group were dismayed by the sums on offer. They petitioned the committee, together with patients and supporters of the litigation group, for a fairer deal. The arbitration committee announced their compensation plan on 25 May in a disorderly session at the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Tokyo. Thirteen protesters were arrested. Instead of accepting the agreement as they had promised, the arbitration group asked for increases. The committee was forced to revise its plan and the patients waited inside the ministry building for two days while they did so. The final agreement was signed on 27 May. Payments for deaths ranged from \u00a51.7 million to \u00a54 million ($4,700 to $11,100), one-time payments from \u00a51 million to \u00a54.2 million ($2,760 to $11,660) and annual payments between \u00a5170,000 and \u00a5380,000 ($470 to $1,100) for surviving patients. On the day of the signing, the Minamata Citizens' Council held a protest outside the Minamata factory gates. One of the Chisso [[trade unions]] held an eight-hour strike in protest at the poor treatment of the arbitration group by their own company.<ref name=arb>George, pp191-202 (Arbitration Group)</ref>\n\nThe litigation group, representing 41 certified patients (17 already deceased) in 28 families, submitted their suit against Chisso in the [[Kumamoto District Court]] on 14 June 1969. The leader of the group, [[Eiz\u014d Watanabe]] (a former leader of the Mutual Aid Society), declared, \"Today, and from this day forth, we are fighting against the power of the state.\" Those who decided to sue the company came under fierce pressure to drop their lawsuits. One woman was visited personally by a Chisso executive and harassed by her neighbours. She was ignored, her family's fishing boat used without permission, their fishing nets were cut, and human faeces were thrown at her in the street.<ref>George, p205</ref>\n\nThe litigation group and their lawyers were helped substantially by an informal national network of citizens' groups that had sprung up around the country in 1969. The {{nihongo|Associations to Indict [Those Responsible for] Minamata Disease|\u6c34\u4fe3\u75c5\u3092\u544a\u767a\u3059\u308b\u4f1a|Minamata-by\u014d o Kokuhatsu Suru Kai}} were instrumental in raising awareness and funds for the lawsuit. The Kumamoto branch, in particular, was especially helpful to the case. In September 1969, they set up a Trial Research Group, which included law professors, medical researchers (including [[Masazumi Harada]]), sociologists and even the housewife and poet Michiko Ishimure to provide useful material to the lawyers to improve their legal arguments. In fact, their report, ''Corporate Responsibility for Minamata Disease: Chisso's Illegal Acts'',<ref>{{nihongo|''Corporate Responsibility for Minamata Disease: Chisso's Illegal Acts''|\u6c34\u4fe3\u75c5\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u4f01\u696d\u306e\u8cac\u4efb\uff1a\u30c1\u30c3\u30bd\u306e\u4e0d\u6cd5\u884c\u70ba|Minamata-by\u014d ni Tai Suru Kigy\u014d no Sekinin: Chisso no Fuh\u014d K\u014di}}</ref> published in August 1970, formed the basis of the ultimately successful lawsuit.<ref name=arb/>\n\nThe trial lasted almost four years. The litigation group lawyers sought to prove Chisso's [[Negligence|corporate negligence]]. Three main legal points had to be overcome to win the case. First, the lawyers had to show that methylmercury caused Minamata disease and that the company's factory was the source of pollution. The extensive research by Kumamoto University and the government conclusion meant that this point was proved quite easily. Second, could and should the company have anticipated the effect of its wastewater and should it have taken steps to prevent the tragedy (i.e., was the company negligent in its [[duty of care]])? Third, was the \"sympathy money\" agreement of 1959, which forbade the patients from claiming any further compensation, a legally binding contract?\n\nThe trial heard from patients and their families, but the most important testimony came from Chisso executives and employees. The most dramatic testimony came from Hajime Hosokawa, who spoke on 4 July 1970 from his hospital bed where he was dying of cancer. He explained his experiments with cats, including the infamous \"cat 400\", which developed Minamata disease after being fed factory wastewater. He also spoke of his opposition to the 1958 change in wastewater output route from Hyakken Harbour to Minamata River. His testimony was backed up by a colleague who also told how company officials had ordered them to halt their cat experiments in the autumn of 1959. Hajime Hosokawa died three months after giving his testimony. Former factory manager [[Eiichi Nishida]] admitted that the company put profits ahead of safety, resulting in dangerous working conditions and a lack of care with mercury. Former Chisso President [[Kiichi Yoshioka]] admitted that the company promoted a theory of dumped [[World War II]] explosives, though it knew it to be unfounded. \n\nThe verdict handed down on 20 March 1973 represented a complete victory for the patients of the litigation group:\n\n{{quote|The defendant's factory was a leading chemical plant with the most advanced technology and ... should have assured the safety of its wastewater. The defendant could have prevented the occurrence of Minamata disease or at least have kept it at a minimum. We cannot find that the defendant took any of the precautionary measures called for in this situation whatsoever. The presumption that the defendant had been negligent from beginning to end in discharging wastewater from its acetaldehyde plant is amply supported. The defendant cannot escape liability for negligence.}}\n\nThe \"sympathy money\" agreement was found to be invalid and Chisso was ordered to make one-time payments of \u00a518 million ($66,000) for each deceased patient and from \u00a516 million to \u00a518 million ($59,000 to $66,000) for each surviving patient. The total compensation of \u00a5937 million ($3.4 million) was the largest sum ever awarded by a Japanese court.<ref>George, pp241-249</ref>\n\n=== Uncertified patients' fight to be recognised ===\n\nWhile the struggles of the arbitration and litigation groups against Chisso were continuing, a new group of Minamata disease sufferers emerged. To qualify for compensation under the 1959 agreement, patients had to be officially recognised by various ''ad hoc'' certification committees according to their symptoms. However, in an effort to limit the liability and financial burden on the company, these committees were sticking to a rigid interpretation of Minamata disease. They required that patients must exhibit all symptoms of [[Hunter-Russell syndrome]] \u2013 the standard diagnosis of organic mercury poisoning at the time \u2013 which originated from an industrial accident in the United Kingdom in 1940. The committee certified only patients exhibiting explicit symptoms of the British syndrome, rather than basing their diagnosis on the disease in Japan. This resulted in many applicants being rejected by the committee, leaving them confused and frustrated.<ref>Harada, pp156-157 and George, p208</ref>\n\n== Epidemiology ==\n\nAs of March 2001, 2,265 victims had been officially certified (1,784 of whom have died)<ref name=officialnumbers/> and over 10,000 people had received financial compensation from Chisso,<ref name=compensationnumbers/> although they were not recognised as official victims. The issue of quantifying the impact of Minamata disease is complicated, as a full [[epidemiological study]] has never been conducted and patients were recognised only if they voluntarily applied to a certification council to seek financial compensation.<ref name=Guardian1>See [https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,574782,00.html \"Mercury poisoning of thousands confirmed\"] by Jonathan Watts, ''The Guardian'', 16 October 2001, retrieved 24 October 2006.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kawamura|first=Hiroki|date=2017|title=The relation between law and technology in Japan: liability for technology-related mass damage in the cases of Minamata disease, asbestos, and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|journal=Contemporary Japan|volume=30 |issue=1|pages=3\u201327|doi=10.1080/18692729.2018.1423459}}</ref> Many victims of Minamata disease faced discrimination and ostracism from the local community if they came out into the open about their symptoms. Some people feared the disease to be contagious, and many local people were fiercely loyal to Chisso, depending on the company for their livelihoods. In this atmosphere, sufferers were reluctant to come forward and seek certification. Despite these factors, over 17,000 people have applied to the council for certification. Also, in recognising an applicant as a Minamata disease sufferer, the certification council qualified that patient to receive financial compensation from Chisso. For that reason, the council has always been under immense pressure to reject claimants and minimise the financial burden placed on Chisso. Rather than being a council of medical recognition, the decisions of the council were always affected by the economic and political factors surrounding Minamata and the Chisso corporation. Furthermore, compensation of the victims led to continued strife in the community, including unfounded accusations that some of the people who sought compensation did not actually suffer from the disease.<ref>See [http://soshisha.org/english/10tishiki_e/10chishiki_e.htm \"Ten Things to Know about Minamata Disease\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725010737/http://soshisha.org/english/10tishiki_e/10chishiki_e.htm |date=2012-07-25 }} by Soshisha \u2013 The Supporting Center for Minamata Disease</ref> More properly, the impact should be called a criminal 'poisoning', not a clinical 'disease'.

Instead, the afflicted were ostracised from their community due to ignorance about the disease, as people were afraid that it was contagious.\n\nThe people directly impacted by the pollution of Minamata Bay were not originally allowed to participate in actions that would affect their future. Disease victims, fishing families, and company employees were excluded from the debate. Progress occurred when Minamata victims were finally allowed to come to a meeting to discuss the issue. As a result, postwar Japan took a small step toward democracy.\n\nThrough the evolution of public sentiments, the victims and environmental protesters were able to acquire standing and proceed more effectively in their cause. The involvement of the press also aided the process of democratization because it caused more people to become aware of the facts of Minamata disease and the pollution that caused it.\n\nAlthough the environmental protests did result in Japan becoming more democratized, it did not completely rid Japan of the system that first suppressed the fishermen and victims of Minamata disease.\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n[[Toshiko Akiyoshi]], touched by the plight of the fishing village, wrote a jazz suite, \"Minamata\", that was to be the central piece of the Toshiko Akiyoshi-Lew Tabackin Big Band's 1976 album on RCA, [[Insights (album)|''Insights'']].  The piece was constructed in three parts, to musically reflect the tragedy \u2013 \"Peaceful Village\", \"Prosperity & Consequence\", and \"Epilogue\".  Akiyoshi used Japanese vocalists to sing the Japanese lyrics of a tone poem that were part of the composition.  The album won many awards in jazz circles, including ''Downbeat'''s best album award, largely on the strength of this piece, which brought some further attention to the tragedy.<ref>Record Review magazine vol 2 no 3 August 1978 \u2013 Scott Yanow; Downbeat (http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=704); liner notes for Toshiko Akiyoshi/Lew Tabackin Big Band LP, Insights 1976 RCA VICTOR   AFL1-2678  STEREO</ref> [[Insights (Toshiko Akiyoshi \u2013 Lew Tabackin Big Band)]]\n\nThe song \"Kepone Factory\" on [[Dead Kennedys]]' ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' makes reference to the disaster in its chorus.\n\nThe song \"The Disease of the Dancing Cats\" by the band [[Bush (band)|Bush]] on \"The Science of Things\" album is in reference to the disaster.\n\n=== Media ===\nPhotographic documentation of Minamata started in the early 1960s. One photographer who arrived in 1960 was [[Shisei Kuwabara]], straight from university and photo school, who had his photographs published in ''[[Weekly Asahi]]'' as early as May 1960. The first exhibition of his photographs of Minamata was held in the [[Fujifilm|Fuji]] Photo Salon in Tokyo in 1962, and the first of his book-length anthologies, ''Minamata Disease'', was published in Japan in 1965. He has returned to Minamata many times since.<ref name=\"kmopa\">\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20011223130736/http://www.kmopa.com/minamata/minamata.htm Shisei Kuwabara \u2013 'Minamata': The Starting point of the work of the photojournalist, Shisei Kuwabara]\", KMoPA.

His Japanese wife and he lived in Minamata from 1971 to 1973. The most famous and striking photo of the essay, ''[[Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath]]'' (1972), shows Ryoko Uemura, holding her severely deformed daughter, Tomoko, in a Japanese bath chamber. Tomoko was poisoned by methylmercury while still in the womb. The photo was very widely published. It was posed by Smith with the co-operation of Ryoko and Tomoko to dramatically illustrate the consequences of the disease. It has subsequently been withdrawn from circulation at the request of Tomoko's family, so does not appear in recent anthologies of Smith's works.<ref name=Tomoko>Read the thoughts of a photography magazine editor surrounding the controversy of the photograph's withdrawal: [http://www.digitaljournalist.org/issue0007/hughes.htm \"Tomoko Uemura, R.I.P.\"] by Jim Hughes, ''The Digital Journalist,'' retrieved 24 October 2006.</ref> Smith and his wife were extremely dedicated to the cause of the victims of Minamata disease, closely documenting their struggle for recognition and right to compensation. Smith was himself attacked and seriously injured by Chisso employees in an incident in Goi, [[Ichihara, Chiba|Ichihara]] city, near Tokyo on January 7, 1972, in an attempt to stop the photographer from further revealing the issue to the world.<ref>Smith, pp94-95</ref> The 54-year-old Smith survived the attack, but his sight in one eye deteriorated and his health never fully recovered before his death in 1978.<!-- Well, no, it didn't; but while I don't want to whitewash the disgusting actions of Chissos' goons, plenty of other factors  hastened Smith's death.

Their next-door neighbors, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (predecessor of [[Spain]]) had been somewhat slower to begin exploring the Atlantic because of the bigger land area it had to re-conquer (the ''[[Reconquista]]'') from the [[Moors]]. It was not until the late 15th century, following the [[dynastic union]] of the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and the completion of the ''Reconquista'', that the unified crowns of what would become Spain (although countries still legally existing) emerged and became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492 the joint rulers conquered the [[Granada#Nasrid Kingdom of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through [[tribute]]. Columbus had previously failed to convince King [[John II of Portugal]] to fund his exploration of a western route, but the new king and queen of the re-conquered Spain decided to fund Columbus's expedition in hopes of bypassing Portugal's lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean, reaching Asia by traveling west.<ref>Jensen, De Ladickmar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe 2nd ed.'' p. 341</ref>\n\n===Funding campaign===\nHe proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out west into the Atlantic, search for a western route to [[India]], and return.

The king submitted the proposal to his experts, who rejected it after several years. It was their considered opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km}} was far too short.<ref name = \"Morison-Admiral\"/>\n\nIn 1488 Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal, receiving a new invitation for an audience with King John II. This also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal following a successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa. With an eastern sea route now under its control, Portugal was no longer interested in trailblazing a western trade route to Asia crossing unknown seas. Columbus traveled to Castile to convince the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Castile and Aragon to finance the expedition.\n\n====Spanish procurement====\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2010}}\nKing [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] married Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469, uniting the two largest kingdoms into what would later be the Spanish Crown. They were known jointly as the Catholic Monarchs, and ruled their kingdoms independently, but had common internal and foreign policies.\n\nColumbus was granted an audience with them; on May 1, 1489, he presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who referred them to a committee. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised the monarchs not to support the proposed venture.\n\nHowever, to expand the Spanish empire and Catholicism in the name of Spanish Kings, and to assure a better market position in trading, the Queen gave Columbus an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and part of the newly conquered lands.<ref>Durant, Will ''\"The Story of Civilization\"'' Vol. VI, \"The Reformation\".

Detail of the Columbus monument in [[Madrid]] (1885).]]\n\nAfter continually lobbying at the royal court and enduring two years of negotiations, Columbus finally succeeded in January 1492. Queen Isabella's forces had just conquered the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim stronghold of [[Al-Andalus]] on the [[Iberian peninsula]], for Castile. Isabella and Ferdinand received Columbus in the ''[[Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alc\u00e1zar]]'' (castle) in [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]] to support his plans.\n\nThe monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made \"Admiral of the Seas\" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous but, as his son later wrote, the monarchs were not confident of his return.\n\nAccording to Columbus's contract made for the expedition commission by Queen Isabella for Castile, if Columbus claimed any new islands or mainland for the Crown, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor#Other colonial empires|Governor]] of the newly colonised lands. He had the right to nominate three people, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to ten per cent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity.<ref>Stuart, ''Isabella of Castile: the first Renaissance queen'', 2004, p. 295.</ref>\n\n===Navigation plans===\nEurope had long enjoyed a safe land passage to China and India\u2014sources of valued goods such as [[silk]], [[spices]], and [[opium|opiates]]\u2014under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] (the [[Pax Mongolica]], or ''Mongol peace''). With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. In response to this the [[Bartholomew Columbus|Columbus brothers]] had, by the 1480s, developed a plan to travel to the [[East Indies|Indies]], then construed roughly as all of southern and eastern Asia, by sailing directly west across what was believed to be the singular \"[[World Ocean|Ocean Sea]],\" the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] thought [[flat earth|the Earth was flat]].<ref name=\"book3\">{{cite book | first=Paul F | last=Boller | title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-19-509186-1 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | url=https://archive.org/details/notsopopularmyth00boll }}</ref> In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the [[spherical Earth]].

In fact [[Eratosthenes]] had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the 2nd century BC.<ref name=Sagan /> Where Columbus did differ from the generally accepted view of his time was in his incorrect arguments that assumed a significantly smaller diameter for the Earth, claiming that Asia could be easily reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising Eurasia and Africa) occupied 180 [[longitude|degrees]] of the terrestrial sphere, and dismissed Columbus's claim that the Earth was much smaller, and that Asia was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of Europe. Columbus's error was attributed to his insufficient experience in navigation at sea.<ref name=\"Morison-Admiral\">Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: The Life of Christopher Columbus'' Boston, 1942</ref>\n\n[[File:ColombusMap.jpg|thumb|The \"Columbus map\" was drawn circa 1490 in the workshop of Bartolomeo and Christopher Columbus in [[Lisbon]].<ref>\"Marco Polo et le Livre des Merveilles\", {{ISBN|978-2-35404-007-9}} p. 37</ref>]]\n[[File:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Handwritten notes by Christopher Columbus on the Latin edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s ''Le livre des merveilles'']]\nColumbus believed the incorrect calculations of [[Marinus of Tyre]],<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia | title = Christopher Columbus (Italian explorer) | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | edition = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc | year = 2013 | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127070/Christopher-Columbus | accessdate = September 12, 2013}}</ref> putting the landmass at 225 degrees, leaving only 135 degrees of water.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=STzVAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=Marinus+of+Tyre+225+135&source=bl&ots=lDjJ6eR5Sf&sig=0MDrD6oMNo4PXVY7Bf8ICxFOjO8&hl=pl&sa=X&ei=v7NhUpP3CubU4wTnhYHYCg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Marinus%20of%20Tyre%20225%20135&f=false]<!--may be based on this article--></ref> Moreover, Columbus believed that one degree represented a shorter distance on the Earth's surface than was actually the case \u2013 he read maps as if the distances were calculated in [[Italian mile]]s (about 1,480 meters). Accepting the length of a degree to be 56\u2154 miles<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->, from the writings of [[Alfraganus]], he therefore calculated the circumference of the Earth as {{convert|25,255|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}<!--need Arabic and statute/U.S. mile--> at most, and the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan as 3,000 Italian miles ({{convert|3,700|km|nmi mi|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}}). Columbus did not realize Alfraganus used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe true circumference of the Earth is about {{convert|40,000|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}, a figure first established approximately by [[Eratosthenes]] in the 2nd century BC,<ref name=\"Sagan\">Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.</ref> and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan {{convert|19,600|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}. No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, probably correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from Europe to Asia non-stop would die of thirst, [[scurvy]] or starvation long before reaching their destination. Spain, however, having just completed the expensive [[Reconquista]], was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the [[East Indies]]. Columbus promised such an advantage.\n\nEuropeans generally assumed that the aquatic expanse between Europe and Asia was uninterrupted. While hints of North America, [[Vinland]], were already surfacing in Europe, historians agree that Columbus calculated too short a distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan by the standards of his peers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n====Trade winds====\nThere was a further element of key importance in the plans of Columbus, a closely held fact discovered by or otherwise learned by Columbus: the [[Trade Winds]]. A brisk westward wind from the east, commonly called an \"[[Easterlies|easterly]]\", propelled ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'', ''[[Ni\u00f1a|La Ni\u00f1a]]'', and ''[[Pinta (ship)|La Pinta]]'' for five weeks from the Canary Islands off Africa. To return to Spain eastward against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique upwind, called [[Sailing#Upwind|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would have been utterly exhausted. Columbus returned home by following prevailing winds northeastward from the southern zone of the North Atlantic to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where prevailing winds are eastward (westerly) to the coastlines of [[Western Europe]], where the winds curve southward towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. So he used the North Atlantic's great circular wind pattern, clockwise in direction, in both legs of his voyage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|title=The First Voyage Log|accessdate=2008-04-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091014015153/http://www.columbusnavigation.com/v1a.shtml|archivedate=2009-10-14}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/columbus.html|title=Christopher Columbus and the Spanish Empire\n  | accessdate = 2008-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==Voyages and events==\n\n===First voyage===\n\nAt 8:00 on the morning of August 3, 1492, Columbus departed from Carolina [[Palos de la Frontera]] (on the [[Rio Saltes|river Saltes]], at the confluence of the rivers [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] and [[Rio Odiel]]).<ref name=\"tharoor\">{{cite magazine|last1=Tharoor|first1=Shashi|title=Trying to discover India|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/trying-to-discover-india/292728|accessdate=25 October 2016|magazine=Outlook India|date=8 December 2014}}</ref> Columbus and his crew embarked on a voyage to find a shorter route to [[India]] and the [[Orient]] with three medium-sized ships, the ''[[Ni\u00f1a]]'' (real name ''Santa Clara''), the [[Pinta (ship)|''Pinta'']], and the [[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|''Santa Maria'']].

Most of modern [[Central America]] was part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] societies of Mesoamerica occupied the land ranging from central [[Mexico]] in the north to [[Costa Rica]] in the south. The cultures of [[Panama]] traded with both Mesoamerica and [[South America]] and can be considered [[Intermediate Area|transitional between those two cultural areas]].\n\nColumbus proceeded to observe the people and their cultural lifestyle. He also explored the northeast coast of Cuba, landing on October 28, 1492, and the north-western coast of Hispaniola, present day [[Haiti]], by December 5, 1492. Here, the ''Santa Maria'' ran aground on [[Christmas Day]], December 25, 1492, and had to be abandoned. Columbus was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus founded the settlement, ''[[La Navidad]]'', leaving behind 39 men.\n\nOn January 15, 1493, he set sail for home aboard the ''Ni\u00f1a''.\n\n====First return====\nWhile returning to Spain, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and ''Pinta'' encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, on the night of February 13, lost contact with each other. All hands on the ''Ni\u00f1a'' vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the [[Azore Islands]], but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' laid anchor at [[Santa Maria Island]], but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Ni\u00f1a moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he and the rest of the crew stayed on the Ni\u00f1a, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, Jo\u00e3o de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the ''Ni\u00f1a'', in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Columbus in the Azores|jstor = 41104900|journal = Portuguese Studies|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 17\u201323|volume = 6|first = Rebecca|last = Catz}}</ref>\n\nLeaving the island of Santa Maria in the Azores on February 23, Columbus headed for Castilian Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the king's harbor patrol ship on March 4, 1493, where he was told a fleet of 100 [[caravels]] had been lost in the storm. Astoundingly, both the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and the ''Pinta'' had been spared. Not finding [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] of Portugal in Lisbon, Columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for the king's reply. After receiving the letter, the king agreed to meet with Columbus in ''Vale do Para\u00edso'' despite poor relations between Portugal and Castile at the time. Upon learning of Columbus's discoveries, the Portuguese king informed him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]]. After spending more than a week in Portugal, Columbus set sail for Spain. Word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout Europe. After the voyage, Columbus met with Spanish monarchs [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] in [[Barcelona]] on March 15, 1493 to report his findings. The [[Columbus Monument, Barcelona|''Monument a Colom'']] in that city commemorates the event.\n\nColumbus and his remaining crew came home to a hero's welcome when they returned to Spain. He showed off what he had brought back from his voyage to the monarchs, including a few small samples of gold, [[pearl]]s, gold jewelry stolen from natives, a few natives he had kidnapped, flowers, and a hammock. He gave the monarchs a few of the gold nuggets, gold jewelry, and pearls, as well as the previously unknown tobacco plant, the pineapple fruit, the turkey, and the hammock. The monarchs invited Columbus to dine with them. A taster even tasted the food from each of his dishes before he ate to \"make sure it was not poisoned\". He was given his own footmen to open doors for him and to serve him at the table. Columbus was even rewarded with his own coat of arms. He did not bring any of the coveted [[East Indies]] spices, such as the exceedingly expensive black pepper, ginger or cloves. In his log, he wrote \"there is also plenty of 'aj\u00ed', which is their pepper, which is more valuable than black pepper, and all the people eat nothing else, it being very wholesome\".<ref>Turner, 2004, p. 11</ref> The word \"aj\u00ed\" is still used in South American Spanish for chili peppers.\n\n[[Columbus's letter on the first voyage]] to the royal court in Madrid was extravagant. He insisted he had reached Asia (it was Cuba) and an island off the coast of China (Hispaniola). His descriptions were part fact, part fiction: \"Hispaniola is a miracle.

Accessed 21 May 2012.</ref>\n\n====Caribbean exploration====\nOn November 3, 1493, Christopher Columbus landed on a rugged shore on an island that he named [[Dominica]]. On the same day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named Santa Mar\u00eda la Galante. After sailing past Les Saintes (Todos los Santos), he arrived at [[Guadeloupe]] (Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe), which he explored between November 4 and November 10, 1493. The exact course of his voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming many islands including Santa Mar\u00eda de Montserrat ([[Montserrat]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua ([[Antigua]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Redonda ([[Saint Martin]]), and Santa Cruz ([[Saint Croix]]). He also sighted and named the island chain of the Santa \u00darsula y las Once Mil V\u00edrgenes (the [[Virgin Islands]]), and named the islands of Virgen Gorda. He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed on the island of San Juan Bautista, present day [[Puerto Rico]], on November 19, 1493. His men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.<ref>Philips and Philips, The Worlds of Christopher Columbus</ref>\n\n====Hispaniola and Jamaica====\nOn November 22, he returned to Hispaniola, where he found his men at [[La Navidad]] had fallen into dispute with natives in the interior and had been killed, but he did not accuse Chief [[Guacanagari]], his ally, of any wrongdoing. Another Chief, named [[Caonabo]] in Maguana, was charged. Columbus established a new settlement at [[La Isabela]], on the north coast of Hispaniola, where gold had first been found, but it was a poor location and the settlement was short-lived. He spent some time exploring the interior of the island for gold. Finding some, he established a small fort in the interior.\n\nHe left Hispaniola on April 24, 1494, and arrived at the island of Juana ([[Cuba]]) (which he had discovered and named during his first voyage) on April 30 and [[Discovery Bay, Jamaica]] on May 5. He explored the south coast of Juana, which he believed to be a peninsula of [[China]] rather than an island, and several nearby islands including La Evangelista (the [[Isle of Youth]]), before returning to Hispaniola on August 20. After staying for a time on the western end of present-day [[Haiti]] he finally returned to Spain.\n\n====Slavery, settlers, and tribute====\nDuring the second voyage,{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Columbus sent a letter to the monarchs proposing to enslave some of the Americas' people, specifically from the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] tribe, on the grounds of their independence-minded aggressiveness and their status as enemies of the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] tribe. Although his petition was refused by the Crown, in February 1495, Columbus disobeyed the Queen and took 1,600 people from the [[Arawak]] tribe who were then taken by the Carib as captives and slaves. No room was available for about 400 of the kidnapped Arawak leading to their release. The long-term consequence for the Arawaks of contact with Europeans was that thousands of people{{dubious|date=October 2016}}  were almost entirely exterminated by disease, infighting and economic despair.<ref>Montague, Peter. \"Celebrating Columbus Day\".

Of course, Columbus would never find [[Cathay]] ([[China]]) or [[Zipangu]] ([[Japan]]), and there was no longer any Great [[Khan (title)|Khan]] for trade treaties.\n\n[[Slavery]] was practiced widely at that time amongst many peoples of the world, including some Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} For the Portuguese\u2014from whom Columbus received most of his maritime training\u2014the profits from enslaving people had resulted in the first \"financial return\" on a 75-year [[investment]] in [[Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nColumbus enslaved five hundred and sixty people.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150602025738/https://www.boundless.com/world-history/textbooks/boundless-world-history-i-ancient-1600-textbook/early-modern-europe-12/the-age-of-discovery-57/spanish-exploration-and-the-voyages-of-christopher-columbus-217-13333/</ref> The slaves were shipped to Spain; 200 died during the route back to Spain, and half of the remainder were ill when they arrived. After legal proceedings in the ''Cortes'', some survivors were ordered released and to be returned to their ''las Americas'' homeland, whereas others were used by Queen Isabella as galley slaves.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Columbus, desperate to repay his investors, failed to realize that Isabella and Ferdinand did not plan to follow or allow Portuguese slavery policy{{which|date=May 2013}} in this respect. Rounding up the slaves led to the first major battle between the Spanish and the native peoples in their homeland, called by Europeans \"the [[New World]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nColumbus was eager to pay back dividends to those who had invested in his promise to fill his ships with gold. And since so many of the slaves died in captivity, he developed a plan while in the Province of Cibao on Hispaniola. Columbus imposed a tribute system, similar to that of the still-unknown [[Aztec#Tribute and trade|Aztec Empire tribute]] on the mainland.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}} All Cibaoan indigenous residents above 14 years of age were required to find and deliver a specific quota of gold every three months. Upon their doing so, they would receive copper tokens that they wore around their necks. Any Indian found without a copper token had their hands cut off and subsequently bled to death.<ref name=\"Zinn 2009 3\"/> Since there were no gold mines on the island, the Indians had no chance of meeting Columbus' quota and thousands are reported to have committed suicide.<ref>Koning, Hans. Columbus, His Enterprise: Exploding the Myth. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1976: 83-83.</ref>\n\nDespite or because of such extreme enforcement, Columbus did not obtain much gold, and many new foreign \"settlers\" were unhappy with the climate and disillusioned about their chances of getting rich quickly. A classic [[gold rush]] had been set off that would have tragic consequences for the [[Caribbean]]'s indigenous people and cultures. Anthropologists have shown there was more intermarriage and assimilation than previously believed (see the [[Black legend (Spain)]]).{{Citation needed|reason=9 May 2010|date=May 2010}} Columbus allowed settlers to return to their homeland with any Indian women with whom they had started families, or to Queen Isabella's fury, had kidnapped and owned as slaves.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Third voyage===\n[[File:Columbus third voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Third voyage]]\n\n====Exploration====\n[[File:AndalusAndMorocco.png|275px|thumb|Location of [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]], the starting point for Columbus's third journey.]]\nAccording to the abstract of Columbus's journal made by [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], the objective of the third voyage was to verify the existence of a continent that King John II of Portugal suggested was located to the southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.

He then sailed to the island of [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]]. The ships found King John's hypothesized continent, which is [[South America]], when they sighted the land of [[Trinidad]] on 31 July approaching from the southeast.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 124</ref> The fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered [[Columbus Channel|Dragon's Mouth]], anchoring near [[Soldado Rock]] where they made contact with a group of native [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] in canoes.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 125</ref> Columbus then landed on Trinidad at [[Icacos Point]] (which he named ''Punta de Arenal'') on August 2.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 126</ref>\n\nFrom August 4 through August 12, 1498, he explored the [[Gulf of Paria]] which separates Trinidad from mainland [[Venezuela]]. He then explored the mainland of South America, including the [[Orinoco]] River. He also sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island]] and sighted and named islands Bella Forma ([[Tobago]]) and Concepcion ([[Grenada]]).\n\n===Governorship issues===\n\n====Colonist rebellions====\nAfter his second journey, Columbus had requested that 330 people be sent to stay permanently (though voluntarily) on Hispaniola, all on the King's pay.   Specifically, he asked for 100 men to work as wood men soldiers and laborers, 50 farmers, 40 squires, 30 sailors, 30 cabin boys, 20 goldsmiths, 10 gardeners, 20 handymen, and 30 women.  In addition to this, plans were made to maintain friars and clergymen, a physician, a pharmacist, an herbalist, and musicians for entertaining the colonists.   Fearing that the King was going to restrict money allotted for wages, Columbus suggested that Spanish criminals be pardoned in exchange for a few years unpaid service in Hispaniola, and the King agreed to this.  A pardon for the death penalty would require 2 years of service, and one year of service was required for lesser crimes.  They also instructed that those who had been sentenced to exile would also be redirected to be exiled in Hispaniola.<ref> Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9. \"History of the Indies\". \"Trans. Andr\u00e9e M.

As these new Colonists arrived on Hispaniola, a rebellion was brewing under Francisco Rold\u00e1n (a man Columbus had left as chief mayor, under his brothers Diego and Bartolomew).   By the time Columbus arrived on Hispaniola, Rold\u00e1n held the territory of Xaragu\u00e1, and some of the new colonists had joined his rebellion.   Over months, Columbus tried negotiating with the rebels.  At some point in these negotiations Columbus ordered Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica, Rold\u00e1n's partner in rebellion, to be hanged.   Eventually, though, he capitulated to much of the Rold\u00e1n's demands.   Several other revolts broke out after that, but Rold\u00e1n, now restored as mayor, took part in putting them down, and tried and hanged one of the ringleaders, Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica.    <ref>\"[https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php Columbus: The Four Voyages, 1492-1504]\", by Laurence Bergreen, Penguin Books, 2012, Chapter 9, https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php </ref>\n\n====Governor Bobadilla====\nDuring Columbus's term as Viceroy and [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]], he had been accused of governing tyrannically, called \"the tyrant of the Caribbean\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted; his body was wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the [[Cortes Generales]] of Castile to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.\n\nThe Cortes appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]]; however, his authority stretched far beyond what Columbus had requested. Bobadilla was given complete control as governor from 1500 until he was killed in a hurricane in 1502. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla immediately received many serious complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolom\u00e9, and Diego.

He was 49 years old.\n\n====Arrest of Governor Columbus====\nColumbus was arrested in 1500 and supplanted from his posts. A number of returned settlers and friars lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him of mismanagement. [[Francisco de Bobadilla]] arrived on August 23, 1500 and detained Columbus and his brothers and had them shipped home. On October 1, 1500, Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spanish Aragon. Once in [[C\u00e1diz]], a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:\n<blockquote>\nIt is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land...\n\nI beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', p. 576.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze - Columbus Before the Queen.JPG|thumb|''Columbus Before the Queen''<ref>The Brooklyn Museum catalogue notes that the most likely source for Leutze's trio of Columbus paintings is [[Washington Irving]]'s best-selling ''Life and Voyages of Columbus'' (1828).</ref> by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]], 1843 ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art]])]]\nColumbus and his brothers were jailed for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered them released. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus's fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Christopher Columbus's role as governor. From that point forward, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]] was to be the new [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].\n\nAlthough he regained his freedom, he did not regain his prestige and lost all his titles including the governorship. As an added insult, the Portuguese had won the race to the [[East Indies]]: [[Vasco da Gama]] returned in September 1499 from a trip to India, having sailed east around Africa.\n\n===Fourth voyage===\n[[File:Columbus fourth voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Columbus's fourth voyage]]\n\nColumbus's fourth voyage was his final chance to prove himself and become the first man ever to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate the world]]. The goal was to find a westward passage through Central America and reach the [[Maluku Islands]], also known as the [[Spice islands|Spice Islands]].\n\nHis project turned into one of history's most epic--and forgotten--''''''adventures''''. Columbus would later claim that this fourth voyage was his greatest. It was without question his most daring, riskiest and most challenging<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?197565-1/the-voyage-columbus|title=The Last Voyage of Columbus|website=C-Span}}</ref>\n\nOn March 14, 1502 Columbus started his fourth voyage with 147 men and with strict orders from the king and queen which instructed him not to stop at Hispaniola, but only to search for a westward passage to the [[Indian Ocean]] mainland. Accompanied by his stepbrother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]], Diego Mendez, and his son [[Fernando Col\u00f3n|Fernando]], he left [[C\u00e1diz]], Spain on May 12, 1502, with his flagship, ''Capitana'', as well as the ''Gallega'', ''Vizca\u00edna,'' and ''Santiago de Palos''.\n\nHe sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue the '''Portuguese''' soldiers who he heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, 1502, they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (Martinica).\n\nColumbus anticipated a [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on June 29, 1502, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the [[Haina River]], the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. The only ship to reach Spain had Columbus's money and belongings on it, and all of his former enemies (and a few friends) had drowned, including [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], who had sent Columbus back to Spain in chains two years earlier.\n\nAfter surviving the hurricane he left Hispaniola and after a brief stop at [[Jamaica]] and off the coast of [[Cuba]] to replenish, he sailed to [[Central America]], arriving at [[Guanaja]] (Isla de los Pinos) in the [[Islas de la Bah\u00eda department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on July 30, 1502. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as \"long as a galley\" and was filled with cargo. On August 14, 1502, he landed on the mainland of the Americas at Puerto Castilla, near [[Trujillo, Honduras]]. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]] looking for the passage, before arriving in Almirante Bay, [[Panama]] on October 16, 1502.\n\nIn Panam\u00e1, he learned from the [[Ngobe]] of gold and a strait to another ocean. After some exploration, he established a garrison at the mouth of [[Bel\u00e9n River]] in January 1503.\n\nBy April 6, the garrison he had established captured the local tribe leader [[El Quib\u00edan]], who had demanded they not go down{{dubious|date=January 2016}} the Bel\u00e9n River. El Quib\u00edan escaped, and returned with an army to attack and repel the Spanish, damaging some of the ships so that one vessel had to be abandoned. Columbus left for Hispaniola on April 16, but sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel any farther, the ships were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], on June 25, 1503.\n\n[[File:Eclipse Christophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|Columbus fills the natives with fear and awe by predicting the [[lunar eclipse]]]]\nFor a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from [[Hispaniola]]. The island's governor, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime, Columbus had to mesmerize the natives in order to prevent being attacked by them and gain their goodwill. He did so by correctly predicting a [[lunar eclipse]] for February 29, 1504, using the ''[[Ephemeris]]'' of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', 1942, pp. 653\u2013654. [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Christopher Columbus, Mariner'', 1955, pp. 184\u2013192.</ref>\n\nIn May of 1504 a battle took place between men loyal to Columbus and those loyal to the Porras brothers, in which there was a sword fight between Bartolom\u00e9 Col\u00f3n and Francisco de Porras. Bartholomew Columbus won against Francisco but he spared his life. In this way, the mutiny ended.\n\nHelp finally arrived from the governor Ovando, on June 29, 1504, when a caravel sent by Diego M\u00e9ndez finally appeared on the island. At this time there were 110 members of the expedition alive out of the 147 that sailed from Spain with Columbus. Due to the strong winds, the caravel had to stop by the road, taking 45 days to reach La Hispaniola. Previously this was a trip that Diego M\u00e9ndez had made in four days in a canoe.\n\nAbout 38 of the 110 men that survived decided not to board again and stayed in Hispaniola instead of returning to Spain. On September 11, 1504 Christopher Columbus and his son Hernando embarked in a caravel to travel from Hispaniola to Spain, paying their corresponding tickets. They arrived in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda on November 7, 1504 and from there they traveled to Seville, where Col\u00f3n denounced to the authorities that the gold that came in the caravel for the Crown had been adulterated and claimed for himself a part for having made the accusation\n\nColumbus died in Valladolid, Spain, on May 20, 1506, at around the age of 54, probably of the effects of chronic [[reactive arthritis]] perhaps acquired secondarily to food poisoning.\n\n===Aftermath===\nColumbus did not find the maritime passage through Central America. However, the Spanish conquistador [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa|Vasco Nunez de Balboa]], exploring overland, became the first European to encounter the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the Americas on September 25, 1513, calling it the \"South Sea\".\n\nLater, on October 29, 1520, [[Magellan's circumnavigation]] expedition discovered the first  maritime passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, at the southern end of what is now Chile ([[Strait of Magellan]]), and his fleet ended up sailing around the whole Earth. Almost a century later, another, wider passage to the Pacific would be discovered farther to the south, bordering [[Cape Horn]].\n\nOn August 15, 1914, the United States completed the [[Panama Canal]], one of the great feats of modern construction, which allows ships to pass from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean across Central America.\n\n==Pleitos Colombinos==\nAfter his death, Columbus's sons, Diego and Fernando, took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the allegations against Columbus and his tyrannical governorship were initiated by the [[Crown of Castile|Crown]] during these lengthy court cases, known as the ''[[Pleitos Colombinos]]''.

These states sought to exploit the New World's riches; build trade networks and colonies; and built the [[Indian reductions]] (settlements) to relocate, use the labor of, and attempt Christian conversions of the native people.\n\nWith the [[Age of Discovery]] starting in the 15th century, Europeans explored the world by ocean, searching for particular trade goods, humans to enslave, and trading locations and ports. The most desired trading goods were gold, silver and spices. Columbus did not reach Asia but rather found what was to the Europeans a New World, the [[Americas]]. For the Catholic monarchies of Spain and Portugal, a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict. This was resolved by Papal intervention in 1494 when the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] purported to divide the world between the two powers. The Portuguese were to receive everything outside of Europe east of a line that ran 270 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]], thought to include the continents of Africa and Asia, but none of the New World.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The Spanish received everything west of this line, territory that was still almost completely unknown, and proved to be primarily the vast majority of the continents of the Americas and the [[Pacific Islands|Islands of the Pacific Ocean]]. This arrangement was somewhat subverted in 1500,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} when the Portuguese navigator [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] arrived at a point on the eastern coast of South America, and realized that it was on the Portuguese side of the dividing line between the two empires. This would lead to the Portuguese colonization of what is now Brazil.\n\nColumbus and other Iberian explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries&mdash;unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castillo ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought in the form of abundant gold. In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of Spanish conquistadors, with large armies of indigenous groups, managed to conquer these states. The most notable amongst the conquered states were the [[Aztec Empire]] in modern [[Mexico]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquered in 1521]]) and the [[Inca Empire]] in modern [[Peru]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquered in 1532]]). During this time, pandemics of European disease such as smallpox devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish sovereignty was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Columbus Day]]\n* [[Columbus's vow]]\n* [[Juan de la Cosa]]\n* [[The Grand Exchange]]\n* [[Guanahani]] (a discussion of candidates for site of first landing)\n* [[Lugares colombinos]]\n* [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]]\n* [[The Pinz\u00f3n Brothers]]\n* [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]\n* [[Exploration of North America]]\n* [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n* [[Amerigo Vespucci]]\n* [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]]\n\n==References==\n; General information\n* Clements R.

The four voyages of Columbus led to the widespread knowledge that a continent existed west of Europe and east of [[Asia]]. This breakthrough in geographical knowledge inaugurated a period of [[Age of Discovery|exploration]], [[Conquistador|conquest]], [[History of colonialism#Portuguese and Spanish exploration and colonization|colonization]], [[Columbian exchange|biological exchange]], and [[trans-Atlantic trade]], whose effects and consequences persist to the present, and are sometimes cited as the start of the [[modern era]].<ref>Mills, Keneth and Taylor, William B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww-J9Kjb2KgC&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=discovery+of+america+marks+modern+era&source=bl&ots=cdiXQBXk3_&sig=7h4YTsP70BUalD1D37ck_bMBTfM&hl=es&sa=X&ei=evwRU5qGHqLm7AaZ24CgCg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=discovery%20of%20america%20marks%20modern%20era&f=false], p. 36, SR Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8420-2573-1}}</ref> \n\nIt was long believed that Columbus had been the first European explorer to reach the Americas, but in fact he had been preceded by the [[Vinland|Viking expedition]] led by [[Leif Erikson]] in the 11th century.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/erikson_leif.shtml |title=History \u2013 Leif Erikson (11th century) |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/10/151011-columbus-day-leif-erikson-italian-americans-holiday-history/ |title=Why Do We Celebrate Columbus Day and Not Leif Erikson Day? |magazine=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=11 October 2015 |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> However, Columbus's voyages were the ones that led to ongoing European contact with the Americas. \n\nColumbus was an [[Italy|Italian]]-born [[navigator]] sailing for the [[Crown of Castile]] (Spain) in search of a westward route to the [[East Indies|Indies]], the vaguely rumored East Asian sources of [[Spice trade|spices]] and other precious oriental goods obtainable only through arduous [[Silk Road|overland routes]]. Although he did not realize it, this search failed when he encountered the [[New World]] between Europe and Asia. Columbus made a total of four voyages to the Americas between 1492 and 1502.\n\nAt the time of Columbus' voyages, the Americas were inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]], [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|descendants]] of [[Paleo-Indians]] who [[Settlement of the Americas|crossed]] [[Beringia]] from [[Asia]] to [[North America]] beginning around 20,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dillehay|first=Tom D.|last2=Ocampo|first2=Carlos|last3=Saavedra|first3=Jos\u00e9|last4=Sawakuchi|first4=Andre Oliveira|last5=Vega|first5=Rodrigo M.|last6=Pino|first6=Mario|last7=Collins|first7=Michael B.|last8=Cummings|first8=Linda Scott|last9=Arregui|first9=Iv\u00e1n|author-link1=Tom Dillehay|author-link6=Mario Pino Quivira|date=2015-11-18|title=New Archaeological Evidence for an Early Human Presence at Monte Verde, Chile|journal=PLOS One|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0141923|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141923|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4651426|pmid=26580202}}</ref>  Soon after first contact, [[Pandemic|Eurasian diseases]] such as [[smallpox]] began to devastate the indigenous populations, which had no immunity to them. \n\nIn 1513, the search for a westward route to Asia continued when [[Vasco Nu\u00f1ez de Balboa]] crossed the narrow [[Isthmus of Panama]] to become the first European to sight the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the New World. The search was completed in 1521, when the Castilian (''Spanish'') [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan expedition]] sailed across the Pacific and reached [[Southeast Asia]], returning to Europe after sailing further West and achieving the first circumnavigation of the world.\n\n==Background to the voyages==\n[[File:Fernandez-Virgin of the Navigators (proper inversion).jpg|thumb|''[[The Virgin of the Navigators]]'' by [[Alejo Fern\u00e1ndez]] dating to between 1531 and 1536 and depicting Columbus and others of importance in the first years of Spanish exploration<ref name=\"Phillips\">{{cite journal |last1=Rahn |first1=Phillips Carla |title=Visualizing Imperium: The Virgin of the Seafarers and Spain's Self-Image in the Early Sixteenth Century * |journal=Renaissance Quarterly |date=NaN |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=815\u2013856 |doi=10.1353/ren.2008.0864 |language=en |issn=0034-4338}}</ref>]]\n\n[[Portugal]] had been the main European power interested in pursuing trade routes overseas. Their next-door neighbors, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (predecessor of [[Spain]]) had been somewhat slower to begin exploring the Atlantic because of the bigger land area it had to re-conquer (the ''[[Reconquista]]'') from the [[Moors]]. It was not until the late 15th century, following the [[dynastic union]] of the Crowns of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and the completion of the ''Reconquista'', that the unified crowns of what would become Spain (although countries still legally existing) emerged and became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492 the joint rulers conquered the [[Granada#Nasrid Kingdom of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through [[tribute]]. Columbus had previously failed to convince King [[John II of Portugal]] to fund his exploration of a western route, but the new king and queen of the re-conquered Spain decided to fund Columbus's expedition in hopes of bypassing Portugal's lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean, reaching Asia by traveling west.<ref>Jensen, De Ladickmar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe 2nd ed.'' p. 341</ref>\n\n===Funding campaign===\nHe proposed the king equip three sturdy ships and grant Columbus one year's time to sail out west into the Atlantic, search for a western route to [[India]], and return. Columbus also requested he be made \"Great Admiral of the Ocean Sea\" (Atlantic Ocean), appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered, and be given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands. The king submitted the proposal to his experts, who rejected it after several years. It was their considered opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km}} was far too short.<ref name = \"Morison-Admiral\"/>\n\nIn 1488 Columbus appealed to the court of Portugal, receiving a new invitation for an audience with King John II. This also proved unsuccessful, in part because not long afterwards [[Bartolomeu Dias]] returned to Portugal following a successful rounding of the southern tip of Africa. With an eastern sea route now under its control, Portugal was no longer interested in trailblazing a western trade route to Asia crossing unknown seas. Columbus traveled to Castile to convince the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Castile and Aragon to finance the expedition.\n\n====Spanish procurement====\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2010}}\nKing [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] married Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] in 1469, uniting the two largest kingdoms into what would later be the Spanish Crown. They were known jointly as the Catholic Monarchs, and ruled their kingdoms independently, but had common internal and foreign policies.\n\nColumbus was granted an audience with them; on May 1, 1489, he presented his plans to Queen Isabella, who referred them to a committee. They pronounced the idea impractical, and advised the monarchs not to support the proposed venture.\n\nHowever, to expand the Spanish empire and Catholicism in the name of Spanish Kings, and to assure a better market position in trading, the Queen gave Columbus an annual allowance of 12,000 ''[[maravedis]]'' and part of the newly conquered lands.<ref>Durant, Will ''\"The Story of Civilization\"'' Vol. VI, \"The Reformation\".

Detail of the Columbus monument in [[Madrid]] (1885).]]\n\nAfter continually lobbying at the royal court and enduring two years of negotiations, Columbus finally succeeded in January 1492. Queen Isabella's forces had just conquered the [[Moors|Moorish]] [[Emirate of Granada]], the last Muslim stronghold of [[Al-Andalus]] on the [[Iberian peninsula]], for Castile. Isabella and Ferdinand received Columbus in the ''[[Alc\u00e1zar de los Reyes Cristianos|Alc\u00e1zar]]'' (castle) in [[C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]] to support his plans.\n\nThe monarchs left it to the royal treasurer to shift funds among various royal accounts on behalf of the enterprise. Columbus was to be made \"Admiral of the Seas\" and would receive a portion of all profits. The terms were unusually generous but, as his son later wrote, the monarchs were not confident of his return.\n\nAccording to Columbus's contract made for the expedition commission by Queen Isabella for Castile, if Columbus claimed any new islands or mainland for the Crown, he would receive many high rewards. In terms of power, he would be given the rank of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and appointed [[Viceroy]] and [[Governor#Other colonial empires|Governor]] of the newly colonised lands. He had the right to nominate three people, from whom the sovereigns would choose one, for any office in the new lands. He would be entitled to ten per cent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity.<ref>Stuart, ''Isabella of Castile: the first Renaissance queen'', 2004, p. 295.</ref>\n\n===Navigation plans===\nEurope had long enjoyed a safe land passage to China and India\u2014sources of valued goods such as [[silk]], [[spices]], and [[opium|opiates]]\u2014under the [[hegemony]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] (the [[Pax Mongolica]], or ''Mongol peace''). With the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453, the land route to Asia became more difficult. In response to this the [[Bartholomew Columbus|Columbus brothers]] had, by the 1480s, developed a plan to travel to the [[East Indies|Indies]], then construed roughly as all of southern and eastern Asia, by sailing directly west across what was believed to be the singular \"[[World Ocean|Ocean Sea]],\" the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n[[Washington Irving]]'s 1828 biography of Columbus popularized the idea that Columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]] thought [[flat earth|the Earth was flat]].<ref name=\"book3\">{{cite book | first=Paul F | last=Boller | title=Not So!:Popular Myths about America from Columbus to Clinton | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-19-509186-1 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | url=https://archive.org/details/notsopopularmyth00boll }}</ref> In fact, the primitive maritime navigation of the time relied on the stars and the curvature of the [[spherical Earth]].

In fact [[Eratosthenes]] had measured the diameter of the Earth with good precision in the 2nd century BC.<ref name=Sagan /> Where Columbus did differ from the generally accepted view of his time was in his incorrect arguments that assumed a significantly smaller diameter for the Earth, claiming that Asia could be easily reached by sailing west across the Atlantic. Most scholars accepted [[Ptolemy]]'s correct assessment that the terrestrial landmass (for Europeans of the time, comprising Eurasia and Africa) occupied 180 [[longitude|degrees]] of the terrestrial sphere, and dismissed Columbus's claim that the Earth was much smaller, and that Asia was only a few thousand nautical miles to the west of Europe.

Accepting the length of a degree to be 56\u2154 miles<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->, from the writings of [[Alfraganus]], he therefore calculated the circumference of the Earth as {{convert|25,255|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}<!--need Arabic and statute/U.S. mile--> at most, and the distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan as 3,000 Italian miles ({{convert|3,700|km|nmi mi|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}}). Columbus did not realize Alfraganus used the much longer Arabic mile (about 1,830 m<!--need km and statute/U.S. mile-->).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThe true circumference of the Earth is about {{convert|40,000|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}, a figure first established approximately by [[Eratosthenes]] in the 2nd century BC,<ref name=\"Sagan\">Sagan, Carl. ''Cosmos''; the mean circumference of the Earth is 40,041.47 km.</ref> and the distance from the Canary Islands to Japan {{convert|19,600|km|nmi mi|abbr=in}}. No ship that was readily available in the 15th century could carry enough food and fresh water for such a journey. Most European sailors and navigators concluded, probably correctly, that sailors undertaking a westward voyage from Europe to Asia non-stop would die of thirst, [[scurvy]] or starvation long before reaching their destination. Spain, however, having just completed the expensive [[Reconquista]], was desperate for a competitive edge over other European countries in trade with the [[East Indies]]. Columbus promised such an advantage.\n\nEuropeans generally assumed that the aquatic expanse between Europe and Asia was uninterrupted. While hints of North America, [[Vinland]], were already surfacing in Europe, historians agree that Columbus calculated too short a distance from the [[Canary Islands]] to Japan by the standards of his peers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n====Trade winds====\nThere was a further element of key importance in the plans of Columbus, a closely held fact discovered by or otherwise learned by Columbus: the [[Trade Winds]]. A brisk westward wind from the east, commonly called an \"[[Easterlies|easterly]]\", propelled ''[[Santa Mar\u00eda (ship)|Santa Mar\u00eda]]'', ''[[Ni\u00f1a|La Ni\u00f1a]]'', and ''[[Pinta (ship)|La Pinta]]'' for five weeks from the Canary Islands off Africa. To return to Spain eastward against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique upwind, called [[Sailing#Upwind|beating]], during which food and drinkable water would have been utterly exhausted. Columbus returned home by following prevailing winds northeastward from the southern zone of the North Atlantic to the middle latitudes of the North Atlantic, where prevailing winds are eastward (westerly) to the coastlines of [[Western Europe]], where the winds curve southward towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]].

The Ta\u00ednos are subdivided into Classic Ta\u00ednos, who occupied Hispaniola and [[Puerto Rico]]; Western Ta\u00ednos, who occupied Cuba, [[Jamaica]], and the [[Bahamian archipelago]]; and the Eastern Ta\u00ednos, who occupied the Leeward Islands.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rouse |first=Irving |title=The Ta\u00ednos : Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus |isbn=0-300-05696-6 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgjsDvFiNuUC&pg=PA1}}</ref> [[Trinidad]] was inhabited by both [[Carib language|Carib-speaking]] and [[Arawak language|Arawak-speaking]] groups. Most of modern [[Central America]] was part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] societies of Mesoamerica occupied the land ranging from central [[Mexico]] in the north to [[Costa Rica]] in the south. The cultures of [[Panama]] traded with both Mesoamerica and [[South America]] and can be considered [[Intermediate Area|transitional between those two cultural areas]].\n\nColumbus proceeded to observe the people and their cultural lifestyle. He also explored the northeast coast of Cuba, landing on October 28, 1492, and the north-western coast of Hispaniola, present day [[Haiti]], by December 5, 1492. Here, the ''Santa Maria'' ran aground on [[Christmas Day]], December 25, 1492, and had to be abandoned. Columbus was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind. Columbus founded the settlement, ''[[La Navidad]]'', leaving behind 39 men.\n\nOn January 15, 1493, he set sail for home aboard the ''Ni\u00f1a''.\n\n====First return====\nWhile returning to Spain, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and ''Pinta'' encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, on the night of February 13, lost contact with each other. All hands on the ''Ni\u00f1a'' vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the [[Azore Islands]], but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the ''Ni\u00f1a'' laid anchor at [[Santa Maria Island]], but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Ni\u00f1a moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he and the rest of the crew stayed on the Ni\u00f1a, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, Jo\u00e3o de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the ''Ni\u00f1a'', in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Columbus in the Azores|jstor = 41104900|journal = Portuguese Studies|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 17\u201323|volume = 6|first = Rebecca|last = Catz}}</ref>\n\nLeaving the island of Santa Maria in the Azores on February 23, Columbus headed for Castilian Spain, but another storm forced him into [[Lisbon]]. He anchored next to the king's harbor patrol ship on March 4, 1493, where he was told a fleet of 100 [[caravels]] had been lost in the storm. Astoundingly, both the ''Ni\u00f1a'' and the ''Pinta'' had been spared. Not finding [[John II of Portugal|King John II]] of Portugal in Lisbon, Columbus wrote a letter to him and waited for the king's reply. After receiving the letter, the king agreed to meet with Columbus in ''Vale do Para\u00edso'' despite poor relations between Portugal and Castile at the time. Upon learning of Columbus's discoveries, the Portuguese king informed him that he believed the voyage to be in violation of the 1479 [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]]. After spending more than a week in Portugal, Columbus set sail for Spain. Word of his finding new lands rapidly spread throughout Europe. After the voyage, Columbus met with Spanish monarchs [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] in [[Barcelona]] on March 15, 1493 to report his findings. The [[Columbus Monument, Barcelona|''Monument a Colom'']] in that city commemorates the event.\n\nColumbus and his remaining crew came home to a hero's welcome when they returned to Spain. He showed off what he had brought back from his voyage to the monarchs, including a few small samples of gold, [[pearl]]s, gold jewelry stolen from natives, a few natives he had kidnapped, flowers, and a hammock. He gave the monarchs a few of the gold nuggets, gold jewelry, and pearls, as well as the previously unknown tobacco plant, the pineapple fruit, the turkey, and the hammock. The monarchs invited Columbus to dine with them. A taster even tasted the food from each of his dishes before he ate to \"make sure it was not poisoned\". He was given his own footmen to open doors for him and to serve him at the table. Columbus was even rewarded with his own coat of arms. He did not bring any of the coveted [[East Indies]] spices, such as the exceedingly expensive black pepper, ginger or cloves. In his log, he wrote \"there is also plenty of 'aj\u00ed', which is their pepper, which is more valuable than black pepper, and all the people eat nothing else, it being very wholesome\".<ref>Turner, 2004, p. 11</ref> The word \"aj\u00ed\" is still used in South American Spanish for chili peppers.\n\n[[Columbus's letter on the first voyage]] to the royal court in Madrid was extravagant. He insisted he had reached Asia (it was Cuba) and an island off the coast of China (Hispaniola). His descriptions were part fact, part fiction: \"Hispaniola is a miracle. Mountains and hills, plains and pastures, are both fertile and beautiful ... the harbors are unbelievably good and there are many wide rivers of which the majority contain gold. ... There are many spices, and great mines of gold and other metals...\"<ref name=\"Zinn 2009 3\">{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|title=A People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780061989834|pages=3}}</ref>\n\n====Papal decree====\n{{further|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\nAfter Columbus's return, [[Pope Alexander VI]] [[Inter caetera|issued a bull]] which divided the \"newly discovered\" lands outside Europe between [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spain]] and [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portugal]] along a north-south meridian 958 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (off the coast of Africa in the mid-Atlantic), thus granting Spain all land discovered by Columbus.

Accessed 21 May 2012.</ref>\n\n====Caribbean exploration====\nOn November 3, 1493, Christopher Columbus landed on a rugged shore on an island that he named [[Dominica]]. On the same day, he landed at [[Marie-Galante]], which he named Santa Mar\u00eda la Galante. After sailing past Les Saintes (Todos los Santos), he arrived at [[Guadeloupe]] (Santa Mar\u00eda de Guadalupe), which he explored between November 4 and November 10, 1493. The exact course of his voyage through the [[Lesser Antilles]] is debated, but it seems likely that he turned north, sighting and naming many islands including Santa Mar\u00eda de Montserrat ([[Montserrat]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Antigua ([[Antigua]]), Santa Mar\u00eda la Redonda ([[Saint Martin]]), and Santa Cruz ([[Saint Croix]]). He also sighted and named the island chain of the Santa \u00darsula y las Once Mil V\u00edrgenes (the [[Virgin Islands]]), and named the islands of Virgen Gorda. He continued to the [[Greater Antilles]], and landed on the island of San Juan Bautista, present day [[Puerto Rico]], on November 19, 1493. His men rescued two boys who had just been castrated by their captors.<ref>Philips and Philips, The Worlds of Christopher Columbus</ref>\n\n====Hispaniola and Jamaica====\nOn November 22, he returned to Hispaniola, where he found his men at [[La Navidad]] had fallen into dispute with natives in the interior and had been killed, but he did not accuse Chief [[Guacanagari]], his ally, of any wrongdoing. Another Chief, named [[Caonabo]] in Maguana, was charged. Columbus established a new settlement at [[La Isabela]], on the north coast of Hispaniola, where gold had first been found, but it was a poor location and the settlement was short-lived. He spent some time exploring the interior of the island for gold. Finding some, he established a small fort in the interior.\n\nHe left Hispaniola on April 24, 1494, and arrived at the island of Juana ([[Cuba]]) (which he had discovered and named during his first voyage) on April 30 and [[Discovery Bay, Jamaica]] on May 5. He explored the south coast of Juana, which he believed to be a peninsula of [[China]] rather than an island, and several nearby islands including La Evangelista (the [[Isle of Youth]]), before returning to Hispaniola on August 20. After staying for a time on the western end of present-day [[Haiti]] he finally returned to Spain.\n\n====Slavery, settlers, and tribute====\nDuring the second voyage,{{clarify|date=October 2016}} Columbus sent a letter to the monarchs proposing to enslave some of the Americas' people, specifically from the [[Island Caribs|Carib]] tribe, on the grounds of their independence-minded aggressiveness and their status as enemies of the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] tribe. Although his petition was refused by the Crown, in February 1495, Columbus disobeyed the Queen and took 1,600 people from the [[Arawak]] tribe who were then taken by the Carib as captives and slaves. No room was available for about 400 of the kidnapped Arawak leading to their release. The long-term consequence for the Arawaks of contact with Europeans was that thousands of people{{dubious|date=October 2016}}  were almost entirely exterminated by disease, infighting and economic despair.<ref>Montague, Peter. \"Celebrating Columbus Day\". ''Ecologist''. Dec. 1999: 468\u2013470. ''SIRS Issues Researcher''. Web. 22 Feb. 2016.</ref>\n\nThe many voyages of discovery did not pay for themselves, and there was no funding for pure science in the [[Renaissance]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Columbus had planned for Queen Isabella to set up trading posts with the cities of the Far East made famous by [[Marco Polo]], but whose Silk Road and eastern maritime routes had been blockaded to her crown's trade. Of course, Columbus would never find [[Cathay]] ([[China]]) or [[Zipangu]] ([[Japan]]), and there was no longer any Great [[Khan (title)|Khan]] for trade treaties.\n\n[[Slavery]] was practiced widely at that time amongst many peoples of the world, including some Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} For the Portuguese\u2014from whom Columbus received most of his maritime training\u2014the profits from enslaving people had resulted in the first \"financial return\" on a 75-year [[investment]] in [[Africa]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nColumbus enslaved five hundred and sixty people.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20150602025738/https://www.boundless.com/world-history/textbooks/boundless-world-history-i-ancient-1600-textbook/early-modern-europe-12/the-age-of-discovery-57/spanish-exploration-and-the-voyages-of-christopher-columbus-217-13333/</ref> The slaves were shipped to Spain; 200 died during the route back to Spain, and half of the remainder were ill when they arrived. After legal proceedings in the ''Cortes'', some survivors were ordered released and to be returned to their ''las Americas'' homeland, whereas others were used by Queen Isabella as galley slaves.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Columbus, desperate to repay his investors, failed to realize that Isabella and Ferdinand did not plan to follow or allow Portuguese slavery policy{{which|date=May 2013}} in this respect. Rounding up the slaves led to the first major battle between the Spanish and the native peoples in their homeland, called by Europeans \"the [[New World]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nColumbus was eager to pay back dividends to those who had invested in his promise to fill his ships with gold. And since so many of the slaves died in captivity, he developed a plan while in the Province of Cibao on Hispaniola. Columbus imposed a tribute system, similar to that of the still-unknown [[Aztec#Tribute and trade|Aztec Empire tribute]] on the mainland.{{Citation needed|source=October 2014|date=October 2014}} All Cibaoan indigenous residents above 14 years of age were required to find and deliver a specific quota of gold every three months. Upon their doing so, they would receive copper tokens that they wore around their necks. Any Indian found without a copper token had their hands cut off and subsequently bled to death.<ref name=\"Zinn 2009 3\"/> Since there were no gold mines on the island, the Indians had no chance of meeting Columbus' quota and thousands are reported to have committed suicide.<ref>Koning, Hans. Columbus, His Enterprise: Exploding the Myth. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1976: 83-83.</ref>\n\nDespite or because of such extreme enforcement, Columbus did not obtain much gold, and many new foreign \"settlers\" were unhappy with the climate and disillusioned about their chances of getting rich quickly.

King John reportedly knew of the existence of such a mainland because \"canoes had been found which set out from the coast of Guinea [West Africa] and sailed to the west with merchandise.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morison|first=Samuel Eliot|title=Journals & Other Documents on the Life & Voyages of Christopher Columbus|year=1963|publisher=The Heritage Press|location=New York|pages=262}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Thacher|first=John Boyd|title=Christopher Columbus: his life, his work, his remains, as revealed by original printed and manuscript records, together with an essay on Peter Martyr of Anghera and Bartolom\u00e9 De Las Casas, the first Historians of America.|year=1903|publisher=G.

He then sailed to the island of [[Madeira]] and spent some time there with the Portuguese captain Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara before sailing to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cape Verde]]. The ships found King John's hypothesized continent, which is [[South America]], when they sighted the land of [[Trinidad]] on 31 July approaching from the southeast.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 124</ref> The fleet sailed along the southern coast and entered [[Columbus Channel|Dragon's Mouth]], anchoring near [[Soldado Rock]] where they made contact with a group of native [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] in canoes.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 125</ref> Columbus then landed on Trinidad at [[Icacos Point]] (which he named ''Punta de Arenal'') on August 2.<ref>Joseph 1838, p. 126</ref>\n\nFrom August 4 through August 12, 1498, he explored the [[Gulf of Paria]] which separates Trinidad from mainland [[Venezuela]]. He then explored the mainland of South America, including the [[Orinoco]] River. He also sailed to the islands of [[Chacachacare]] and [[Margarita Island]] and sighted and named islands Bella Forma ([[Tobago]]) and Concepcion ([[Grenada]]).\n\n===Governorship issues===\n\n====Colonist rebellions====\nAfter his second journey, Columbus had requested that 330 people be sent to stay permanently (though voluntarily) on Hispaniola, all on the King's pay.   Specifically, he asked for 100 men to work as wood men soldiers and laborers, 50 farmers, 40 squires, 30 sailors, 30 cabin boys, 20 goldsmiths, 10 gardeners, 20 handymen, and 30 women.  In addition to this, plans were made to maintain friars and clergymen, a physician, a pharmacist, an herbalist, and musicians for entertaining the colonists.   Fearing that the King was going to restrict money allotted for wages, Columbus suggested that Spanish criminals be pardoned in exchange for a few years unpaid service in Hispaniola, and the King agreed to this.  A pardon for the death penalty would require 2 years of service, and one year of service was required for lesser crimes.  They also instructed that those who had been sentenced to exile would also be redirected to be exiled in Hispaniola.<ref> Las Casas, Bartolom\u00e9. \"History of the Indies\". \"Trans. Andr\u00e9e M.

As these new Colonists arrived on Hispaniola, a rebellion was brewing under Francisco Rold\u00e1n (a man Columbus had left as chief mayor, under his brothers Diego and Bartolomew).   By the time Columbus arrived on Hispaniola, Rold\u00e1n held the territory of Xaragu\u00e1, and some of the new colonists had joined his rebellion.   Over months, Columbus tried negotiating with the rebels.  At some point in these negotiations Columbus ordered Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica, Rold\u00e1n's partner in rebellion, to be hanged.   Eventually, though, he capitulated to much of the Rold\u00e1n's demands.   Several other revolts broke out after that, but Rold\u00e1n, now restored as mayor, took part in putting them down, and tried and hanged one of the ringleaders, Adri\u00e1n de M\u00fajica.    <ref>\"[https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php Columbus: The Four Voyages, 1492-1504]\", by Laurence Bergreen, Penguin Books, 2012, Chapter 9, https://erenow.net/biographies/columbus-the-four-voyages-1492-1504/11.php </ref>\n\n====Governor Bobadilla====\nDuring Columbus's term as Viceroy and [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]], he had been accused of governing tyrannically, called \"the tyrant of the Caribbean\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Columbus was physically and mentally exhausted; his body was wracked by [[arthritis]] and his eyes by [[ophthalmia]]. In October 1499, he sent two ships to Spain, asking the [[Cortes Generales]] of Castile to appoint a royal commissioner to help him govern.\n\nThe Cortes appointed [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], a member of the [[Order of Calatrava]]; however, his authority stretched far beyond what Columbus had requested. Bobadilla was given complete control as governor from 1500 until he was killed in a hurricane in 1502. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away, Bobadilla immediately received many serious complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolom\u00e9, and Diego. The testimonies of 23 people who had seen or heard about the treatment meted out by Columbus and his brothers\u2014had originally been lost for centuries, but was rediscovered in 2005 in the Spanish archives in [[Valladolid]]. It contained an account of Columbus's seven-year reign as the first [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].

He was 49 years old.\n\n====Arrest of Governor Columbus====\nColumbus was arrested in 1500 and supplanted from his posts. A number of returned settlers and friars lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him of mismanagement. [[Francisco de Bobadilla]] arrived on August 23, 1500 and detained Columbus and his brothers and had them shipped home. On October 1, 1500, Columbus and his two brothers, likewise in chains, were sent back to Spanish Aragon. Once in [[C\u00e1diz]], a grieving Columbus wrote to a friend at court:\n<blockquote>\nIt is now seventeen years since I came to serve these princes with the Enterprise of the Indies. They made me pass eight of them in discussion, and at the end rejected it as a thing of jest. Nevertheless I persisted therein... Over there I have placed under their sovereignty more land than there is in Africa and Europe, and more than 1,700 islands... In seven years I, by the divine will, made that conquest. At a time when I was entitled to expect rewards and retirement, I was incontinently arrested and sent home loaded with chains... The accusation was brought out of malice on the basis of charges made by civilians who had revolted and wished to take possession on the land...\n\nI beg your graces, with the zeal of faithful Christians in whom their Highnesses have confidence, to read all my papers, and to consider how I, who came from so far to serve these princes... now at the end of my days have been despoiled of my honor and my property without cause, wherein is neither justice nor mercy.<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', p. 576.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze - Columbus Before the Queen.JPG|thumb|''Columbus Before the Queen''<ref>The Brooklyn Museum catalogue notes that the most likely source for Leutze's trio of Columbus paintings is [[Washington Irving]]'s best-selling ''Life and Voyages of Columbus'' (1828).</ref> by [[Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze]], 1843 ([[Brooklyn Museum of Art]])]]\nColumbus and his brothers were jailed for six weeks before the busy King Ferdinand ordered them released. Not long thereafter, the king and queen summoned the Columbus brothers to their presence at the [[Alhambra]] palace in [[Granada]]. There the royal couple heard the brothers' pleas; restored their freedom and their wealth; and, after much persuasion, agreed to fund Columbus's fourth voyage. But the door was firmly shut on Christopher Columbus's role as governor. From that point forward, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]] was to be the new [[List of viceroys of New Spain#The Indies|Governor of the Indies]].\n\nAlthough he regained his freedom, he did not regain his prestige and lost all his titles including the governorship. As an added insult, the Portuguese had won the race to the [[East Indies]]: [[Vasco da Gama]] returned in September 1499 from a trip to India, having sailed east around Africa.\n\n===Fourth voyage===\n[[File:Columbus fourth voyage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Columbus's fourth voyage]]\n\nColumbus's fourth voyage was his final chance to prove himself and become the first man ever to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate the world]]. The goal was to find a westward passage through Central America and reach the [[Maluku Islands]], also known as the [[Spice islands|Spice Islands]].\n\nHis project turned into one of history's most epic--and forgotten--''''''adventures''''. Columbus would later claim that this fourth voyage was his greatest. It was without question his most daring, riskiest and most challenging<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?197565-1/the-voyage-columbus|title=The Last Voyage of Columbus|website=C-Span}}</ref>\n\nOn March 14, 1502 Columbus started his fourth voyage with 147 men and with strict orders from the king and queen which instructed him not to stop at Hispaniola, but only to search for a westward passage to the [[Indian Ocean]] mainland. Accompanied by his stepbrother [[Bartolomeo Columbus|Bartolomeo]], Diego Mendez, and his son [[Fernando Col\u00f3n|Fernando]], he left [[C\u00e1diz]], Spain on May 12, 1502, with his flagship, ''Capitana'', as well as the ''Gallega'', ''Vizca\u00edna,'' and ''Santiago de Palos''.\n\nHe sailed to [[Arzila]] on the Moroccan coast to rescue the '''Portuguese''' soldiers who he heard were under siege by the Moors. On June 15, 1502, they landed at Carbet on the island of [[Martinique]] (Martinica).\n\nColumbus anticipated a [[hurricane]] was brewing, so he continued on, hoping to find shelter on Hispaniola. He arrived at [[Santo Domingo]] on June 29, 1502, but was denied port, and the new governor refused to listen to his storm prediction. Instead, while Columbus's ships sheltered at the mouth of the [[Haina River]], the first Spanish treasure fleet sailed into the hurricane. The only ship to reach Spain had Columbus's money and belongings on it, and all of his former enemies (and a few friends) had drowned, including [[Francisco de Bobadilla]], who had sent Columbus back to Spain in chains two years earlier.\n\nAfter surviving the hurricane he left Hispaniola and after a brief stop at [[Jamaica]] and off the coast of [[Cuba]] to replenish, he sailed to [[Central America]], arriving at [[Guanaja]] (Isla de los Pinos) in the [[Islas de la Bah\u00eda department|Bay Islands]] off the coast of [[Honduras]] on July 30, 1502. Here Bartolomeo found native merchants and a large canoe, which was described as \"long as a galley\" and was filled with cargo. On August 14, 1502, he landed on the mainland of the Americas at Puerto Castilla, near [[Trujillo, Honduras]]. He spent two months exploring the coasts of Honduras, [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]] looking for the passage, before arriving in Almirante Bay, [[Panama]] on October 16, 1502.\n\nIn Panam\u00e1, he learned from the [[Ngobe]] of gold and a strait to another ocean. After some exploration, he established a garrison at the mouth of [[Bel\u00e9n River]] in January 1503.\n\nBy April 6, the garrison he had established captured the local tribe leader [[El Quib\u00edan]], who had demanded they not go down{{dubious|date=January 2016}} the Bel\u00e9n River. El Quib\u00edan escaped, and returned with an army to attack and repel the Spanish, damaging some of the ships so that one vessel had to be abandoned. Columbus left for Hispaniola on April 16, but sustained more damage in a storm off the coast of Cuba. Unable to travel any farther, the ships were beached in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], on June 25, 1503.\n\n[[File:Eclipse Christophe Colomb.jpg|thumb|Columbus fills the natives with fear and awe by predicting the [[lunar eclipse]]]]\nFor a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on Jamaica. A Spaniard, Diego Mendez, and some natives paddled a canoe to get help from [[Hispaniola]]. The island's governor, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando y C\u00e1ceres]], detested Columbus and obstructed all efforts to rescue him and his men. In the meantime, Columbus had to mesmerize the natives in order to prevent being attacked by them and gain their goodwill. He did so by correctly predicting a [[lunar eclipse]] for February 29, 1504, using the ''[[Ephemeris]]'' of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].<ref>[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Admiral of the Ocean Sea: A Life of Christopher Columbus'', 1942, pp. 653\u2013654. [[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''Christopher Columbus, Mariner'', 1955, pp. 184\u2013192.</ref>\n\nIn May of 1504 a battle took place between men loyal to Columbus and those loyal to the Porras brothers, in which there was a sword fight between Bartolom\u00e9 Col\u00f3n and Francisco de Porras. Bartholomew Columbus won against Francisco but he spared his life. In this way, the mutiny ended.\n\nHelp finally arrived from the governor Ovando, on June 29, 1504, when a caravel sent by Diego M\u00e9ndez finally appeared on the island. At this time there were 110 members of the expedition alive out of the 147 that sailed from Spain with Columbus. Due to the strong winds, the caravel had to stop by the road, taking 45 days to reach La Hispaniola. Previously this was a trip that Diego M\u00e9ndez had made in four days in a canoe.\n\nAbout 38 of the 110 men that survived decided not to board again and stayed in Hispaniola instead of returning to Spain. On September 11, 1504 Christopher Columbus and his son Hernando embarked in a caravel to travel from Hispaniola to Spain, paying their corresponding tickets. They arrived in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda on November 7, 1504 and from there they traveled to Seville, where Col\u00f3n denounced to the authorities that the gold that came in the caravel for the Crown had been adulterated and claimed for himself a part for having made the accusation\n\nColumbus died in Valladolid, Spain, on May 20, 1506, at around the age of 54, probably of the effects of chronic [[reactive arthritis]] perhaps acquired secondarily to food poisoning.\n\n===Aftermath===\nColumbus did not find the maritime passage through Central America. However, the Spanish conquistador [[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa|Vasco Nunez de Balboa]], exploring overland, became the first European to encounter the [[Pacific Ocean]] from the shores of the Americas on September 25, 1513, calling it the \"South Sea\".\n\nLater, on October 29, 1520, [[Magellan's circumnavigation]] expedition discovered the first  maritime passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific, at the southern end of what is now Chile ([[Strait of Magellan]]), and his fleet ended up sailing around the whole Earth. Almost a century later, another, wider passage to the Pacific would be discovered farther to the south, bordering [[Cape Horn]].\n\nOn August 15, 1914, the United States completed the [[Panama Canal]], one of the great feats of modern construction, which allows ships to pass from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean across Central America.\n\n==Pleitos Colombinos==\nAfter his death, Columbus's sons, Diego and Fernando, took legal action to enforce their father's contract. Many of the allegations against Columbus and his tyrannical governorship were initiated by the [[Crown of Castile|Crown]] during these lengthy court cases, known as the ''[[Pleitos Colombinos]]''. The family had some success in their first litigation, as a judgment of 1511 confirmed Diego's position as Viceroy, but reduced his powers. Diego resumed litigation in 1512 lasting until 1536, and further disputes continued until 1790.<ref>Mark McDonald (2005). ''Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector (1488\u20131539)''. British Museum Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7141-2644-9}}.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe success of Columbus's first voyage touched off a series of westward explorations by European seafaring states. These states sought to exploit the New World's riches; build trade networks and colonies; and built the [[Indian reductions]] (settlements) to relocate, use the labor of, and attempt Christian conversions of the native people.\n\nWith the [[Age of Discovery]] starting in the 15th century, Europeans explored the world by ocean, searching for particular trade goods, humans to enslave, and trading locations and ports. The most desired trading goods were gold, silver and spices. Columbus did not reach Asia but rather found what was to the Europeans a New World, the [[Americas]]. For the Catholic monarchies of Spain and Portugal, a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict. This was resolved by Papal intervention in 1494 when the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] purported to divide the world between the two powers. The Portuguese were to receive everything outside of Europe east of a line that ran 270 leagues west of the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]], thought to include the continents of Africa and Asia, but none of the New World.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The Spanish received everything west of this line, territory that was still almost completely unknown, and proved to be primarily the vast majority of the continents of the Americas and the [[Pacific Islands|Islands of the Pacific Ocean]]. This arrangement was somewhat subverted in 1500,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} when the Portuguese navigator [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] arrived at a point on the eastern coast of South America, and realized that it was on the Portuguese side of the dividing line between the two empires. This would lead to the Portuguese colonization of what is now Brazil.\n\nColumbus and other Iberian explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries&mdash;unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castillo ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought in the form of abundant gold. In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of Spanish conquistadors, with large armies of indigenous groups, managed to conquer these states. The most notable amongst the conquered states were the [[Aztec Empire]] in modern [[Mexico]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquered in 1521]]) and the [[Inca Empire]] in modern [[Peru]] ([[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|conquered in 1532]]). During this time, pandemics of European disease such as smallpox devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish sovereignty was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Columbus Day]]\n* [[Columbus's vow]]\n* [[Juan de la Cosa]]\n* [[The Grand Exchange]]\n* [[Guanahani]] (a discussion of candidates for site of first landing)\n* [[Lugares colombinos]]\n* [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli]]\n* [[The Pinz\u00f3n Brothers]]\n* [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]\n* [[Exploration of North America]]\n* [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]\n* [[Amerigo Vespucci]]\n* [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]]\n\n==References==\n; General information\n* Clements R.

In terms of passenger service, the airport offers year-round direct service to five destinations, along with seasonal destinations.

At the end of 1923, the Army closed Camp Grant as an active facility, transferring it to the [[Illinois National Guard]].  In 1941, the facility was reactivated by the Army.  During World War II, Camp Grant served as one of the largest Army induction and training centers in the United States, training medical personnel, and serving as a prisoner of war confinement center.  Following the end of the war, the facility served as a separation center.  In 1946, Camp Grant was shut down for the second (and final) time.\n\nAfter World War II, Illinois adopted the Airport Authority Act; the Greater Rockford Airport Authority was created in 1946.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://flyrfd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CampGranthistory.pdf|title=CAMP GRANT & BELL BOWL TIMELINE {{!}} Airport, Camp Grant & Bell Bowl Prairie|website=flyRFD.com {{!}} History}}</ref>  In 1948, the Camp Grant land was officially transferred to the airport authority from the federal government.  Of the 5,460 acres (plus a 6,000 acre rifle range) of Camp Grant, the airport authority acquired the western 1,500 acres of the facility<ref name=\":1\" />, bordered by the Rock River to the north and the Kishwaukee River to the south.  In 1954, construction commenced on the airport and terminal.<ref name=\":1\" />  \n\nIn 1974, the airport demolished the final remaining Camp Grant buildings on the airport property.<ref name=\":1\" />  In an effort to expand passenger airline service, the current passenger terminal was constructed in 1987.  In 1994, [[United Parcel Service]] opened the first of two cargo facilities at the airport.  While its centralized location in northern Illinois became a selling point for cargo service, scheduled passenger airline service struggled, ending altogether in 2001.  During the 1980s and 1990s, Rockford had passenger service to O'Hare Airport, but many airline passengers in the area considered bus service or driving to Chicago a viable alternative.  In 2003, the airport restored passenger service; instead of offering regional service to Chicago or elsewhere in the Midwest, the airport presented itself as an alternative for leisure-based travelers, offering low-cost flights to Florida. \n\nIn an effort to capitalize on its location (less than {{convert|90|mi|km|0}} from downtown Chicago and about {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} from the outermost Chicago suburbs), the Greater Rockford Airport underwent several name changes in the 2000s.   Initially changing to the '''Northwest Chicagoland Regional Airport at Rockford''' in the early 2000s, in 2004, the airport became an official US port of entry and achieved international status.  To reflect the change, it was renamed again, becoming the '''Chicago/Rockford International Airport''' (the slash was removed in 2007)<ref>[http://blogs.e-rockford.com/thepassengerseat/2007/11/27/another-airport-name-change-this-time-its-simple/ The Passenger Seat \u00bb Another airport name change (this time, it's simple)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704141928/http://blogs.e-rockford.com/thepassengerseat/2007/11/27/another-airport-name-change-this-time-its-simple/|date=July 4, 2008}}</ref>, bringing it in line with the two \"Chicago\" airports (O'Hare and Midway).  In many forms of media, the airport also markets itself by its three [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]/[[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] call letters: RFD.\n\nToday the Rockford airport is marketed to residents of Rockford and surrounding areas as an alternative to [[Chicago Midway International Airport]] and [[O'Hare International Airport]] in Chicago, [[Mitchell International Airport]] in Milwaukee and [[Dane County Regional Airport]] in Madison, Wisconsin as well as limited service airports such as [[Dubuque Regional Airport]] in Iowa. The airlines at Rockford often use their low fares as a selling point.

At the end of 1923, the Army closed Camp Grant as an active facility, transferring it to the [[Illinois National Guard]].  In 1941, the facility was reactivated by the Army.  During World War II, Camp Grant served as one of the largest Army induction and training centers in the United States, training medical personnel, and serving as a prisoner of war confinement center.  Following the end of the war, the facility served as a separation center.  In 1946, Camp Grant was shut down for the second (and final) time.\n\nAfter World War II, Illinois adopted the Airport Authority Act; the Greater Rockford Airport Authority was created in 1946.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://flyrfd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CampGranthistory.pdf|title=CAMP GRANT & BELL BOWL TIMELINE {{!}} Airport, Camp Grant & Bell Bowl Prairie|website=flyRFD.com {{!}} History}}</ref>  In 1948, the Camp Grant land was officially transferred to the airport authority from the federal government.  Of the 5,460 acres (plus a 6,000 acre rifle range) of Camp Grant, the airport authority acquired the western 1,500 acres of the facility<ref name=\":1\" />, bordered by the Rock River to the north and the Kishwaukee River to the south.  In 1954, construction commenced on the airport and terminal.<ref name=\":1\" />  \n\nIn 1974, the airport demolished the final remaining Camp Grant buildings on the airport property.<ref name=\":1\" />  In an effort to expand passenger airline service, the current passenger terminal was constructed in 1987.  In 1994, [[United Parcel Service]] opened the first of two cargo facilities at the airport.  While its centralized location in northern Illinois became a selling point for cargo service, scheduled passenger airline service struggled, ending altogether in 2001.  During the 1980s and 1990s, Rockford had passenger service to O'Hare Airport, but many airline passengers in the area considered bus service or driving to Chicago a viable alternative.  In 2003, the airport restored passenger service; instead of offering regional service to Chicago or elsewhere in the Midwest, the airport presented itself as an alternative for leisure-based travelers, offering low-cost flights to Florida. \n\nIn an effort to capitalize on its location (less than {{convert|90|mi|km|0}} from downtown Chicago and about {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} from the outermost Chicago suburbs), the Greater Rockford Airport underwent several name changes in the 2000s.   Initially changing to the '''Northwest Chicagoland Regional Airport at Rockford''' in the early 2000s, in 2004, the airport became an official US port of entry and achieved international status.  To reflect the change, it was renamed again, becoming the '''Chicago/Rockford International Airport''' (the slash was removed in 2007)<ref>[http://blogs.e-rockford.com/thepassengerseat/2007/11/27/another-airport-name-change-this-time-its-simple/ The Passenger Seat \u00bb Another airport name change (this time, it's simple)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704141928/http://blogs.e-rockford.com/thepassengerseat/2007/11/27/another-airport-name-change-this-time-its-simple/|date=July 4, 2008}}</ref>, bringing it in line with the two \"Chicago\" airports (O'Hare and Midway).  In many forms of media, the airport also markets itself by its three [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]/[[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] call letters: RFD.\n\nToday the Rockford airport is marketed to residents of Rockford and surrounding areas as an alternative to [[Chicago Midway International Airport]] and [[O'Hare International Airport]] in Chicago, [[Mitchell International Airport]] in Milwaukee and [[Dane County Regional Airport]] in Madison, Wisconsin as well as limited service airports such as [[Dubuque Regional Airport]] in Iowa. The airlines at Rockford often use their low fares as a selling point.
