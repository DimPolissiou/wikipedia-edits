Newer archaeological evidence shows the presence of a people who lived in an area called Gungywump, somewhat northwest of the Mystic River, which suggests that the Pequots may have been indigenous to southeastern Connecticut prior to the 16th century.

''A History of Mystic, Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town'' p. 13).</ref> They were in control of a considerable amount of territory, extending toward the [[Pawcatuck River]] to the east and the [[Connecticut River]] to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]] dominated the land linked by the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Hudson River]], allowing trading to occur between the Iroquois and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]].  The Pequots were settled just distant enough to be secure from any danger that the Iroquois posed.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\">Leigh Fought, ''A History of Mystic Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town''. Charleston, North Carolina: www.historypress.net, 2007.</ref> The [[Pequot War]] profoundly affected the Mystic area between 1636 and 1638.

The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Bowen |first=Clarence Winthrop |date=1882 |title=The Boundary Disputes of Connecticut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJUNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=connecticut+massachusetts+boundaries+mystic+pawcatuck&source=bl&ots=P7LQvmRSwy&sig=ACfU3U2UsYroB9merBravbZZcfc6MALITA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYrc2T2_DoAhUXj3IEHWd_D4QQ6AEwDXoECAwQKA#v=onepage&q=connecticut%20massachusetts%20boundaries%20mystic%20pawcatuck&f=false |location=Boston |publisher=James R. Osgood and Company}}</ref> In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shepard |first=James |date=1913 |title=Connecticut Soldiers in the Pequot War of 1637 |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&context=etas |location=Meriden, Conn. |publisher=The Journal Publishing Co.}}</ref> [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut.<ref>{{cite web | title=John Winthrop, Jr. | website=Museum of Connecticut History | date=April 1999 | url=https://museumofcthistory.org/2015/08/john-winthrop-jr/ | access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''.

The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]].{{cite book |last=Bowen |first=Clarence Winthrop |date=1882 |title=The Boundary Disputes of Connecticut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XJUNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=connecticut+massachusetts+boundaries+mystic+pawcatuck&source=bl&ots=P7LQvmRSwy&sig=ACfU3U2UsYroB9merBravbZZcfc6MALITA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYrc2T2_DoAhUXj3IEHWd_D4QQ6AEwDXoECAwQKA#v=onepage&q=connecticut%20massachusetts%20boundaries%20mystic%20pawcatuck&f=false |location=Boston |publisher=James R.

''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]]. The Turks in Turkey are over 60 million<!-- According to a 2008 report prepared for the [[National Security Council (Turkey) of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern Anatolia, there were approximately 50 to 55 million ethnic Turks --><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/turkiye-deki-kurtlerin-sayisi--magazin-873452/|title=T\u00fcrkiye'deki K\u00fcrtlerin say\u0131s\u0131!|trans-title=The number of Kurds in Turkey!|language=tr|newspaper=[[Milliyet]]|date=6 June 2008|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref> to 70 million worldwide, while the second largest Turkic people are the [[Azerbaijanis]], numbering 22 to 38 million worldwide; most of them live in Azerbaijan and Iran.\n\nIn the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] there are several Turkic national subdivisions,<ref>[http://www.sonsoftheconquerors.com/16501.html?*session*id*key*=*session*id*val* Across Central Asia], a New Bond Grows \u2013 Iron Curtain's Fall Has Spawned a Convergence for Descendants of Turkic Nomad Hordes</ref> including [[Bashkortostan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Chuvash Republic|Chuvashia]], [[Khakassia]], [[Tuva]], [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]], the [[Altai Republic]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], and [[Karachayevo-Cherkessiya]]. Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]]. The Turks in Turkey are over 60 million<!-- According to a 2008 report prepared for the [[National Security Council (Turkey) of Turkey by academics of three Turkish universities in eastern Anatolia, there were approximately 50 to 55 million ethnic Turks --><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/turkiye-deki-kurtlerin-sayisi--magazin-873452/|title=T\u00fcrkiye'deki K\u00fcrtlerin say\u0131s\u0131!|trans-title=The number of Kurds in Turkey!|language=tr|newspaper=[[Milliyet]]|date=6 June 2008|accessdate=16 November 2016}}</ref> to 70 million worldwide, while the second largest Turkic people are the [[Azerbaijanis]], numbering 22 to 38 million worldwide; most of them live in Azerbaijan and Iran.\n\nIn the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] there are several Turkic national subdivisions,<ref>[http://www.sonsoftheconquerors.com/16501.html?*session*id*key*=*session*id*val* Across Central Asia], a New Bond Grows \u2013 Iron Curtain's Fall Has Spawned a Convergence for Descendants of Turkic Nomad Hordes</ref> including [[Bashkortostan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Chuvash Republic|Chuvashia]], [[Khakassia]], [[Tuva]], [[Sakha Republic|Yakutia]], the [[Altai Republic]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], and [[Karachayevo-Cherkessiya]]. Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

It has a lot more kinds of horns and a lot more strings.\" Added Joe Jonas, \"there\u2019s more to the music rather than just a typical kind of relationship song.\"\n\nIn another interview, Nick Jonas explained that the album is \"our journal in songs,\" mostly about \"all things we've gone through, personal experiences we get inspiration from.\" He also added that \"we've also been working on trying to use metaphors...to kind of mask a literal thing that happens to us.\" Kevin Jonas also added that \"the overall message is it's the same old Jonas Brothers, in a sense\" and that they will be adding \"different musical instruments that are going to add and build to the sound we already have.\" Musical influences for this album include [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Zutons]], [[Coldplay]] and [[Neil Diamond]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n==Promotion==\nThe Jonas Brothers were promoting the album on their [[Jonas Brothers World Tour 2009|2009 world tour]] which began on May 18, 2009 in [[Lima, Peru]].<ref name=\"JonasMyspace\">{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/jonasbrothers|title=Jonas Brothers at Myspace Music|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> The track \"Fly with Me\" was featured during the end credits of ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]''.<ref name=\"FlyWithMeNight\">{{cite web|url=http://music.ninemsn.com.au/blog.aspx?blogentryid=416187&showcomments=true|title=Jonas Brothers spend a Night at the Museum|accessdate=2009-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530114050/http://music.ninemsn.com.au/blog.aspx?blogentryid=416187&showcomments=true|archive-date=2009-05-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> They've hosted three live web chats via [[Facebook]] (May 7, May 28 and June 4) to promote the album.<ref name=\"livechat1\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=6|title=Thursday, May 07, 2009 - LIVE FACEBOOK WEBCAST TODAY 5PM PDT!!!|date=2009-05-07|publisher=Jonas Brothers via Myspace Blogs|accessdate=2009-06-05|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121211041606/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=6|archive-date=2012-12-11|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"livechat2&3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=2 |title=\"Friday, May 29, 2009 - Last Night's Chat\" and \"Friday, May 29, 2009 -  NEXT LIVE FACEBOOK WEBCAST JUNE 4TH!!!\" |date=2009-05-29 |publisher=Jonas Brothers via Myspace Blogs |accessdate=2009-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426201846/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=2 |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}</ref> The brothers performed songs off the album for a [[Wal-Mart]] Soundcheck [[concert]] which was released on June 9, 2009.<ref name=\"WalmartSoundcheck\">{{cite web|url=http://soundcheck.walmart.com/jonas-brothers|title=Soundcheck - Jonas Brothers|accessdate=2009-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524091219/http://soundcheck.walmart.com/jonas-brothers|archive-date=2009-05-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> They performed on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on June 12, 2009 as part of GMA's Summer Concert Series.<ref name=\"GMAConcertJonas\">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/SummerConcert/story?id=7502433&page=1\n| title=\"GMA\" summer concerts in central park|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> [[Radio Disney]] premiered all the songs from the album over a period of four days between June 11 and June 14.

It was released June 16, 2009 in the US. The album received mixed reviews from critics and fans. In its first week, the album sold 247,000 copies, debuting at #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It was their third and last album released under [[Hollywood Records]], and their last before a hiatus, which lasted from October 2013 to March 2019.\n\n==Background==\nIn an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Nick Jonas explained the title, ''Lines, Vines and Trying Times'' as \"a bit of poetry we came up with on the set for the TV show.\" On the meaning, he stated, \"Lines are something that someone feeds you, whether it's good or bad. Vines are the things that get in the way of the path that you're on, and trying times \u2014 well, obviously we're younger guys, but we're aware of what's going on in the world and we're trying to bring some light to it.\" He noted, \"this new album for us, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a big jump, but it definitely is a progression in our music and a growth for us. It has a lot more kinds of horns and a lot more strings.\" Added Joe Jonas, \"there\u2019s more to the music rather than just a typical kind of relationship song.\"\n\nIn another interview, Nick Jonas explained that the album is \"our journal in songs,\" mostly about \"all things we've gone through, personal experiences we get inspiration from.\" He also added that \"we've also been working on trying to use metaphors...to kind of mask a literal thing that happens to us.\" Kevin Jonas also added that \"the overall message is it's the same old Jonas Brothers, in a sense\" and that they will be adding \"different musical instruments that are going to add and build to the sound we already have.\" Musical influences for this album include [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Zutons]], [[Coldplay]] and [[Neil Diamond]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n==Promotion==\nThe Jonas Brothers were promoting the album on their [[Jonas Brothers World Tour 2009|2009 world tour]] which began on May 18, 2009 in [[Lima, Peru]].<ref name=\"JonasMyspace\">{{cite web|url=https://www.myspace.com/jonasbrothers|title=Jonas Brothers at Myspace Music|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> The track \"Fly with Me\" was featured during the end credits of ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]''.<ref name=\"FlyWithMeNight\">{{cite web|url=http://music.ninemsn.com.au/blog.aspx?blogentryid=416187&showcomments=true|title=Jonas Brothers spend a Night at the Museum|accessdate=2009-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530114050/http://music.ninemsn.com.au/blog.aspx?blogentryid=416187&showcomments=true|archive-date=2009-05-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> They've hosted three live web chats via [[Facebook]] (May 7, May 28 and June 4) to promote the album.<ref name=\"livechat1\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=6|title=Thursday, May 07, 2009 - LIVE FACEBOOK WEBCAST TODAY 5PM PDT!!!|date=2009-05-07|publisher=Jonas Brothers via Myspace Blogs|accessdate=2009-06-05|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121211041606/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=6|archive-date=2012-12-11|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"livechat2&3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=2 |title=\"Friday, May 29, 2009 - Last Night's Chat\" and \"Friday, May 29, 2009 -  NEXT LIVE FACEBOOK WEBCAST JUNE 4TH!!!\" |date=2009-05-29 |publisher=Jonas Brothers via Myspace Blogs |accessdate=2009-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426201846/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&friendId=22191827&page=2 |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}</ref> The brothers performed songs off the album for a [[Wal-Mart]] Soundcheck [[concert]] which was released on June 9, 2009.<ref name=\"WalmartSoundcheck\">{{cite web|url=http://soundcheck.walmart.com/jonas-brothers|title=Soundcheck - Jonas Brothers|accessdate=2009-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524091219/http://soundcheck.walmart.com/jonas-brothers|archive-date=2009-05-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> They performed on ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on June 12, 2009 as part of GMA's Summer Concert Series.<ref name=\"GMAConcertJonas\">{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/SummerConcert/story?id=7502433&page=1\n| title=\"GMA\" summer concerts in central park|accessdate=2009-05-26}}</ref> [[Radio Disney]] premiered all the songs from the album over a period of four days between June 11 and June 14.

The term derives from [[Latin]] ''inter'' (among) and ''regalia'' (things of the king).\n\nThere are two classes of rights, divided into:\n\n*''The regalia majora'' (major regalia), which are inseparable from the person of the sovereign.\n*''The regalia minora'' (minor regalia), which may be conveyed to a subject.\n\n== The Regalia Majora ==\n[Section in Edit]\n\n== The Regalia Minora ==\nUnder [[Scots property law#Operation of the Feudal System|feudal law]], which operated in Scotland from the [[Davidian Revolution|Davidian Revolutio]]<nowiki/>n until 28 November 2004,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000 s.1</ref> all land in Scotland was owned by the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: [[List of Scottish monarchs|The King/Queen of Scots]] of the time). Certain rights in the land, called the ''[[Inter regalia (Scots law)|regalia minora]]'', could be reserved to the Crown when they granted land to a Crown vassal. Today, following the [[Scots property law#Feudal%20Reform%20and%20Abolition|abolition of feudalism]], any of the ''regalia minora'' that has not been expressly granted to the owner of land through previous grant or another individual as a separate legal tenement, still remains the property of the Crown under the ''Regalia Minora''.<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G.
