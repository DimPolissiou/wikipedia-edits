Bound on the east and south by its [[natural border]]s, the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian mountain range]], historical Transylvania extended westward to the [[Apuseni Mountains]]. The term sometimes encompasses not only Transylvania proper, but also parts of the historical regions of [[Cri\u0219ana]] and [[Maramure\u0219]], and occasionally the Romanian part of [[Banat]].\n\nThe region of Transylvania is known for the scenery of its [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] landscape and its rich history. It also contains major cities such as [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Bra\u0219ov]], [[Sibiu]], [[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]], [[Alba Iulia]], and [[Bistri\u021ba]].\n\nThe [[Western world]] commonly associates Transylvania with [[vampire]]s, thanks to the dominant influence of [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and the many films the tale inspired.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\">{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DE143BF931A1575BC0A965958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Travel Advisory; Lure of Dracula In Transylvania | date=1993-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icromania.com/infoTransylvania.asp |title=Romania Transylvania |publisher=Icromania.com |date=2007-04-15 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Historical names of Transylvania}}\nThe earliest known reference to Transylvania appears in a [[Medieval Latin]] document of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1075 as {{lang|la|ultra silvam}}, meaning \"beyond the forest\" ({{lang|la|ultra}} meaning \"beyond\" or \"on the far side of\" and the [[accusative case]] of {{lang|la|sylva}} ({{lang|la|sylvam}}) \"woods, forest\").

The latter wrote the novel  ''Ion'', which introduces the reader to a depiction of the life of the peasants and intellectuals of Transylvania at the turn of the 20th century.\n\n== Religion ==\nTransylvania has a very rich and unique religious history from the other regions of Europe. Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], different Christian denominations have been coexisting in this religious melting pot, including [[Romanian Orthodox]], [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church|Romanian Greek Catholic]], other [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Reformed]], and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] branches. Other faiths also are present, including [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]]. Under the [[Habsburgs]], Transylvania served as a place for \"religious undesirables\". People who arrived in Transylvania included those that did not conform to the [[Catholic Church]] and were sent here forcibly, as well as many religious refugees. Transylvania has a long history of religious tolerance. This has been ensured by its religious pluralism. [[Christianity]] is the largest religion in Transylvania. Transylvania has also been (and still is) a center for Christian denominations other than [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], the form of Christianity that most Romanians follow. As such, there are significant numbers of inhabitants of Transylvania that follow [[Roman Catholicism in Romania|Roman Catholicism]], [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholicism]] and [[Religion in Romania#Protestantism|Protestantism]].<ref name=\"poperamet\">Earl A.

One of the predominant early symbols of Transylvania was the coat of arms of [[Sibiu]] city. In 1596 [[Levinus Hulsius]] created a coat of arms for the imperial province of Transylvania, consisting of a shield [[Division of the field|party per fess]], with a rising eagle in the upper field and seven hills with towers on top in the lower field. He published it in his work \"Chronologia\", issued in [[Nuremberg]] the same year. The seal from 1597 of [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]], prince of Transylvania, reproduced the new coat of arms with some slight changes: in the upper field the eagle was flanked by a sun and a moon and in the lower field the hills were replaced by simple towers.<ref>Dan Cernovodeanu, ''\u0218tiin\u021ba \u0219i arta heraldic\u0103 \u00een Rom\u00e2nia'', Bucharest, 1977, p. 130</ref>\n\nThe seal of [[Michael the Brave]] from 1600 depicts the territory of the former [[Dacia|Dacian kingdom]]: [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]] and Transylvania:<ref name=\"Coat of arms of Dacia medieval\">{{cite web|title=Coat of arms of Dacia (medieval)|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ro-dacia.html|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409102552/http://www.fotw.net/flags/ro-dacia.html |archivedate=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n* The black eagle ([[Wallachia]])\n* The [[aurochs]] head ([[Moldavia]])\n* The seven hills (Transylvania).\n* Over the hills there were two rampant lions affronts, supporting the trunk of a tree, as a symbol of the reunited [[Dacia|Dacian Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Coat of arms of Dacia medieval\"/>\n\nThe [[Transylvanian Diet|Diet]] of 1659 codified the representation of the privileged nations in Transylvania's [[coat of arms]].

For example, in [[Paulo Coelho]]'s novel ''[[The Witch of Portobello]]'', the main character, Sherine Khalil, is described as a Transylvanian orphan with a [[Romani people|Romani]] mother, in an effort to add to the character's exotic mystique.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The so-called Transylvanian trilogy of historical novels by [[Miklos Banffy]], ''The Writing on the Wall'', is an extended treatment of the 19th- and early 20th-century social and political history of the country.

Bound on the east and south by its [[natural border]]s, the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian mountain range]], historical Transylvania extended westward to the [[Apuseni Mountains]]. The term sometimes encompasses not only Transylvania proper, but also parts of the historical regions of [[Cri\u0219ana]] and [[Maramure\u0219]], and occasionally the Romanian part of [[Banat]].\n\nThe region of Transylvania is known for the scenery of its [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] landscape and its rich history. It also contains major cities such as [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Bra\u0219ov]], [[Sibiu]], [[T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]], [[Alba Iulia]], and [[Bistri\u021ba]].\n\nThe [[Western world]] commonly associates Transylvania with [[vampire]]s, thanks to the dominant influence of [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel ''[[Dracula]]'' and the many films the tale inspired.<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\">{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6DE143BF931A1575BC0A965958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Travel Advisory; Lure of Dracula In Transylvania | date=1993-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icromania.com/infoTransylvania.asp |title=Romania Transylvania |publisher=Icromania.com |date=2007-04-15 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Historical names of Transylvania}}\nThe earliest known reference to Transylvania appears in a [[Medieval Latin]] document of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1075 as {{lang|la|ultra silvam}}, meaning \"beyond the forest\" ({{lang|la|ultra}} meaning \"beyond\" or \"on the far side of\" and the [[accusative case]] of {{lang|la|sylva}} ({{lang|la|sylvam}}) \"woods, forest\").

The revolution in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] grew into a war for the total independence from the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]]. [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]], the leader of the Austrian army was appointed plenipotentiary to restore order in Hungary after the conflict. He ordered the execution of [[The 13 Martyrs of Arad|The 13 Hungarian Martyrs]] of [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] and Prime Minister [[Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny|Batthy\u00e1ny]] was executed the same day in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]]. After a series of serious Austrian defeats in 1849, the [[Austrian Empire|empire]] came close to the brink of collapse. Thus, the new young emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] had to call for Russian help in the name of the Holy Alliance. Czar Nicholas I answered, and sent a 200,000 men strong army with 80,000 auxiliary forces. Finally, the joint army of Russian and Austrian forces defeated the Hungarian forces. After the restoration of Habsburg power, Hungary was placed under martial law. Following the Hungarian Army's surrender at Vil\u00e1gos (now [[\u0218iria]], Romania) in 1849, their revolutionary banners were taken to Russia by the Tsarist troops, and were kept there both under the Tsarist and Communist systems (in 1940 the Soviet Union offered the banners to the Horthy government).\n\nAfter the [[Ausgleich]] of 1867, the Principality of Transylvania was once again abolished.

One of the predominant early symbols of Transylvania was the coat of arms of [[Sibiu]] city. In 1596 [[Levinus Hulsius]] created a coat of arms for the imperial province of Transylvania, consisting of a shield [[Division of the field|party per fess]], with a rising eagle in the upper field and seven hills with towers on top in the lower field. He published it in his work \"Chronologia\", issued in [[Nuremberg]] the same year. The seal from 1597 of [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]], prince of Transylvania, reproduced the new coat of arms with some slight changes: in the upper field the eagle was flanked by a sun and a moon and in the lower field the hills were replaced by simple towers.<ref>Dan Cernovodeanu, ''\u0218tiin\u021ba \u0219i arta heraldic\u0103 \u00een Rom\u00e2nia'', Bucharest, 1977, p. 130</ref>\n\nThe seal of [[Michael the Brave]] from 1600 depicts the territory of the former [[Dacia|Dacian kingdom]]: [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]] and Transylvania:<ref name=\"Coat of arms of Dacia medieval\">{{cite web|title=Coat of arms of Dacia (medieval)|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ro-dacia.html|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409102552/http://www.fotw.net/flags/ro-dacia.html |archivedate=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n* The black eagle ([[Wallachia]])\n* The [[aurochs]] head ([[Moldavia]])\n* The seven hills (Transylvania).\n* Over the hills there were two rampant lions affronts, supporting the trunk of a tree, as a symbol of the reunited [[Dacia|Dacian Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Coat of arms of Dacia medieval\"/>\n\nThe [[Transylvanian Diet|Diet]] of 1659 codified the representation of the privileged nations in Transylvania's [[coat of arms]].

With its success, Transylvania became associated in the English-speaking world with [[vampire]]s. Since then it has been represented in fiction and literature as a land of mystery and magic. For example, in [[Paulo Coelho]]'s novel ''[[The Witch of Portobello]]'', the main character, Sherine Khalil, is described as a Transylvanian orphan with a [[Romani people|Romani]] mother, in an effort to add to the character's exotic mystique.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The so-called Transylvanian trilogy of historical novels by [[Miklos Banffy]], ''The Writing on the Wall'', is an extended treatment of the 19th- and early 20th-century social and political history of the country.  Among the first actors to portray [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|in film]] was [[Bela Lugosi]], who was born in Lugos (now [[Lugoj]]), in present-day Romania.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Prehistory of Transylvania]]\n* [[Siebenb\u00fcrgenlied]]\n{{clear|right}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Transylvania}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Patrick Leigh Fermor]], ''[[Between the Woods and the Water]]'' (New York Review of Books Classics, 2005; {{ISBN|1-59017-166-7}}).
