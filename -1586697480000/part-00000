London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;497.</ref> but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', \"to open\", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to \"open\", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of [[wikt:\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7#Greek|\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7]] (''\u00e1nixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''[[Aphrodite|Apru]]''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.<ref>Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. \"Monate\"</ref>\n\nApril was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]],<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29&nbsp;days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s&nbsp;BC, which produced the Julian calendar.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''\u0113astre-mona\u00fe''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''\u0113astre'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]].\n\n[[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=April|volume=2|page=230}}</ref>\n\nIn [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.\n\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[\u0160kofja Loka manuscript]].<ref name=\"KoledarDPG2007\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije ob\u010dine Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec <!-- |issn=C505-5857 --> |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe month Aprilis had 30&nbsp;days; [[Numa Pompilius]] made it 29&nbsp;days long; finally [[Julius Caesar]]\u2019s calendar reform made it again 30&nbsp;days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of [[Julian calendar|Augustus Caesar]] in 8&nbsp;BC. Additionally in the Spanish colony, Las Islas Filipinas (now known as the Philippines), the month Aprilis had a significant meaning to the life of the natives as it was associated to the influence of the Chinese during the Spanish colonial period. The importance of this aspect to the lives of the natives was formerly associated to an event called \"Abril na Ikaw\" as it is closely linked to the famous trader, April Yu.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Cerealia]] was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. [[Feriae Latinae]] was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include [[Veneralia]] (April 1), [[Megalesia]] (April 10\u201316), [[Fordicidia]] (April 15), [[Parilia]] (April 21), [[Vinalia|Vinalia Urbana]], [[Robigalia]], and [[Serapia]] were celebrated on (April 25). [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[Lyrids]] [[meteor shower]] appears on April 16 \u2013 April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22.

The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', \"to open\", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to \"open\", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of [[wikt:\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7#Greek|\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7]] (''\u00e1nixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''[[Aphrodite|Apru]]''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.<ref>Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. \"Monate\"</ref>\n\nApril was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]],<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29&nbsp;days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s&nbsp;BC, which produced the Julian calendar.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''\u0113astre-mona\u00fe''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''\u0113astre'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]].\n\n[[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=April|volume=2|page=230}}</ref>\n\nIn [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.\n\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[\u0160kofja Loka manuscript]].<ref name=\"KoledarDPG2007\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije ob\u010dine Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec <!-- |issn=C505-5857 --> |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe month Aprilis had 30&nbsp;days; [[Numa Pompilius]] made it 29&nbsp;days long; finally [[Julius Caesar]]\u2019s calendar reform made it again 30&nbsp;days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of [[Julian calendar|Augustus Caesar]] in 8&nbsp;BC. Additionally in the Spanish colony, Las Islas Filipinas (now known as the Philippines), the month Aprilis had a significant meaning to the life of the natives as it was associated to the influence of the Chinese during the Spanish colonial period. The importance of this aspect to the lives of the natives was formerly associated to an event called \"Abril na Ikaw\" as it is closely linked to the famous trader, April Yu.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Cerealia]] was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. [[Feriae Latinae]] was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include [[Veneralia]] (April 1), [[Megalesia]] (April 10\u201316), [[Fordicidia]] (April 15), [[Parilia]] (April 21), [[Vinalia|Vinalia Urbana]], [[Robigalia]], and [[Serapia]] were celebrated on (April 25). [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[Lyrids]] [[meteor shower]] appears on April 16 \u2013 April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22. [[Eta Aquariids]] meteor shower also appears in April. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The [[Pi Puppids]] appear on April 23, but only in years around the parent comet's [[perihelion]] date. The [[Virginids]] also shower at various dates in April.\n\nThe \"Days of April\" (''journ\u00e9es d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a [[July Monarchy#April 1834 insurrections|series of insurrections]] at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''proc\u00e8s d'avril''.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/>\n\n==April symbols==\n*[[File:Irish diamond.JPG|alt=Diamond crystals|thumb|[[Diamond]] crystals]][[File:Diamond.jpg|alt=Faceted diamond|thumb|Faceted diamond]]April's [[Birthstones|birthstone]] is the [[diamond (gemstone)|diamond]].\n*[[File:Daisy ntgr.JPG|alt=Daisy flower|thumb|[[Bellis perennis|Daisy]] flower]][[File:Sweet Pea (27711557850).jpg|alt=Sweet pea|thumb|[[Sweet pea]]]]The [[Birthday#Birth flowers|birth flower]] is typically listed as either the [[Common Daisy|Daisy]] ''(Bellis perennis)'' or the [[Sweet pea|Sweet Pea]].<ref>Kipfer, Barbara Ann (1997) ''The Order of Things.''

{"title_page": "Anti-tank warfare", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More footnotes|date= December 2010}}\n{{lead too long|date= December 2016}}\n}}\n\n[[File:FGR-17 VIPER.jpg|thumb|right|200px| A soldier preparing to fire the [[FGR-17 Viper]], an American one-man disposable antitank rocket]]\n\n'''Anti-tank warfare''' originated from the need to develop technology and [[Military tactics| tactics]] to destroy [[tank]]s during [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918). Since the [[Triple Entente]] developed the first tanks in 1916 but did not deploy them in battle until 1917, the [[German Empire]] developed the first anti-tank weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.antitank.co.uk/ww1_anti-tank_rifles1.htm|title= WW1 Anti-Tank rifles|accessdate= 10 October 2014}}</ref> The first developed anti-tank weapon was a scaled-up bolt-action rifle, the [[Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr]], that fired a 13mm cartridge with a solid bullet that could penetrate the thin armor of tanks of the time and destroy the engine or ricochet inside, killing occupants.<ref>Maj. Frederck Myatt M.C., ''Modern Small Arms'', Crescent Books, New York, NY, 1978, pp,228\u201329</ref> Because tanks represent an enemy's greatest [[force projection]] on land, military strategists have incorporated anti-tank warfare into the doctrine of nearly every combat service since. The most predominant anti-tank weapons at the start of [[World War II]] in 1939  included the [[Tank gun| tank-mounted gun]], [[#Anti-tank guns| anti-tank guns]] and [[anti-tank grenade]]s used by the [[Infantry#Equipment|infantry]], as well as [[ground-attack aircraft]].\n\nAnti-tank warfare evolved rapidly during World War II (1939\u20131945), leading to the inclusion of infantry-portable weapons such as the [[Bazooka]], anti-tank [[Combat engineering#Role, practices and techniques |combat engineering]], specialized anti-tank aircraft and self-propelled anti-tank guns ([[tank destroyer]]s). Both the Soviet [[Red Army]] and the [[German Army (Wehrmacht) |German Army]] developed methods of combating tank-led offensives, including deployment of static anti-tank weapons embedded in in-depth defensive positions, protected by anti-tank obstacles and [[Anti-tank mine| minefields]], and supported by mobile anti-tank [[Military reserve| reserves]] and by ground-attack aircraft.\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA18188.jpg|thumb|right| A British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|17-pounder anti-tank gun]] and [[half-track]] of the 87th ([[Devonshire Regiment]]) Anti-Tank Regiment approaches the River Foglia, Italy, 1 September 1944]]\n\nThrough the [[Cold War]], the United States, [[Soviet Union]] and other countries contemplated the possibility of nuclear warfare. While previous technology had developed to protect the crews of armored vehicles from projectiles and from explosive damage; the possibility of [[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear| radiation]] arose. In the [[NATO]] countries little if any development took place on defining a [[Military doctrine| doctrine]] of how to use armed forces without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s. In the Soviet sphere of influence the legacy doctrine of [[Soviet deep battle| operational maneuver]] was being [[Military doctrine#Military doctrine in the former Soviet Union and Russia| theoretically examined]] to understand how a tank-led force could be used even with the threat of limited use of nuclear weapons on prospective European battlefields. The [[Warsaw Pact]] arrived at the solution of [[maneuver warfare]] while massively increasing the number of anti-tank weapons. To achieve this, Soviet military theorists such as [[Vasily Sokolovsky]] (1897\u20131968) realized that anti-tank weapons had to assume an offensive role rather than the traditionally defensive role of the [[Great Patriotic War]] (1941\u20131945) by becoming more mobile. This led to the development of improved [[Anti-tank guided missile| guided anti-tank missiles]], though similar design work was being performed in Western Europe and the United States.\n\nBoth sides in the [[Cold War]] also recognized the utility of the light anti-tank weapon, and this led to further development of man-portable weapons used by the infantry squad, while heavier missiles were mounted on dedicated [[Tank destroyer#Post-World War II development |missile tank-destroyers]], including dedicated [[Attack helicopter |anti-tank helicopters]], and even heavier guided anti-tank [[Air-to-surface missile| missiles launched from aircraft]]. Designers also developed new varieties of artillery munitions in the form of [[Artillery shell#Guided shells| top-attack shells]], and shells that were used to saturate areas with [[Cluster munition#Anti-tank| anti-armor bomblets]]. Helicopters could be used as well to rapidly deliver scattered anti-tank mines.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War in 1992, the only major new threats to tanks and other armored vehicles have been remotely detonated [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs) used in [[asymmetric warfare]] and weapon systems like the [[RPG-29]] and [[FGM-148 Javelin]], which can defeat [[reactive armor]] or shell armor. Both those weapon systems use a [[tandem warhead]] where the first stage of the tandem warhead activates the reactive armor, and the second stage of the tandem warhead defeats the shell armor by means of a [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead |High Explosive Anti Tank]] (HEAT) [[shaped charge]].\n\n==Tank threat==\nAnti-tank warfare evolved as a countermeasure to the threat of the tank's appearance on the battlefields of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of the First World War. The tank had been developed to negate the German [[trench warfare|system of trenches]], and allow a return to [[Flanking maneuver|maneuver against enemy's flanks]] and to [[Encirclement|attack the rear]] with [[cavalry]].\n \nThe use of the tank was primarily based on the assumption that, once they were able to eliminate the German trench lines with their machine gun and [[Infantry support gun]] positions, the Allied infantry would follow and secure the breach, and the cavalry would exploit the breach in the trench lines by attacking into the depth of German-held territory, eventually capturing the [[field artillery]] positions and interdicting logistics and reserves being brought up from the rear areas. Naval crews{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} initially used to operate the installed naval guns and machine guns were replaced with Army personnel who were more aware of the [[Infantry tactics#Trench warfare tactics|infantry tactics]] with which the tanks were intended to cooperate. However, there was no means of communication between the tank's crew and the accompanying infantry, or between the tanks participating in combat. Radios were not yet portable or robust enough to be mounted in a tank, although Morse Code transmitters were installed in some Mark IVs at Cambrai as messaging vehicles.<ref>Macksey, K., Tank vs Tank, Grub Street, London, 1999, p.32</ref> Attaching a field telephone to the rear would become a practice only during the next war. With greater use of tanks by both sides it was realized that the accompanying infantry could be forced to ground by [[ambush]] fire, thus separating them from the tanks, which would continue to advance, eventually finding themselves exposed to [[Small unit tactics|close-assaults]] by German infantry and sappers.\n\nThe early tanks were mechanically rudimentary. The {{convert|0.23|to|0.47|in|mm|adj=on}} thick armor generally prevented penetration by [[small arms]] fire and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shell fragments]]. However, even a near miss from field artillery or an impact from a mortar [[Shell (projectile)#High-explosive|HE round]] easily disabled or destroyed the tank: if the [[fuel tank]] was ruptured, it could incinerate the tank's crew. A large caliber gun was recognized as a tactical necessity to attack machine gun positions and defeat any infantry field pieces found in the trench lines which could easily disable [[Continuous track|tank track]] with the HE ammunition. This was achieved by mounting a [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss]] light 57&nbsp;mm naval gun mounted in the hull [[barbette]]s. Hull and track engineering was largely dictated by the [[terrain]]\u2014the need to cross wide trenches\u2014although the relationship between [[ground pressure]] and [[Soil mechanics|soil-vehicle mechanics]] was not resolved until the Second World War. [[Gun turret|Turrets]] were later introduced on medium and light tanks to react to ambushes during the advance.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n==First World War==\nThe tank, when it appeared on the Western Front in September 1916, was a surprise to German troops, but not the [[German General Staff]]. The French Army Staff was highly critical of the British Army's [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette#The debut of the tank|early fielding]] of the Mark I vehicles in small numbers because the French trials showed the armored vehicles to be highly unreliable. They judged that large numbers had to be employed to sustain an offensive despite losses to mechanical failure or vehicles being foundered in intractable [[no man's land]] terrain. These losses, coupled with those from enemy artillery fire, later amounted to as high as 70% of the starters during some operations. Deploying small numbers of tanks would therefore cause the Allies to lose the [[Indirect approach|element of surprise]], allowing Germans to develop countermeasures.\n\n[[File:The Battle of Arras, April-May 1917 Q6286.jpg|left|thumb|A British heavy tank of World War One]]\n\n===Anti-tank weapons===\nBecause the German Army was the only force in need of anti-tank weapons, they were first to develop a viable technology to combat the armored vehicle. These technologies took three [[ammunition]] approaches: use of grenades by infantrymen, including the ''Geballte Ladung'' (\"Bundled Charge\") of several stick grenades bound together by pioneers; early attempts at the small-caliber [[anti-tank rifles]] like the [[Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr|13&nbsp;mm Mauser bolt-action]]; and 3.7&nbsp;cm TaK Rheinmetall in starrer R\u00e4der-lafette 1916 [[anti-tank gun]] on a light carriage which could destroy a tank<ref>John Norris, Anti-tank weapons, p.7</ref> using large-caliber [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] ammunition issued in 1917 to special commands; and the existing 77&nbsp;mm field guns (such as the [[7.7 cm FK 16]]) of the infantry division's artillery regiment were also eventually issued with special armor-piercing (AP) ammunition.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R27012, Bei Cambrai erbeuteter englischer Panzer.jpg|thumb|right|A disabled Mark IV tank near [[Cambrai]], 1917 \u2013 World War I]]\n\n===Anti-tank tactics===\nWith the appearance of Allied tanks, the German Army were quick to introduce new anti-tank defense detachments within the pioneer battalions of the infantry divisions. These were initially issued 1.3&nbsp;cm caliber long barrel rifles firing solid shot. However, these suffered from fouling after 2\u20133 rounds and had a recoil that was unsustainable by the mechanism or the rifleman. Stick grenades were used to destroy the tracks by individual pioneers, however this required accompanying machine-gunners to first separate the supporting Allied infantry line from the tanks, which proved difficult. Another tactic was to lure the tank beyond the German trench-line, re-establishing it just as the Allied infantry approached. The tank would then be engaged by the divisional ''7.7&nbsp;cm'' guns brought forward, that would try to disable the tracks with ordinary HE shells (and later AP ammunition). If the crews of the disabled tanks refused to surrender, they were engaged with flamethrowers, or a mortar would be fired on the stricken vehicle until a direct hit was achieved on the top surface, usually resulting in an internal fire. Finally, anti-tank obstacles were prepared on the likely approaches by deepening and widening existing ground cratering, the precursors of the [[anti-tank trench]]. Finally in early 1917 the ''3.7&nbsp;cm TaK'' from [[Rheinmetall]] was rushed to the frontline, and proved effective in destroying the tanks despite limited elevation and traverse.\n\n==Development between the world wars==\n\nLack of consensus on the design and use of the tank after the First World War also influenced the development of its anti-tank countermeasures. However, because Germany was restricted by the [[Treaty of Versailles#Military restrictions|Treaty of Versailles]] in its military capability, and there were no other challenges to France and Britain, very little development took place in anti-tank warfare until the 1930s.\n\n[[File:Protitankov\u00fd kan\u00f3n 3,7 cm vz.gif|thumb|left|Czechoslovak anti-tank gun [[3,7cm KP\u00daV vz. 37]] .]]\nThe [[Interwar period]] was dominated by the strategic thinking with [[Fortification#20th and 21st centuries|fortified]] borders at its core. These included obstacles consisting of natural features such as [[ditch (fortification)|ditches]], [[stream]]s and [[urban area]]s, or constructed obstacles such as anti-tank ditches, [[land mine|minefields]], [[Dragon's teeth (fortification)|dragon's teeth]], or log barriers. The pinnacle of this strategic thinking was considered to be the [[Maginot Line]] which replaced infantry-filled trenches with artillery-filled [[bunker]]s, including [[casemate]]s housing 37 or 47&nbsp;mm anti-tank guns, and steel turrets armed with a pair of machine guns and a 25&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun, although Germany was forbidden to produce tanks. The construction was partially based on the Allied experience with the [[Hindenburg Line]] which was breached with tank support during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|battles of Cambrai]] and [[Battle of St. Quentin Canal|St. Quentin Canal]], although German Command was more impressed by the surprise achieved by the Canadian troops at the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord]]. This came to influence their planning in 1940.\n\nThe Maginot line defenses \u2013 up to {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} deep from the forward positions to the rear line \u2013 were intended to prevent a surprise attack and delay any attack while the French Army was mobilized. With the relative numerical inferiority between the France and Germany, it was a more effective use of manpower. Within the line, passive anti-tank obstacles were supported by anti-infantry and anti-tank bunkers. After Belgium declared neutrality in 1936, France began work on extending the line along the Belgian border.\n\nImproved artillery was seen as the quickest solution to anti-tank defense, and one of the earliest post-war anti-tank gun designs was the [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun|25&nbsp;mm Hotchkiss]] model from France. It was intended to replace an [[Canon d'Infanterie de 37 mod\u00e8le 1916 TRP|Atelier de Puteaux 37&nbsp;mm]] weapon designed in 1916 to destroy machine gun positions. [[Rheinmetall]] commenced design of a 37&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun in 1924 and the first guns were produced in 1928 as 3.7&nbsp;cm Pak L/45,<ref>Terry Gander and Peter Chamberlain, ''Small Arms, Artillery and Special Weapons of the Third Reich'', MacDonald and Janes, London, 1978, p.107</ref> later adopted in Wehrmacht service as [[3.7 cm Pak 36]]. It made an appearance during the [[Spanish Civil War]], as did the [[Bofors 37 mm]] developed in Sweden, and used by many early Second World War combatants. The British Army accepted for service the (40&nbsp;mm) [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder]], which was developed as a [[tank gun]]. The Soviet [[Red Army]] after the [[Russian Civil War#Northwest Russia : Yudenich's campaign|Russian Civil War]] also begun a search for an anti-tank gun with a French Hotchkiss 37&nbsp;mm L.33 tank gun, but soon upgraded this to a higher velocity L.45 Model 1935 while also making a licensed copy of the German [[3.7 cm Pak 36|3.7&nbsp;cm PaK 36]]. However, the Red Army was almost immediately taught a lesson about anti-tank warfare when a tank [[battalion]] sent to aid the Spanish Republicans in the [[Spanish Civil War]] was almost entirely destroyed in an [[Engagement (military)|engagement]].\n\nAt this time, the predominant ammunition used against tanks was the [[armor-piercing]] [[kinetic energy]] shell that defeated armor by direct [[pressure]], spiking or punching through it. During the late 1930s [[shaped charge]] ammunition was experimented with that used [[chemical energy]] for armor penetration. The shaped charge concept is officially known as the \"Munroe Effect\" and was discovered by accident decades earlier by Professor Charles E. Munroe at the U.S. Torpedo Station, Providence, RI. Professor Munroe was detonating different manufactured blocks of explosives on a sheet of armor plating and observed the blocks having the manufacturing letters recessed (vs. raised) cut an imprint of the manufacturing letters into the armor plate\u2014the birth of the shaped-charged explosive which focuses the blast energy caused by an indentation on the surface area of an explosive.<ref>Dr. J.R. Crittenden, \"RPG-The Devil's Finger\", ''Shotgun News'', Nov. 20, 2003, P.30.</ref> Although shaped charges are somewhat more difficult to manufacture, the advantage is that the projectile does not require as high velocity as typical kinetic energy shells, yet on impact it creates a high-[[velocity]] jet of metal flowing like a liquid due to the immense pressure (though x-ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid<ref>JOURNAL OF BATTLEFIELD TECHNOLOGY,\n VOL 1, NO 1, MARCH 1998, SOME METALLURGICAL ASPECTS OF SHAPED CHARGE LINERS, Alistair Doig, p.1.</ref>) which [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamically]] penetrates the armor and kills occupants inside.<ref>Chant, Christoper, ''How Weapons Work'', Marshal Cavendish, Ltd,, Hong Kong, 1980, p.50.</ref> The depth of the penetration, though proportional to the length of the jet and the [[square root]] of its [[Density#Densities of various materials|density]], is also dependent on the strength of the armor. With the development of this new ammunition begun more advanced research into [[Steelmaking|steel manufacturing]], and development of [[spaced armor]] that caused \"jet waver\" by detonating prematurely or at the wrong angle to the surface of the main armor.\n\nThe only significant attempt to experiment in the use of tanks in the late 1920s was that of the British Army's [[Experimental Mechanized Force]] that influenced future development of tanks, armored troops and entire armies of both its future enemies and allies in the next war.\n\nIn Spain, the anti-tank defense of the Nationalists was organized by the [[Wehrmacht#History|Wehrmacht]] officers, and the anti-tank guns were incorporated into a system of obstacles that were constructed with the intent to stop an attack by tanks by slowing it down, separating them from supporting infantry (advancing on foot) with machine-gun and mortar fire, and forcing tanks to conduct deliberate head-on assaults with engineer support, or seek a less-defended area to attack. [[Minefield]]s laid with purpose-designed [[Anti-tank mine#Inter-War|mines]] were used for the first time, destroying tank tracks, and forcing [[combat engineer]]s to [[Mine clearance#Removal methods in demining|clear]] them on foot. Delay meant that Nationalist field artillery could engage the [[BT-5|lightly armored Soviet tanks]]. This meant a change in Republican operational and eventually strategic planning, and a more protracted combat operations, with more casualties at a greater cost.\n\nThe only change to the German anti-tank tactics of the First World War was that now an effective anti-tank weapon was available to support the defending infantry. However, the Soviet tanks armed with 45&nbsp;mm guns easily destroyed the German light tanks.\n\nIronically, in the early 1930s until the Spanish War, German officers were conducting secret testing of a new way of employing tanks, infantry and artillery [[Offensive (military)|offensively]] in the Soviet Union with the cooperation of the Red Army. In Germany, these developments eventually culminated in tactics that later came to be known as [[Blitzkrieg]], while in the Soviet Union they formed the core of the [[deep battle]] operational doctrine. The successful test of the latter was during the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] although the Red Army foundered on the [[Winter War#Defence of the Mannerheim Line|Mannerheim Line]] in 1940, largely due to the [[Great Purge#Purge of the army|purge in the Officer Corps]], claiming many of the [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky#The theory of deep operations|senior proponents]] of the new doctrine. Anti-tank artillery would be included in mobile tank-led Wehrmacht and Red Army units due to the possibility of encountering enemy tanks in a [[meeting engagement]].\n\nThe new doctrines of using the tank, were divided into infantry and cavalry [[School of thought|schools of thought]]. The former regarded the tank as a mobile artillery system to be used for infantry support. This suggested that the infantry needed to be armed with integral anti-tank weapons. The latter advocated use of tanks in the traditional cavalry way of high-tempo attacks intended to outflank the enemy infantry and sever its communication lines. This approach suggested that the tank was the best anti-tank system, and only limited anti-tank troops were required to accompany them. For this reason the late 30s [[Tank classification|tank configurations]] came in a great diversity, ranging from light [[tankettes]] and [[cavalry tank]]s to multi-turreted [[heavy tank]]s resembling bunkers, all of which had to be considered in training by the anti-tank artillery troops. The development of these doctrines was the most significant influence on the rapid development in anti-tank technology and tactics in the Second World War.\n\n==Second World War==\nTwo aspects of how the Second World War commenced helped to delay development of anti-tank warfare: resignation and surprise. After Poland was attacked, its allies in the West were resigned to its defeat by a numerically superior Wehrmacht. The little information that was brought out about the conduct of combat during that campaign did nothing to convince either France, Britain or the USSR of the need for improved anti-tank technology and tactics. The reliance on the Maginot Line, and the subsequent surprise of the German offensive left no time to develop existing capabilities and tactics in the West. The British were preparing the stop lines and the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II#Lines and islands|anti-tank islands]] to slow enemy progress and restrict the route of an attack. The Red Army however was fortunate in having several excellent designs for anti-tank warfare that were either in final stages of development for production, or had been rejected earlier as unnecessary and could now be rushed into production. The relative ease with which the older models of Red Army's tank fleet were destroyed by German anti-tank weapons, using tactics already seen in Spain, once and for all focused Stavka attention on anti-tank warfare as Soviet armies were repeatedly encircled by panzer-led strategic pincer maneuvers. Of the major iconic Soviet weapons of the Second World War, two were made exclusively for anti-tank warfare, the [[T-34]] and the [[Ilyushin Il-2]] ''Shturmovik''. The former was one of the most manufactured tanks in history, and the latter, itself dubbed the 'flying tank', was one of the most manufactured aircraft. The war also saw the creation and almost immediate abandonment of the self-propelled tank destroyer which would be replaced post war by the anti tank guided missile.\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[File:RIAN archive 225 IL-2 attacking.jpg|thumb|Soviet [[Ilyushin Il-2]] planes with 23 mm cannons attacking a German tank column during the [[Battle of Kursk]]]]\nAs tanks were rarely used in conflicts between the two World Wars, no specific aircraft or tactics were developed to combat them from the air. One solution adopted by almost all European air forces was to use bomb loads for conventional bombers that were composed from small bombs allowing a higher density during bombing. This created a greater chance of causing a direct impact on the thinner top armor of the tank while also having the ability to damage track and wheels through proximity detonation.\n\nThe first aircraft capable of engaging tanks was the [[Junkers Ju 87]] \"Stuka\" using [[dive bombing]] to place the bomb close to the target. Some French and German fighters fitted with 20&nbsp;mm cannon were also able to engage thinner top armor surfaces of the tanks early in the war. The Stuka was also given cannons for anti-armor role though it was obsolete by 1942, and was joined by the [[Henschel Hs 129]] that mounted a podded {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[MK 101 cannon]] beneath its fuselage, while the Red Army Air Force fielded the Soviet [[Ilyushin Il-2]] armed with a pair of 23&nbsp;mm cannons and unguided rockets, but armored to enable the pilots to approach German tanks at very low altitude, ignoring small arms, machine-gun and even small anti-aircraft cannon fire that usually provided tanks with protection against the bombers. Il-2s could also carry large numbers of 2.5&nbsp;kg shaped-charge anti-tank [[PTAB (bomb)|PTAB]] bombs.\n\nTo give it more firepower against tanks, the RAF mounted two underwing pod-mounted 40&nbsp;mm [[Vickers S]] cannon on the [[Hawker Hurricane]] (as the [[Hawker Hurricane variants#Hurricane Mk II|Mk. IID]]), which saw service in North Africa in 1942 and the [[Hawker Typhoon]] was given HE rockets though these were more effective against other ground vehicles. From March 1943 the Red Army Air Force produced the more agile [[Yakovlev Yak-9]]T (37&nbsp;mm cannon) and K (45&nbsp;mm cannon) bomber interceptor also used for ground attack, with a single example of either gun in ''motornaya pushka'' mounts attached to the engine's gear reduction unit, that had either one of them firing through a hollow-center propeller shaft.\n\nFollowing [[Operation Overlord]] in 1944, the military version of the slow-flying [[Piper J-3 Cub]] high-wing light civilian monoplane, the L-4 Grasshopper, usually used for liaison and artillery-spotting, began to be used in a light anti-armor role by a few U.S. Army artillery spotter units over France; these aircraft were field-outfitted with either two or four [[bazooka]] rocket launchers attached to the [[lift strut]]s,<ref>Francis, Devon E., ''Mr. Piper and His Cubs'', Iowa State University Press, {{ISBN|0-8138-1250-X}}, 9780813812502 (1973), p. 117.</ref> against German armored fighting vehicles. During the summer of 1944, U.S. Army [[Charles Carpenter (lieutenant colonel)|Major Charles Carpenter]] managed to successfully take on an anti-armor role with his rocket-armed Piper L-4. His L-4, named ''Rosie the Rocketeer'', armed with six bazookas, had a notable anti-armor success during an engagement during the [[Battle of Arracourt#The battle|Battle of Arracourt]] on September 20, 1944, knocking out at least four German armored vehicles,<ref>Gantt, Marlene, ''Riding His Piper Cub Through The Skies Over France, Bazooka Charlie Fought A One-man War'', World War II Magazine, September 1987</ref> as a pioneering example of taking on heavy enemy armor from a lightweight slow-flying aircraft.<ref>Fountain, Paul, ''The Maytag Messerschmitts'', Flying Magazine, March 1945, p. 90</ref>\n\n===Field artillery===\nField artillery were often the first ground combat arm to engage detected concentration of troops which included tanks through artillery airborne observers, either in assembly areas (for refueling and rearming), during approach marches to the combat zone, or as the tank unit was forming up for the attack. Conventional artillery shells were very effective against the tank's thinner top armor if fired in appropriate density while the tanks were concentrated, enabling direct hits by a sufficiently powerful shell. Even a non-penetrating shell could still disable a tank through dynamic shock, internal armor shattering or simply overturning the tank. More importantly the tanks could be disabled due to damage to tracks and wheels, and their supporting vehicles and personnel could be damaged and killed, reducing unit's ability to fight in the longer term. Because tanks were usually accompanied by infantry mounted on trucks or [[half-track]]ed vehicles that lacked overhead armor, field artillery that fired a mix of ground and air-burst ammunition was likely to inflict heavy casualties on the infantry as well. Field guns, such as the [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder]], were provided with armor-piercing shot for direct engagement of enemy tanks.\n\n===Anti-tank guns {{anchor|Anti-tank guns}}===<!-- This section is linked from [[Chinese Civil War]] --><!-- This section is linked from [[Cruiser tank]] --><!-- this section is linked from [[T-26]] -->\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2008}}\n{{see also|Anti-tank gun|Tank gun}}\n[[File:37mm bofors antitank gun parola 2.jpg|thumb|right|Bofors 37&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun as used by several nations]]\nAnti-tank guns are guns designed to destroy armored vehicles from defensive positions. In order to penetrate vehicle armor, they fire smaller caliber shells from longer-barreled guns to achieve higher muzzle velocity than field artillery weapons, many of which are [[howitzer]]s. The higher velocity, flatter trajectory [[ballistics]] provide terminal [[Kinetic energy penetrator|kinetic energy]] to penetrate the moving/static target's armor at a given range and contact's angle. Any field artillery [[cannon]] with barrel length 15 to 25 times longer than its [[caliber]] was able also to fire anti-tank ammunition, such as the Soviet [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|A-19]].\n\nPrior to [[World War II]], few anti-tank guns had (or needed) calibers larger than 50&nbsp;mm. Examples of guns in this class include the [[3.7 cm PaK 36|German 37&nbsp;mm]], [[37 mm Gun M3|US 37&nbsp;mm]] (the largest gun able to be towed by the [[jeep]]), [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun|French 25&nbsp;mm]] and [[47 mm APX anti-tank gun|47&nbsp;mm]] guns, [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|British QF 2-pounder (40&nbsp;mm)]], [[Cannone da 47/32 M35|Italian 47 mm]] and [[45 mm anti-tank gun M1937 (53-K)|Soviet 45&nbsp;mm]]. All of these light weapons could penetrate the thin armor found on most pre-war and early war tanks.\n\n[[File:Pak38 cfb borden 2.JPG|thumb|left|German [[PaK 38]] 50-mm anti-tank gun]]\nAt the start of [[World War II]], many of these weapons were still being used operationally, along with a newer generation of light guns that closely resembled their WWI counterparts. After Soviet [[T-34 tank|T-34]] and [[KV tank|KV]] tanks were encountered, these guns were recognized as ineffective against [[sloped armor]], with the German lightweight 37&nbsp;mm gun quickly nicknamed the \"tank door knocker\" ({{lang-ger|Panzeranklopfger\u00e4t}}), for revealing its presence without penetrating the armor.\n\nGermany introduced more powerful anti-tank guns, some which had been in the early stages of development prior to the war. By late 1942, the Germans had an excellent [[5 cm PaK 38|50-mm high-velocity design]], while they faced the [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6-pounder]] introduced in the [[North African Campaign]] by the British Army, and later adopted by the [[57 mm Gun M1#U.S. service|US Army]]. By 1943 Wehrmacht was forced to adopt still larger calibers on the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]], the [[7.5 cm PaK 40|75&nbsp;mm]] and the famous [[88 mm gun|88&nbsp;mm]] guns. The Red Army used a variety of 45&nbsp;mm, [[57 mm anti-tank gun M1943 (ZiS-2)|57&nbsp;mm]], and [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100&nbsp;mm]] guns, as well as deploying general-purpose 76.2&nbsp;mm and 122-mm guns in the anti-tank role. For the [[Invasion of Normandy]], the British produced the 3-inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) calibre [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder|QF 17 pounder]], whose design had begun before the 6 pounder entered service, which proved to be a highly effective anti-tank gun and was also used on the [[Sherman Firefly|tank]] and the [[Archer (tank destroyer)|tank destroyer]].\n\n====Tank Destroyers====\n{{main|Tank destroyer}} {{see also|Panzerj\u00e4ger|Jagdpanzer}}\n[[File:Archer SP 17 pdr Tank Destroyer.jpg|thumb|right|A British [[Archer (tank destroyer)|Archer tank destroyer]], based on the hull of a [[Valentine tank]]]]\nAs towed anti-tank cannon guns grew in size and weight, they became less mobile and more cumbersome to maneuver, and required ever larger gun crews, who often had to wrestle the gun into position while under heavy artillery and/or tank fire. As the war progressed, this disadvantage often resulted in the loss or destruction of both the antitank gun and its trained crew. This gave impetus to the development of the self-propelled, lightly armored \"[[tank destroyer]]\" (TD). The tank destroyer was usually based on the hull of existing tank designs, using either a gun integrated into the hull or a fully rotating turret much like that of a conventional tank. These self-propelled (SP) AT guns were first employed as infantry support weapons in place of towed antitank guns. Later, due to a shortage of tanks, TDs sometimes replaced the former in offensive armored operations.\n\nEarly German-designed tank destroyers, such as the [[Marder I]], employed existing light French or Czech design tank chassis, installing an AT gun as part of an armored, turret-less superstructure. This method reduced both weight and conversion costs. The Soviet Union later adopted this style of self-propelled anti-tank gun or tank destroyer. This type of tank destroyer had the advantage of a reduced silhouette, allowing the crew to more frequently fire from [[defilade]] [[ambush]] positions. Such designs were easier and faster to manufacture and offered good crew protection, though the lack of a turret limited the gun's traverse to a few degrees. This meant that, if the TD became immobilized due to engine failure or track damage, it could not rotate its gun to counter opposing tanks, making it an easy target. This vulnerability was later exploited by opposing tank forces. Late in the war, it was not unusual to find even the largest and most powerful tank destroyer abandoned on the field after a battle, having been immobilized by a single high-explosive shell to the track or front drive sprocket.\n\nUS Army pre-war infantry support doctrines emphasized the use of tank destroyers with open-top fully rotating turrets, featuring less armor than the standard [[M4 Sherman]] tanks, but with more powerful cannon. A 76&nbsp;mm long-barrel tank cannon was fitted to the Sherman-based [[M10 tank destroyer|M10]] and all-new design [[M18 Hellcat|M18]] designs, with the M18 being the fastest-moving American AFV of any type in World War II.<ref>{{citation |title=M18 Hellcat Tank Destroyer 1943\u201397 |first= Steven J |last=Zaloga |date= 27 April 2004 |page=14 |isbn=1-84176-687-9}}</ref> Late in 1944, the Sherman-origin [[M36 tank destroyer|M36]] appeared, equipped with a 90&nbsp;mm cannon. With rotating turrets and good combat maneuverability, American TD designs generally worked well, although their light armor was no match for enemy tank cannon fire during one on one confrontations. Another disadvantage proved to be the open, unprotected turret, and casualties from artillery fire soon led to the introduction of folding armor turret covers. Near the war's end, a change in official doctrine caused both the self-propelled tank destroyer and the towed antitank gun to fall from favor in U.S. service, increasingly replaced by conventional tanks or infantry level antitank weapons. Despite this change, the M36 tank destroyer continued in service, and was used in combat as late as the [[Korean War]].\n\nThe third, and likely most effective kind of tank destroyer was the unturreted, [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|casemate]]-style tank destroyer, known by the [[Jagdpanzer]] term in German service, or [[Samokhodnaya Ustanovka]] in Soviet service for their own designs. These generally featured a heavy gun mounted on an older or then-current tank chassis, with the gun pointing forward with a limited degree of traverse. Casemate tank destroyers often had the same amount of armour as the tanks they were based on. The removal of the turret allowed for greater room to mount a larger gun with a larger breech and leave room for crew. Many casemate tank destroyers either originated as, or were dual-purpose vehicles with the duty of a self-propelled gun, which share many (but usually not all) of the same features and layout. Some examples are the German [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III]] \u2013 the most-produced German armored fighting vehicle of WW II \u2014 and the Soviets' [[SU-100]], itself based on the [[T-34 tank]]'s hull and drivetrain.\n\n===Infantry===\n\n====Rifles====\n[[File:Ptrs003.jpg|right|thumb|The Soviet [[PTRS-41]] anti-tank rifle during World War II.]]\n{{See also|Anti-tank rifle}}\n\nAnti-tank rifles were introduced in some armies before the Second World War to provide infantry with a stand-off weapon when confronted with a tank assault. The intention was to preserve the morale of the infantry by providing a weapon that could actually defeat a tank. [[Anti-tank rifle]]s were developed in several countries during the 1930s. By the beginning of WW2, anti-tank rifle teams could knock out most tanks from a distance of about 500&nbsp;m, and do so with a weapon that was man-portable and easily concealed. Although the AT rifle performance was negated by the increased armor of medium and heavy tanks by 1942, they remained viable against lighter-armored and unarmored vehicles, and against field fortification embrasures.\n\nNotable examples include the Finnish [[Lahti L-39]] (which was also used as a sniper rifle during the [[Continuation War]]), the automatic Japanese [[Type 97 20 mm anti-tank rifle]], the German [[Panzerb\u00fcchse 38]], [[Panzerb\u00fcchse 39]], the Polish [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|wz.35]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] 14.5&nbsp;mm [[PTRD]] and [[PTRS-41]].\n\nBy 1943, most armies judged anti-tank rifles to lack combat effectiveness due to the diminished ability to penetrate the thicker armor of new tanks \u2013\nthe British Army had abandoned them by 1942 and the Wehrmacht by 1943, while the US Army never adopted the weapon, although the USMC used [[Boys anti-tank rifle]]s in the Pacific Theater. However, the [[anti-tank rifle]] remained in Soviet use during the conflict due to the importance it occupied in its doctrine of anti-tank in-depth defense, first demonstrated during the defense of Moscow and again during the Kursk battles. This became particularly true later in the war when the Red Army assumed an almost constant offensive, and anti-tank in-depth defensive deployments were used for protecting flanks of the operational breakthroughs against German tactical counterattacks. By firing on the lighter armored infantry and support vehicles (e.g. [[artillery tractor]]s) the anti-tank rifle units helped to separate the supporting infantry (''[[panzergrenadiers]]'') and artillery of the German tanks and so forced the tanks to halt at short distances from the concealed anti-tank guns leaving them exposed to fire from larger, longer ranged anti-tank guns. PTRS-41 semi-automatic anti-tank rifles were also used for sniping since an additional tracer round enabled rapid fire adjustment by the gunner. Although optical sniper scopes were tried with the PTRS-41, the weapons proved too inaccurate at sniping distances (800&nbsp;m or more), and the recoil too much for effective use of the scopes.\n\n===={{anchor|AT_rockets}}Rockets and shaped charges====\n[[File:PIAT cropped.jpg|thumb|British [[PIAT]]]]\nThe development of light, man-portable, anti-tank weapons increased during the Second World War. Most were based on the [[Munroe effect]] which led to the development of the [[high-explosive]] [[shaped charge]]. These weapons were called [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead|high-explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT). The destructive effect was reliant entirely on the kinetic energy of the explosion rather than the ballistic speed of the round on the damage inflicted to the armor. The effect was also concentrated and could penetrate more armor for a given amount of explosives. The first HEAT rounds were rifle grenades, but better delivery systems were soon introduced: the British [[PIAT]] was propelled in a manner similar to the [[spigot mortar]] with a blackpowder charge contained in the tailfin assembly, the US [[Bazooka]] and the German ''[[Panzerschreck]]'' used rockets, and the German ''[[Panzerfaust]]'' was a small [[recoilless gun]]. The HEAT warhead was retroactively used to give more power to smaller calibre weapons such as in the conversion of the otherwise limited German 37&nbsp;mm PaK guns to fire a large shell, called [[Stielgranate 41]], that fitted over the barrel rather than down in it, to a greater range than the ''Panzerschreck'' could manage.\n\nThe [[Hungarian 44M|Hungarian 44M \"\"Buzog\u00e1nyvet\u0151\"\"]] was a successful unguided rocket used extensively in the [[Siege of Budapest]].\n[[File:Trigat-LR-detoured.jpg|thumb|[[PARS 3 LR]] with HEAT warhead of the [[German Army]].]]\nAfter the war, research on infantry anti-tank weapons continued, with most designers focused on two primary goals: first an anti-tank weapon that could defeat more heavily armored postwar tanks and fighting vehicles, and second a weapon lightweight and portable enough for infantry use.\n\n====Mines and other explosives====\n{{Main|Anti-tank mine}}\n[[File:Lunge AT Mine.jpg|thumb|right|A statue of a Vietminh soldier holding a Lunge AT Mine.

These ranged from [[hollow charge]] designs (e.g., the British [[No. 68 AT Grenade]]), to ones that simply contained a lot of explosive (the British [[No. 73 Grenade]]). To increase their effectiveness, some grenades were designed so that they adhered to the tank either through an adhesive ([[sticky bomb]]) or with a magnet. The Germans used a magnetic grenade, the [[Hafthohlladung]] to ensure that the [[shaped charge]] would fire at the optimal 90\u00b0 angle to the armor.\n\nThere was also a special type of grenade called the ''Nebelhandgranaten'' or ''Blendk\u00f6rper'' (\"smoke hand grenades\"), which was supposed to be smashed over an air vent and fill the tank with smoke, widely used by both sides in [[World War II]]. [[Molotov cocktails]] also saw much use, especially in the [[Winter War]], early tanks (such as the [[T-26]]) being very vulnerable to them, but later tanks required a well-thrown bottle directly over the engine compartment to have any effect at all.\n\nOn the whole, thrown anti-tank weapons suffered from a variety of drawbacks. In addition to the inherently short range, they required careful aim to be effective, and those that relied on explosive force were often so powerful that the user had to take cover immediately.\n\n===Tactics===\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2009}}\n[[File:Talvisota Molotov Cocktail.PNG|thumb|right|upright|A [[Finnish Army|Finnish soldier]] with a Molotov cocktail in the 1939\u201340 [[Winter War]].]]\nAnti-tank tactics developed rapidly during the war but along different paths in different armies based on the threats they faced and the technologies they were able to produce. Very little development took place in UK because weapons available in 1940 were judged adequate for engaging Italian and German tanks during most of the [[North African Campaign]]. Its experience therefore failed to influence the US Army's anti-tank doctrine prior to 1944.\nFrom 1941, German anti-tank tactics developed rapidly as a result of being surprised by the previously unknown Soviet tank designs, forcing introduction of new technologies and new tactics. The Red Army was also faced with a new challenge in anti-tank warfare after losing most of its tank fleet and a considerable part of its anti-tank capable cannons.\n\nAnti-tank tactics during the war were largely integrated with the offensive or defensive posture of the troops being supported, usually infantry. Most anti-tank tactics depend on the range effectiveness of various weapons and weapon systems available. These are divided as follows:\n*Operational range over the horizon (20\u201340&nbsp;km range)\n*:Bomber aircraft and long range artillery\n*Tactical staging areas (7\u201320&nbsp;km range)\n*:Ground attack aircraft and field artillery including [[Multiple rocket launcher|MRL]]s\n*Tactical zone forming-up area and rear combat zone (2\u20137&nbsp;km range)\n*:Heavy anti-tank guns and mortars\n*Tactical forward combat zone (1\u20132&nbsp;km range)\n*:Anti-tank guns and tanks deployed in defense\n*Engagement distance (200\u20131000&nbsp;m range)\n*:Mines and anti-tank rifles\n*Close combat distance (25\u2013200&nbsp;m range)\n*:Infantry anti-tank weapons\n\nGround-to-air cooperation was not yet systematic in any army of the period, but given sufficient warning ground attack aircraft could support ground troops even during an enemy attack in an attempt to interdict the enemy units before they come into tactical combat zone. Various bomb loads can be used depending on what type of tank unit is engaged in at the time or who its accompanying troops are. This is an indirect form of anti-tank warfare where the tanks are denied the opportunity to even reach combat.\n\nField artillery was particularly effective in firing against tank formations because although they were rarely able to destroy a tank by direct penetration, they would severely crater the area preventing the tanks from moving therefore causing them to become nearly stationary targets for the ground attack aircraft, or disrupting the enemy schedule and allowing own troops more time to prepare their defense.\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-719-0240-26, Pas de Calais, Atlantikwall, Panzersperren.jpg|thumb|left|Examples of [[Czech hedgehog]]s deployed on the [[Atlantic Wall]] in the vicinity of [[Calais]].]]\nAnti-tank defense proper was by 1942 designed in First World War fashion with several prepared trench lines incorporating anti-tank weapons of different capabilities. Depending on terrain and the available line-of-sight, the longer-ranged guns could begin to fire on approaching tanks from as far as 2 kilometers, which was also the range at which German Panther and Tiger tank gunners were trained to fire. Anti-tank guns were usually deployed to cover terrain more suitable for tanks, and were protected by minefields laid at about 500 meters to 1 kilometer from their positions by combat engineers. In the Red Army the anti-tank rifle units would be positioned throughout the forward trench line and would engage the lighter tanks and any other vehicles, such as infantry half-tracks in an attempt to separate them from the tanks. The anti-tank guns deployed further back would often hold their fire until enemy tanks were within the most effective range for their ammunition. Where there were insufficient anti-tank weapons, engineers would construct anti-tank obstacles such as [[Dragon's teeth (fortification)|dragon's teeth]] or [[czech hedgehog]].\n\nTowed anti-tank guns were thought to be the primary means of defeating tanks. At the [[battle of Kursk]] for example, the Red Army deployed more artillery regiments than infantry regiments and towed gun densities reached over 20 guns per kilometer of defended tactical zone. A towed gun was much cheaper than a tank and could be concealed in a shallow position. When time allowed, dugouts with strong overhead cover could be constructed. Guns deployed on reverse slopes and in flanking positions could take a toll of attacking tanks. However, gun crews were vulnerable to artillery, mortar HE fire and enemy infantry. Their positions had to be carefully selected and once engaged, they generally could not redeploy. Experience strongly suggested that towed AT guns were less effective than self-propelled AT weapons and took heavier casualties.\n\nThe tactic of ambushing enemy armor at grazing shot distances was perfected during World War 2. Some combatants, like the Soviet Red Army, doctrinalized it and used it to engage heavy German armor at optimal distances and angles.\n\nSelf-propelled anti-tank guns were rare at the beginning of WW2, although the [[Belgian Army]] deployed a few T.15 tank destroyers and the French army was developing several wheeled and tracked designs. The advantages of mobility and even thin armor protection were so compelling that most armies were using self-propelled AT guns by mid-war. Examples of these weapons included the [[M10 Tank Destroyer|US M10]], German [[Marder II]], and Soviet [[SU-85]].\n\n====Infantry close assault====\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28150, Deutsche Soldaten mit Panzerf\u00e4usten.jpg|thumb|right|Panzerfaust armed German soldiers on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], 1945.]]\nThe tank is still vulnerable to infantry, especially in close country or built-up areas. Rough terrain may expose the floor armor, and high ground such as multi-story buildings may expose the top armor. Their large size and loud noise can allow enemy infantry to spot, track and evade tanks until an opportunity presents itself for counter-attack.\n\nBecause tank crews have limited visibility from inside the tank, infantry can get close to a tank given enough concealment and if the hatches are closed. If tank crewmen unbutton for better visibility they become vulnerable to small arms fire, grenades and molotov cocktails. An infantryman cannot be targeted by a tank's main gun when close, as it cannot depress sufficiently. Close defense weapons such as pistol ports, hull-, coaxial- and pintle-mounted machine guns gave them some protection however.\n\nWhilst many hand-held infantry anti-tank weapons will not penetrate the front armor of a tank, they may penetrate the less heavily armored top, rear, and sides. Anti-tank weapons can damage the tracks or running gear to inflict a [[mobility kill]]. Early WWII tanks had open vision slits that could be fired through to kill the crew. Later tanks' slits had thick glass, as well as sights and periscopes which could still be damaged with powerful small arms such as [[anti-tank rifle]]s and [[heavy machine gun]]s, hampering the crew. If all else fails, the hatch could also be forced open and grenades thrown inside, although later tank designs often have hatches designed to be difficult to open from the outside.\n\nTanks were also vulnerable to hand-placed anti-tank mines. Infantry have even immobilized tanks using a set of plates covered with leaves and dirt as dummy mines \u2013 the ruse being augmented by the crew's obscured vision \u2013 infantry can then attack the stopped tank. This tactic was taught to the [[British Home Guard]] during World War II since they were not often provided with long-range anti-tank weapons.<ref>{{cite web | title=Leonard Thomas Piper | work=WW2 People's War (article a2504530) | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/30/a2504530.shtml | accessdate=20 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn some cases in World War II, a tactic of some infantry was to run directly up to a tank, avoiding its main and machine guns, and pour petrol over and into the tank and light it, sometimes blocking the exit, burning the crew alive.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn the Japanese army, the use of satchel charges and pole charges was widespread. Although the charges could knock out any allied tank, the tactic was extremely close-range and the sappers were vulnerable to allied weapons.\n\n====Suicide bombing====\n\n[[File:Chinese infantry soldier preparing a suicide vest of Model 24 hand grenades at the Battle of Taierzhuang against Japanese Tanks.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese suicide bomber putting on an explosive vest made out of Model 24 hand grenades to use in an attack on Japanese tanks at the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]].]]\n\nChinese troops in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] used [[suicide bombing]] against Japanese tanks.

The tide turned in favour of the United Nations forces in August 1950 when the North Koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to develop an anti-tank role, including U.S. [[M4 Sherman|M4A3 Sherman]] medium tanks backed by [[M26 Pershing]] heavy tanks, along with British [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], [[Churchill tank|Churchill]], and [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell]] tanks.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=182\u2013184}}\n\nIn the U.S., the {{convert|2.36|in|mm|abbr=on}} M9A1 [[bazooka]] rocket launcher evolved into the more powerful {{convert|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} M20 \"Super Bazooka\", which was used to good effect against North Korean armored spearheads during the [[Korean War]]. However, the M20 proved difficult and cumbersome to portage on foot over long distances. The [[Anti-Tank Aircraft Rocket]], developed by the navy, also proved effective against North Korean tanks.\n\n==Cold War==\nIn the Cold War era, HEAT became an almost universal choice outside of artillery and tank units. The British had developed the [[High-explosive squash head]] (HESH) warhead as a weapon for attacking fortifications during the war, and found it surprisingly effective against tanks. Although these systems allowed infantry to take on even the largest tanks, and, like HEAT, its effectiveness was independent of range, infantry typically operated at short range. A major influence in anti-tank warfare came with the development and evolution of [[anti-tank guided missile]]s (ATGM) that could be fired by infantry operators, from ground vehicles and by aircraft. Increasing use of [[combined arms]] tactics allowed the attacking infantry to suppress the anti-tank crews effectively, meaning that they could typically get off only one or two shots before being countered or forced to move.\n\n===Aircraft===\n{{main|Attack aircraft}}\nCold War aircraft, such as the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] and [[Sukhoi Su-25|SU-25 Frogfoot]], have been specifically built for [[close air support]], including tank destruction. They can use a variety of weaponry, including large-caliber anti-tank [[autocannon]]s or [[rotary cannon|rotary autocannons]], air-to-surface missiles (e.g. [[AGM-65 Maverick]]), volleys of unguided rockets, and various [[bomb]]s (unguided or [[laser-guided]] and with or without submunitions such as HEAT bomblets, an example of which would be the [[CBU-100 Cluster Bomb]]).\n\n===Helicopters===\n{{further|Attack helicopter}}\n[[File:ApacheWAH64.jpg|thumb|right|[[British Army]] [[Westland WAH-64 Apache]], an anti-tank helicopter]]\nGuided anti-tank missiles were first used in a helicopter-borne role by the French in the late 1950s, when they mounted [[Nord SS.11|SS.11]] wire-guided missiles on [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II]] helicopters.<ref name=\"HELOSATWAR\">''Helicopters at War'', Blitz Editions, p. 63, {{ISBN|1-85605-345-8}}.</ref> Initially there were many teething problems; However, the possibilities, such as providing the ability to attack the more lightly armored top of the tank, were clear.\n\nAlthough putting weapons on helicopters (probably) dates back to 1955 with the [[Bell 47]], the first specific [[attack helicopter]] that went into mass production was the Bell [[AH-1 Cobra]] in 1966. The AH-1 was equipped with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]] missiles in 1973 for anti-tank capability.<ref>Verier, Mike. ''Bell AH-1 Cobra''. Osprey Publishing, 1990. {{ISBN|0-85045-934-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe anti-tank helicopter armed with [[Anti-tank guided missile|ATGW]]s (Anti-Tank Guided Weapons) or anti-tank cannons is one of the biggest threats to a modern tank. The helicopter can position itself where it is not easily seen from a tank and then attack from any quarter, exposing the weaker parts of the tank's armor. The limited visibility from a closed-down tank also makes sighting a helicopter harder.\n\nMost helicopter-launched ATGWs have sufficient range that they can under the right conditions be fired at a range too long for the tank to retaliate with its own weapons. This may change with the Israelis fielding the [[LAHAT]] missile that can be fired from the main gun of the Merkava MBT. With both anti-tank and anti-helicopter role, it does level the playing field somewhat. The Indian [[Arjun (tank)|Arjun tank]] has also been modified to fire this missile. The People's Republic of China has developed 100&nbsp;mm gun-launched missiles based on Russian designs such as the GP2 (based on the Russian [[9M117 Bastion|Bastion]]). It has been reported to have successfully engaged aerial targets, as well as being an anti-tank missile. Similar missiles are available for Chinese tanks equipped with the 105&nbsp;mm gun. The Russians have also displayed a similar if more advanced system in the [[9M119 Svir|Reflex]]. The system involves an automatic targeting of an aerial/land target instigated by a laser warning system.\n\n===Artillery===\nIn the last thirty years, however, a variety of artillery projectiles have been developed specifically to attack tanks. These include laser-guided projectiles, such as the US's Copperhead [[CLGP|Cannon Launched Guided Projectile]] (CLGP), which increases the chances of a direct hit. Some of these CLGPs (including the Copperhead) have HEAT warheads instead of common HE.\n\nGuided and unguided scatter munitions and [[submunition]]s have also been developed: a single artillery shell containing a number of smaller munitions designed to attack a tank. A six-gun battery might be able to fire several hundred submunitions in a minute or two.\n\nIn one form, the shell bursts in the air above the tank and a number of [[shaped charge]] (HEAT) or HEDP (High Explosive Dual Purpose) bomblets or grenades rain down. Any that hit the tank have a good chance of causing damage, since they are attacking the thin top armor.\n\nAnother form scatters a number of small anti-tank mines in the tank's path, which probably will not penetrate the armor but can damage a track, leaving the tank [[mobility kill|immobile]] and vulnerable.\n\nMore sophisticated are submunitions with a homing capability. Once again the shell explodes above the tank position and dispenses a number of submunitions. The munitions contain some circuitry to identify tanks, such as IR or millimeter radar; when a tank is identified, a rocket propellant is fired to shoot the projectile at the tank. These munitions will often descend by parachute, to allow time for target acquisition and attack.\n\nAll of the above, but the CLGP can be fired from medium (122mm/130mm/152mm/155mm) tube artillery and rocket artillery. There has also been development of medium and large (81mm/82mm/120mm) guided mortar munitions with both internal (e.g., IR or radar) or external (i.e., laser designator) guidance.\n\n===Missiles===\n{{main|Anti-tank missile}}\nThe development of the [[wire-guided missile]], or Anti-Tank Guided Weapon (ATGW) systems came into use in the late 1950s and 1960s that could defeat any known tank at ranges beyond that of the guns of the accompanying infantry. The United Kingdom, France, and other [[NATO]] countries were among the first to develop such weapons (e.g., the [[Malkara missile]] by the UK and Australia in 1958). The Soviet Union, and now Russia, put extensive development into these weapons; the first man-portable model to enter service was the [[AT-3 Sagger|AT-3]] in 1961. The United States was one of the last, coming up with the [[BGM-71 TOW]] in 1970.\n\nFor a time, it appeared that the tank was a dead end. A small team of infantry with a few missiles in a well-concealed position could take on a number of the largest and most expensive tanks. In the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], Soviet first-generation wire-guided missiles employed by the Egyptian forces inflicted heavy casualties on [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli]] tank units, causing a major crisis of confidence for tank designers.\n\n[[Active protection system]]s, such as the Russian [[Arena active protection system]], are starting to be more common, with similar systems such as the Israeli [[Iron Fist active protection system]]. The tank may be on a comeback because of active defense systems, which attack missiles in mid-air. This may allow the tank to be competitive on the battlefield once again.\n\n===Guns===\n{{main|Anti-tank gun}}\n[[File:Baasjan1.JPG|thumb|South African tank gun retrofitted to a [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|OQF 17 pdr]] carriage.]]\nAnti-tank guns continued to be used in a number of conflicts past World War 2 around the world, such as the [[Six-Day War]]<ref name=\"Oren\">{{cite book|last=Oren|first=Michael|title=Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East|year=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sixdaysofwarjune0000oren_u3x7/page/192 192\u2013194]|publisher=Presidio Press|isbn=978-0345461926|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sixdaysofwarjune0000oren_u3x7/page/192}}</ref> and the [[South African Border War]].<ref name=\"Grove\">{{cite web|title=Ratel teen tenk en|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|url=http://www.samagte.co.za/weermag/hc/grove.html|url-status=dead|location=Port Elizabeth|publisher=International Veterans' Association/South African Forces Club|year=2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728040847/http://www.samagte.co.za/weermag/hc/grove.html|archivedate=28 July 2012}}</ref> Soviet anti-tank guns in particular were exported to at least eighteen other countries after being retired from service and have continued to see action.<ref name=\"trade\">{{cite web|url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php |title=Trade Registers |publisher=Armstrade.sipri.org |accessdate=2013-06-20}}</ref>\n\nRather than developing specialized anti-tank artillery, some nations, including South Africa and Israel, grafted obsolete tank guns onto towed carriages for use in that role.<ref name=\"Gate\">{{Citation |title=Baasjan howitzer (RSA) |year=2014 |type=Exhibit |publisher=[[South African National Defence Force]] |location=South African Armour Museum, [[Bloemfontein]]}}</ref>\n\n===Mines===\nOwing to greater sophistication of the tank, and engineering support available to tank units to detect and negate minefields, a considerable effort was made to develop more effective anti-tank mine technology in the effort to deny tank-led formations maneuver space, or channel their movement into unsuitable avenues of approach.\n\n===Infantry===\n[[File:106mm land rover.JPG|thumb|[[Australian Army]] [[Land Rover Series|Land Rover Series 2]] \"gunbuggy\" with a [[M40 recoilless rifle]] used in the anti-tank role.]]\n\nThe search for a more suitable, longer-range delivery system took up much of the immediate post-war era. The US invested in the [[recoilless rifle]], delivering a widely used 75&nbsp;mm design, and less common 90&nbsp;mm and 106&nbsp;mm designs (the latter was usually mounted rather than infantry-handled). The 106&nbsp;mm formed the basis of a dedicated anti-tank vehicle, the [[Ontos tank]], which mounted six 106&nbsp;mm rifles. The [[Australian Army]] also fitted [[M40 recoilless rifle]]s to [[Land Rover Series|Land Rover Series 2]] vehicles for use in an anti-tank role. The Soviet Union also built recoilless rifles in various calibers intended to be used as anti-tank weapons, most commonly 73&nbsp;mm, 82&nbsp;mm, and 110&nbsp;mm (only the 73&nbsp;mm remains in service with the Russian military today, though the other two can be found all over the world due to Soviet military aid during the Cold War). The British used a 120&nbsp;mm (4.7 inch) design to equip infantry units, the [[L6 Wombat|BAT series]], which served from the 1950s until replaced by [[MILAN]], but it was generally too heavy for infantry use and had to be towed by, or mounted on, a vehicle for maneuverability.\n\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s developed the [[RPG-2]] from the German ''Panzerfaust 150''. Further development led to the ubiquitous [[RPG-7]]. The RPG-7 is one of the most widely used anti-tank weapons, favored most by soldiers of [[Irregular military|irregular militaries]]. The RPG-7 could fire a range of different warheads, from [[thermobaric]] warheads to a single HEAT or [[tandem-charge]] HEAT warheads against [[explosive reactive armor]] equipped tanks. The RPG-7 has a long combat history, and has been used in most wars from the [[Vietnam war]] all the way to present day wars. In modern times, the RPG-7 is generally used in an [[urban area|urban]] environment, which would enhance their effectiveness due to the close ranges involved. However, the aging RPG-7 has evolved to the even more potent [[RPG-29]] which has proven its worth in conflicts in the [[Middle East]], damaging the [[Merkava IV]],<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/746929.html Hezbollah anti-tank fire causing most IDF casualties in Lebanon \u2013 Haaretz Daily Newspaper | Israel News]</ref> [[Challenger 2]]<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/13/nmod13.xml|title=Telegraph article|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> and [[M1 Abrams]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/world/middleeast/21sadr.html?_r=2&hp&oref=slogin&oref=slogin NYtimes.com]</ref> [[main battle tank]]s.\n\n[[File:ISF member armed with RPG-7.jpg|thumb|Soviet RPG-7]]\n\nIn the 1960s, the U.S. Army adopted the [[M72 LAW]] rocket, a lightweight, collapsible rocket launcher with the ability to penetrate moderate thicknesses of enemy armor. During the [[Vietnam War]], the weapon was used primarily against NVA and Viet Cong defensive works and emplacements, as there were few encounters against enemy armor. Overall, the LAW was regarded as a success, though its ignition system frequently suffered from misfires in the heat and humidity of Vietnamese jungles. The LAW has since been replaced by the [[AT4]] (M136).\n\n===Tactics===\nChanges in the anti-tank tactics since the Second World War mostly came from the appearance of new technologies, and increased firepower of the infantry mounted on fully armored vehicles. The most profound anti-tank technology has been the guided missile, which when coupled with a helicopter can mean that tanks can be engaged beyond ground line of sight (LOS), and at one of their most vulnerable aspect, the top armor.\n\n==Effectiveness==\nThe effect of anti-tank warfare is to destroy or damage enemy tanks, or to prevent enemy tanks, and their supporting troops from maneuvering, which is the primary capability of the tanks. In the US Army the degree of effect by an anti-tank weapon on a vehicle is referred to as either \"[[mobility kill]]\", \"[[wiktionary:firepower kill|firepower kill]]\", and \"[[catastrophic kill]]\". In a mobility kill (M-kill), the vehicle loses its ability to move, for example, by breaking a [[caterpillar track|tank track]] or bogey or damaging the engine; the targeted tank is then immobile, but may retain full use of its weapons (large cannon, heavy machine gun and smaller machine guns) and still be able to fight to some extent. On the other hand, a mobility-killed tank is a relatively vulnerable target to RPG or [[Molotov cocktail]] attacks, and it cannot maneuver to better firing positions.\n\nA firepower kill (F-kill) is some loss of the vehicle's ability to fire its weapons. For example, a tank may be hit on its main cannon, making the main gun inoperable. M-kills and F-kills may be complete or partial, the latter corresponding to reductions in a target's ability to move or fire. A catastrophic kill (K-kill) removes the tank's ability to fight completely; this may entail complete destruction of the tank or disabling or killing the crew.\n\n[[File:6SADiv Tanks disabled Perugia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|South African Sherman tanks disabled in the fight to take the Perugia Highlands in Italy 1944 \u2013 World War 2. |alt=Two damaged tanks with their tracks visibly destroyed and a damaged Willy's Jeep displaying the 6th Armoured triangular flash]]\n\n===Current trends===\nAlthough the future of the tank was questioned in the 1960s due to the development of the anti-tank missiles, increases in thickness and composition of armor, and other improvements in tank design meant that infantry operated systems were no longer sufficiently effective by the 1970s, and the introduction of [[Chobham armor]] by the British Army and [[reactive armor]] by the Soviet Army forced the HEAT rounds to be increased in size, rendering them less portable.\n\nWeapon systems like the [[RPG-29]] and [[FGM-148 Javelin]] use a [[Tandem warhead]] where the first warhead disables reactive armor, while the second warhead defeats the shell armor by means of a HEAT or a [[shaped charge]]. Today the anti-tank role is filled with a variety of weapons, such as portable \"top attack\" artillery ammunition and missiles, larger [[HEAT]] missiles fired from ground vehicles and [[helicopter]]s, a variety of high velocity [[autocannon]], and ever-larger and heavier tank guns. One of the first lessons of the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]] is the effectiveness of portable rocket propelled grenades, in particular, Russian-made [[RPG-29]], and [[AT-13 Metis-M|Metis-M]], [[9M133 Kornet|Kornet]] and European [[MILAN]] anti-tank missiles.\n\n{{Commons category|Anti-tank weapons}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anti-tank grenade]]\n* [[Bumbar]]\n* [[Czech hedgehog]]\n* [[List of anti-tank guns]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708122806/http://caseyfuller.com/law.htm A 1987 U.S. Army news archive about light anti-tank weapon training by the 7th Infantry Division (Light), Fort Ord, Calif.]\n\n{{Weapons}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anti-Tank Warfare}}\n[[Category:Anti-tank guns]]\n[[Category:Anti-tank weapons|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More footnotes|date= December 2010}}\n{{lead too long|date= December 2016}}\n}}\n\n[[File:FGR-17 VIPER.jpg|thumb|right|200px| A soldier preparing to fire the [[FGR-17 Viper]], an American one-man disposable antitank rocket]]\n\n'''Anti-tank warfare''' originated from the need to develop technology and [[Military tactics| tactics]] to destroy [[tank]]s during [[World War I]] (1914-1918). Since the [[Triple Entente]] developed the first tanks in 1916 but did not deploy them in battle until 1917, the [[German Empire]] developed the first anti-tank weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.antitank.co.uk/ww1_anti-tank_rifles1.htm|title= WW1 Anti-Tank rifles|publisher= |accessdate= 10 October 2014}}</ref> The first developed anti-tank weapon was a scaled-up bolt-action rifle, the [[Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr]], that fired a 13mm cartridge with a solid bullet that could penetrate the thin armor of tanks of the time and destroy the engine or ricochet inside, killing occupants.<ref>Maj. Frederck Myatt M.C., ''Modern Small Arms'', Crescent Books, New York, NY, 1978, pp,228-29</ref> Because tanks represent an enemy's greatest [[force projection]] on land, military strategists have incorporated anti-tank warfare into the doctrine of nearly every combat service since. The most predominant anti-tank weapons at the start of [[World War II]] in 1939  included the [[Tank gun| tank-mounted gun]], [[#Anti-tank guns| anti-tank guns]] and [[anti-tank grenade]]s used by the [[Infantry#Equipment|infantry]], as well as [[ground-attack aircraft]].\n\nAnti-tank warfare evolved rapidly during World War II (1939-1945), leading to the inclusion of infantry-portable weapons such as the [[Bazooka]], anti-tank [[Combat engineering#Role, practices and techniques |combat engineering]], specialized anti-tank aircraft and self-propelled anti-tank guns ([[tank destroyer]]s). Both the Soviet [[Red Army]] and the [[German Army (Wehrmacht) |German Army]] developed methods of combating tank-led offensives, including deployment of static anti-tank weapons embedded in in-depth defensive positions, protected by anti-tank obstacles and [[Anti-tank mine| minefields]], and supported by mobile anti-tank [[Military reserve| reserves]] and by ground-attack aircraft.\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA18188.jpg|thumb|right| A British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|17-pounder anti-tank gun]] and [[half-track]] of the 87th ([[Devonshire Regiment]]) Anti-Tank Regiment approaches the River Foglia, Italy, 1 September 1944]]\n\nThrough the [[Cold War]], the United States, [[Soviet Union]] and other countries contemplated the possibility of nuclear warfare. While previous technology had developed to protect the crews of armored vehicles from projectiles and from explosive damage; the possibility of [[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear| radiation]] arose. In the [[NATO]] countries little if any development took place on defining a [[Military doctrine| doctrine]] of how to use armed forces without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s. In the Soviet sphere of influence the legacy doctrine of [[Soviet deep battle| operational maneuver]] was being [[Military doctrine#Military doctrine in the former Soviet Union and Russia| theoretically examined]] to understand how a tank-led force could be used even with the threat of limited use of nuclear weapons on prospective European battlefields. The [[Warsaw Pact]] arrived at the solution of [[maneuver warfare]] while massively increasing the number of anti-tank weapons. To achieve this, Soviet military theorists such as [[Vasily Sokolovsky]] (1897-1968) realized that anti-tank weapons had to assume an offensive role rather than the traditionally defensive role of the [[Great Patriotic War]] (1941-1945) by becoming more mobile. This led to the development of improved [[Anti-tank guided missile| guided anti-tank missiles]], though similar design work was being performed in Western Europe and the United States.\n\nBoth sides in the [[Cold War]] also recognized the utility of the light anti-tank weapon, and this led to further development of man-portable weapons used by the infantry squad, while heavier missiles were mounted on dedicated [[Tank destroyer#Post-World War II development |missile tank-destroyers]], including dedicated [[Attack helicopter |anti-tank helicopters]], and even heavier guided anti-tank [[Air-to-surface missile| missiles launched from aircraft]]. Designers also developed new varieties of artillery munitions in the form of [[Artillery shell#Guided shells| top-attack shells]], and shells that were used to saturate areas with [[Cluster munition#Anti-tank| anti-armor bomblets]]. Helicopters could be used as well to rapidly deliver scattered anti-tank mines.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War in 1992, the only major new threats to tanks and other armored vehicles have been remotely detonated [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs) used in [[asymmetric warfare]] and weapon systems like the [[RPG-29]] and [[FGM-148 Javelin]], which can defeat [[reactive armor]] or shell armor. Both those weapon systems use a [[tandem warhead]] where the first stage of the tandem warhead activates the reactive armor, and the second stage of the tandem warhead defeats the shell armor by means of a [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead |High Explosive Anti Tank]] (HEAT) [[shaped charge]].\n\n==Tank threat==\nAnti-tank warfare evolved as a countermeasure to the threat of the tank's appearance on the battlefields of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of the First World War. The tank had been developed to negate the German [[trench warfare|system of trenches]], and allow a return to [[Flanking maneuver|maneuver against enemy's flanks]] and to [[Encirclement|attack the rear]] with [[cavalry]].\n \nThe use of the tank was primarily based on the assumption that, once they were able to eliminate the German trench lines with their machine gun and [[Infantry support gun]] positions, the Allied infantry would follow and secure the breach, and the cavalry would exploit the breach in the trench lines by attacking into the depth of German-held territory, eventually capturing the [[field artillery]] positions and interdicting logistics and reserves being brought up from the rear areas. Naval crews{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} initially used to operate the installed naval guns and machine guns were replaced with Army personnel who were more aware of the [[Infantry tactics#Trench warfare tactics|infantry tactics]] with which the tanks were intended to cooperate. However, there was no means of communication between the tank's crew and the accompanying infantry, or between the tanks participating in combat. Radios were not yet portable or robust enough to be mounted in a tank, although Morse Code transmitters were installed in some Mark IVs at Cambrai as messaging vehicles.<ref>Macksey, K., Tank vs Tank, Grub Street, London, 1999, p.32</ref> Attaching a field telephone to the rear would become a practice only during the next war. With greater use of tanks by both sides it was realized that the accompanying infantry could be forced to ground by [[ambush]] fire, thus separating them from the tanks, which would continue to advance, eventually finding themselves exposed to [[Small unit tactics|close-assaults]] by German infantry and sappers.\n\nThe early tanks were mechanically rudimentary. The {{convert|0.23|to|0.47|in|mm|adj=on}} thick armor generally prevented penetration by [[small arms]] fire and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shell fragments]]. However, even a near miss from field artillery or an impact from a mortar [[Shell (projectile)#High-explosive|HE round]] easily disabled or destroyed the tank: if the [[fuel tank]] was ruptured, it could incinerate the tank's crew. A large caliber gun was recognized as a tactical necessity to attack machine gun positions and defeat any infantry field pieces found in the trench lines which could easily disable [[Continuous track|tank track]] with the HE ammunition. This was achieved by mounting a [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss]] light 57&nbsp;mm naval gun mounted in the hull [[barbette]]s. Hull and track engineering was largely dictated by the [[terrain]]\u2014the need to cross wide trenches\u2014although the relationship between [[ground pressure]] and [[Soil mechanics|soil-vehicle mechanics]] was not resolved until the Second World War. [[Gun turret|Turrets]] were later introduced on medium and light tanks to react to ambushes during the advance.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n==First World War==\nThe tank, when it appeared on the Western Front in September 1916, was a surprise to German troops, but not the [[German General Staff]]. The French Army Staff was highly critical of the British Army's [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette#The debut of the tank|early fielding]] of the Mark I vehicles in small numbers because the French trials showed the armored vehicles to be highly unreliable. They judged that large numbers had to be employed to sustain an offensive despite losses to mechanical failure or vehicles being foundered in intractable [[no man's land]] terrain. These losses, coupled with those from enemy artillery fire, later amounted to as high as 70% of the starters during some operations. Deploying small numbers of tanks would therefore cause the Allies to lose the [[Indirect approach|element of surprise]], allowing Germans to develop countermeasures.\n\n[[File:The Battle of Arras, April-May 1917 Q6286.jpg|left|thumb|A British heavy tank of World War One]]\n\n===Anti-tank weapons===\nBecause the German Army was the only force in need of anti-tank weapons, they were first to develop a viable technology to combat the armored vehicle. These technologies took three [[ammunition]] approaches: use of grenades by infantrymen, including the ''Geballte Ladung'' (\"Bundled Charge\") of several stick grenades bound together by pioneers; early attempts at the small-caliber [[anti-tank rifles]] like the [[Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr|13&nbsp;mm Mauser bolt-action]]; and 3.7&nbsp;cm TaK Rheinmetall in starrer R\u00e4der-lafette 1916 [[anti-tank gun]] on a light carriage which could destroy a tank<ref>John Norris, Anti-tank weapons, p.7</ref> using large-caliber [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] ammunition issued in 1917 to special commands; and the existing 77&nbsp;mm field guns (such as the [[7.7 cm FK 16]]) of the infantry division's artillery regiment were also eventually issued with special armor-piercing (AP) ammunition.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R27012, Bei Cambrai erbeuteter englischer Panzer.jpg|thumb|right|A disabled Mark IV tank near [[Cambrai]], 1917 - World War I]]\n\n===Anti-tank tactics===\nWith the appearance of Allied tanks, the German Army were quick to introduce new anti-tank defense detachments within the pioneer battalions of the infantry divisions. These were initially issued 1.3&nbsp;cm caliber long barrel rifles firing solid shot. However, these suffered from fouling after 2\u20133 rounds and had a recoil that was unsustainable by the mechanism or the rifleman. Stick grenades were used to destroy the tracks by individual pioneers, however this required accompanying machine-gunners to first separate the supporting Allied infantry line from the tanks, which proved difficult. Another tactic was to lure the tank beyond the German trench-line, re-establishing it just as the Allied infantry approached. The tank would then be engaged by the divisional ''7.7&nbsp;cm'' guns brought forward, that would try to disable the tracks with ordinary HE shells (and later AP ammunition). If the crews of the disabled tanks refused to surrender, they were engaged with flamethrowers, or a mortar would be fired on the stricken vehicle until a direct hit was achieved on the top surface, usually resulting in an internal fire. Finally, anti-tank obstacles were prepared on the likely approaches by deepening and widening existing ground cratering, the precursors of the [[anti-tank trench]]. Finally in early 1917 the ''3.7&nbsp;cm TaK'' from [[Rheinmetall]] was rushed to the frontline, and proved effective in destroying the tanks despite limited elevation and traverse.\n\n==Development between the world wars==\n\nLack of consensus on the design and use of the tank after the First World War also influenced the development of its anti-tank countermeasures. However, because Germany was restricted by the [[Treaty of Versailles#Military restrictions|Treaty of Versailles]] in its military capability, and there were no other challenges to France and Britain, very little development took place in anti-tank warfare until the 1930s.\n\n[[File:Protitankov\u00fd kan\u00f3n 3,7 cm vz.gif|thumb|left|Czechoslovak anti-tank gun [[3,7cm KP\u00daV vz. 37]] .]]\nThe [[Interwar period]] was dominated by the strategic thinking with [[Fortification#20th and 21st centuries|fortified]] borders at its core. These included obstacles consisting of natural features such as [[ditch (fortification)|ditches]], [[stream]]s and [[urban area]]s, or constructed obstacles such as anti-tank ditches, [[land mine|minefields]], [[Dragon's teeth (fortification)|dragon's teeth]], or log barriers. The pinnacle of this strategic thinking was considered to be the [[Maginot Line]] which replaced infantry-filled trenches with artillery-filled [[bunker]]s, including [[casemate]]s housing 37 or 47&nbsp;mm anti-tank guns, and steel turrets armed with a pair of machine guns and a 25&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun, although Germany was forbidden to produce tanks. The construction was partially based on the Allied experience with the [[Hindenburg Line]] which was breached with tank support during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|battles of Cambrai]] and [[Battle of St. Quentin Canal|St. Quentin Canal]], although German Command was more impressed by the surprise achieved by the Canadian troops at the [[Battle of the Canal du Nord]]. This came to influence their planning in 1940.\n\nThe Maginot line defenses - up to {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} deep from the forward positions to the rear line - were intended to prevent a surprise attack and delay any attack while the French Army was mobilized. With the relative numerical inferiority between the France and Germany, it was a more effective use of manpower. Within the line, passive anti-tank obstacles were supported by anti-infantry and anti-tank bunkers. After Belgium declared neutrality in 1936, France began work on extending the line along the Belgian border.\n\nImproved artillery was seen as the quickest solution to anti-tank defense, and one of the earliest post-war anti-tank gun designs was the [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun|25&nbsp;mm Hotchkiss]] model from France. It was intended to replace an [[Canon d'Infanterie de 37 mod\u00e8le 1916 TRP|Atelier de Puteaux 37&nbsp;mm]] weapon designed in 1916 to destroy machine gun positions. [[Rheinmetall]] commenced design of a 37&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun in 1924 and the first guns were produced in 1928 as 3.7&nbsp;cm Pak L/45,<ref>Terry Gander and Peter Chamberlain, ''Small Arms, Artillery and Special Weapons of the Third Reich'', MacDonald and Janes, London, 1978, p.107</ref> later adopted in Wehrmacht service as [[3.7 cm Pak 36]]. It made an appearance during the [[Spanish Civil War]], as did the [[Bofors 37 mm]] developed in Sweden, and used by many early Second World War combatants. The British Army accepted for service the (40&nbsp;mm) [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder]], which was developed as a [[tank gun]]. The Soviet [[Red Army]] after the [[Russian Civil War#Northwest Russia : Yudenich's campaign|Russian Civil War]] also begun a search for an anti-tank gun with a French Hotchkiss 37&nbsp;mm L.33 tank gun, but soon upgraded this to a higher velocity L.45 Model 1935 while also making a licensed copy of the German [[3.7 cm Pak 36|3.7&nbsp;cm PaK 36]]. However, the Red Army was almost immediately taught a lesson about anti-tank warfare when a tank [[battalion]] sent to aid the Spanish Republicans in the [[Spanish Civil War]] was almost entirely destroyed in an [[Engagement (military)|engagement]].\n\nAt this time, the predominant ammunition used against tanks was the [[armor-piercing]] [[kinetic energy]] shell that defeated armor by direct [[pressure]], spiking or punching through it. During the late 1930s [[shaped charge]] ammunition was experimented with that used [[chemical energy]] for armor penetration. The shaped charge concept is officially known as the \"Munroe Effect\" and was discovered by accident decades earlier by Professor Charles E. Munroe at the U.S. Torpedo Station, Providence, RI. Professor Munroe was detonating different manufactured blocks of explosives on a sheet of armor plating and observed the blocks having the manufacturing letters recessed (vs. raised) cut an imprint of the manufacturing letters into the armor plate\u2014the birth of the shaped-charged explosive which focuses the blast energy caused by an indentation on the surface area of an explosive.<ref>Dr. J.R. Crittenden, \"RPG-The Devil's Finger\", ''Shotgun News'', Nov. 20, 2003, P.30.</ref> Although shaped charges are somewhat more difficult to manufacture, the advantage is that the projectile does not require as high velocity as typical kinetic energy shells, yet on impact it creates a high-[[velocity]] jet of metal flowing like a liquid due to the immense pressure (though x-ray diffraction has shown the metal stays solid<ref>JOURNAL OF BATTLEFIELD TECHNOLOGY,\n VOL 1, NO 1, MARCH 1998, SOME METALLURGICAL ASPECTS OF SHAPED CHARGE LINERS, Alistair Doig, p.1.</ref>) which [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamically]] penetrates the armor and kills occupants inside.<ref>Chant, Christoper, ''How Weapons Work'', Marshal Cavendish, Ltd,, Hong Kong, 1980, p.50.</ref> The depth of the penetration, though proportional to the length of the jet and the [[square root]] of its [[Density#Densities of various materials|density]], is also dependent on the strength of the armor. With the development of this new ammunition begun more advanced research into [[Steelmaking|steel manufacturing]], and development of [[spaced armor]] that caused \"jet waver\" by detonating prematurely or at the wrong angle to the surface of the main armor.\n\nThe only significant attempt to experiment in the use of tanks in the late 1920s was that of the British Army's [[Experimental Mechanized Force]] that influenced future development of tanks, armored troops and entire armies of both its future enemies and allies in the next war.\n\nIn Spain, the anti-tank defense of the Nationalists was organized by the [[Wehrmacht#History|Wehrmacht]] officers, and the anti-tank guns were incorporated into a system of obstacles that were constructed with the intent to stop an attack by tanks by slowing it down, separating them from supporting infantry (advancing on foot) with machine-gun and mortar fire, and forcing tanks to conduct deliberate head-on assaults with engineer support, or seek a less-defended area to attack. [[Minefield]]s laid with purpose-designed [[Anti-tank mine#Inter-War|mines]] were used for the first time, destroying tank tracks, and forcing [[combat engineer]]s to [[Mine clearance#Removal methods in demining|clear]] them on foot. Delay meant that Nationalist field artillery could engage the [[BT-5|lightly armored Soviet tanks]]. This meant a change in Republican operational and eventually strategic planning, and a more protracted combat operations, with more casualties at a greater cost.\n\nThe only change to the German anti-tank tactics of the First World War was that now an effective anti-tank weapon was available to support the defending infantry. However, the Soviet tanks armed with 45&nbsp;mm guns easily destroyed the German light tanks.\n\nIronically, in the early 1930s until the Spanish War, German officers were conducting secret testing of a new way of employing tanks, infantry and artillery [[Offensive (military)|offensively]] in the Soviet Union with the cooperation of the Red Army. In Germany, these developments eventually culminated in tactics that later came to be known as [[Blitzkrieg]], while in the Soviet Union they formed the core of the [[deep battle]] operational doctrine. The successful test of the latter was during the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol]] although the Red Army foundered on the [[Winter War#Defence of the Mannerheim Line|Mannerheim Line]] in 1940, largely due to the [[Great Purge#Purge of the army|purge in the Officer Corps]], claiming many of the [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky#The theory of deep operations|senior proponents]] of the new doctrine. Anti-tank artillery would be included in mobile tank-led Wehrmacht and Red Army units due to the possibility of encountering enemy tanks in a [[meeting engagement]].\n\nThe new doctrines of using the tank, were divided into infantry and cavalry [[School of thought|schools of thought]]. The former regarded the tank as a mobile artillery system to be used for infantry support. This suggested that the infantry needed to be armed with integral anti-tank weapons. The latter advocated use of tanks in the traditional cavalry way of high-tempo attacks intended to outflank the enemy infantry and sever its communication lines. This approach suggested that the tank was the best anti-tank system, and only limited anti-tank troops were required to accompany them. For this reason the late 30s [[Tank classification|tank configurations]] came in a great diversity, ranging from light [[tankettes]] and [[cavalry tank]]s to multi-turreted [[heavy tank]]s resembling bunkers, all of which had to be considered in training by the anti-tank artillery troops. The development of these doctrines was the most significant influence on the rapid development in anti-tank technology and tactics in the Second World War.\n\n==Second World War==\nTwo aspects of how the Second World War commenced helped to delay development of anti-tank warfare: resignation and surprise. After Poland was attacked, its allies in the West were resigned to its defeat by a numerically superior Wehrmacht. The little information that was brought out about the conduct of combat during that campaign did nothing to convince either France, Britain or the USSR of the need for improved anti-tank technology and tactics. The reliance on the Maginot Line, and the subsequent surprise of the German offensive left no time to develop existing capabilities and tactics in the West. The British were preparing the stop lines and the [[British anti-invasion preparations of World War II#Lines and islands|anti-tank islands]] to slow enemy progress and restrict the route of an attack. The Red Army however was fortunate in having several excellent designs for anti-tank warfare that were either in final stages of development for production, or had been rejected earlier as unnecessary and could now be rushed into production. The relative ease with which the older models of Red Army's tank fleet were destroyed by German anti-tank weapons, using tactics already seen in Spain, once and for all focused Stavka attention on anti-tank warfare as Soviet armies were repeatedly encircled by panzer-led strategic pincer maneuvers. Of the major iconic Soviet weapons of the Second World War, two were made exclusively for anti-tank warfare, the [[T-34]] and the [[Ilyushin Il-2]] ''Shturmovik''. The former was one of the most manufactured tanks in history, and the latter, itself dubbed the 'flying tank', was one of the most manufactured aircraft. The war also saw the creation and almost immediate abandonment of the self-propelled tank destroyer which would be replaced post war by the anti tank guided missile.\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[File:RIAN archive 225 IL-2 attacking.jpg|thumb|Soviet [[Ilyushin Il-2]] planes with 23 mm cannons attacking a German tank column during the [[Battle of Kursk]]]]\nAs tanks were rarely used in conflicts between the two World Wars, no specific aircraft or tactics were developed to combat them from the air. One solution adopted by almost all European air forces was to use bomb loads for conventional bombers that were composed from small bombs allowing a higher density during bombing. This created a greater chance of causing a direct impact on the thinner top armor of the tank while also having the ability to damage track and wheels through proximity detonation.\n\nThe first aircraft capable of engaging tanks was the [[Junkers Ju 87]] \"Stuka\" using [[dive bombing]] to place the bomb close to the target. Some French and German fighters fitted with 20&nbsp;mm cannon were also able to engage thinner top armor surfaces of the tanks early in the war. The Stuka was also given cannons for anti-armor role though it was obsolete by 1942, and was joined by the [[Henschel Hs 129]] that mounted a podded {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[MK 101 cannon]] beneath its fuselage, while the Red Army Air Force fielded the Soviet [[Ilyushin Il-2]] armed with a pair of 23&nbsp;mm cannons and unguided rockets, but armored to enable the pilots to approach German tanks at very low altitude, ignoring small arms, machine-gun and even small anti-aircraft cannon fire that usually provided tanks with protection against the bombers. Il-2s could also carry large numbers of 2.5&nbsp;kg shaped-charge anti-tank [[PTAB (bomb)|PTAB]] bombs.\n\nTo give it more firepower against tanks, the RAF mounted two underwing pod-mounted 40&nbsp;mm [[Vickers S]] cannon on the [[Hawker Hurricane]] (as the [[Hawker Hurricane variants#Hurricane Mk II|Mk. IID]]), which saw service in North Africa in 1942 and the [[Hawker Typhoon]] was given HE rockets though these were more effective against other ground vehicles. From March 1943 the Red Army Air Force produced the more agile [[Yakovlev Yak-9]]T (37&nbsp;mm cannon) and K (45&nbsp;mm cannon) bomber interceptor also used for ground attack, with a single example of either gun in ''motornaya pushka'' mounts attached to the engine's gear reduction unit, that had either one of them firing through a hollow-center propeller shaft.\n\nFollowing [[Operation Overlord]] in 1944, the military version of the slow-flying [[Piper J-3 Cub]] high-wing light civilian monoplane, the L-4 Grasshopper, usually used for liaison and artillery-spotting, began to be used in a light anti-armor role by a few U.S. Army artillery spotter units over France; these aircraft were field-outfitted with either two or four [[bazooka]] rocket launchers attached to the [[lift strut]]s,<ref>Francis, Devon E., ''Mr. Piper and His Cubs'', Iowa State University Press, {{ISBN|0-8138-1250-X}}, 9780813812502 (1973), p. 117.</ref> against German armored fighting vehicles. During the summer of 1944, U.S. Army [[Charles Carpenter (lieutenant colonel)|Major Charles Carpenter]] managed to successfully take on an anti-armor role with his rocket-armed Piper L-4. His L-4, named ''Rosie the Rocketeer'', armed with six bazookas, had a notable anti-armor success during an engagement during the [[Battle of Arracourt#The battle|Battle of Arracourt]] on September 20, 1944, knocking out at least four German armored vehicles,<ref>Gantt, Marlene, ''Riding His Piper Cub Through The Skies Over France, Bazooka Charlie Fought A One-man War'', World War II Magazine, September 1987</ref> as a pioneering example of taking on heavy enemy armor from a lightweight slow-flying aircraft.<ref>Fountain, Paul, ''The Maytag Messerschmitts'', Flying Magazine, March 1945, p. 90</ref>\n\n===Field artillery===\nField artillery were often the first ground combat arm to engage detected concentration of troops which included tanks through artillery airborne observers, either in assembly areas (for refueling and rearming), during approach marches to the combat zone, or as the tank unit was forming up for the attack. Conventional artillery shells were very effective against the tank's thinner top armor if fired in appropriate density while the tanks were concentrated, enabling direct hits by a sufficiently powerful shell. Even a non-penetrating shell could still disable a tank through dynamic shock, internal armor shattering or simply overturning the tank. More importantly the tanks could be disabled due to damage to tracks and wheels, and their supporting vehicles and personnel could be damaged and killed, reducing unit's ability to fight in the longer term. Because tanks were usually accompanied by infantry mounted on trucks or [[half-track]]ed vehicles that lacked overhead armor, field artillery that fired a mix of ground and air-burst ammunition was likely to inflict heavy casualties on the infantry as well. Field guns, such as the [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder]], were provided with armor-piercing shot for direct engagement of enemy tanks.\n\n===Anti-tank guns {{anchor|Anti-tank guns}}===<!-- This section is linked from [[Chinese Civil War]] --><!-- This section is linked from [[Cruiser tank]] --><!-- this section is linked from [[T-26]] -->\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2008}}\n{{see also|Anti-tank gun|Tank gun}}\n[[File:37mm bofors antitank gun parola 2.jpg|thumb|right|Bofors 37&nbsp;mm anti-tank gun as used by several nations]]\nAnti-tank guns are guns designed to destroy armored vehicles from defensive positions. In order to penetrate vehicle armor, they fire smaller caliber shells from longer-barreled guns to achieve higher muzzle velocity than field artillery weapons, many of which are [[howitzer]]s. The higher velocity, flatter trajectory [[ballistics]] provide terminal [[Kinetic energy penetrator|kinetic energy]] to penetrate the moving/static target's armor at a given range and contact's angle. Any field artillery [[cannon]] with barrel length 15 to 25 times longer than its [[caliber]] was able also to fire anti-tank ammunition, such as the Soviet [[122 mm gun M1931/37 (A-19)|A-19]].\n\nPrior to [[World War II]], few anti-tank guns had (or needed) calibers larger than 50&nbsp;mm. Examples of guns in this class include the [[3.7 cm PaK 36|German 37&nbsp;mm]], [[37 mm Gun M3|US 37&nbsp;mm]] (the largest gun able to be towed by the [[jeep]]), [[25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun|French 25&nbsp;mm]] and [[47 mm APX anti-tank gun|47&nbsp;mm]] guns, [[Ordnance QF 2 pounder|British QF 2-pounder (40&nbsp;mm)]], [[Cannone da 47/32 M35|Italian 47 mm]] and [[45 mm anti-tank gun M1937 (53-K)|Soviet 45&nbsp;mm]]. All of these light weapons could penetrate the thin armor found on most pre-war and early war tanks.\n\n[[File:Pak38 cfb borden 2.JPG|thumb|left|German [[PaK 38]] 50-mm anti-tank gun]]\nAt the start of [[World War II]], many of these weapons were still being used operationally, along with a newer generation of light guns that closely resembled their WWI counterparts. After Soviet [[T-34 tank|T-34]] and [[KV tank|KV]] tanks were encountered, these guns were recognized as ineffective against [[sloped armor]], with the German lightweight 37&nbsp;mm gun quickly nicknamed the \"tank door knocker\" ({{lang-ger|Panzeranklopfger\u00e4t}}), for revealing its presence without penetrating the armor.\n\nGermany introduced more powerful anti-tank guns, some which had been in the early stages of development prior to the war. By late 1942, the Germans had an excellent [[5 cm PaK 38|50-mm high-velocity design]], while they faced the [[Ordnance QF 6 pounder|QF 6-pounder]] introduced in the [[North African Campaign]] by the British Army, and later adopted by the [[57 mm Gun M1#U.S. service|US Army]]. By 1943 Wehrmacht was forced to adopt still larger calibers on the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]], the [[7.5 cm PaK 40|75&nbsp;mm]] and the famous [[88 mm gun|88&nbsp;mm]] guns. The Red Army used a variety of 45&nbsp;mm, [[57 mm anti-tank gun M1943 (ZiS-2)|57&nbsp;mm]], and [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100&nbsp;mm]] guns, as well as deploying general-purpose 76.2&nbsp;mm and 122-mm guns in the anti-tank role. For the [[Invasion of Normandy]], the British produced the 3-inch (76.2&nbsp;mm) calibre [[Ordnance QF 17 pounder|QF 17 pounder]], whose design had begun before the 6 pounder entered service, which proved to be a highly effective anti-tank gun and was also used on the [[Sherman Firefly|tank]] and the [[Archer (tank destroyer)|tank destroyer]].\n\n====Tank Destroyers====\n{{main|Tank destroyer}} {{see also|Panzerj\u00e4ger|Jagdpanzer}}\n[[File:Archer SP 17 pdr Tank Destroyer.jpg|thumb|right|A British [[Archer (tank destroyer)|Archer tank destroyer]], based on the hull of a [[Valentine tank]]]]\nAs towed anti-tank cannon guns grew in size and weight, they became less mobile and more cumbersome to maneuver, and required ever larger gun crews, who often had to wrestle the gun into position while under heavy artillery and/or tank fire. As the war progressed, this disadvantage often resulted in the loss or destruction of both the antitank gun and its trained crew. This gave impetus to the development of the self-propelled, lightly armored \"[[tank destroyer]]\" (TD). The tank destroyer was usually based on the hull of existing tank designs, using either a gun integrated into the hull or a fully rotating turret much like that of a conventional tank. These self-propelled (SP) AT guns were first employed as infantry support weapons in place of towed antitank guns. Later, due to a shortage of tanks, TDs sometimes replaced the former in offensive armored operations.\n\nEarly German-designed tank destroyers, such as the [[Marder I]], employed existing light French or Czech design tank chassis, installing an AT gun as part of an armored, turret-less superstructure. This method reduced both weight and conversion costs. The Soviet Union later adopted this style of self-propelled anti-tank gun or tank destroyer. This type of tank destroyer had the advantage of a reduced silhouette, allowing the crew to more frequently fire from [[defilade]] [[ambush]] positions. Such designs were easier and faster to manufacture and offered good crew protection, though the lack of a turret limited the gun's traverse to a few degrees. This meant that, if the TD became immobilized due to engine failure or track damage, it could not rotate its gun to counter opposing tanks, making it an easy target. This vulnerability was later exploited by opposing tank forces. Late in the war, it was not unusual to find even the largest and most powerful tank destroyer abandoned on the field after a battle, having been immobilized by a single high-explosive shell to the track or front drive sprocket.\n\nUS Army pre-war infantry support doctrines emphasized the use of tank destroyers with open-top fully rotating turrets, featuring less armor than the standard [[M4 Sherman]] tanks, but with more powerful cannon. A 76&nbsp;mm long-barrel tank cannon was fitted to the Sherman-based [[M10 tank destroyer|M10]] and all-new design [[M18 Hellcat|M18]] designs, with the M18 being the fastest-moving American AFV of any type in World War II.<ref>{{citation |title=M18 Hellcat Tank Destroyer 1943-97 |first= Steven J |last=Zaloga |page=14 |isbn=1-84176-687-9}}</ref> Late in 1944, the Sherman-origin [[M36 tank destroyer|M36]] appeared, equipped with a 90&nbsp;mm cannon. With rotating turrets and good combat maneuverability, American TD designs generally worked well, although their light armor was no match for enemy tank cannon fire during one on one confrontations. Another disadvantage proved to be the open, unprotected turret, and casualties from artillery fire soon led to the introduction of folding armor turret covers. Near the war's end, a change in official doctrine caused both the self-propelled tank destroyer and the towed antitank gun to fall from favor in U.S. service, increasingly replaced by conventional tanks or infantry level antitank weapons. Despite this change, the M36 tank destroyer continued in service, and was used in combat as late as the [[Korean War]].\n\nThe third, and likely most effective kind of tank destroyer was the unturreted, [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|casemate]]-style tank destroyer, known by the [[Jagdpanzer]] term in German service, or [[Samokhodnaya Ustanovka]] in Soviet service for their own designs. These generally featured a heavy gun mounted on an older or then-current tank chassis, with the gun pointing forward with a limited degree of traverse. Casemate tank destroyers often had the same amount of armour as the tanks they were based on. The removal of the turret allowed for greater room to mount a larger gun with a larger breech and leave room for crew. Many casemate tank destroyers either originated as, or were dual-purpose vehicles with the duty of a self-propelled gun, which share many (but usually not all) of the same features and layout. Some examples are the German [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III]] - the most-produced German armored fighting vehicle of WW II \u2014 and the Soviets' [[SU-100]], itself based on the [[T-34 tank]]'s hull and drivetrain.\n\n===Infantry===\n\n====Rifles====\n[[File:Ptrs003.jpg|right|thumb|The Soviet [[PTRS-41]] anti-tank rifle during World War II.]]\n{{See also|Anti-tank rifle}}\n\nAnti-tank rifles were introduced in some armies before the Second World War to provide infantry with a stand-off weapon when confronted with a tank assault. The intention was to preserve the morale of the infantry by providing a weapon that could actually defeat a tank. [[Anti-tank rifle]]s were developed in several countries during the 1930s. By the beginning of WW2, anti-tank rifle teams could knock out most tanks from a distance of about 500&nbsp;m, and do so with a weapon that was man-portable and easily concealed. Although the AT rifle performance was negated by the increased armor of medium and heavy tanks by 1942, they remained viable against lighter-armored and unarmored vehicles, and against field fortification embrasures.\n\nNotable examples include the Finnish [[Lahti L-39]] (which was also used as a sniper rifle during the [[Continuation War]]), the automatic Japanese [[Type 97 20 mm anti-tank rifle]], the German [[Panzerb\u00fcchse 38]], [[Panzerb\u00fcchse 39]], the Polish [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|wz.35]] and the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] 14.5&nbsp;mm [[PTRD]] and [[PTRS-41]].\n\nBy 1943, most armies judged anti-tank rifles to lack combat effectiveness due to the diminished ability to penetrate the thicker armor of new tanks -\nthe British Army had abandoned them by 1942 and the Wehrmacht by 1943, while the US Army never adopted the weapon, although the USMC used [[Boys anti-tank rifle]]s in the Pacific Theater. However, the [[anti-tank rifle]] remained in Soviet use during the conflict due to the importance it occupied in its doctrine of anti-tank in-depth defense, first demonstrated during the defense of Moscow and again during the Kursk battles. This became particularly true later in the war when the Red Army assumed an almost constant offensive, and anti-tank in-depth defensive deployments were used for protecting flanks of the operational breakthroughs against German tactical counterattacks. By firing on the lighter armored infantry and support vehicles (e.g. [[artillery tractor]]s) the anti-tank rifle units helped to separate the supporting infantry (''[[panzergrenadiers]]'') and artillery of the German tanks and so forced the tanks to halt at short distances from the concealed anti-tank guns leaving them exposed to fire from larger, longer ranged anti-tank guns. PTRS-41 semi-automatic anti-tank rifles were also used for sniping since an additional tracer round enabled rapid fire adjustment by the gunner. Although optical sniper scopes were tried with the PTRS-41, the weapons proved too inaccurate at sniping distances (800&nbsp;m or more), and the recoil too much for effective use of the scopes.\n\n===={{anchor|AT_rockets}}Rockets and shaped charges====\n[[File:PIAT cropped.jpg|thumb|British [[PIAT]]]]\nThe development of light, man-portable, anti-tank weapons increased during the Second World War. Most were based on the [[Munroe effect]] which led to the development of the [[high-explosive]] [[shaped charge]]. These weapons were called [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead|high-explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT). The destructive effect was reliant entirely on the kinetic energy of the explosion rather than the ballistic speed of the round on the damage inflicted to the armor. The effect was also concentrated and could penetrate more armor for a given amount of explosives. The first HEAT rounds were rifle grenades, but better delivery systems were soon introduced: the British [[PIAT]] was propelled in a manner similar to the [[spigot mortar]] with a blackpowder charge contained in the tailfin assembly, the US [[Bazooka]] and the German ''[[Panzerschreck]]'' used rockets, and the German ''[[Panzerfaust]]'' was a small [[recoilless gun]]. The HEAT warhead was retroactively used to give more power to smaller calibre weapons such as in the conversion of the otherwise limited German 37&nbsp;mm PaK guns to fire a large shell, called [[Stielgranate 41]], that fitted over the barrel rather than down in it, to a greater range than the ''Panzerschreck'' could manage.\n\nThe [[Hungarian 44M|Hungarian 44M \"\"Buzog\u00e1nyvet\u0151\"\"]] was a successful unguided rocket used extensively in the [[Siege of Budapest]].\n[[File:Trigat-LR-detoured.jpg|thumb|[[PARS 3 LR]] with HEAT warhead of the [[German Army]].]]\nAfter the war, research on infantry anti-tank weapons continued, with most designers focused on two primary goals: first an anti-tank weapon that could defeat more heavily armored postwar tanks and fighting vehicles, and second a weapon lightweight and portable enough for infantry use.\n\n====Mines and other explosives====\n{{Main|Anti-tank mine}}\n[[File:Lunge AT Mine.jpg|thumb|right|A statue of a Vietminh soldier holding a Lunge AT Mine. In Vietnamese the mine is called ''bom ba c\u00e0ng'', literally means \"three-clawed bomb\".]]\n[[File:Production of Sticky Bombs.jpg|thumb|[[Sticky bomb]] in production]]\n\n*Though unsophisticated, the [[satchel charge]] was an effective anti-tank weapon during World War II; the blast could sever the tracks of a tank, damage internal components or injure the crew.\n*[[Hawkins mine]]\n*The [[Wehrmacht]] employed the [[Goliath tracked mine]], an unmanned demolition vehicle.\n*The [[Soviet Union]] employed [[anti-tank dog]]s during World War II, with very limited success; as a counterpart to the German Goliath the [[Teletank]] was used as a remote-controlled unmanned tank.\n*The Japanese forces employed suicide attacks with pole-mounted anti-tank mines dubbed [[lunge mine]]s during late World War II.<ref>[http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/jp_tankhunters/index.html Lone Sentry: New Weapons for Jap Tank Hunters (U.S. WWII Intelligence Bulletin, March 1945)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In Vietnam, similar mines were called ''bom ba c\u00e0ng'' due to the three contact points at the head of each mine.\n\n====Grenades====\n{{main|Anti-tank grenade}}\nRegular [[fragmentation grenade]]s were ineffective against tanks, so many kinds of anti-tank grenades were developed. These ranged from [[hollow charge]] designs (e.g., the British [[No. 68 AT Grenade]]), to ones that simply contained a lot of explosive (the British [[No. 73 Grenade]]). To increase their effectiveness, some grenades were designed so that they adhered to the tank either through an adhesive ([[sticky bomb]]) or with a magnet. The Germans used a magnetic grenade, the [[Hafthohlladung]] to ensure that the [[shaped charge]] would fire at the optimal 90\u00b0 angle to the armor.\n\nThere was also a special type of grenade called the ''Nebelhandgranaten'' or ''Blendk\u00f6rper'' (\"smoke hand grenades\"), which was supposed to be smashed over an air vent and fill the tank with smoke, widely used by both sides in [[World War II]]. [[Molotov cocktails]] also saw much use, especially in the [[Winter War]], early tanks (such as the [[T-26]]) being very vulnerable to them, but later tanks required a well-thrown bottle directly over the engine compartment to have any effect at all.\n\nOn the whole, thrown anti-tank weapons suffered from a variety of drawbacks. In addition to the inherently short range, they required careful aim to be effective, and those that relied on explosive force were often so powerful that the user had to take cover immediately.\n\n===Tactics===\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2009}}\n[[File:Talvisota Molotov Cocktail.PNG|thumb|right|upright|A [[Finnish Army|Finnish soldier]] with a Molotov cocktail in the 1939-40 [[Winter War]].]]\nAnti-tank tactics developed rapidly during the war but along different paths in different armies based on the threats they faced and the technologies they were able to produce. Very little development took place in UK because weapons available in 1940 were judged adequate for engaging Italian and German tanks during most of the [[North African Campaign]]. Its experience therefore failed to influence the US Army's anti-tank doctrine prior to 1944.\nFrom 1941, German anti-tank tactics developed rapidly as a result of being surprised by the previously unknown Soviet tank designs, forcing introduction of new technologies and new tactics. The Red Army was also faced with a new challenge in anti-tank warfare after losing most of its tank fleet and a considerable part of its anti-tank capable cannons.\n\nAnti-tank tactics during the war were largely integrated with the offensive or defensive posture of the troops being supported, usually infantry. Most anti-tank tactics depend on the range effectiveness of various weapons and weapon systems available. These are divided as follows:\n*Operational range over the horizon (20\u201340&nbsp;km range)\n*:Bomber aircraft and long range artillery\n*Tactical staging areas (7\u201320&nbsp;km range)\n*:Ground attack aircraft and field artillery including [[Multiple rocket launcher|MRL]]s\n*Tactical zone forming-up area and rear combat zone (2\u20137&nbsp;km range)\n*:Heavy anti-tank guns and mortars\n*Tactical forward combat zone (1\u20132&nbsp;km range)\n*:Anti-tank guns and tanks deployed in defense\n*Engagement distance (200\u20131000&nbsp;m range)\n*:Mines and anti-tank rifles\n*Close combat distance (25\u2013200&nbsp;m range)\n*:Infantry anti-tank weapons\n\nGround-to-air cooperation was not yet systematic in any army of the period, but given sufficient warning ground attack aircraft could support ground troops even during an enemy attack in an attempt to interdict the enemy units before they come into tactical combat zone. Various bomb loads can be used depending on what type of tank unit is engaged in at the time or who its accompanying troops are. This is an indirect form of anti-tank warfare where the tanks are denied the opportunity to even reach combat.\n\nField artillery was particularly effective in firing against tank formations because although they were rarely able to destroy a tank by direct penetration, they would severely crater the area preventing the tanks from moving therefore causing them to become nearly stationary targets for the ground attack aircraft, or disrupting the enemy schedule and allowing own troops more time to prepare their defense.\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-719-0240-26, Pas de Calais, Atlantikwall, Panzersperren.jpg|thumb|left|Examples of [[Czech hedgehog]]s deployed on the [[Atlantic Wall]] in the vicinity of [[Calais]].]]\nAnti-tank defense proper was by 1942 designed in First World War fashion with several prepared trench lines incorporating anti-tank weapons of different capabilities. Depending on terrain and the available line-of-sight, the longer-ranged guns could begin to fire on approaching tanks from as far as 2 kilometers, which was also the range at which German Panther and Tiger tank gunners were trained to fire. Anti-tank guns were usually deployed to cover terrain more suitable for tanks, and were protected by minefields laid at about 500 meters to 1 kilometer from their positions by combat engineers. In the Red Army the anti-tank rifle units would be positioned throughout the forward trench line and would engage the lighter tanks and any other vehicles, such as infantry half-tracks in an attempt to separate them from the tanks. The anti-tank guns deployed further back would often hold their fire until enemy tanks were within the most effective range for their ammunition. Where there were insufficient anti-tank weapons, engineers would construct anti-tank obstacles such as [[Dragon's teeth (fortification)|dragon's teeth]] or [[czech hedgehog]].\n\nTowed anti-tank guns were thought to be the primary means of defeating tanks. At the [[battle of Kursk]] for example, the Red Army deployed more artillery regiments than infantry regiments and towed gun densities reached over 20 guns per kilometer of defended tactical zone. A towed gun was much cheaper than a tank and could be concealed in a shallow position. When time allowed, dugouts with strong overhead cover could be constructed. Guns deployed on reverse slopes and in flanking positions could take a toll of attacking tanks. However, gun crews were vulnerable to artillery, mortar HE fire and enemy infantry. Their positions had to be carefully selected and once engaged, they generally could not redeploy. Experience strongly suggested that towed AT guns were less effective than self-propelled AT weapons and took heavier casualties.\n\nThe tactic of ambushing enemy armor at grazing shot distances was perfected during World War 2. Some combatants, like the Soviet Red Army, doctrinalized it and used it to engage heavy German armor at optimal distances and angles.\n\nSelf-propelled anti-tank guns were rare at the beginning of WW2, although the [[Belgian Army]] deployed a few T.15 tank destroyers and the French army was developing several wheeled and tracked designs. The advantages of mobility and even thin armor protection were so compelling that most armies were using self-propelled AT guns by mid-war. Examples of these weapons included the [[M10 Tank Destroyer|US M10]], German [[Marder II]], and Soviet [[SU-85]].\n\n====Infantry close assault====\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28150, Deutsche Soldaten mit Panzerf\u00e4usten.jpg|thumb|right|Panzerfaust armed German soldiers on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], 1945.]]\nThe tank is still vulnerable to infantry, especially in close country or built-up areas. Rough terrain may expose the floor armor, and high ground such as multi-story buildings may expose the top armor. Their large size and loud noise can allow enemy infantry to spot, track and evade tanks until an opportunity presents itself for counter-attack.\n\nBecause tank crews have limited visibility from inside the tank, infantry can get close to a tank given enough concealment and if the hatches are closed. If tank crewmen unbutton for better visibility they become vulnerable to small arms fire, grenades and molotov cocktails. An infantryman cannot be targeted by a tank's main gun when close, as it cannot depress sufficiently. Close defense weapons such as pistol ports, hull-, coaxial- and pintle-mounted machine guns gave them some protection however.\n\nWhilst many hand-held infantry anti-tank weapons will not penetrate the front armor of a tank, they may penetrate the less heavily armored top, rear, and sides. Anti-tank weapons can damage the tracks or running gear to inflict a [[mobility kill]]. Early WWII tanks had open vision slits that could be fired through to kill the crew. Later tanks' slits had thick glass, as well as sights and periscopes which could still be damaged with powerful small arms such as [[anti-tank rifle]]s and [[heavy machine gun]]s, hampering the crew. If all else fails, the hatch could also be forced open and grenades thrown inside, although later tank designs often have hatches designed to be difficult to open from the outside.\n\nTanks were also vulnerable to hand-placed anti-tank mines. Infantry have even immobilized tanks using a set of plates covered with leaves and dirt as dummy mines \u2013 the ruse being augmented by the crew's obscured vision \u2013 infantry can then attack the stopped tank.

The tide turned in favour of the United Nations forces in August 1950 when the North Koreans suffered major tank losses during a series of battles in which the UN forces brought heavier equipment to develop an anti-tank role, including U.S. [[M4 Sherman|M4A3 Sherman]] medium tanks backed by [[M26 Pershing]] heavy tanks, along with British [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], [[Churchill tank|Churchill]], and [[Cromwell tank|Cromwell]] tanks.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=182\u2013184}}\n\nIn the U.S., the {{convert|2.36|in|mm|abbr=on}} M9A1 [[bazooka]] rocket launcher evolved into the more powerful {{convert|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} M20 \"Super Bazooka\", which was used to good effect against North Korean armored spearheads during the [[Korean War]]. However, the M20 proved difficult and cumbersome to portage on foot over long distances. The [[Anti-Tank Aircraft Rocket]], developed by the navy, also proved effective against North Korean tanks.\n\n==Cold War==\nIn the Cold War era, HEAT became an almost universal choice outside of artillery and tank units. The British had developed the [[High-explosive squash head]] (HESH) warhead as a weapon for attacking fortifications during the war, and found it surprisingly effective against tanks. Although these systems allowed infantry to take on even the largest tanks, and, like HEAT, its effectiveness was independent of range, infantry typically operated at short range. A major influence in anti-tank warfare came with the development and evolution of [[anti-tank guided missile]]s (ATGM) that could be fired by infantry operators, from ground vehicles and by aircraft. Increasing use of [[combined arms]] tactics allowed the attacking infantry to suppress the anti-tank crews effectively, meaning that they could typically get off only one or two shots before being countered or forced to move.\n\n===Aircraft===\n{{main|Attack aircraft}}\nCold War aircraft, such as the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] and [[Sukhoi Su-25|SU-25 Frogfoot]], have been specifically built for [[close air support]], including tank destruction. They can use a variety of weaponry, including large-caliber anti-tank [[autocannon]]s or [[rotary cannon|rotary autocannons]], air-to-surface missiles (e.g. [[AGM-65 Maverick]]), volleys of unguided rockets, and various [[bomb]]s (unguided or [[laser-guided]] and with or without submunitions such as HEAT bomblets, an example of which would be the [[CBU-100 Cluster Bomb]]).\n\n===Helicopters===\n{{further|Attack helicopter}}\n[[File:ApacheWAH64.jpg|thumb|right|[[British Army]] [[Westland WAH-64 Apache]], an anti-tank helicopter]]\nGuided anti-tank missiles were first used in a helicopter-borne role by the French in the late 1950s, when they mounted [[Nord SS.11|SS.11]] wire-guided missiles on [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II]] helicopters.<ref name=\"HELOSATWAR\">''Helicopters at War'', Blitz Editions, p. 63, {{ISBN|1-85605-345-8}}.</ref> Initially there were many teething problems; However, the possibilities, such as providing the ability to attack the more lightly armored top of the tank, were clear.\n\nAlthough putting weapons on helicopters (probably) dates back to 1955 with the [[Bell 47]], the first specific [[attack helicopter]] that went into mass production was the Bell [[AH-1 Cobra]] in 1966. The AH-1 was equipped with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]] missiles in 1973 for anti-tank capability.<ref>Verier, Mike. ''Bell AH-1 Cobra''. Osprey Publishing, 1990. {{ISBN|0-85045-934-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe anti-tank helicopter armed with [[Anti-tank guided missile|ATGW]]s (Anti-Tank Guided Weapons) or anti-tank cannons is one of the biggest threats to a modern tank. The helicopter can position itself where it is not easily seen from a tank and then attack from any quarter, exposing the weaker parts of the tank's armor. The limited visibility from a closed-down tank also makes sighting a helicopter harder.\n\nMost helicopter-launched ATGWs have sufficient range that they can under the right conditions be fired at a range too long for the tank to retaliate with its own weapons. This may change with the Israelis fielding the [[LAHAT|Lahat]] missile that can be fired from the main gun of the Merkava MBT. With both anti-tank and anti-helicopter role, it does level the playing field somewhat. The Indian [[Arjun (tank)|Arjun tank]] has also been modified to fire this missile. The People's Republic of China has developed 100&nbsp;mm gun-launched missiles based on Russian designs such as the GP2 (based on the Russian [[9M117 Bastion|Bastion]]). It has been reported to have successfully engaged aerial targets, as well as being an anti-tank missile. Similar missiles are available for Chinese tanks equipped with the 105&nbsp;mm gun. The Russians have also displayed a similar if more advanced system in the [[9M119 Svir|Reflex]]. The system involves an automatic targeting of an aerial/land target instigated by a laser warning system.\n\n===Artillery===\nIn the last thirty years, however, a variety of artillery projectiles have been developed specifically to attack tanks. These include laser-guided projectiles, such as the US's Copperhead [[CLGP|Cannon Launched Guided Projectile]] (CLGP), which increases the chances of a direct hit. Some of these CLGPs (including the Copperhead) have HEAT warheads instead of common HE.\n\nGuided and unguided scatter munitions and [[submunition]]s have also been developed: a single artillery shell containing a number of smaller munitions designed to attack a tank. A six-gun battery might be able to fire several hundred submunitions in a minute or two.\n\nIn one form, the shell bursts in the air above the tank and a number of [[shaped charge]] (HEAT) or HEDP (High Explosive Dual Purpose) bomblets or grenades rain down. Any that hit the tank have a good chance of causing damage, since they are attacking the thin top armor.\n\nAnother form scatters a number of small anti-tank mines in the tank's path, which probably will not penetrate the armor but can damage a track, leaving the tank [[mobility kill|immobile]] and vulnerable.\n\nMore sophisticated are submunitions with a homing capability. Once again the shell explodes above the tank position and dispenses a number of submunitions. The munitions contain some circuitry to identify tanks, such as IR or millimeter radar; when a tank is identified, a rocket propellant is fired to shoot the projectile at the tank. These munitions will often descend by parachute, to allow time for target acquisition and attack.\n\nAll of the above, but the CLGP can be fired from medium (122mm/130mm/152mm/155mm) tube artillery and rocket artillery. There has also been development of medium and large (81mm/82mm/120mm) guided mortar munitions with both internal (e.g., IR or radar) or external (i.e., laser designator) guidance.\n\n===Missiles===\n{{main|Anti-tank missile}}\nThe development of the [[wire-guided missile]], or Anti-Tank Guided Weapon (ATGW) systems came into use in the late 1950s and 1960s that could defeat any known tank at ranges beyond that of the guns of the accompanying infantry. The United Kingdom, France, and other [[NATO]] countries were among the first to develop such weapons (e.g., the [[Malkara missile]] by the UK and Australia in 1958). The Soviet Union, and now Russia, put extensive development into these weapons; the first man-portable model to enter service was the [[AT-3 Sagger|AT-3]] in 1961. The United States was one of the last, coming up with the [[BGM-71 TOW]] in 1970.\n\nFor a time, it appeared that the tank was a dead end. A small team of infantry with a few missiles in a well-concealed position could take on a number of the largest and most expensive tanks. In the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], Soviet first-generation wire-guided missiles employed by the Egyptian forces inflicted heavy casualties on [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli]] tank units, causing a major crisis of confidence for tank designers.\n\n[[Active protection system]]s, such as the Russian [[Arena active protection system]], are starting to be more common, with similar systems such as the Israeli [[Iron Fist active protection system]]. The tank may be on a comeback because of active defense systems, which attack missiles in mid-air. This may allow the tank to be competitive on the battlefield once again.\n\n===Guns===\n{{main|Anti-tank gun}}\n[[File:Baasjan1.JPG|thumb|South African tank gun retrofitted to a [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|OQF 17 pdr]] carriage.]]\nAnti-tank guns continued to be used in a number of conflicts past World War 2 around the world, such as the [[Six-Day War]]<ref name=\"Oren\">{{cite book|last=Oren|first=Michael|title=Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East|edition=2003|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sixdaysofwarjune0000oren_u3x7/page/192 192\u2013194]|publisher=Presidio Press|isbn=978-0345461926|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/sixdaysofwarjune0000oren_u3x7/page/192}}</ref> and the [[South African Border War]].<ref name=\"Grove\">{{cite web|title=Ratel teen tenk en|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->\n|url=http://www.samagte.co.za/weermag/hc/grove.html|url-status=dead|location=Port Elizabeth|publisher=International Veterans' Association/South African Forces Club|date=2011\n|accessdate=20 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728040847/http://www.samagte.co.za/weermag/hc/grove.html|archivedate=28 July 2012}}</ref> Soviet anti-tank guns in particular were exported to at least eighteen other countries after being retired from service and have continued to see action.<ref name=\"trade\">{{cite web|url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/trade_register.php |title=Trade Registers |publisher=Armstrade.sipri.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-20}}</ref>\n\nRather than developing specialized anti-tank artillery, some nations, including South Africa and Israel, grafted obsolete tank guns onto towed carriages for use in that role.<ref name=\"Gate\">{{Citation |title=Baasjan howitzer (RSA) |year=2014 |type=Exhibit |publisher=[[South African National Defence Force]] |location=South African Armour Museum, [[Bloemfontein]]}}</ref>\n\n===Mines===\nOwing to greater sophistication of the tank, and engineering support available to tank units to detect and negate minefields, a considerable effort was made to develop more effective anti-tank mine technology in the effort to deny tank-led formations maneuver space, or channel their movement into unsuitable avenues of approach.\n\n===Infantry===\n[[File:106mm land rover.JPG|thumb|[[Australian Army]] [[Land Rover Series|Land Rover Series 2]] \"gunbuggy\" with a [[M40 recoilless rifle]] used in the anti-tank role.]]\n\nThe search for a more suitable, longer-range delivery system took up much of the immediate post-war era. The US invested in the [[recoilless rifle]], delivering a widely used 75&nbsp;mm design, and less common 90&nbsp;mm and 106&nbsp;mm designs (the latter was usually mounted rather than infantry-handled). The 106&nbsp;mm formed the basis of a dedicated anti-tank vehicle, the [[Ontos tank]], which mounted six 106&nbsp;mm rifles. The [[Australian Army]] also fitted [[M40 recoilless rifle]]s to [[Land Rover Series|Land Rover Series 2]] vehicles for use in an anti-tank role. The Soviet Union also built recoilless rifles in various calibers intended to be used as anti-tank weapons, most commonly 73&nbsp;mm, 82&nbsp;mm, and 110&nbsp;mm (only the 73&nbsp;mm remains in service with the Russian military today, though the other two can be found all over the world due to Soviet military aid during the Cold War). The British used a 120&nbsp;mm (4.7 inch) design to equip infantry units, the [[L6 Wombat|BAT series]], which served from the 1950s until replaced by [[MILAN]], but it was generally too heavy for infantry use and had to be towed by, or mounted on, a vehicle for maneuverability.\n\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s developed the [[RPG-2]] from the German ''Panzerfaust 150''. Further development led to the ubiquitous [[RPG-7]]. The RPG-7 is one of the most widely used anti-tank weapons, favored most by soldiers of [[Irregular military|irregular militaries]]. The RPG-7 could fire a range of different warheads, from [[thermobaric]] warheads to a single HEAT or [[tandem-charge]] HEAT warheads against [[explosive reactive armor]] equipped tanks. The RPG-7 has a long combat history, and has been used in most wars from the [[Vietnam war]] all the way to present day wars. In modern times, the RPG-7 is generally used in an [[urban area|urban]] environment, which would enhance their effectiveness due to the close ranges involved. However, the aging RPG-7 has evolved to the even more potent [[RPG-29]] which has proven its worth in conflicts in the [[Middle East]], damaging the [[Merkava IV]],<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/746929.html Hezbollah anti-tank fire causing most IDF casualties in Lebanon - Haaretz Daily Newspaper | Israel News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Challenger 2]]<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/13/nmod13.xml|title=Telegraph article|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> and [[M1 Abrams]]<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/21/world/middleeast/21sadr.html?_r=2&hp&oref=slogin&oref=slogin NYtimes.com]</ref> [[main battle tank]]s.\n\n[[File:ISF member armed with RPG-7.jpg|thumb|Soviet RPG-7]]\n\nIn the 1960s, the U.S. Army adopted the [[M72 LAW]] rocket, a lightweight, collapsible rocket launcher with the ability to penetrate moderate thicknesses of enemy armor. During the [[Vietnam War]], the weapon was used primarily against NVA and Viet Cong defensive works and emplacements, as there were few encounters against enemy armor. Overall, the LAW was regarded as a success, though its ignition system frequently suffered from misfires in the heat and humidity of Vietnamese jungles. The LAW has since been replaced by the [[AT4]] (M136).\n\n===Tactics===\nChanges in the anti-tank tactics since the Second World War mostly came from the appearance of new technologies, and increased firepower of the infantry mounted on fully armored vehicles. The most profound anti-tank technology has been the guided missile, which when coupled with a helicopter can mean that tanks can be engaged beyond ground line of sight (LOS), and at one of their most vulnerable aspect, the top armor.\n\n==Effectiveness==\nThe effect of anti-tank warfare is to destroy or damage enemy tanks, or to prevent enemy tanks, and their supporting troops from maneuvering, which is the primary capability of the tanks. In the US Army the degree of effect by an anti-tank weapon on a vehicle is referred to as either \"[[mobility kill]]\", \"[[wiktionary:firepower kill|firepower kill]]\", and \"[[catastrophic kill]]\". In a mobility kill (M-kill), the vehicle loses its ability to move, for example, by breaking a [[caterpillar track|tank track]] or bogey or damaging the engine; the targeted tank is then immobile, but may retain full use of its weapons (large cannon, heavy machine gun and smaller machine guns) and still be able to fight to some extent. On the other hand, a mobility-killed tank is a relatively vulnerable target to RPG or [[Molotov cocktail]] attacks, and it cannot maneuver to better firing positions.\n\nA firepower kill (F-kill) is some loss of the vehicle's ability to fire its weapons. For example, a tank may be hit on its main cannon, making the main gun inoperable. M-kills and F-kills may be complete or partial, the latter corresponding to reductions in a target's ability to move or fire. A catastrophic kill (K-kill) removes the tank's ability to fight completely; this may entail complete destruction of the tank or disabling or killing the crew.\n\n[[File:6SADiv Tanks disabled Perugia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|South African Sherman tanks disabled in the fight to take the Perugia Highlands in Italy 1944 - World War 2. |alt=Two damaged tanks with their tracks visibly destroyed and a damaged Willy's Jeep displaying the 6th Armoured triangular flash]]\n\n===Current trends===\nAlthough the future of the tank was questioned in the 1960s due to the development of the anti-tank missiles, increases in thickness and composition of armor, and other improvements in tank design meant that infantry operated systems were no longer sufficiently effective by the 1970s, and the introduction of [[Chobham armor]] by the British Army and [[reactive armor]] by the Soviet Army forced the HEAT rounds to be increased in size, rendering them less portable.\n\nWeapon systems like the [[RPG-29]] and [[FGM-148 Javelin]] use a [[Tandem warhead]] where the first warhead disables reactive armor, while the second warhead defeats the shell armor by means of a HEAT or a [[shaped charge]]. Today the anti-tank role is filled with a variety of weapons, such as portable \"top attack\" artillery ammunition and missiles, larger [[HEAT]] missiles fired from ground vehicles and [[helicopter]]s, a variety of high velocity [[autocannon]], and ever-larger and heavier tank guns. One of the first lessons of the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]] is the effectiveness of portable rocket propelled grenades, in particular, Russian-made [[RPG-29]], and [[AT-13 Metis-M|Metis-M]], [[9M133 Kornet|Kornet]] and European [[MILAN]] anti-tank missiles.\n\n{{Commons category|Anti-tank weapons}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anti-tank grenade]]\n* [[Bumbar]]\n* [[Czech hedgehog]]\n* [[List of anti-tank guns]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708122806/http://caseyfuller.com/law.htm A 1987 U.S. Army news archive about light anti-tank weapon training by the 7th Infantry Division (Light), Fort Ord, Calif.]\n{{Weapons}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anti-Tank Warfare}}\n[[Category:Anti-tank guns]]\n[[Category:Anti-tank weapons|*]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:DASH, link maintenance, refine ref details", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_warfare"}
