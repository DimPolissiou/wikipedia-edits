He was subsequently made vicar of [[Dalston, Cumbria|Dalston]] in 1780, near the bishop's palace at [[Rose Castle]]. In 1782 he became the [[Archdeacon of Carlisle]]. Paley was intimate with the Law family throughout his life, and the Bishop and his son [[John Law (bishop)|John Law]] (who was later an Irish bishop) were instrumental during the decade after he left Cambridge in pressing him to publish his revised lectures and in negotiating with the publisher.

The book was published in 1785 under the title of ''The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', and was made a part of the examinations at the [[University of Cambridge]] the next year. It passed through fifteen editions in the author's lifetime. Paley strenuously supported the abolition of the [[slave trade]], and his attack on slavery in the book was instrumental in drawing greater public attention to the practice.

In 1802, he published  ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'', his last book. As he states in the preface, he saw the book as a preamble to his other philosophical and theological books; in fact, he suggests that ''Natural Theology'' should be read first, so as to build a systematic understanding of his arguments. The main thrust of his argument was that God's design of the whole creation could be seen in the general happiness, or well-being, that was evident in the physical and social order of things. Such a book fell within the broad tradition of [[natural theology]] works written during the Enlightenment; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on [[John Ray]] (1691), [[William Derham]] (1711) and [[Bernard Nieuwentyt]] (1750).<ref>{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel and David M. Knight|title='Introduction', in William Paley, Natural Theology|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nPaley's argument is built mainly around anatomy and natural history. \"For my part\", he says, \"I take my stand in human anatomy\"; elsewhere he insists upon \"the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear\". In making his argument, Paley employed a wide variety of metaphors and analogies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Science and Rhetoric of Paley's Natural Theology|journal=Literature and Theology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=1\u201322|doi=10.1093/litthe/18.1.1}}</ref> Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world. Historians, philosophers and theologians often call this the [[Watchmaker analogy]].  Building on this mechanical analogy, Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock.  To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend [[John Law (bishop)|John Law]] and the Dublin Astronomer Royal [[John Brinkley (astronomer)|John Brinkley]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural Theology|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=Appendix entry on Brinkley}}</ref>\n\nThe germ of the idea is to be found in ancient writers who used sundials and Ptolemaic epicycles to illustrate the divine order of the world.  These types of examples can be seen in the work of the ancient philosopher [[Cicero]], especially in his ''[[De Natura Deorum|De natura deorum]]'', ii. 87 and 97.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hallam|first=Henry|title=Introduction to the Literature of Europe, Vol II|year=1847|publisher=Murray|location=London|page=385}}</ref>  The watch analogy was widely used in the Enlightenment, by [[Deism|deists]] and Christians alike. Thus, Paley's use of the watch (and other mechanical objects like it) continued a long and fruitful tradition of analogical reasoning that was well received by those who read ''Natural Theology'' when it was published in 1802.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Three churchmen; John Wesley, William Paley, and Beilby Port Wellcome V0006791.jpg|thumb|Three churchmen: [[John Wesley]], William Paley, and [[Beilby Porteus]]. A posthumous engraving.]]\nSince Paley is often read in university courses that address the philosophy of religion, the timing of his design argument has sometimes perplexed modern philosophers. Earlier in the century [[David Hume]] had argued against notions of design with counter examples drawn from monstrosity, imperfect forms of testimony and probability (see [[watchmaker analogy#Criticism|watchmaker analogy]]). Hume's arguments, however, were not widely accepted by most of the reading public and they fell 'stillborn' (to use Hume's own assessment) from the press.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Fieser, James |title=Early Responses to Hume's Life and Reputation Vols 1 and 2 |year=2005 |publisher=Continuum}}</ref> Despite Hume's unpopularity, Paley's published works and in manuscript letters show that he engaged directly with Hume from his time as an undergraduate to his last works. Paley's works were more influential than Hume's from the 1800s to the 1840s.  Hume's arguments were only accepted gradually by the reading public, and his philosophical works sold poorly until agnostics like [[Thomas Huxley]] championed Hume's philosophy in the late 19th century.\n\nScientific norms have changed greatly since Paley's day, and are inclined to do less than justice to his arguments and ways of reasoning. But his style is lucid and he was willing to present transparently the evidence against his own case. The design argument has also been applied in other fields of scientific and philosophical inquiry, notably in regards to anthropic cosmological fine-tuning,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpIiIaC4kRA]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj_fLi_K7jA]</ref> fine-tuning for discoverability<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey8723Vc8gg]</ref> and the origin of life.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA-FcnLsF1g]</ref> His subject matter was central to Victorian anxieties, which might be one reason ''Natural Theology'' continued to appeal to the reading public, making his book a best seller for most of the 19th century, even after the publication of Darwin's ''[[Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.  ''[[Natural Theology]]'' and the ''[[Evidences of Christianity]]'' appealed to Victorian [[Evangelicals]], although not so much to adherents of the [[Oxford Movement]] \u2013 and both found his ''utilitarianism'' objectionable.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fyfe |first=Aileen |title=Publishing and the classics: Paley's Natural Theology and the nineteenth-century scientific canon |journal=Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science |year=2002 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=729\u2013751 |doi=10.1016/s0039-3681(02)00032-8|url=https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/5083/1/classics_of_science_Studies_revised.pdf }}</ref> Paley's views influenced (both positively and negatively) theologians, philosophers and scientists, then and since.\n\nIn addition to ''Moral and Political Philosophy'' and the ''Evidences'', [[Charles Darwin]] read ''Natural Theology'' during his student years, and later stated in his autobiography that he was initially convinced by the argument. His views changed with time. By the 1820s and 1830s, well-known liberals like [[Thomas Wakley]] and other radical editors of ''[[The Lancet]]'' were using Paley's ageing examples to attack the establishment's control over medical and scientific education in Durham, London, Oxford and Cambridge. It also inspired the [[Earl of Bridgewater]] to commission the ''Bridgewater Treatises'' and the [[Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge]] to issue cheap reprints for the rising middle class.   But whereas Paley's natural theology was disassembled or rebuilt by intellectuals like Wakley or the Bridgewater authors, the core of argument retained an ongoing popularity with the reading public and served as the basis of many catechisms and textbooks that were used in Britain and its colonies until World War II when, as argued by [[Matthew Daniel Eddy]], the existential morass of World War I undermined the moral teleology that had underpinned natural theology since the Enlightenment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |title=Nineteenth Century Natural Theology |journal=Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology |year=2013 |pages=101\u2013117 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1539597}}</ref>\n\nToday, Paley's name evokes both reverence and revulsion and his work is cited accordingly by authors seeking to frame their own views of design. Even [[Richard Dawkins]], an opponent of the ''design argument'', described himself as a ''neo-Paleyan'' in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. Today, as in his own time (though for different reasons), Paley is a controversial figure, a lightning rod for both sides in the contemporary argument between creationism and evolutionary biology.  His writings reflect the thought of his time, but as Dawkins observed, his was a strong and logical approach to evidence, whether human or natural. Perhaps this explains why the Oxford constitutional theorist [[A.V. Dicey]] had his pupils read the ''Evidences'' to teach them about legal reasoning. It is for such reasons that Paley's writings, ''Natural Theology'' included, stand as a notable body of work in the canon of Western thought.\n\n==Works==\n\n* ''The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', 1785\n* ''Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'', 1790\n* ''View of the Evidences of Christianity'', 1794 \n* {{citation | author= Paley, William | year = 1809 | title =Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity\n | edition =12th | location = London | publisher = J.

As he states in the preface, he saw the book as a preamble to his other philosophical and theological books; in fact, he suggests that ''Natural Theology'' should be read first, so as to build a systematic understanding of his arguments. The main thrust of his argument was that God's design of the whole creation could be seen in the general happiness, or well-being, that was evident in the physical and social order of things. Such a book fell within the broad tradition of [[natural theology]] works written during the Enlightenment; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on [[John Ray]] (1691), [[William Derham]] (1711) and [[Bernard Nieuwentyt]] (1750).<ref>{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel and David M. Knight|title='Introduction', in William Paley, Natural Theology|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\nPaley's argument is built mainly around anatomy and natural history. \"For my part\", he says, \"I take my stand in human anatomy\"; elsewhere he insists upon \"the necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and determining of the forms which organized bodies bear\". In making his argument, Paley employed a wide variety of metaphors and analogies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Science and Rhetoric of Paley's Natural Theology|journal=Literature and Theology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=1\u201322|doi=10.1093/litthe/18.1.1}}</ref> Perhaps the most famous is his analogy between a watch and the world. Historians, philosophers and theologians often call this the [[Watchmaker analogy]].  Building on this mechanical analogy, Paley presents examples from planetary astronomy and argues that the regular movements of the solar system resemble the workings of a giant clock.  To bolster his views he cites the work of his old friend [[John Law (bishop)|John Law]] and the Dublin Astronomer Royal [[John Brinkley (astronomer)|John Brinkley]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=Natural Theology|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=Appendix entry on Brinkley}}</ref>\n\nThe germ of the idea is to be found in ancient writers who used sundials and Ptolemaic epicycles to illustrate the divine order of the world.  These types of examples can be seen in the work of the ancient philosopher [[Cicero]], especially in his ''[[De Natura Deorum|De natura deorum]]'', ii. 87 and 97.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hallam|first=Henry|title=Introduction to the Literature of Europe, Vol II|year=1847|publisher=Murray|location=London|page=385}}</ref>  The watch analogy was widely used in the Enlightenment, by [[Deism|deists]] and Christians alike. Thus, Paley's use of the watch (and other mechanical objects like it) continued a long and fruitful tradition of analogical reasoning that was well received by those who read ''Natural Theology'' when it was published in 1802.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Three churchmen; John Wesley, William Paley, and Beilby Port Wellcome V0006791.jpg|thumb|Three churchmen: [[John Wesley]], William Paley, and [[Beilby Porteus]]. A posthumous engraving.]]\nSince Paley is often read in university courses that address the philosophy of religion, the timing of his design argument has sometimes perplexed modern philosophers. Earlier in the century [[David Hume]] had argued against notions of design with counter examples drawn from monstrosity, imperfect forms of testimony and probability (see [[watchmaker analogy#Criticism|watchmaker analogy]]). Hume's arguments, however, were not widely accepted by most of the reading public and they fell 'stillborn' (to use Hume's own assessment) from the press.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Fieser, James |title=Early Responses to Hume's Life and Reputation Vols 1 and 2 |year=2005 |publisher=Continuum}}</ref> Despite Hume's unpopularity, Paley's published works and in manuscript letters show that he engaged directly with Hume from his time as an undergraduate to his last works. Paley's works were more influential than Hume's from the 1800s to the 1840s.  Hume's arguments were only accepted gradually by the reading public, and his philosophical works sold poorly until agnostics like [[Thomas Huxley]] championed Hume's philosophy in the late 19th century.\n\nScientific norms have changed greatly since Paley's day, and are inclined to do less than justice to his arguments and ways of reasoning. But his style is lucid and he was willing to present transparently the evidence against his own case. The design argument has also been applied in other fields of scientific and philosophical inquiry, notably in regards to anthropic cosmological fine-tuning,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpIiIaC4kRA]</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj_fLi_K7jA]</ref> fine-tuning for discoverability<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey8723Vc8gg]</ref> and the origin of life.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA-FcnLsF1g]</ref> His subject matter was central to Victorian anxieties, which might be one reason ''Natural Theology'' continued to appeal to the reading public, making his book a best seller for most of the 19th century, even after the publication of Darwin's ''[[Origin of Species]]'' in 1859.  ''[[Natural Theology]]'' and the ''[[Evidences of Christianity]]'' appealed to Victorian [[Evangelicals]], although not so much to adherents of the [[Oxford Movement]] \u2013 and both found his ''utilitarianism'' objectionable.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fyfe |first=Aileen |title=Publishing and the classics: Paley's Natural Theology and the nineteenth-century scientific canon |journal=Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science |year=2002 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=729\u2013751 |doi=10.1016/s0039-3681(02)00032-8|url=https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/5083/1/classics_of_science_Studies_revised.pdf }}</ref> Paley's views influenced (both positively and negatively) theologians, philosophers and scientists, then and since.\n\nIn addition to ''Moral and Political Philosophy'' and the ''Evidences'', [[Charles Darwin]] read ''Natural Theology'' during his student years, and later stated in his autobiography that he was initially convinced by the argument. His views changed with time. By the 1820s and 1830s, well-known liberals like [[Thomas Wakley]] and other radical editors of ''[[The Lancet]]'' were using Paley's ageing examples to attack the establishment's control over medical and scientific education in Durham, London, Oxford and Cambridge. It also inspired the [[Earl of Bridgewater]] to commission the ''Bridgewater Treatises'' and the [[Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge]] to issue cheap reprints for the rising middle class.   But whereas Paley's natural theology was disassembled or rebuilt by intellectuals like Wakley or the Bridgewater authors, the core of argument retained an ongoing popularity with the reading public and served as the basis of many catechisms and textbooks that were used in Britain and its colonies until World War II when, as argued by [[Matthew Daniel Eddy]], the existential morass of World War I undermined the moral teleology that had underpinned natural theology since the Enlightenment.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |title=Nineteenth Century Natural Theology |journal=Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology |year=2013 |pages=101\u2013117 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1539597}}</ref>\n\nToday, Paley's name evokes both reverence and revulsion and his work is cited accordingly by authors seeking to frame their own views of design. Even [[Richard Dawkins]], an opponent of the ''design argument'', described himself as a ''neo-Paleyan'' in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. Today, as in his own time (though for different reasons), Paley is a controversial figure, a lightning rod for both sides in the contemporary argument between creationism and evolutionary biology.  His writings reflect the thought of his time, but as Dawkins observed, his was a strong and logical approach to evidence, whether human or natural. Perhaps this explains why the Oxford constitutional theorist [[A.V. Dicey]] had his pupils read the ''Evidences'' to teach them about legal reasoning. It is for such reasons that Paley's writings, ''Natural Theology'' included, stand as a notable body of work in the canon of Western thought.\n\n==Works==\n\n* ''The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'', 1785\n* ''Horae Paulinae, or the Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul'', 1790\n* ''View of the Evidences of Christianity'', 1794 \n* {{citation | author= Paley, William | year = 1809 | title =Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity\n | edition =12th | location = London | publisher = J.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined castle by the river and a stretch of wall that linked South, East and original North Gates, the last known as Inner North Gate and now well within the city, still survived. From South to East Gates the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Herbert's army in February, and then the fall of Bristol, prompted the hurried reinforcement of the exsting defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from South Gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to Outer North Gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This third, easternmost channel of the River Severn was filled in in the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate street, from where it was extended across the Old Severn to the east channel of the River Severn just above West Gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at Inner North Gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The Outer North Gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline, while what the Town Regiment lacked in experience it made up for with a motivation rooted in ties to the city it was defending. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's impossible to know if Massey genuinely considered surrender or whether it was a ruse to buy time.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 71\u2013</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. Troops were paid, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nOn 10 August, the Royalist army arrived at Gloucester and promptly demanded that Colonel [[Edward Massey]] surrender. Massey refused and Royalist forces began digging in and setting up artillery batteries around the south and east gates of the city and severed or diverted water pipes. The defenders burned houses and other obstacles outside the city walls. The bombardment of the city began.\n\nHowever, over the next days, the defenders made several sallies from the gates, attacking and disabling Royalist artillery, taking prisoners and tools. Breaches in the wall were filled with cannon baskets and wool sacks. The Royalists made attempts to drain the city moat and fill it in at places.\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined castle by the river and a stretch of wall that linked South, East and original North Gates, the last known as Inner North Gate and now well within the city, still survived. From South to East Gates the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Herbert's army in February, and then the fall of Bristol, prompted the hurried reinforcement of the exsting defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from South Gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to Outer North Gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This third, easternmost channel of the River Severn was filled in in the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate street, from where it was extended across the Old Severn to the east channel of the River Severn just above West Gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at Inner North Gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The Outer North Gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline, while what the Town Regiment lacked in experience it made up for with a motivation rooted in ties to the city it was defending. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member common council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's impossible to know if Massey genuinely considered surrender or whether it was a ruse to buy time.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 71\u2013</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. Troops were paid, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nOn 10 August, the Royalist army arrived at Gloucester and promptly demanded that Colonel [[Edward Massey]] surrender. Massey refused and Royalist forces began digging in and setting up artillery batteries around the south and east gates of the city and severed or diverted water pipes. The defenders burned houses and other obstacles outside the city walls. The bombardment of the city began.\n\nHowever, over the next days, the defenders made several sallies from the gates, attacking and disabling Royalist artillery, taking prisoners and tools. Breaches in the wall were filled with cannon baskets and wool sacks. The Royalists made attempts to drain the city moat and fill it in at places.\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

It had its world premiere at [[Fantastic Fest]] in September 2018. The film began streaming on [[Netflix]] on 12 October 2018. It has received positive reviews from critics for its visuals, cinematography, performances, and unique blend of horror genres.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1905, Thomas Richardson travels to a remote [[Wales|Welsh]] island to rescue his sister, Jennifer, who has been kidnapped and held for ransom by a mysterious cult. Posing as a convert to the cult, Thomas arrives and encounters the leader, Malcolm Howe, who founded the cult with two other convicts, Frank and Quinn. They claim that the previously barren island was rendered fertile through [[sacrifice|blood sacrifice]]. Each member of the cult keeps a jar for regular [[bloodletting]]. Thomas also discovers teenagers Jeremy and Ffion \u2013 son of Frank and daughter of Quinn, respectively \u2013 sneaking home after a [[wiki: tryst|tryst]]. He forces Jeremy to admit that Jennifer, who Malcolm is presenting to cult members as a captured spy, was kidnapped for ransom, as the cult does not have the resources to pay for the continuous animal sacrifices needed to maintain the island's fertility. \n\nMalcolm suspects an infiltrator among the newcomers and questions them. One of the men attempts to assassinate Malcolm, but Thomas intervenes and is badly wounded during the ordeal. Malcolm promptly has him treated by his daughter Andrea and promises that his loyalty will be rewarded. The same night, Malcolm parades Jennifer through the village, claiming she is a traitor and will be killed if her co-conspirator does not come forward. Thomas accesses a tunnel underneath Malcolm's house and flees from what appears to be an old woman who chases him. He escapes to a beach cave covered in markings, indicating the presence of a deity on the island. Malcolm visits a barn where the old woman who is, in fact, the island's deity, is imprisoned in tree roots; he reprimands her for appearing to Thomas before feeding her his blood, causing the vegetation imprisoning her to bloom. Andrea finds Thomas in the cave and offers to help him. He tells her that he was a [[Christians|Christian]] [[Christian mission|missionary]] who was persecuted in [[Peking]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] for [[Protestant missions in China|introducing Christianity to China]], and has lost his faith as a result. She takes him to a shack in a wheat field to hide.\n\nFfion and Jeremy meet in her home, where she reveals that she is pregnant and the pair decide to elope. Jeremy briefly leaves and returns to find that Quinn has murdered Ffion in a [[forced abortion]]. Jeremy stabs Quinn before fleeing through the field, where guards capture and return him; Thomas and Andrea follow them back. Quinn frames Jeremy for Ffion's murder and uses a \"purification\" ritual to murder him with a [[Crank (mechanism)|hand crank]] in front of the islanders. When Malcolm and Frank return and challenge him, Quinn calls Malcolm a false prophet and demands that he prove himself by killing Thomas. Frank, enraged by the death of his son, attacks Quinn, allowing Thomas to escape.\n\nFrank and Thomas flee through the forest and eventually arrive at the barn where The Goddess is being held. Frank enters, intent on killing The Goddess, but is killed by a masked figure, The Grinder, who Thomas witnesses force-feeding Frank's blood to The Goddess. Sneaking past The Grinder, he finds Jennifer alive but strung up in a sack. As he releases her, he is knocked unconscious. When he awakens, he finds himself tethered to a meat grinding table by hooks embedded into his hands and legs. Thomas escapes and kills The Grinder but not before the device mangles his hand.\n\nQuinn reveals to a captive Jennifer and Andrea that he imprisoned The Goddess after he and Malcolm realised her powers. He tells the women that he will repeatedly impregnate them and use their offspring as blood sacrifices. Meanwhile, The Goddess shows Thomas her history with the cult, and begs him to set her free \u2013 he grants her wish by [[Death by burning|immolating]] her. The rest of the village catches fire and the villagers begin to flee to boats. Thomas tracks down Quinn and his captives. The three of them eventually overpower and kill Quinn, but not before Thomas sustains several stab wounds. He collapses, bidding Jennifer and Andrea farewell as they escape by boat, also asking them to pray for him. His faith restored, Thomas is discovered by an injured Malcolm. The two stare out over the hilltop at the boats departing, both smiling in relief.

It had its world premiere at [[Fantastic Fest]] in September 2018. The film began streaming on [[Netflix]] on 12 October 2018. It has received positive reviews from critics for its visuals, cinematography, performances, and unique blend of horror genres.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1905, Thomas Richardson travels to a remote [[Wales|Welsh]] island to rescue his sister, Jennifer, who has been kidnapped and held for ransom by a mysterious cult. Posing as a convert to the cult, Thomas arrives and encounters the leader, Malcolm Howe, who founded the cult with two other convicts, Frank and Quinn. They claim that the previously barren island was rendered fertile through [[sacrifice|blood sacrifice]]. Each member of the cult keeps a jar for regular [[bloodletting]]. Thomas also discovers teenagers Jeremy and Ffion \u2013 son of Frank and daughter of Quinn, respectively \u2013 sneaking home after a [[wikt:tryst|tryst]]. He forces Jeremy to admit that Jennifer, who Malcolm is presenting to cult members as a captured spy, was kidnapped for ransom, as the cult does not have the resources to pay for the continuous animal sacrifices needed to maintain the island's fertility. \n\nMalcolm suspects an infiltrator among the newcomers and questions them. One of the men attempts to assassinate Malcolm, but Thomas intervenes and is badly wounded during the ordeal. Malcolm promptly has him treated by his daughter Andrea and promises that his loyalty will be rewarded. The same night, Malcolm parades Jennifer through the village, claiming she is a traitor and will be killed if her co-conspirator does not come forward. Thomas accesses a tunnel underneath Malcolm's house and flees from what appears to be an old woman who chases him. He escapes to a beach cave covered in markings, indicating the presence of a deity on the island. Malcolm visits a barn where the old woman who is, in fact, the island's deity, is imprisoned in tree roots; he reprimands her for appearing to Thomas before feeding her his blood, causing the vegetation imprisoning her to bloom. Andrea finds Thomas in the cave and offers to help him. He tells her that he was a [[Christians|Christian]] [[Christian mission|missionary]] who was persecuted in [[Peking]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] for [[Protestant missions in China|introducing Christianity to China]], and has lost his faith as a result. She takes him to a shack in a wheat field to hide.\n\nFfion and Jeremy meet in her home, where she reveals that she is pregnant and the pair decide to elope. Jeremy briefly leaves and returns to find that Quinn has murdered Ffion in a [[forced abortion]]. Jeremy stabs Quinn before fleeing through the field, where guards capture and return him; Thomas and Andrea follow them back. Quinn frames Jeremy for Ffion's murder and uses a \"purification\" ritual to murder him with a [[Crank (mechanism)|hand crank]] in front of the islanders. When Malcolm and Frank return and challenge him, Quinn calls Malcolm a false prophet and demands that he prove himself by killing Thomas. Frank, enraged by the death of his son, attacks Quinn, allowing Thomas to escape.\n\nFrank and Thomas flee through the forest and eventually arrive at the barn where The Goddess is being held. Frank enters, intent on killing The Goddess, but is killed by a masked figure, The Grinder, who Thomas witnesses force-feeding Frank's blood to The Goddess. Sneaking past The Grinder, he finds Jennifer alive but strung up in a sack. As he releases her, he is knocked unconscious. When he awakens, he finds himself tethered to a meat grinding table by hooks embedded into his hands and legs. Thomas escapes and kills The Grinder but not before the device mangles his hand.\n\nQuinn reveals to a captive Jennifer and Andrea that he imprisoned The Goddess after he and Malcolm realised her powers. He tells the women that he will repeatedly impregnate them and use their offspring as blood sacrifices. Meanwhile, The Goddess shows Thomas her history with the cult, and begs him to set her free \u2013 he grants her wish by [[Death by burning|immolating]] her. The rest of the village catches fire and the villagers begin to flee to boats. Thomas tracks down Quinn and his captives. The three of them eventually overpower and kill Quinn, but not before Thomas sustains several stab wounds. He collapses, bidding Jennifer and Andrea farewell as they escape by boat, also asking them to pray for him. His faith restored, Thomas is discovered by an injured Malcolm. The two stare out over the hilltop at the boats departing, both smiling in relief.  As Thomas bleeds onto the ground, the vegetation around him begins to grow and infuse itself within Thomas\u2019s body.  As this occurs, Thomas\u2019s eyes begin to turn into the same shape and colour as the goddess's, signifying his rebirth as the new guardian of the island.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dan Stevens]] as Thomas Richardson, Jennifer's brother who sets out to rescue her\n*[[Michael Sheen]] as Malcolm Howe, the leader of an island cult\n*[[Mark Lewis Jones]] as Quinn, Malcolm's second-in-command and Ffion's father\n*[[Paul Higgins (actor)|Paul Higgins]] as Frank, a founder of the cult and Jeremy's father\n*[[Lucy Boynton]] as Andrea Howe, Malcolm's daughter\n*[[Bill Milner]] as Jeremy, Frank's son and Ffion's lover\n*[[Kristine Froseth]] as Ffion, Quinn's daughter and Jeremy's lover\n*[[Elen Rhys]] as Jennifer Richardson, Thomas' sister who has been kidnapped by Malcolm's cult\n*[[Sharon Morgan]] as Her, the cult's goddess\n*Sebastian McCheyne as The Grinder, a bloodied humanoid creature and keeper of Her\n\n[[Ross O'Hennessy]] and [[Gareth Pierce]] appear as unnamed cultists.\n\n==Production==\nOn 2 November 2016, it was announced that [[Gareth Evans (director)|Gareth Evans]] was working on a new project that he would write and direct.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ford |first1=Rebecca |last2=Kit |first2=Borys |url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/raid-director-gareth-evans-helm-period-thriller-apostle-943417 |title='The Raid' Director Gareth Evans to Helm Period Thriller 'Apostle' (Exclusive) |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2 November 2016 |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> [[Dan Stevens]] was confirmed to be cast in the lead role.<ref>{{cite news |last=Justin |first=Kroll |url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/apostle-dan-stevens-gareth-evans-1201907469/|title=Dan Stevens to Star in Gareth Evans Thriller \u2018Apostle\u2019 (EXCLUSIVE) |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=3 November 2016 |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> In March 2017, the film was picked up by [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Colbert  |first=Stephen M. |url=http://screenrant.com/netflix-gareth-evans-revenge-thriller-apostle/ |title=Apostle: Netflix Grabs Revenge Thriller From The Raid Director |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=28 March 2017 |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> Later that month, it was announced that [[Michael Sheen]], [[Lucy Boynton]], [[Bill Milner]] and [[Kristine Froseth]] had joined the cast.<ref>{{cite news |last1=N'Duka  |first1=Amanda |url=https://deadline.com/2017/03/netflix-nabs-gareth-evans-apostle-michael-sheen-lucy-boynton-1202053765/|title=Netflix Nabs Gareth Evans\u2019 \u2018Apostle\u2019; Michael Sheen, Lucy Boynton, Kristine Froseth & More Round Cast |magazine=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=28 March 2017 |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref> Filming started in April 2017.<ref>{{cite web |last=Nordine |first=Michael |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/05/apostle-photo-plot-details-gareth-evans-1201813367/|title=Dan Stevens to Star in Gareth Evans Thriller \u2018Apostle\u2019 |date=6 May 2017 |publisher=[[IndieWire]] |accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref> The film was largely shot on a set built at [[Margam Park]] in [[Neath Port Talbot]], [[Wales]].<ref name=\"walesonline\">{{cite web|last1=Bevan |first1=Nathan |title=Michael Sheen's terrifying horror Apostle is now on Netflix |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/michael-sheens-wales-set-horror-15271029 |publisher=[[WalesOnline]] |date=12 October 2018 |accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at [[Fantastic Fest]] in September 2018.<ref>{{cite web |author=Dino-Ray Ramos |date=31 July 2018 |title=Fantastic Fest 2018 Sets \u2018Overlord\u2019, \u2018Apostle\u2019, & \u2018The Night Comes For Us\u2019 In First Wave Of Programming |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/fantastic-fest-2018-overlord-apostle-the-night-comes-for-us-first-wave-1202436895/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> It began streaming on [[Netflix]] on 12 October 2018.<ref>{{cite web |first=Brad |last=Miska |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3513046/join-gareth-evans-apostle-cult-october-netflix/ |title=Join Gareth Evans\u2019 \u2018Apostle\u2019 Cult This October on Netflix! |website=[[Bloody-Disgusting.com]] |date=31 July 2018 |accessdate=31 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a rating of 80%, based on 66 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 6.71/10.
