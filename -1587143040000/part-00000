They are also known for their [[digital audio workstation]] program [[FL Studio]]<ref name=\"musik\"/> and related [[audio plugin|audio plugins]] such as [[Sytrus]]<ref name=\"sytrus\"/> and [[Harmor]].<ref name=\"Harmor\"/> Image-Line was founded in 1994.<ref name=\"Image-Line Company Page\"/> In 2007, Image-Line introduced [[Deckadance]], a virtual DJ console application.<ref name=\"musik\"/> The company also produced [[EZGenerator]], a template-based [[web development|web editing]] program.<ref name=\"awardsez\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early development===\nImage-Line was founded by Jean-Marie Cannie and Frank Van Biesen, who after seven years of creating [[stock market]] software for Pavell Software, decided in 1992 to branch into [[video games]]. Their first product was an [[adult video game]] of ''[[Tetris]]'', which they then offered on [[floppy disks]] in the ad section of ''Computer Magazine''. Around this time [[CD-ROM]] games such as [[The 7th Guest]] were becoming popular, inspiring Van Biesen and Cannie to begin working with Private, one of the larger producers of adult video games at the time. Private released multiple Image-Line CD-ROM games including ''Private Prison'' and ''Private Castle''.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> The company officially adopted the name Image-Line in 1994.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\n===Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin===\nAround the time they released the games for Private, [[IBM]] launched the \"Da Vinci\" contest where the first prizes were color laptops. Image-Line, which at the time had little money, won the contest in the multimedia category after reworking one of their game environments to fit the contest criteria.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nImage-Line took an interest in Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin, the developer who won the overall Da Vinci contest as well as the Game category. They hired the 19-year-old to work for them, and his first game for the company was the game ''Private Investigator.'' <ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> Dambrin's next project for Image-Line was the platform game ''Eat This'',<ref name=\"eat this\"/>  a [[shoot 'em up]] game that involved killing aliens.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nOther Image-Line developers created products such as the [[invoice|invoicing]] program Fact2000 and E-OfficeDirect, a content-based web tool that would a precursor to their later product [[EZGenerator]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> Image-Line also topped the Belgian game charts 4 years in a row with their CD version of the Belgian TV [[game show]] ''[[Blokken]].''<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\n===Audio software===\nIn 1997 Dambrin gained an interest in music applications of the time such as Hammerhead and Rebirth 338, and developed a simple [[MIDI]]-only [[drum machine]] in an effort to merge the two products into a [[step sequencer]] that utilized both rows and steps. Dubbed FruityLoops 1.0, the program didn't fit with Image-Line's other product lines of the time. However, the demo version released in December 1997 became so popular that the number of downloads quickly overwhelmed the Image-Line servers.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> To gather income to support their servers, Image-Line had Dambrin develop an [[EJay]] clone called FruityTracks. Image-Line then served as the program's [[OEM]] for [[Mattel]]. The program was released as Pro-DJ in [[France]] and the [[UK]], and Radio 538 Music Machine in The [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\nImage-Line continued to develop the FruityLoops application from a simple [[drum machine]] into a large and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FruityLoops was eventually renamed [[FL Studio]] for branding purposes and to avoid a prolonged trademark dispute in the [[United States]] with [[Kelloggs]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> FL Studio is now one of the most popular software production systems in the world, and Image-Line's flagship program.<ref name=\"musik\"/> A multitude of [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s have been developed by Image-Line to work with FL Studio, including [[synthesizers]] such as [[Sytrus]] and [[Audio signal processing|effects]] [[plugins]] such as Maximus and Edison.<ref name=\"musik\"/> In 2007 Image-Line released [[Deckadance]], a [[DJ]] [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] program developed by programmer [[Arguru]]. Deckadance works as both a stand-alone program and as a FL Studio plugin.\n\n===Other software===\nBeyond audio products, Image-Line developed and distributed [[EZGenerator]], a software program for website design and maintenance. EZGenerator has won multiple awards since its release.<ref name=\"awardsez\"/>\n\n==Products==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:left;\"\n|-\n! Software\n! Release\n!

[[web development|web editing]] program.<ref name=\"awardsez\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early development===\nImage-Line was founded by Jean-Marie Cannie and Frank Van Biesen, who after seven years of creating [[stock market]] software for Pavell Software, decided in 1992 to branch into [[video games]]. Their first product was an [[adult video game]] of ''[[Tetris]]'', which they then offered on [[floppy disks]] in the ad section of ''Computer Magazine''. Around this time [[CD-ROM]] games such as [[The 7th Guest]] were becoming popular, inspiring Van Biesen and Cannie to begin working with Private, one of the larger producers of adult video games at the time. Private released multiple Image-Line CD-ROM games including ''Private Prison'' and ''Private Castle''.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> The company officially adopted the name Image-Line in 1994.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\n===Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin===\nAround the time they released the games for Private, [[IBM]] launched the \"Da Vinci\" contest where the first prizes were color laptops. Image-Line, which at the time had little money, won the contest in the multimedia category after reworking one of their game environments to fit the contest criteria.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nImage-Line took an interest in Didier \"Gol\" Dambrin, the developer who won the overall Da Vinci contest as well as the Game category. They hired the 19-year-old to work for them, and his first game for the company was the game ''Private Investigator.'' <ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/> Dambrin's next project for Image-Line was the platform game ''Eat This'',<ref name=\"eat this\"/>  a [[shoot 'em up]] game that involved killing aliens.<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nOther Image-Line developers created products such as the [[invoice|invoicing]] program Fact2000 and E-OfficeDirect, a content-based web tool that would a precursor to their later product [[EZGenerator]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> Image-Line also topped the Belgian game charts 4 years in a row with their CD version of the Belgian TV [[game show]] ''[[Blokken]].''<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/><ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\n===Audio software===\nIn 1997 Dambrin gained an interest in music applications of the time such as Hammerhead and Rebirth 338, and developed a simple [[MIDI]]-only [[drum machine]] in an effort to merge the two products into a [[step sequencer]] that utilized both rows and steps. Dubbed FruityLoops 1.0, the program didn't fit with Image-Line's other product lines of the time. However, the demo version released in December 1997 became so popular that the number of downloads quickly overwhelmed the Image-Line servers.<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> To gather income to support their servers, Image-Line had Dambrin develop an [[EJay]] clone called FruityTracks. Image-Line then served as the program's [[OEM]] for [[Mattel]]. The program was released as Pro-DJ in [[France]] and the [[UK]], and Radio 538 Music Machine in The [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/>\n\nImage-Line continued to develop the FruityLoops application from a simple [[drum machine]] into a large and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FruityLoops was eventually renamed [[FL Studio]] for branding purposes and to avoid a prolonged trademark dispute in the [[United States]] with [[Kelloggs]].<ref name=\"imagelinehistory\"/> FL Studio is now one of the most popular software production systems in the world, and Image-Line's flagship program.<ref name=\"musik\"/> A multitude of [[plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s have been developed by Image-Line to work with FL Studio, including [[synthesizers]] such as [[Sytrus]] and [[Audio signal processing|effects]] [[plugins]] such as Maximus and Edison.<ref name=\"musik\"/> In 2007 Image-Line released [[Deckadance]], a [[DJ]] [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] program developed by programmer [[Arguru]]. Deckadance works as both a stand-alone program and as a FL Studio plugin.\n\n===Other software===\nBeyond audio products, Image-Line developed and distributed [[EZGenerator]], a software program for website design and maintenance. EZGenerator has won multiple awards since its release.<ref name=\"awardsez\"/>\n\n==Products==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:left;\"\n|-\n! Software\n! Release\n!

He synthesised ureastibamine (carbostibamide) in 1922 and determined that it was an effective substitute for the other antimony-containing compounds in the treatment of kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis) which is caused by a protozoan, Leishmania donovani.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nWhen people develop visceral leishmaniasis, the most typical symptoms are [[fever]] and the [[splenomegaly|enlargement of the spleen]], with [[hepatomegaly|enlargement of the liver]] sometimes being seen as well. The blackening of the skin that gave the disease its common name in India does not appear in most strains of the disease, and the other symptoms are very easy to mistake for those of [[malaria]]. Misdiagnosis is dangerous, as without proper treatment the mortality rate for kala-azar is close to 100%. ''L. donovani'' itself is not usually the direct cause of death in kala-azar sufferers, however. [[Pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[dysentery]] are omnipresent in the immuno-depressed regions where leishmaniasis thrives, and, as with [[AIDS]], it is these [[opportunistic infection]]s that are more likely to kill, flaring up in a host whose immune system has been weakened by the ''L. donovani'' infection. Progress of the disease is extremely variable, taking anywhere from one to twenty weeks, but a typical duration for the Sudanese strain of the disease is narrower, between twelve and sixteen weeks.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nEven with recovery, kala-azar does not always leave its hosts unmarked. Some time after successful treatment\u2014generally a few months with African kala-azar, or as much as several years with the Indian strain\u2014a secondary form of the disease may set in, called post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, or PKDL. This condition manifests first as small, measle-like skin lesions on the face, which gradually increase in size and spread over the body. Eventually the lesions may coalesce to form disfiguring, swollen structures resembling [[leprosy]], and occasionally causing blindness if they spread to the eyes. (This disease is not the same as [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]], a milder disease caused by another protozoan of the Leishmania genus which also causes skin lesions.)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burza|first=Sakib|last2=Croft|first2=Simon L.|last3=Boelaert|first3=Marleen|date=2018-09-15|title=Leishmaniasis|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31204-2/abstract|journal=The Lancet|language=English|volume=392|issue=10151|pages=951\u2013970|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31204-2|issn=0140-6736|pmid=30126638}}</ref>\n\n==Cause==\nTwo species of ''Leishmania'' are known to give rise to the visceral form of the disease.

The latter parasite (LS) further contained a RNA virus known as Leptomonas seymouri narna-like virus 1 ([[Lepsey NLV1]]). So, it appears that a great majority of kala-azar victims in the Indian subcontinent are exposed to a RNA virus in LS, the co-infecting parasite with LD i.e. the \"LD-LS-Lepsey NLV1 triple pathogen\" phenomenon.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Sukla|first=Soumi|author2=Roy, Syamal |author3=Sundar, Shyam|author4=Biswas, Subhajit | title=Leptomonas seymouri narna-like virus 1 and not leishmaniaviruses detected in kala-azar samples from India | journal=Archives of Virology| volume=162 | issue=12 | pages=3827\u201335 | doi=10.1007/s00705-017-3559-y | year=2017 | pmid=28939968 }}</ref>\n\n===Life cycle===\nThe life cycle of ''Leishmania'' is completed in two hosts, humans and sandflies. The adult female sandfly is a bloodsucker, usually feeding at night on sleeping prey. When the fly bites an individual infected with ''Leishmania'', the pathogen is ingested along with the prey's blood. The [[protozoan]] is in the smaller of its two forms, called an [[amastigote]], which is round, non-motile, and only 3\u20137 micrometers in diameter. Inside the stomach of the sandfly, the amastigotes quickly transform into elongated and motile forms called the [[promastigote]]s. Promastigote is spindle-shaped, triple the size of the amastigote, and has a single [[flagellum]] that allows mobility. The promastigotes live extracellularly in the alimentary canal, reproducing asexually, then migrate to the proximal end of the gut where they become poised for a regurgitational transmission. As the fly bites, the promastigotes are released from the proboscis and introduced locally at the bite site.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sacks|first=DL|title=''Leishmania''-sand fly interactions controlling species-specific vector competence.|journal=Cellular Microbiology|year=2001|volume=3|issue=4|pages=189\u201396|pmid=11298643|doi=10.1046/j.1462-5822.2001.00115.x|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1236490}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ilg|first=T|author2=Stierhof, YD |author3=Wiese, M |author4=McConville, MJ |author5= Overath, P |title=Characterization of phosphoglycan-containing secretory products of Leishmania.|journal=Parasitology|year=1994|volume=108|issue=Suppl|pages=S63-71|pmid=8084657|doi=10.1017/s0031182000075739}}</ref>\n\nOnce inside the human host, promastigotes invade [[macrophages]].

Avoid outdoor activities, especially from dusk to dawn, when sand flies generally are the most active.\n\n2. When outdoors (or in unprotected quarters), minimize the amount of exposed (uncovered) skin to the extent that is tolerable in the climate. Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks; and tuck your shirt into your pants.\n\n3. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin and under the ends of sleeves and pant legs. Follow the instructions on the label of the repellent. The most effective repellents generally are those that contain the chemical DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide).\n\n* Indoors:\n1. Stay in well-screened or air-conditioned areas.\n\n2. Keep in mind that sand flies are much smaller than mosquitoes and therefore can get through smaller holes.\n\n3. Spray living/sleeping areas with an insecticide to kill insects.\n\n4. If you are not sleeping in a well-screened or air-conditioned area, use a bed net and tuck it under your mattress. If possible, use a bed net that has been soaked in or sprayed with a pyrethroid-containing insecticide. The same treatment can be applied to screens, curtains, sheets, and clothing (clothing should be retreated after five washings).\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/prevent.html|title=Parasites-Leishmaniasis Prevention and Control|date=January 10, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Treatments==\nAs with many diseases in developing nations, (including [[trypanosomiasis]] and [[malaria]]) effective and affordable [[chemotherapy]] is sorely lacking and parasites or insect vectors are becoming increasingly resistant to existing anti-parasite drugs.

As they published their discovery almost simultaneously, the species was named for both of them\u2014''Leishmania donovani''. \n\nToday, the name kala-azar is used interchangeably with the scientific name visceral leishmaniasis for the most acute form of the disease caused by ''L. donovani''. The disease is endemic in [[West Bengal]], where it was first discovered, but is seen at its most deadly in north and east Africa. It can also be found throughout the [[Arab]] world and southern Europe (where the causative organism is ''L. infantum''), and a slightly different strain of the pathogen, ''L. chagasi'', is responsible for leishmaniasis in the new world. Several species of [[Canidae|canines]] serve as reservoir hosts of ''L. infantum (chagasi)''.\n\nContemporary life has made itself felt even here, however\u2014not as \"progress\" but in the form of the many small wars of Africa's post-colonial era. In the [[Sudan]], where civil war has been continuous since 1983, the violence has been concentrated in the more populated south, and kala-azar was concentrated there too. But the wars have driven a steady stream of [[refugees]] out of the region, and these traveled either across the southern border or into the remoter western part of the country called the Upper Nile, where both war and the disease that went with it had not yet penetrated.<ref name=\"Jean1995\"/>\n\nThese refugees, moving at foot-speed, carried the disease with them, and when it arrived it hit the Upper Nile with a force comparable to [[smallpox]] hitting the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. The isolated people of the Upper Nile had no access to medicine or education about the new disease among them. Worse, their [[immune system]]s were defenseless against this new pathogen, foreign to them though it came only from another part of their own country. One village at the center of the epidemic, [[Duar]], was left with four survivors out of a population of a thousand, and from the late eighties to the mid-nineties a total of 100,000 succumbed to the sickness in that region alone.

He synthesised ureastibamine (carbostibamide) in 1922 and determined that it was an effective substitute for the other antimony-containing compounds in the treatment of kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis) which is caused by a protozoan, Leishmania donovani.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nWhen people develop visceral leishmaniasis, the most typical symptoms are [[fever]] and the [[splenomegaly|enlargement of the spleen]], with [[hepatomegaly|enlargement of the liver]] sometimes being seen as well. The blackening of the skin that gave the disease its common name in India does not appear in most strains of the disease, and the other symptoms are very easy to mistake for those of [[malaria]]. Misdiagnosis is dangerous, as without proper treatment the mortality rate for kala-azar is close to 100%. ''L. donovani'' itself is not usually the direct cause of death in kala-azar sufferers, however. [[Pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[dysentery]] are omnipresent in the immuno-depressed regions where leishmaniasis thrives, and, as with [[AIDS]], it is these [[opportunistic infection]]s that are more likely to kill, flaring up in a host whose immune system has been weakened by the ''L. donovani'' infection. Progress of the disease is extremely variable, taking anywhere from one to twenty weeks, but a typical duration for the Sudanese strain of the disease is narrower, between twelve and sixteen weeks.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nEven with recovery, kala-azar does not always leave its hosts unmarked. Some time after successful treatment\u2014generally a few months with African kala-azar, or as much as several years with the Indian strain\u2014a secondary form of the disease may set in, called post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, or PKDL. This condition manifests first as small, measle-like skin lesions on the face, which gradually increase in size and spread over the body. Eventually the lesions may coalesce to form disfiguring, swollen structures resembling [[leprosy]], and occasionally causing blindness if they spread to the eyes. (This disease is not the same as [[cutaneous leishmaniasis]], a milder disease caused by another protozoan of the Leishmania genus which also causes skin lesions.)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burza|first=Sakib|last2=Croft|first2=Simon L.|last3=Boelaert|first3=Marleen|date=2018-09-15|title=Leishmaniasis|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31204-2/abstract|journal=The Lancet|language=English|volume=392|issue=10151|pages=951\u2013970|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31204-2|issn=0140-6736|pmid=30126638}}</ref>\n\n==Cause==\nTwo species of ''Leishmania'' are known to give rise to the visceral form of the disease.

The latter parasite (LS) further contained a RNA virus known as Leptomonas seymouri narna-like virus 1 ([[Lepsey NLV1]]).

The adult female sandfly is a bloodsucker, usually feeding at night on sleeping prey. When the fly bites an individual infected with ''Leishmania'', the pathogen is ingested along with the prey's blood. The [[protozoan]] is in the smaller of its two forms, called an [[amastigote]], which is round, non-motile, and only 3\u20137 micrometers in diameter. Inside the stomach of the sandfly, the amastigotes quickly transform into elongated and motile forms called the [[promastigote]]s. Promastigote is spindle-shaped, triple the size of the amastigote, and has a single [[flagellum]] that allows mobility. The promastigotes live extracellularly in the alimentary canal, reproducing asexually, then migrate to the proximal end of the gut where they become poised for a regurgitational transmission. As the fly bites, the promastigotes are released from the proboscis and introduced locally at the bite site.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sacks|first=DL|title=''Leishmania''-sand fly interactions controlling species-specific vector competence.|journal=Cellular Microbiology|year=2001|volume=3|issue=4|pages=189\u201396|pmid=11298643|doi=10.1046/j.1462-5822.2001.00115.x|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1236490}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Ilg|first=T|author2=Stierhof, YD |author3=Wiese, M |author4=McConville, MJ |author5= Overath, P |title=Characterization of phosphoglycan-containing secretory products of Leishmania.|journal=Parasitology|year=1994|volume=108|issue=Suppl|pages=S63-71|pmid=8084657|doi=10.1017/s0031182000075739}}</ref>\n\nOnce inside the human host, promastigotes invade [[macrophages]].

To decrease the risk of being bitten, these precautionary measures are suggested:\n\n* Outdoors:\n1. Avoid outdoor activities, especially from dusk to dawn, when sand flies generally are the most active.\n\n2. When outdoors (or in unprotected quarters), minimize the amount of exposed (uncovered) skin to the extent that is tolerable in the climate. Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks; and tuck your shirt into your pants.\n\n3. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin and under the ends of sleeves and pant legs. Follow the instructions on the label of the repellent. The most effective repellents generally are those that contain the chemical DEET (N,N-diethylmetatoluamide).\n\n* Indoors:\n1. Stay in well-screened or air-conditioned areas.\n\n2. Keep in mind that sand flies are much smaller than mosquitoes and therefore can get through smaller holes.\n\n3. Spray living/sleeping areas with an insecticide to kill insects.\n\n4. If you are not sleeping in a well-screened or air-conditioned area, use a bed net and tuck it under your mattress. If possible, use a bed net that has been soaked in or sprayed with a pyrethroid-containing insecticide. The same treatment can be applied to screens, curtains, sheets, and clothing (clothing should be retreated after five washings).\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/prevent.html|title=Parasites-Leishmaniasis Prevention and Control|date=January 10, 2013|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Treatments==\nAs with many diseases in developing nations, (including [[trypanosomiasis]] and [[malaria]]) effective and affordable [[chemotherapy]] is sorely lacking and parasites or insect vectors are becoming increasingly resistant to existing anti-parasite drugs.

As they published their discovery almost simultaneously, the species was named for both of them\u2014''Leishmania donovani''. \n\nToday, the name kala-azar is used interchangeably with the scientific name visceral leishmaniasis for the most acute form of the disease caused by ''L. donovani''. The disease is endemic in [[West Bengal]], where it was first discovered, but is seen at its most deadly in north and east Africa. It can also be found throughout the [[Arab]] world and southern Europe (where the causative organism is ''L. infantum''), and a slightly different strain of the pathogen, ''L. chagasi'', is responsible for leishmaniasis in the new world. Several species of [[Canidae|canines]] serve as reservoir hosts of ''L. infantum (chagasi)''.\n\nContemporary life has made itself felt even here, however\u2014not as \"progress\" but in the form of the many small wars of Africa's post-colonial era. In the [[Sudan]], where civil war has been continuous since 1983, the violence has been concentrated in the more populated south, and kala-azar was concentrated there too. But the wars have driven a steady stream of [[refugees]] out of the region, and these traveled either across the southern border or into the remoter western part of the country called the Upper Nile, where both war and the disease that went with it had not yet penetrated.<ref name=\"Jean1995\"/>\n\nThese refugees, moving at foot-speed, carried the disease with them, and when it arrived it hit the Upper Nile with a force comparable to [[smallpox]] hitting the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. The isolated people of the Upper Nile had no access to medicine or education about the new disease among them. Worse, their [[immune system]]s were defenseless against this new pathogen, foreign to them though it came only from another part of their own country. One village at the center of the epidemic, [[Duar]], was left with four survivors out of a population of a thousand, and from the late eighties to the mid-nineties a total of 100,000 succumbed to the sickness in that region alone.

Nine contestants were selected to compete in the running of becoming \"America's Next Drag Superstar.\" The first season was filmed during the summer of 2008. The winner of the first season won $5,000 worth of [[MAC Cosmetics]], was featured in an LA Eyeworks campaign, joined the Logo Drag Race tour, and won a cash prize of $20,000. One of the nine contestants to compete on ''RuPaul's Drag Race'', [[Nina Flowers]] was determined by an audience vote via the show's official website. The results were announced in early September 2008.\n\nThe theme song playing during the runway every episode was \"[[Cover Girl (RuPaul song)|Cover Girl]]\" from RuPaul's album ''[[Champion (RuPaul album)|Champion]]''. This season and season one of All-Stars are the only seasons to not feature the \"Snatch Game.\"\n\nThe winner of the first season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' was [[BeBe Zahara Benet]] ; the runner-up was Nina Flowers.\n\nIn late 2013, Logo re-aired the first season, which was titled ''RuPaul's Drag Race: The Lost Season Ru-Vealed'', and featured commentary from RuPaul.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thepub.viacom.com/sites/logopress/Pages/GENTLEMEN.aspx | title = Gentlemen, Re-Start Your Engines...and May the Best Woman Win...Again! | accessdate = August 20, 2013 | last = Shumaker | first = Jason |author2=Jake Slane  | date = August 18, 2013 | work = Logo Press Room | publisher = [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151663349732828\u230a&\"&\"set=a.156472877827.118955.31772462827&type=1&comment_id=9992661&reply_comment_id=9992723&total_comments=15 | title= Callie, dear... | publisher= RuPaul's Drag Race Facebook page | date = September 23, 2013 | accessdate = September 29, 2013 | quote=Callie, dear...}}</ref> \n\n[[Nina Flowers]], [[Shannel]], and [[Tammie Brown]] competed on the [[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars|All Stars]]''. Nina and Tammie placed 9/10th overall together, while Shannel placed 3rd/4th with [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|season 2]] contestant [[Jujubee (drag queen)|Jujubee]].\n\nIn the premiere episode of the [[RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars (season 3)|third season]] of ''All Stars'', Benet was announced as the surprise tenth contestant. This made Benet the first winner of a regular ''Drag Race'' season to compete again. Benet placed 3rd/4th overall along with [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 2)|season 2]] and [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 3)|season 3]] contestant [[Shangela]].\n\n==Contestants==\n{{See also|List of RuPaul's Drag Race contestants}}\n''(Ages and names stated are at time of contest)''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

The winner of the first season won $5,000 worth of [[MAC Cosmetics]], was featured in an LA Eyeworks campaign, joined the Logo Drag Race tour, and won a cash prize of $20,000. One of the nine contestants to compete on ''RuPaul's Drag Race'', [[Nina Flowers]] was determined by an audience vote via the show's official website. The results were announced in early September 2008.\n\nThe theme song playing during the runway every episode was \"[[Cover Girl (RuPaul song)|Cover Girl]]\" from RuPaul's album ''[[Champion (RuPaul album)|Champion]]''.
