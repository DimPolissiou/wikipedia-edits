The use of [[live electronic music]] greatly expanded in the 1950s, along with the use of [[electric guitar]] and bass. With the advent of new technologies in the 1960s, electronic genres such as [[electronic rock]], [[electronic jazz]], [[disco]], [[computer music]], [[synthpop]], [[psychedelic rock]] and [[ambient music]] followed, with large [[free festival]]s showcasing the sounds into the 1970s. There has been a significant change in the capabilities of [[amplifiers]], [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]s, and mixing [[synthesizers]] since 1980, as well as computers and [[digital audio workstations]]. This has given electronic musicians and DJs the ability to mix elaborate and complicated music in forms such as [[techno]], [[electronica]], [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]], [[trance music|trance]], [[house music|house]], and [[industrial music|industrial]], all of which have large festivals, [[rave]]s, [[technoparade]]s, [[algorave]]s, [[doof]]s, or [[teknival]]s in their sole dedication.\n\n==Related lists, categories, and media==\n{{See also|Category:Lists of electronic music festivals}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left;font-size:95%;\"\n|+ \n!

The use of [[live electronic music]] greatly expanded in the 1950s, along with the use of [[electric guitar]] and bass. With the advent of new technologies in the 1960s, electronic genres such as [[electronic rock]], [[electronic jazz]], [[disco]], [[computer music]], [[synthpop]], [[psychedelic rock]] and [[ambient music]] followed, with large [[free festival]]s showcasing the sounds into the 1970s. There has been a significant change in the capabilities of [[amplifiers]], [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]s, and mixing [[synthesizers]] since 1980, as well as computers and [[digital audio workstations]]. This has given electronic musicians and DJs the ability to mix elaborate and complicated music in forms such as [[techno]], [[electronica]], [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]], [[trance music|trance]], [[house music|house]], and [[industrial music|industrial]], all of which have large festivals, [[rave]]s, [[technoparade]]s, [[algorave]]s, [[doof]]s, or [[teknival]]s in their sole dedication.\n\n==Related lists, categories, and media==\n{{See also|Category:Lists of electronic music festivals}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left;font-size:95%;\"\n|+ \n!
