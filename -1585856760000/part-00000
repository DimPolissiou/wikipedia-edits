Those considerations that are selected by the agent as having a more than negligible bearing on the decision then figure in a reasoning process, and if the agent is in the main reasonable, those considerations ultimately serve as predictors and explicators of the agent's final decision.<ref>''Brainstorms'', p. 295</ref>}}\n\nWhile other philosophers have developed two-stage models, including [[William James]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], [[Arthur Compton]], and [[Henry Margenau]], Dennett defends this model for the following reasons:\n\n{{quote|\n# First ... The intelligent selection, rejection, and weighing of the considerations that do occur to the subject is a matter of intelligence making the difference.\n# Second, I think it installs indeterminism in the right place for the libertarian, if there is a right place at all.\n# Third ... from the point of view of biological engineering, it is just more efficient and in the end more rational that decision making should occur in this way.\n# A fourth observation in favor of the model is that it permits moral education to make a difference, without making all of the difference.\n# Fifth\u2014and I think this is perhaps the most important thing to be said in favor of this model\u2014it provides some account of our important intuition that we are the authors of our moral decisions.\n# Finally, the model I propose points to the multiplicity of decisions that encircle our moral decisions and suggests that in many cases our ultimate decision as to which way to act is less important phenomenologically as a contributor to our sense of free will than the prior decisions affecting our deliberation process itself: the decision, for instance, not to consider any further, to terminate deliberation; or the decision to ignore certain lines of inquiry.\n}}\n\n{{quote|These prior and subsidiary decisions contribute, I think, to our sense of ourselves as responsible free agents, roughly in the following way: I am faced with an important decision to make, and after a certain amount of deliberation, I say to myself: \"That's enough. I've considered this matter enough and now I'm going to act,\" in the full knowledge that I could have considered further, in the full knowledge that the eventualities may prove that I decided in error, but with the acceptance of responsibility in any case.<ref>''Brainstorms'', pp. 295\u201397</ref>}}\n\nLeading libertarian philosophers such as [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]] have rejected Dennett's model, specifically that random chance is directly involved in a decision, on the basis that they believe this eliminates the agent's motives and reasons, [[Moral character|character]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], and feelings and [[Desire (emotion)|desires]]. They claim that, if chance is the primary cause of decisions, then agents cannot be liable for resultant actions. Kane says:\n\n{{quote|[As Dennett admits,] a causal indeterminist view of this deliberative kind does not give us everything libertarians have wanted from free will. For [the agent] does not have complete control over what chance images and other thoughts enter his mind or influence his deliberation. They simply come as they please. [The agent] does have some control ''after'' the chance considerations have occurred.}}\n{{quote|But then there is no more chance involved. What happens from then on, how he reacts, is ''determined'' by desires and beliefs he already has. So it appears that he does not have control in the ''libertarian'' sense of what happens after the chance considerations occur as well. Libertarians require more than this for full responsibility and free will.<ref>Robert Kane, ''A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will'', Oxford (2005) pp. 64\u20135</ref>}}\n\n===Philosophy of mind===\nDennett has remarked in several places (such as \"Self-portrait\", in ''Brainchildren'') that his overall philosophical project has remained largely the same since his time at Oxford. He is primarily concerned with providing a philosophy of mind that is grounded in [[empirical]] research. In his original [[Thesis|dissertation]], ''Content and Consciousness'', he broke up the problem of explaining the mind into the need for a theory of content and for a theory of consciousness. His approach to this project has also stayed true to this distinction. Just as ''Content and Consciousness'' has a bipartite structure, he similarly divided ''Brainstorms'' into two sections. He would later collect several essays on content in ''The [[Intentional stance|Intentional Stance]]'' and synthesize his views on consciousness into a unified theory in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''. These volumes respectively form the most extensive development of his views.<ref>{{citation |last=Guttenplan |first=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Guttenplan |title=A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1994 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/companiontophilo0000unse/page/642 642] |isbn=0-631-19996-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/companiontophilo0000unse/page/642 }}</ref>\n\nIn chapter 5 of ''Consciousness Explained'' Dennett describes his [[multiple drafts model]] of consciousness. He states that, \"all varieties of perception\u2014indeed all varieties of thought or mental activity\u2014are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous 'editorial revision.'\" (p.&nbsp;111). Later he asserts, \"These yield, over the course of time, something ''rather like'' a narrative stream or sequence, which can be thought of as subject to continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain, ...\" (p.&nbsp;135, emphasis in the original).\n\nIn this work, Dennett's interest in the ability of evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this has since become an integral part of his program. He defends a theory known by some as [[Neural Darwinism]]. He also presents an argument against [[qualia]]; he argues that the [[concept]] is so confused that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of [[physicalism]]. His strategy mirrors his teacher Ryle's approach of redefining first person phenomena in third person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.\n\nDennett self-identifies with a few terms:\n{{quote|[Others] note that my \"avoidance of the standard philosophical terminology for discussing such matters\" often creates problems for me; philosophers have a hard time figuring out what I am saying and what I am denying. My refusal to play ball with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless\u2014a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors.<ref>Daniel Dennett, ''The Message is: There is no Medium''</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Consciousness Explained'', he affirms \"I am a sort of '[[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|teleofunctionalist]]', of course, perhaps the original teleofunctionalist\". He goes on to say, \"I am ready to come out of the closet as some sort of [[Verificationism|verificationist]]\".(page 460-461)\n\n===Evolutionary debate===\nMuch of Dennett's work since the 1990s has been concerned with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from what distinguishes human minds from animal minds (''Kinds of Minds''), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist view of the world (''[[Freedom Evolves]]'').\n\nDennett sees evolution by natural selection as an [[algorithm]]ic process (though he spells out that algorithms as simple as [[long division]] often incorporate a significant degree of [[randomness]]).<ref>p. 52-60, ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life'' (Simon & Schuster; reprint edition 1996) ({{ISBN|0-684-82471-X}})</ref> This idea is in conflict with the evolutionary philosophy of [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who preferred to stress the \"pluralism\" of evolution (i.e., its dependence on many crucial factors, of which natural selection is only one).\n\nDennett's views on evolution are identified as being strongly [[Adaptationism|adaptationist]], in line with his theory of the [[intentional stance]], and the evolutionary views of [[biologist]] Richard Dawkins. In ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', Dennett showed himself even more willing than Dawkins to defend adaptationism in print, devoting an entire chapter to a criticism of the ideas of Gould. This stems from Gould's long-running public debate with [[E.&nbsp;O. Wilson]] and other evolutionary biologists over human [[sociobiology]] and its descendant [[evolutionary psychology]], which Gould and [[Richard Lewontin]] opposed, but which Dennett advocated, together with Dawkins and [[Steven Pinker]].<ref>Although Dennett has expressed criticism of human sociobiology, calling it a form of \"[[greedy reductionism]]\", he is generally sympathetic towards the explanations proposed by [[evolutionary psychology]]. Gould also is not one sided, and writes: \"Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of [[inclusive fitness]] and [[kin selection]] to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism\u2014previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior. . . . Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply.\" Gould, 1980.

He rejects the idea of the [[naturalistic fallacy]] as the idea that ethics is in some free-floating realm, writing that the fallacy is to rush from facts to values.\n\nIn his 2006 book, ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'', Dennett attempts to account for religious belief naturalistically, explaining possible evolutionary reasons for the phenomenon of religious adherence.\nIn this book he declares himself to be \"[[Brights movement|a bright]]\", and defends the term.\n\nHe has been doing research into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found what he called a \"don't ask, don't tell\" conspiracy because believers did not want to hear of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but they did not want to lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual.<ref name=\"Dennett2010\">[https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/Preachers_who_are_not_believers.pdf], \"Preachers Who Are Not Believers,\" Evolutionary Psychology, Vol. 8, Issue 1, March 2010, pp. 122\u201350, ({{ISSN|1474-7049}}).</ref> The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics.<ref>[http://traffic.libsyn.com/ffrf/FTradio_247_011511.mp3 Podcast: interview with Daniel Dennett.

Those considerations that are selected by the agent as having a more than negligible bearing on the decision then figure in a reasoning process, and if the agent is in the main reasonable, those considerations ultimately serve as predictors and explicators of the agent's final decision.<ref>''Brainstorms'', p. 295</ref>}}\n\nWhile other philosophers have developed two-stage models, including [[William James]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], [[Arthur Compton]], and [[Henry Margenau]], Dennett defends this model for the following reasons:\n\n{{quote|\n# First ... The intelligent selection, rejection, and weighing of the considerations that do occur to the subject is a matter of intelligence making the difference.\n# Second, I think it installs indeterminism in the right place for the libertarian, if there is a right place at all.\n# Third ... from the point of view of biological engineering, it is just more efficient and in the end more rational that decision making should occur in this way.\n# A fourth observation in favor of the model is that it permits moral education to make a difference, without making all of the difference.\n# Fifth\u2014and I think this is perhaps the most important thing to be said in favor of this model\u2014it provides some account of our important intuition that we are the authors of our moral decisions.\n# Finally, the model I propose points to the multiplicity of decisions that encircle our moral decisions and suggests that in many cases our ultimate decision as to which way to act is less important phenomenologically as a contributor to our sense of free will than the prior decisions affecting our deliberation process itself: the decision, for instance, not to consider any further, to terminate deliberation; or the decision to ignore certain lines of inquiry.\n}}\n\n{{quote|These prior and subsidiary decisions contribute, I think, to our sense of ourselves as responsible free agents, roughly in the following way: I am faced with an important decision to make, and after a certain amount of deliberation, I say to myself: \"That's enough. I've considered this matter enough and now I'm going to act,\" in the full knowledge that I could have considered further, in the full knowledge that the eventualities may prove that I decided in error, but with the acceptance of responsibility in any case.<ref>''Brainstorms'', pp. 295\u201397</ref>}}\n\nLeading libertarian philosophers such as [[Robert Kane (philosopher)|Robert Kane]] have rejected Dennett's model, specifically that random chance is directly involved in a decision, on the basis that they believe this eliminates the agent's motives and reasons, [[Moral character|character]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], and feelings and [[Desire (emotion)|desires]]. They claim that, if chance is the primary cause of decisions, then agents cannot be liable for resultant actions. Kane says:\n\n{{quote|[As Dennett admits,] a causal indeterminist view of this deliberative kind does not give us everything libertarians have wanted from free will. For [the agent] does not have complete control over what chance images and other thoughts enter his mind or influence his deliberation. They simply come as they please. [The agent] does have some control ''after'' the chance considerations have occurred.}}\n{{quote|But then there is no more chance involved. What happens from then on, how he reacts, is ''determined'' by desires and beliefs he already has. So it appears that he does not have control in the ''libertarian'' sense of what happens after the chance considerations occur as well. Libertarians require more than this for full responsibility and free will.<ref>Robert Kane, ''A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will'', Oxford (2005) pp. 64\u20135</ref>}}\n\n===Philosophy of mind===\nDennett has remarked in several places (such as \"Self-portrait\", in ''Brainchildren'') that his overall philosophical project has remained largely the same since his time at Oxford. He is primarily concerned with providing a philosophy of mind that is grounded in [[empirical]] research. In his original [[Thesis|dissertation]], ''Content and Consciousness'', he broke up the problem of explaining the mind into the need for a theory of content and for a theory of consciousness. His approach to this project has also stayed true to this distinction. Just as ''Content and Consciousness'' has a bipartite structure, he similarly divided ''Brainstorms'' into two sections. He would later collect several essays on content in ''The [[Intentional stance|Intentional Stance]]'' and synthesize his views on consciousness into a unified theory in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]''. These volumes respectively form the most extensive development of his views.<ref>{{citation |last=Guttenplan |first=Samuel |authorlink=Samuel Guttenplan |title=A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford |year=1994 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/companiontophilo0000unse/page/642 642] |isbn=0-631-19996-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/companiontophilo0000unse/page/642 }}</ref>\n\nIn chapter 5 of ''Consciousness Explained'' Dennett describes his [[multiple drafts model]] of consciousness. He states that, \"all varieties of perception\u2014indeed all varieties of thought or mental activity\u2014are accomplished in the brain by parallel, multitrack processes of interpretation and elaboration of sensory inputs. Information entering the nervous system is under continuous 'editorial revision.'\" (p.&nbsp;111). Later he asserts, \"These yield, over the course of time, something ''rather like'' a narrative stream or sequence, which can be thought of as subject to continual editing by many processes distributed around the brain, ...\" (p.&nbsp;135, emphasis in the original).\n\nIn this work, Dennett's interest in the ability of evolution to explain some of the content-producing features of consciousness is already apparent, and this has since become an integral part of his program. He defends a theory known by some as [[Neural Darwinism]]. He also presents an argument against [[qualia]]; he argues that the [[concept]] is so confused that it cannot be put to any use or understood in any non-contradictory way, and therefore does not constitute a valid refutation of [[physicalism]]. His strategy mirrors his teacher Ryle's approach of redefining first person phenomena in third person terms, and denying the coherence of the concepts which this approach struggles with.\n\nDennett self-identifies with a few terms:\n{{quote|[Others] note that my \"avoidance of the standard philosophical terminology for discussing such matters\" often creates problems for me; philosophers have a hard time figuring out what I am saying and what I am denying. My refusal to play ball with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless\u2014a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors.<ref>Daniel Dennett, ''The Message is: There is no Medium''</ref>}}\n\nIn ''Consciousness Explained'', he affirms \"I am a sort of '[[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|teleofunctionalist]]', of course, perhaps the original teleofunctionalist\". He goes on to say, \"I am ready to come out of the closet as some sort of [[Verificationism|verificationist]]\".(page 460-461)\n\n===Evolutionary debate===\nMuch of Dennett's work since the 1990s has been concerned with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from what distinguishes human minds from animal minds (''Kinds of Minds''), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist view of the world (''[[Freedom Evolves]]'').\n\nDennett sees evolution by natural selection as an [[algorithm]]ic process (though he spells out that algorithms as simple as [[long division]] often incorporate a significant degree of [[randomness]]).<ref>p. 52-60, ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life'' (Simon & Schuster; reprint edition 1996) ({{ISBN|0-684-82471-X}})</ref> This idea is in conflict with the evolutionary philosophy of [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]], who preferred to stress the \"pluralism\" of evolution (i.e., its dependence on many crucial factors, of which natural selection is only one).\n\nDennett's views on evolution are identified as being strongly [[Adaptationism|adaptationist]], in line with his theory of the [[intentional stance]], and the evolutionary views of [[biologist]] Richard Dawkins. In ''Darwin's Dangerous Idea'', Dennett showed himself even more willing than Dawkins to defend adaptationism in print, devoting an entire chapter to a criticism of the ideas of Gould. This stems from Gould's long-running public debate with [[E.&nbsp;O. Wilson]] and other evolutionary biologists over human [[sociobiology]] and its descendant [[evolutionary psychology]], which Gould and [[Richard Lewontin]] opposed, but which Dennett advocated, together with Dawkins and [[Steven Pinker]].<ref>Although Dennett has expressed criticism of human sociobiology, calling it a form of \"[[greedy reductionism]]\", he is generally sympathetic towards the explanations proposed by [[evolutionary psychology]]. Gould also is not one sided, and writes: \"Sociobiologists have broadened their range of selective stories by invoking concepts of [[inclusive fitness]] and [[kin selection]] to solve (successfully I think) the vexatious problem of altruism\u2014previously the greatest stumbling block to a Darwinian theory of social behavior. . . . Here sociobiology has had and will continue to have success. And here I wish it well. For it represents an extension of basic Darwinism to a realm where it should apply.\" Gould, 1980.

He rejects the idea of the [[naturalistic fallacy]] as the idea that ethics is in some free-floating realm, writing that the fallacy is to rush from facts to values.\n\nIn his 2006 book, ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon]]'', Dennett attempts to account for religious belief naturalistically, explaining possible evolutionary reasons for the phenomenon of religious adherence.\nIn this book he declares himself to be \"[[Brights movement|a bright]]\", and defends the term.\n\nHe has been doing research into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He found what he called a \"don't ask, don't tell\" conspiracy because believers did not want to hear of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but they did not want to lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual.<ref name=\"Dennett2010\">[https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/Preachers_who_are_not_believers.pdf], \"Preachers Who Are Not Believers,\" Evolutionary Psychology, Vol. 8, Issue 1, March 2010, pp. 122\u201350, ({{ISSN|1474-7049}}).</ref> The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics.<ref>[http://traffic.libsyn.com/ffrf/FTradio_247_011511.mp3 Podcast: interview with Daniel Dennett.

Retrieved on 5 July 2014.</ref>\n\n== Plot==\nThe movie tells the story of a village called Chembattunadu in [[Palakkad district]] of Kerala, which is popular as Chattambinadu for the presence of several goons and hooligans. According to retired goons Chenkeeri Madhavan ([[T. G. Ravi]]) and Vadival Vasu ([[Janardhanan (actor)|Janardanan]]), it was the severe animosity between Mallanchira and Kattappilly families that has caused the arrival of several goons to the land, including them, which made Chattambinadu notorious. The film begins with Mallanchira Chandramohan's ([[Manoj K. Jayan]]) plan to sell off his mansion, to pay up his heavy debts. But Kattappilly Nagendran ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]), plays all ways to stop the sale. The local police inspector (Saju kodiyan) informs Chandramohan about Virendra Mallaya ([[Mammootty]]), a popular rich man with strong criminal background, who also has strong passion in real estate. Chandramohan approaches Mallayya, who refuses to take up the mansion in the beginning. But upon the request from Dr.Lakshmi ([[Meenakshi (actress)|Meenakshi]]), his friend, who also hails from Chattambinadu, he decides to buy the property, inviting strong opposition from Nagendran. Mallayya, who speaks Malayalam with strong [[Kannada]] accent, arrives at Chattambinadu along with Murugan ([[Vinu Mohan]]), his secretary, who is also more like his brother. At Chattambinadu, he comes across Vadival Vasu and his family consisting of daughters Gowri ([[Raai Laxmi]]) and Meenakshi([[Mythili]]). To create a rift among the villagers and Mallayya, under the instruction, Dashamoolam Damu ([[Suraj Venjarammood]]), a foolish assistant of Nagendran, on one night steals the lorry of Malaya and drives it into the house of Vasu, demolishing it. But Mallaya promises to repair the house with his own money. Murugan, who within this time had developed a soft feeling towards Meenakshi, takes them along with Maakri Gopalan ([[Salim Kumar]]) to Mallaya's house. Dr.Lakshmi on her day of arrival at Chattambinadu on vacation comes to know from her brother that Nagendran has decided to marry her, without the approval of her parents. Shocked Lakshmi even witnesses Nagendran violently thrashing her fianc\u00e9, making him flee. Lakshmi explains her condition to Mallaya, who promises her all help. Gowri, who witnesses their conversation mistakes them of being in love. She gets jealous as she had within this time fell in love with him. Chandramohan, on a casual talk, tells Mallaya, about Veeru, his servant boy, who had once attacked his father Mallanchira Unnithan ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]) and ran away with all his hard earned money. Chandramohan also adds that his only aim in life is to find out Veeru and avenge him by killing him for the crime done to his father. Veerendra Mallaya, on hearing this story is really shocked as he is none other than Veeru, who had once ran away. Chandramohan, on understanding the relation between Meenakshi and Murugan, approaches Mallaya to get them married. Also Vasu wants Mallaya to marry Gowri, his elder daughter. One night Mallaya reveals his story to Vasu, whom he had assaulted with sword in a bid to escape years back. Unnithan had got Veeru, a Kannadiga boy, who understood not a single world in Malayalam from street. Unnithan and his family took care of him well and treated him as their own son. One sudden day, in middle of a trip, Unnithan gets into an argument with Kattapilly Kurup, who tries to snatch the suitcase consisting of huge amount. In an attempt to save Unithan Veeru attacks Kuruppu and on the advice of Unnithan, runs away with the bag. But on hearing the cry of Unnithan, he comes back to see that Unnithan is severely wounded as attacked by Kattapilly Nagendran, son of Kuruppu. Kuruppu, then calls up people and tells them that it is Veeru who had killed Unithan, making him run for life. In an attempt to save himself, he assaults Vasu and jumps into river. The police inspector ([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Sai Kumar]]), who arrests him after a couple of days interrogates in [[Malayalam]], and Veeru, who knows not a single word in Malayalam is confused, where by accepts his charges. But on realising that he is framed, he escapes from police. He also adds that it is Kattappilly Kuruppu, who is behind the crime. Mallaya is also shocked to find Unnithan at the house of Chandramohan, who is now paralysed, who also had lost the ability to speak after the incident.\n\nNagendran, at the meantime, has gone forward with his plan to marry Lakshmi, but is saved by Mallaya, who gets her married to her fianc\u00e9.

According to retired goons Chenkeeri Madhavan ([[T. G. Ravi]]) and Vadival Vasu ([[Janardhanan (actor)|Janardanan]]), it was the severe animosity between Mallanchira and Kattappilly families that has caused the arrival of several goons to the land, including them, which made Chattambinadu notorious. The film begins with Mallanchira Chandramohan's ([[Manoj K. Jayan]]) plan to sell off his mansion, to pay up his heavy debts. But Kattappilly Nagendran ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]), plays all ways to stop the sale. The local police inspector (Saju kodiyan) informs Chandramohan about Virendra Mallaya ([[Mammootty]]), a popular rich man with strong criminal background, who also has strong passion in real estate. Chandramohan approaches Mallayya, who refuses to take up the mansion in the beginning. But upon the request from Dr.Lakshmi ([[Meenakshi (actress)|Meenakshi]]), his friend, who also hails from Chattambinadu, he decides to buy the property, inviting strong opposition from Nagendran. Mallayya, who speaks Malayalam with strong [[Kannada]] accent, arrives at Chattambinadu along with Murugan ([[Vinu Mohan]]), his secretary, who is also more like his brother. At Chattambinadu, he comes across Vadival Vasu and his family consisting of daughters Gowri ([[Raai Laxmi]]) and Meenakshi([[Mythili]]). To create a rift among the villagers and Mallayya, under the instruction, Dashamoolam Damu ([[Suraj Venjarammood]]), a foolish assistant of Nagendran, on one night steals the lorry of Malaya and drives it into the house of Vasu, demolishing it. But Mallaya promises to repair the house with his own money. Murugan, who within this time had developed a soft feeling towards Meenakshi, takes them along with Maakri Gopalan ([[Salim Kumar]]) to Mallaya's house. Dr.Lakshmi on her day of arrival at Chattambinadu on vacation comes to know from her brother that Nagendran has decided to marry her, without the approval of her parents. Shocked Lakshmi even witnesses Nagendran violently thrashing her fianc\u00e9, making him flee. Lakshmi explains her condition to Mallaya, who promises her all help. Gowri, who witnesses their conversation mistakes them of being in love. She gets jealous as she had within this time fell in love with him. Chandramohan, on a casual talk, tells Mallaya, about Veeru, his servant boy, who had once attacked his father Mallanchira Unnithan ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]) and ran away with all his hard earned money. Chandramohan also adds that his only aim in life is to find out Veeru and avenge him by killing him for the crime done to his father. Veerendra Mallaya, on hearing this story is really shocked as he is none other than Veeru, who had once ran away. Chandramohan, on understanding the relation between Meenakshi and Murugan, approaches Mallaya to get them married. Also Vasu wants Mallaya to marry Gowri, his elder daughter. One night Mallaya reveals his story to Vasu, whom he had assaulted with sword in a bid to escape years back. Unnithan had got Veeru, a Kannadiga boy, who understood not a single world in Malayalam from street. Unnithan and his family took care of him well and treated him as their own son. One sudden day, in middle of a trip, Unnithan gets into an argument with Kattapilly Kurup, who tries to snatch the suitcase consisting of huge amount. In an attempt to save Unithan Veeru attacks Kuruppu and on the advice of Unnithan, runs away with the bag. But on hearing the cry of Unnithan, he comes back to see that Unnithan is severely wounded as attacked by Kattapilly Nagendran, son of Kuruppu. Kuruppu, then calls up people and tells them that it is Veeru who had killed Unithan, making him run for life. In an attempt to save himself, he assaults Vasu and jumps into river. The police inspector ([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Sai Kumar]]), who arrests him after a couple of days interrogates in [[Malayalam]], and Veeru, who knows not a single word in Malayalam is confused, where by accepts his charges. But on realising that he is framed, he escapes from police. He also adds that it is Kattappilly Kuruppu, who is behind the crime. Mallaya is also shocked to find Unnithan at the house of Chandramohan, who is now paralysed, who also had lost the ability to speak after the incident.\n\nNagendran, at the meantime, has gone forward with his plan to marry Lakshmi, but is saved by Mallaya, who gets her married to her fianc\u00e9. Mallaya is shocked to see the old police inspector, who is now the father of the husband of Laksmi. He shows his willingness to help Mallaya to reveal the truth to Chandramohan, but is killed by Nagendran on the same night. The people of Chattambinadu, within this time recognises who Mallaya is and is waiting for his arrival to get him killed. Nagendran expands his net and gets the crowd gather at the spot where Mallaya arrives.
