Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/writer [[Rob Liefeld]], the character first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #98 ([[cover-date]]d February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a [[supervillain]] when he made his first appearance in ''The New Mutants'' and later in issues of ''X-Force'', but later evolved into his more recognizable [[antiheroic]] persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured [[mercenary]] with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the \"Merc with a Mouth\" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the [[fourth wall]] for humorous effect and running gags.\n\nThe character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media.

Deadpool laments that the Secret Wars should have stayed an Avengers event, but then dies at peace, content that everybody else is dying with him.<ref>''Deadpool'' (2012) #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====All New, All Different Marvel====\nEight months after the events of ''Secret Wars'' and the restoration of Earth, Deadpool is seen working for [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. After stealing some potentially life-saving chemicals needed by an ailing [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], he is offered membership in the [[Avengers Unity Squad]].<ref>''Avengers'' #0</ref>\n\nIn the course of the following months, Deadpool's popularity skyrocketed after the mercenary Solo impersonated him to piggyback on Deadpool's reputation and take jobs at a higher pay rate. One of Solo's jobs in Washington, D.C. had Deadpool's public opinion drastically change for the better when he saved an ambassador from his telepathically-manipulated agents. After learning of Solo's impersonation, Deadpool came up with the idea to form a group of mercenaries called the Mercs for Money to extend his reach across the globe. However, Deadpool's newfound popularity forced him to leave his family behind, fearing his enemies could endanger them. Deadpool additionally joined the Avengers Unity Division and used his popularity as a means of funding the team, with the profit from merchandise.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #1</ref>\n\nMadcap additionally returned to Deadpool's life, though Wade was unaware his experience inside his mind left Madcap emotionally damaged and vengeful. Madcap initially posed as an ally, joining the Mercs for Money, but eventually showed his true intentions after he was discovered impersonating Deadpool to defame and threaten his loved ones. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap used an alien weapon to molecularly disintegrate himself. For his second coming, the villain had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier of a deadly airborne virus with which he infected his family. Wade found a cure, though had to resort to Cable's evil clone Stryfe to find it. Around this time, tensions between Shiklah's domain and the surface word sparked an invasion of Manhattan from Monster Metropolis, which in turn led to Shiklah divorcing Deadpool, opting to return to Dracula instead.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #23-29</ref>\n\nNot long after Wade joined the Avengers Unity Division, the real Steve Rogers was secretly supplanted by an evil fascist counterpart from another timeline that operated as a Hydra sleeper agent within the superhero community. When Phil Coulson became suspicious of Steve, Rogers convinced Deadpool to kill him, claiming that Coulson had gone rogue. A short time afterwards, Captain America's machinations resulted in Hydra rising to power, taking over the United States of America. When Hydra's conquest had barely begun, Preston found out about Coulson's death, and confronted Deadpool about it. The fight ended in Preston's death. As Hydra's empire grew stronger, Wade joined its own version of the Avengers out of blind loyalty for Captain America. Plagued by guilt, Wade held back when tasked with hunting down the rebel alliance known as the Underground, and eventually helped, behind the scenes, to lay part of the foundation of Hydra's eventual defeat. With his mistakes costing the lives of two of his friends, the love of his daughter, and any respect the world had for him, Deadpool turned his back on what little remained of the life he had built.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #31-36</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n===Personality===\nDeadpool is aware that he is a fictional comic book character.<ref name=\"DeadpoolV1Issue34\">{{Cite comic\n| writer = [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Priest, Christopher]]\n| penciller = Paco Diaz\n| inker = Ramos, Rod\n| coinkers = John Holdredge\n| colorist = Blanchard, Shannon\n| letterer = Deschesne, Albert\n| editor = Diaz, Ruben\n| story = Chapter X Verse One: Sending in the Clowns\n| title = Deadpool\n| volume = 1\n| issue = 34\n| date = Nov 1999\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| location = [[New York, NY]]\n| page = \n| panel = \n| id = \n}}</ref> He commonly breaks the [[fourth wall]], which is done by few other characters in the [[Marvel Universe]], and this is used to humorous effect. He often has conversations with his two internal monologues, which are shown as caption boxes in his panels; in ''Deadpool Annual'' #1 (2014) it is revealed that [[Madcap (comics)|Madcap]], a foe of [[Captain America]], is the psychotic voice appearing in white captions with a typewriter serif;<ref>''Deadpool Annual'' #1 (2014).</ref> the other voice is unidentified and often mistakenly attributed to Dr. Bong, Deadpool's former psychiatrist.\n\nThe character's back-story has been presented as vague and subject to change, and within the narrative he is unable to remember his personal history due to a mental condition. Whether or not his name was even Wade Wilson is subject to speculation since one of his nemeses, [[T-Ray (comics)|T-Ray]], claims in ''Deadpool'' #33 that he is the real Wade Wilson and that Deadpool is a vicious murderer who stole his identity.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 3 #23.</ref> There have been other dubious stories about his history\u2014at one point the supervillain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] claimed to be his father.<ref name=\"Deadpool #36\">''Deadpool'' (2012) #36.</ref> Frequently, revelations are later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] or ignored altogether, and in one issue, Deadpool himself joked that whether or not he is actually Wade Wilson depends on which writer the reader prefers.<ref>\"Cable and Deadpool\" #47.</ref>\n\nDeadpool is depicted as having a regenerative healing factor, which not only prevents him from being permanently injured through enhanced cell regeneration throughout his body, but also causes psychosis and mental instability, as his [[neuron]]s are also affected by the accelerated regeneration. It is thought that while his psychosis is a handicap, it is also one of his assets as they make him an extremely unpredictable opponent. [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], who has photo-reflexive memory which allows him to copy anyone's fighting skills by observation, was unable to defeat Deadpool due to his chaotic and improvised fighting style.<ref name=\"DeadpoolV1Issue02\">{{Cite comic\n| writer = [[Joe Kelly (writer)|Kelly, Joe]]\n| penciller = [[Ed McGuinness|McGuinness, Ed]]\n| inker = Massengill, Nathan\n| coinkers = Norman Lee\n| colorist = Lichtner, Chris\n| letterer = Comicraft\n| editor = Idelson, Matt\n| story = Operation: That Wacky Doctor's Game!\n| title = Deadpool\n| volume = 1\n| issue = 2\n| date = February 1997\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| location = [[New York, NY]]\n| page = \n| panel = \n| id = \n}}</ref> Taskmaster has also stated that Deadpool is an expert at distracting his opponents.<ref name=\"DeadpoolV1Issue02\" /><ref name=filmjournal>{{cite news | url= http://www.filmjournal.com/features/deadpool-marvel-simon-kinberg-producer-interview | title= Everyone into the Deadpool: Producer Simon Kinberg helps revive Marvel's raunchy superhero | first= Frank | last= Lovece | authorlink= Frank Lovece | date= January 26, 2016 | work= [[Film Journal International]] | archivedate= January 28, 2016 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160128182927/http://www.filmjournal.com/features/deadpool-marvel-simon-kinberg-producer-interview | url-status= dead | access-date= February 9, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nDeadpool has sometimes been portrayed to have a strong sense of core morality.

For example, it is extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated.<ref>''Deadpool'' #12.</ref> He can be affected by certain drugs, such as tranquilizers if he is exposed to a large enough dosage.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Unlike Wolverine, whose wounds sometimes cause excruciating pain as they heal depending on the severity, Deadpool has some degree of pain insensitivity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/103688/does-deadpool-feel-pain|title=11 Does Deadpool feel pain ?|date=September 25, 2015|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDeadpool is effectively [[immortality|immortal]], although he has died several times.<ref name=\"Deadpool #61\">''Deadpool'' #61.</ref><ref>Deadpool & Death Annual.</ref> He is still alive 800 years in the future when the new X-Force encounters him.<ref>''X-Force / Cable Messiah War'' Oneshot.</ref> In addition, [[Thanos]] once declared that Deadpool should \"consider yourself cursed{{nbsp}}... with life!\" out of jealousy over Deadpool's status as [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]'s love interest.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol. 1 #64.</ref> His enemy T-Ray later resurrected him,<ref name=\"Deadpool #61\"/> under Thanos' instruction, using an artifact he had given him.<ref>''Deadpool'' #64.</ref> Later, Deadpool was informed that Thanos had placed a curse on him, and tracked Thanos down.

Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/writer [[Rob Liefeld]], the character first appeared in ''[[The New Mutants]]'' #98 ([[cover-date]]d February 1991). Initially Deadpool was depicted as a [[supervillain]] when he made his first appearance in ''The New Mutants'' and later in issues of ''X-Force'', but later evolved into his more recognizable [[antiheroic]] persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade Wilson, is a disfigured [[mercenary]] with the superhuman ability of an accelerated healing factor and physical prowess. The character is known as the \"Merc with a Mouth\" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the [[fourth wall]] for humorous effect and running gags.\n\nThe character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004 series ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'', he refers to his own scarred appearance as \"[[Ryan Reynolds]] crossed with a [[Shar Pei|Shar-Pei]]\" (though in the comic, Reynolds' name is misspelled as \"Renolds\".)<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #2, p. 13.

After subsequently appearing in ''[[X-Force]]'' as a recurring character, Deadpool began making guest appearances in a number of different Marvel Comics titles such as ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]''. In 1993, the character received his own [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]], titled ''The Circle Chase'', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]] and pencilled by [[Joe Madureira]]. It was a relative success and Deadpool starred in a second, self-titled miniseries written in 1994 by [[Mark Waid]], pencilled by [[Ian Churchill]], and inked by [[Jason Temujin Minor]] and Bud LaRosa. Waid later commented, \"Frankly, if I'd known Deadpool was such a creep when I agreed to write the mini-series, I wouldn't have done it.

''Deadpool'' became an action comedy parody of the cosmic drama, antihero-heavy comics of the time. The series firmly established his supporting cast, including his prisoner/den mother [[Blind Al]] and his best friend [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]. The ongoing series gained [[cult following|cult popularity]] for its unorthodox main character, its balance of angst and pop culture slapstick and the character became less of a villain, though the element of his moral ambiguity remained.

After the symbiotic Deadpool and Carnage fought again, Deadpool captures Shriek and forces her to impersonate himself, making it trick Carnage into almost killing her in the process. Feeling broken after a mental breakdown, Carnage allowed himself to be arrested and was placed in an unlocked cell. While sitting in the cell until he was his own self, Carnage swore vengeance on Deadpool.

He, along with his family and friends, (''and presumably everyone on Earth'') are all killed when the Earth [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|collides with an alternate universe's Earth]]. Deadpool laments that the Secret Wars should have stayed an Avengers event, but then dies at peace, content that everybody else is dying with him.<ref>''Deadpool'' (2012) #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====All New, All Different Marvel====\nEight months after the events of ''Secret Wars'' and the restoration of Earth, Deadpool is seen working for [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]]. After stealing some potentially life-saving chemicals needed by an ailing [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], he is offered membership in the [[Avengers Unity Squad]].<ref>''Avengers'' #0</ref>\n\nIn the course of the following months, Deadpool's popularity skyrocketed after the mercenary Solo impersonated him to piggyback on Deadpool's reputation and take jobs at a higher pay rate. One of Solo's jobs in Washington, D.C. had Deadpool's public opinion drastically change for the better when he saved an ambassador from his telepathically-manipulated agents. After learning of Solo's impersonation, Deadpool came up with the idea to form a group of mercenaries called the Mercs for Money to extend his reach across the globe. However, Deadpool's newfound popularity forced him to leave his family behind, fearing his enemies could endanger them. Deadpool additionally joined the Avengers Unity Division and used his popularity as a means of funding the team, with the profit from merchandise.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 4, #1</ref>\n\nMadcap additionally returned to Deadpool's life, though Wade was unaware his experience inside his mind left Madcap emotionally damaged and vengeful. Madcap initially posed as an ally, joining the Mercs for Money, but eventually showed his true intentions after he was discovered impersonating Deadpool to defame and threaten his loved ones. Seeing as he had had enough fun, Madcap used an alien weapon to molecularly disintegrate himself. For his second coming, the villain had Deadpool unwittingly become the carrier of a deadly airborne virus with which he infected his family. Wade found a cure, though had to resort to Cable's evil clone Stryfe to find it. Around this time, tensions between Shiklah's domain and the surface word sparked an invasion of Manhattan from Monster Metropolis, which in turn led to Shiklah divorcing Deadpool, opting to return to Dracula instead.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #23-29</ref>\n\nNot long after Wade joined the Avengers Unity Division, the real Steve Rogers was secretly supplanted by an evil fascist counterpart from another timeline that operated as a Hydra sleeper agent within the superhero community. When Phil Coulson became suspicious of Steve, Rogers convinced Deadpool to kill him, claiming that Coulson had gone rogue. A short time afterwards, Captain America's machinations resulted in Hydra rising to power, taking over the United States of America. When Hydra's conquest had barely begun, Preston found out about Coulson's death, and confronted Deadpool about it. The fight ended in Preston's death. As Hydra's empire grew stronger, Wade joined its own version of the Avengers out of blind loyalty for Captain America. Plagued by guilt, Wade held back when tasked with hunting down the rebel alliance known as the Underground, and eventually helped, behind the scenes, to lay part of the foundation of Hydra's eventual defeat. With his mistakes costing the lives of two of his friends, the love of his daughter, and any respect the world had for him, Deadpool turned his back on what little remained of the life he had built.<ref>''Deadpool'' Vol 4 #31-36</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n===Personality===\nDeadpool is aware that he is a fictional comic book character.<ref name=\"DeadpoolV1Issue34\">{{Cite comic\n| writer = [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Priest, Christopher]]\n| penciller = Paco Diaz\n| inker = Ramos, Rod\n| coinkers = John Holdredge\n| colorist = Blanchard, Shannon\n| letterer = Deschesne, Albert\n| editor = Diaz, Ruben\n| story = Chapter X Verse One: Sending in the Clowns\n| title = Deadpool\n| volume = 1\n| issue = 34\n| date = Nov 1999\n| publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| location = [[New York, NY]]\n| page = \n| panel = \n| id = \n}}</ref> He commonly breaks the [[fourth wall]], which is done by few other characters in the [[Marvel Universe]], and this is used to humorous effect.

It is thought that while his psychosis is a handicap, it is also one of his assets as they make him an extremely unpredictable opponent.

It is the fifth installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]]. ''Final Destination 5'' stars [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Miles Fisher]], [[Arlen Escarpeta]], [[David Koechner]], and [[Tony Todd]].\n\nDespite ''[[The Final Destination]]'' being originally announced as the final film in the franchise, due to its financial success, development of ''Final Destination 5'' began in 2010. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], as with the first three installments. It was theatrically released in August 12, 2011, and on [[DVD]] on December 27, 2011.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews; this is the first film in the franchise to do so. Critics praised the plot, CGI, death scenes and tone, especially in comparison to the previous installment. The film was a financial success and is the second highest-grossing film in the franchise.\n\n==Plot==\nSam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it actually does collapse, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \"Death doesn't like to be cheated\", and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.\n\nLater, Candice goes to the gym to practice, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below, popping her eyeball out of its socket, causing it to roll away. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.\n\nMeanwhile, Nathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. As Nathan informs the remaining survivors about this, they realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident, a wrench launched by a belt sander hits him in the face, killing him.\n\nThat evening, after working at a restaurant, Sam asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter, who has become unstable after Candice's death, interrupts the date and tells them that he will kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the kitchen. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside. When he enters the restaurant, he is shot dead by Peter. Believing that he is safe from Death, Peter decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. The two men fight and Peter knocks Sam unconscious. Just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam awakens and stabs him in the back with a large skewer, leading Sam to believe that he claimed Block's life.\n\nTwo weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to Paris. As they take their seats, they notice [[Final Destination (film)|a couple passengers being removed from the plane]] with one of them, [[Alex Browning]], warning the other passengers still in the plane to get off. This reveals that the plane they are on is Vol\u00e9e Airlines  [[Boeing 747]] Flight 180 from [[Final Destination (film)|the first film]]. Sam and Molly are confused but take their seats nonetheless. When the lights dim for take off, Sam looks at his plane ticket, dated May 13, 2000, revealing that the previous events took place in April. Upon takeoff, Sam gets the same signs that he got on the bridge collapse and overhears from an airhostess telling another passenger that Alex had a vision of the plane's destruction and realizes it is too late for him to leave, and both he and Molly perish in the explosion that follows. At Roy's memorial, Nathan learns that Roy had a [[Intracranial aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] that was close to bursting, and was due to die \"any day now.\" As Nathan realizes he is still in danger, the landing gear from the plane breaks through the roof and crushes Nathan, setting off the events of the [[Final Destination|first four films]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Final Destination characters}}\n[[File:Nicholas D'Agosto, Emma Bell, Tony Todd on Dulce Osuna for Final Destination 5.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Tony Todd]] interviewed by Dulce Osuna about ''Final Destination 5'']]\n[[File:P.

It is the fifth installment in the [[Final Destination|''Final Destination'' film series]]. ''Final Destination 5'' stars [[Nicholas D'Agosto]], [[Emma Bell]], [[Miles Fisher]], [[Arlen Escarpeta]], [[David Koechner]], and [[Tony Todd]].\n\nDespite ''[[The Final Destination]]'' being originally announced as the final film in the franchise, due to its financial success, development of ''Final Destination 5'' began in 2010. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], as with the first three installments. It was theatrically released in August 12, 2011, and on [[DVD]] on December 27, 2011.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews; this is the first film in the franchise to do so. Critics praised the plot, CGI, death scenes and tone, especially in comparison to the previous installment. The film was a financial success and is the second highest-grossing film in the franchise.\n\n==Plot==\nSam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it actually does collapse, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \"Death doesn't like to be cheated\", and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.\n\nLater, Candice goes to the gym to practice, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below, popping her eyeball out of its socket, causing it to roll away. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.\n\nMeanwhile, Nathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. As Nathan informs the remaining survivors about this, they realize he claimed Roy's remaining lifespan by killing him and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident, a wrench launched by a belt sander hits him in the face, killing him.\n\nThat evening, after working at a restaurant, Sam asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter, who has become unstable after Candice's death, interrupts the date and tells them that he will kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the kitchen. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside. When he enters the restaurant, he is shot dead by Peter. Believing that he is safe from Death, Peter decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. The two men fight and Peter knocks Sam unconscious. Just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam awakens and stabs him in the back with a large skewer, leading Sam to believe that he claimed Block's life.\n\nTwo weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to Paris. As they take their seats, they notice [[Final Destination (film)|a couple passengers being removed from the plane]] with one of them, [[Alex Browning]], warning the other passengers still in the plane to get off. This reveals that the plane they are on is Vol\u00e9e Airlines  [[Boeing 747]] Flight 180 from [[Final Destination (film)|the first film]]. Sam and Molly are confused but take their seats nonetheless. When the lights dim for take off, Sam looks at his plane ticket, dated May 13, 2000, revealing that the previous events took place in April. Upon takeoff, Sam gets the same signs that he got on the bridge collapse and overhears from an airhostess telling another passenger that Alex had a vision of the plane's destruction and realizes it is too late for him to leave, and both he and Molly perish in the explosion that follows.

Based on [[Roald Dahl]]'s [[Matilda (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film stars [[Mara Wilson]] as the [[Matilda Wormwood|title character]] with DeVito, [[Rhea Perlman]], [[Embeth Davidtz]], and [[Pam Ferris]] in supporting roles. The film centers on a young genius girl named Matilda Wormwood, who develops [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic abilities]] and uses them to deal with her disreputable family and Agatha Trunchbull, the ruthless, oppressive and tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School.\n\nProduced by DeVito's [[Jersey Group|Jersey Films]] and released theatrically in the United States on August 2, 1996 by [[TriStar Pictures]], the film received predominantly positive reviews from critics but was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing only $33 million in the United States on a $36 million budget.<ref name=\"gross\">{{mojo title|matilda|Matilda}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nYoung genius [[Matilda Wormwood]] is regularly neglected and mistreated by her parents, Harry and Zinnia, and her older brother, Michael. She is smart, independent and frequently goes to the public library where she finds solace in the fictional worlds found in the books. When Matilda's parents refuse to enroll her into school, she retaliates against them, first by adding [[hydrogen peroxide]] bleaching agent to her father's [[Hair conditioner|hair tonic]] and then by gluing his hat to his head. When Harry rips up the library's copy of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (which he finds appalling because of the title) and forces Matilda to watch television instead, Matilda becomes increasingly enraged until the television mysteriously explodes.\n\nOne of Harry's car dealership customers is Miss Agatha Trunchbull, the tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School. Harry sells her a car in exchange for her admitting Matilda as a pupil. At school, Matilda makes friends but discovers Trunchbull's harsh punishments of the students, while Matilda's teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, takes a liking to Matilda due to her intelligence; Honey requests Matilda be moved up to a higher class, but Trunchbull refuses. Miss Honey tells the Wormwoods about Matilda's genius-level intellect, but they ignore her while Matilda discovers that her father is under surveillance by undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents Bob and Bill (with whom Zinnia flirts) because of his illegal dealings. Her parents refuse to believe her as they assume that the agents are speedboat salesmen.\n\nAs a prank, one of Matilda's friends puts a [[newt]] in Trunchbull's water jug to scare her. Trunchbull accuses Matilda, whose anger at the injustice leads her to [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] tip the glass over, splashing the newt onto Trunchbull. Honey invites Matilda over to her house for tea and reveals a secret: when she was two, her mother died and her father invited his stepsister-in-law, Miss Trunchbull, to live with them and look after her, but Trunchbull abused her; when Honey was five, her father died of an alleged [[suicide]] and left everything to Trunchbull. When Matilda and Honey sneak inside Trunchbull's house to obtain some of the latter's belongings, Trunchbull's sudden return prompts the duo to barely escape without getting caught.\n\nMatilda trains her telekinetic power by making objects fly around the house and thwarting the FBI agents who threaten to put her in an [[orphanage]]. Having practiced her ability, she returns to Trunchbull's house in an attempt to scare her away with telekinesis, but Trunchbull discovers Matilda's presence upon finding her hair ribbon. The next day, Matilda reveals her powers to Honey but Trunchbull visits the class to make Matilda confess. Matilda magically writes a message on the blackboard, pretending to be the vengeful soul of Miss Honey's deceased father, Magnus, who accuses Trunchbull of murdering him. Trunchbull attacks the students, but Matilda keeps them safe and she and the other students force her out of the school for good, and Honey moves back into her true home.\n\nThe FBI uncovers enough evidence to prosecute Harry, forcing the Wormwoods to flee to [[Guam]]. They stop by Honey's home to fetch Matilda, who refuses to go with them and says she would rather be adopted by Honey; remorseful for never understanding her daughter, Zinnia and Harry both sign Matilda's adoption papers and Matilda lives happily with Honey, who then becomes the new principal of Crunchem Hall.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as [[Matilda Wormwood]]\n** Alissa and Amanda Graham, Trevor and James Gallagher as Newborn Matilda\n** Kayla and Kelsey Fredericks as 9-month-old Matilda\n** Amanda and Caitlin Fein as 2-year-old Matilda\n** Sara Magdalin as 4-year-old Matilda\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Miss Jennifer Honey\n** Amanda and Kristyn Summers as 2-year-old Miss Honey\n** Phoebe Pearl as 5-year-old Miss Honey\n* [[Pam_Ferris|Pam Ferris]] as [[Miss Trunchbull|Agatha Trunchbull]]\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Harold \"Harry\" Wormwood and the Narrator\n* [[Rhea Perlman]] as Zinnia Wormwood\n* [[Brian Levinson]] as Michael Wormwood\n** Nicholas Cox as 6-year-old Michael\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as FBI Agent Bob\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as FBI Agent Bill\n* Kiami Davael as Lavender \n* Jacqueline Steiger as Amanda Thripp\n* Kira Spencer Hesser as Hortensia\n* [[Jean Speegle Howard]] as Mrs. Phelps\n* [[Marion Dugan]] as Cookie\n* Cade Allum as Bruce Bogtrotter\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] (uncredited) as Mickey on \"The Million Dollar Sticky\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Pam Ferris]] (Miss Trunchbull) incurred several injuries during production on the film.

Based on [[Roald Dahl]]'s [[Matilda (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film stars [[Mara Wilson]] as the [[Matilda Wormwood|title character]] with DeVito, [[Rhea Perlman]], [[Embeth Davidtz]], and [[Pam Ferris]] in supporting roles. The film centers on a young genius girl named Matilda Wormwood, who develops [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic abilities]] and uses them to deal with her disreputable family and Agatha Trunchbull, the ruthless, oppressive and tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School.\n\nProduced by DeVito's [[Jersey Group|Jersey Films]] and released theatrically in the United States on August 2, 1996 by [[TriStar Pictures]], the film received predominantly positive reviews from critics but was a [[Box-office bomb|box office bomb]], grossing only $33 million in the United States on a $36 million budget.<ref name=\"gross\">{{mojo title|matilda|Matilda}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nYoung genius [[Matilda Wormwood]] is regularly neglected and mistreated by her parents, Harry and Zinnia, and her older brother, Michael. She is smart, independent and frequently goes to the public library where she finds solace in the fictional worlds found in the books. When Matilda's parents refuse to enroll her into school, she retaliates against them, first by adding [[hydrogen peroxide]] bleaching agent to her father's [[Hair conditioner|hair tonic]] and then by gluing his hat to his head. When Harry rips up the library's copy of ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (which he finds appalling because of the title) and forces Matilda to watch television instead, Matilda becomes increasingly enraged until the television mysteriously explodes.\n\nOne of Harry's car dealership customers is Miss Agatha Trunchbull, the tyrannical principal of Crunchem Hall Elementary School. Harry sells her a car in exchange for her admitting Matilda as a pupil. At school, Matilda makes friends but discovers Trunchbull's harsh punishments of the students, while Matilda's teacher, Miss Jennifer Honey, takes a liking to Matilda due to her intelligence; Honey requests Matilda be moved up to a higher class, but Trunchbull refuses. Miss Honey tells the Wormwoods about Matilda's genius-level intellect, but they ignore her while Matilda discovers that her father is under surveillance by undercover [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents Bob and Bill (with whom Zinnia flirts) because of his illegal dealings. Her parents refuse to believe her as they assume that the agents are speedboat salesmen.\n\nAs a prank, one of Matilda's friends puts a [[newt]] in Trunchbull's water jug to scare her. Trunchbull accuses Matilda, whose anger at the injustice leads her to [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]] tip the glass over, splashing the newt onto Trunchbull. Honey invites Matilda over to her house for tea and reveals a secret: when she was two, her mother died and her father invited his stepsister-in-law, Miss Trunchbull, to live with them and look after her, but Trunchbull abused her; when Honey was five, her father died of an alleged [[suicide]] and left everything to Trunchbull. When Matilda and Honey sneak inside Trunchbull's house to obtain some of the latter's belongings, Trunchbull's sudden return prompts the duo to barely escape without getting caught.\n\nMatilda trains her telekinetic power by making objects fly around the house and thwarting the FBI agents who threaten to put her in an [[orphanage]]. Having practiced her ability, she returns to Trunchbull's house in an attempt to scare her away with telekinesis, but Trunchbull discovers Matilda's presence upon finding her hair ribbon. The next day, Matilda reveals her powers to Honey but Trunchbull visits the class to make Matilda confess. Matilda magically writes a message on the blackboard, pretending to be the vengeful soul of Miss Honey's deceased father, Magnus, who accuses Trunchbull of murdering him. Trunchbull attacks the students, but Matilda keeps them safe and she and the other students force her out of the school for good, and Honey moves back into her true home.\n\nThe FBI uncovers enough evidence to prosecute Harry, forcing the Wormwoods to flee to [[Guam]]. They stop by Honey's home to fetch Matilda, who refuses to go with them and says she would rather be adopted by Honey; remorseful for never understanding her daughter, Zinnia and Harry both sign Matilda's adoption papers and Matilda lives happily with Honey, who then becomes the new principal of Crunchem Hall.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mara Wilson]] as [[Matilda Wormwood]]\n** Alissa and Amanda Graham, Trevor and James Gallagher as Newborn Matilda\n** Kayla and Kelsey Fredericks as 9-month-old Matilda\n** Amanda and Caitlin Fein as 2-year-old Matilda\n** Sara Magdalin as 4-year-old Matilda\n* [[Embeth Davidtz]] as Miss Jennifer Honey\n** Amanda and Kristyn Summers as 2-year-old Miss Honey\n** Phoebe Pearl as 5-year-old Miss Honey\n* [[Pam_Ferris|Pam Ferris]] as [[Miss Trunchbull|Agatha Trunchbull]]\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Harold \"Harry\" Wormwood and the Narrator\n* [[Rhea Perlman]] as Zinnia Wormwood\n* [[Brian Levinson]] as Michael Wormwood\n** Nicholas Cox as 6-year-old Michael\n* [[Paul Reubens]] as FBI Agent Bob\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as FBI Agent Bill\n* Kiami Davael as Lavender \n* Jacqueline Steiger as Amanda Thripp\n* Kira Spencer Hesser as Hortensia\n* [[Jean Speegle Howard]] as Mrs. Phelps\n* [[Marion Dugan]] as Cookie\n* Cade Allum as Bruce Bogtrotter\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] (uncredited) as Mickey on \"The Million Dollar Sticky\"\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[Pam Ferris]] (Miss Trunchbull) incurred several injuries during production on the film.

This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>\n\n==War service==\n[[File:Hms g8 submarine.jpg|thumb|left|Submarine ''G8'' (on right) moored alongside 10th Flotilla's [[depot ship]] {{HMS|Lucia}} during World War I]]\nLike the rest of her class, ''G8''\u2032s role was to patrol the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[submarine]]s.\n\n''G8'' belonged to the 10th Flotilla during her war service, but also operated out of [[Scapa Flow]] during most of 1917. Her patrol areas were from north of [[Shetland]] to [[Norway]], the [[Skagerrak]], the [[Kattegat]], and the [[Horns Reef]]. She also made one patrol out of [[Harwich]] for the 9th Flotilla in August 1916 before joining the Tees Flotilla.\n\nHer two [[commanding officer]]s were [[Lieutenant (naval)|Lieutenant]] Charles de Burgh from 30 June 1916 to 30 July 1917 and Lieutenant John F. Tryon from 30 July 1917 until her loss.\n\nHer last patrol began from Tees on 27 December 1917, leaving with the submarine {{HMS|G12||6}} and the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Medea||6}} for the [[Kattegat]]. She was ordered to start her voyage back on 3 January 1918 or possibly 48 hours later, returning to Tees on or around 6 January 1918. She did not return and was never heard from again. She was officially declared missing on 14 January 1918. The cause remains unknown, but she was found with depth rudders pointing towards the surface, which suggests that the men aboard were trying to get to the surface. Therefore it is thought that a technical error led to the sinking.

Her patrol areas were from north of [[Shetland]] to [[Norway]], the [[Skagerrak]], the [[Kattegat]], and the [[Horns Reef]]. She also made one patrol out of [[Harwich]] for the 9th Flotilla in August 1916 before joining the Tees Flotilla.\n\nHer two [[commanding officer]]s were [[Lieutenant (naval)|Lieutenant]] Charles de Burgh from 30 June 1916 to 30 July 1917 and Lieutenant John F. Tryon from 30 July 1917 until her loss.\n\nHer last patrol began from Tees on 27 December 1917, leaving with the submarine {{HMS|G12||6}} and the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Medea||6}} for the [[Kattegat]]. She was ordered to start her voyage back on 3 January 1918 or possibly 48 hours later, returning to Tees on or around 6 January 1918. She did not return and was never heard from again. She was officially declared missing on 14 January 1918. The cause remains unknown, but it was found with it`s depth rudders pointing towards the surface, which suggests that the men aboard was trying, but failed, to get to the surface. Therefore it is thought that a technical error led to the sinking. There is no evidence on the wreck of it being hit by torpedoes or mines.<ref>*[http://www.submarine-museum.co.uk/what-we-have/memorial-chapel/submarine-losses?start=7 'Submarine losses 1904 to present day' - Royal Navy Submarine Museum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130714021235/http://www.submarine-museum.co.uk/what-we-have/memorial-chapel/submarine-losses?start=7 |date=14 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/samfund/101-aar-gammel-ubaad-fundet-i-danmark/7732484|title=101 \u00e5r gammel ub\u00e5d fundet i Danmark|last=Fax: 33141000|first=R\u00e5dhuspladsen 37 1785 K\u00f8benhavn V.

SPA's latest releases are ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', an animated [[superhero film]] based on the [[Spider-Man]] comics and featuring the [[Miles Morales]] incarnation of the character, and ''[[The Angry Birds Movie 2]]'', a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]'' produced by [[Rovio Animation]].

No [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling.\n\nIn theory, a particle and its anti-particle (for example, proton and antiproton) have the same mass, but opposite [[electric charge]] and other differences in [[quantum number]]s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.\n\nA collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their ''mutual [[annihilation]]'', giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle-antiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of [[ionizing radiation]]. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light. The amount of the released energy is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter, in accordance with the [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]] equation, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |date=11 August 2011\n |title=Smidgen of Antimatter Surrounds Earth\n |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/pamela-spots-a-smidgen-of-antimatter-110811.html\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926174944/http://news.discovery.com/space/pamela-spots-a-smidgen-of-antimatter-110811.html\n |archivedate=26 September 2011\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\nAntimatter particles bind with each other to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter.

For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.\n\n==Properties==\nThere are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>\n{{Cite arXiv\n |last1=Dolgov |first1=A.

They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter.

This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.\n\nAntimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.\n\nStorage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons . The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.\n\nOne researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:\n{{quote|If we could assemble all of the antimatter we've ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |year=2004 [2008]\n |title=Angels and Demons: Do antimatter atoms exist?\n |url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |publisher=[[CERN]]\n |accessdate=2010-11-18\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160609/http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |url-status=dead\n |archivedate=2010-11-16\n}}</ref>}}\n--->\n\n===Weapons===\n{{Main|Antimatter weapon}}\n\nAntimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |title=Antimatter weapons\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424174413/http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |archivedate=24 April 2013\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref> A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last1=Gsponer |first1=Andre\n |last2=Hurni |first2=Jean-Pierre\n |year=1987\n |chapter=The physics of antimatter induced fusion and thermonuclear explosions\n |editor1-last=Velarde |editor1-first=G.\n |editor2-last=Minguez |editor2-first=E.\n |title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems, Madrid, June/July, 1986\n |volume=4 |issue=30 |pages=66\u2013169\n |publisher=[[World Scientific]]\n |arxiv=physics/0507114\n |bibcode=2005physics...7114G\n}}</ref> However, the U.S. Air Force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the [[Cold War]], and began considering its possible use in weapons, not just as a trigger, but as the explosive itself.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/10/04/MNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |title=Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons / Program was touted publicly, then came official gag order\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609101650/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F10%2F04%2FMNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |archivedate=9 June 2012\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Antimatter comet}}\n* {{annotated link|Plasma cosmology#Alfv\u00e9n\u2013Klein cosmology}}\n* {{annotated link|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=G.

For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.\n\nA collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their ''mutual [[annihilation]]'', giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle-antiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of [[ionizing radiation]]. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy such as heat or light.

For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.\n\n==Properties==\nThere are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>\n{{Cite arXiv\n |last1=Dolgov |first1=A.

High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[Solar System]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter.

In late 2002 the ATHENA project announced that they had created the world's first \"cold\" antihydrogen.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Amoretti |first=M.\n |display-authors=etal\n |date=2002\n |title=Production and detection of cold antihydrogen atoms\n |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/581488\n |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n |volume=419 |issue=6906 |pages=456\u2013459\n |bibcode=2002Natur.419..456A\n |doi=10.1038/nature01096\n |pmid=12368849\n}}</ref> The ATRAP project released similar results very shortly thereafter.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Gabrielse |first=G.\n |display-authors=etal\n |date=2002\n |title=Background-free observation of cold antihydrogen with field ionization analysis of its states\n |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/977774\n |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]\n |volume=89 |issue=21 |page=213401\n |bibcode=2002PhRvL..89u3401G\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.213401\n |pmid=12443407\n}}</ref> The antiprotons used in these experiments were cooled by decelerating them with the Antiproton Decelerator, passing them through a thin sheet of foil, and finally capturing them in a Penning\u2013Malmberg trap.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Malmberg |first1=J.

To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma. The electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation, and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via [[Coulomb potential|Coulomb]] collisions.

This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons, and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates. Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.\n\nIn 2005, ATHENA disbanded and some of the former members (along with others) formed the [[ALPHA Collaboration]], which is also based at CERN. The ultimate goal of this endeavour is to test [[CPT symmetry]] through comparison of the [[atomic spectra]] of [[hydrogen]] and antihydrogen (see [[hydrogen spectral series]]).<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Madsen |first=N.\n |date=2010\n |title=Cold antihydrogen: a new frontier in fundamental physics\n |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]]\n |volume=368 |issue=1924 |pages=3671\u201382\n |bibcode=2010RSPTA.368.3671M\n |doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0026\n |pmid=20603376\n|doi-access=free\n }}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 a new antiproton decelerator and cooler called ELENA (E Low Energy Antiproton decelerator) was built.

This machine works by using high energy and accelerating the particles within the chamber. More than one hundred antiprotons can be captured per second, a huge improvement, but it would still take several thousand years to make a [[nanogram]] of antimatter.\n\nMost of the sought-after high-precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped, that is, held in place for a relatively long time. While antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral, the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of their component particles produce a [[magnetic moment]]. These magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field; some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum.

They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.\n\nAntimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.\n\nStorage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons . The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.\n\nOne researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:\n{{quote|If we could assemble all of the antimatter we've ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |year=2004 [2008]\n |title=Angels and Demons: Do antimatter atoms exist?\n |url=http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |publisher=[[CERN]]\n |accessdate=2010-11-18\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116160609/http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/Spotlight/SpotlightAandD-en.html\n |url-status=dead\n |archivedate=2010-11-16\n}}</ref>}}\n--->\n\n===Weapons===\n{{Main|Antimatter weapon}}\n\nAntimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |title=Antimatter weapons\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424174413/http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/anti-BPP-3.html\n |archivedate=24 April 2013\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref> A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last1=Gsponer |first1=Andre\n |last2=Hurni |first2=Jean-Pierre\n |year=1987\n |chapter=The physics of antimatter induced fusion and thermonuclear explosions\n |editor1-last=Velarde |editor1-first=G.\n |editor2-last=Minguez |editor2-first=E.\n |title=Proceedings of the International Conference on Emerging Nuclear Energy Systems, Madrid, June/July, 1986\n |volume=4 |issue=30 |pages=66\u2013169\n |publisher=[[World Scientific]]\n |arxiv=physics/0507114\n |bibcode=2005physics...7114G\n}}</ref> However, the U.S. Air Force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the [[Cold War]], and began considering its possible use in weapons, not just as a trigger, but as the explosive itself.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/10/04/MNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |title=Air Force pursuing antimatter weapons / Program was touted publicly, then came official gag order\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609101650/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F10%2F04%2FMNGM393GPK1.DTL\n |archivedate=9 June 2012\n |df=dmy-all\n |url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Antimatter comet}}\n* {{annotated link|Plasma cosmology#Alfv\u00e9n\u2013Klein cosmology}}\n* {{annotated link|Gravitational interaction of antimatter}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|author=G.
