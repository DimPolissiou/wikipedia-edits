Text messages may be sent over a [[cellular network]], or may also be sent via an [[Internet]] connection.\n\nThe term originally referred to messages sent using the [[SMS|Short Message Service]] (SMS). It has grown beyond alphanumeric text to include multimedia messages using the [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS) \ncontaining digital images, videos, and sound content, as well as ideograms known as [[emoji]] ([[Smiley|happy face]]s, sad faces, and other icons).\n\nText messages are used for personal, family, business and social purposes. Governmental and non-governmental organizations use text messaging for communication between colleagues.  In the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages has become an accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier with [[email]]ing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Robert|last2=Pinchot|first2=Jamie|date=2010|title=Conference on Information Systems Applied Research|url=http://proc.conisar.org/2010/pdf/1519.pdf|journal=How Mobile Technology is Changing Our Culture|volume=3|pages=10|via=CONISAR}}</ref> This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family and colleagues, including in contexts where a [[telephone call|call]] would be impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at night or when one knows the other person is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail and [[voicemail]] and unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting does not require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits communication even between busy individuals.  Text messages can also be used to interact with automated systems, for example, to order products or services from [[e-commerce]] websites, or to participate in online contests. Advertisers and service providers use [[Direct Text Marketing|direct text marketing]] to send messages to mobile users about promotions, payment due dates, and other notifications instead of using [[Mail|postal mail]], [[email]], or [[voicemail]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe service is referred to by different [[colloquialism]]s depending on the region. It may simply be referred to as a \"text\" in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines, an \"SMS\" in most of mainland Europe, or an \"MMS\" or \"SMS\" in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The sender of a text message is commonly referred to as a \"texter\".\n\n== History ==\nThe [[electrical telegraph]] systems, developed in the early 19th century, used simple electrical signals to send text messages. In the late 19th century, the [[wireless telegraphy]] was developed using [[radio waves]].\n\nIn 1933, the German ''[[Reichspost]]'' ([[Reich]] postal service) introduced the first \"[[telex]]\" service.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title                 = Fifty years of telex\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/?id=VjMgAQAAMAAJ&q=%22world%27s+first+public+teleprinter+network%22\n| journal               = Telecommunication Journal\n| date      = 1984\n| volume                = 51\n| page                  = 35 \n| access-date           = 2017-05-18\n| quote                 = Just over fifty years ago, in October 1933, the ''Deutsche Reichspost'' as it was then known, opened the world's first public teleprinter network.\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite news\n| last1                 = Herbst\n| first1                = Kris\n| last2                 = Ubois\n| first2                = Jeff\n| title                 = The competition\n| newspaper             = [[Network World]]\n| volume                = 5\n| issue                 = 46\n| date                  = November 14, 1988\n| publisher             = IDG Network World Inc\n| page                  = 68\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=exIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68\n| issn                  = 0887-7661\n| access-date           = 2017-12-29\n| quote                 = Telex originated in Germany and rapidly expanded to other countries after World War II. \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe University of Hawaii began using radio to send digital information as early as 1971, using [[ALOHAnet]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Friedhelm Hillebrand]] conceptualised SMS in 1984 while working for [[Deutsche Telekom]].

Modern SMS text messaging is {{by whom|date=February 2016}} usually messaging from one mobile phone to another. Finnish [[Radiolinja]] became the first network to offer a commercial person-to-person SMS text messaging service in 1994. When Radiolinja's domestic competitor, Telecom Finland (now part of [[TeliaSonera]]) also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality, Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as on a commercial basis. GSM was allowed{{by whom|date=February 2016}} in the United States and the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US \"Carriers\" to use US technology. Hence there is no \"development\" in the US in mobile messaging service. The GSM in the US had to use a frequency allocated for [[Personal Communications Service|private communication service]]s (PCS) \u2013 what the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] frequency r\u00e9gime had blocked for DECT \u2013 [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]] \u2013 1000-feet range picocell, but survived. American Personal Communications (APC), the first GSM carrier in America, provided the first text-messaging service in the United States.  Sprint Telecommunications Venture, a partnership of Sprint Corp. and three large cable-TV companies, owned 49 percent of APC. The Sprint venture was the largest single buyer at a government-run spectrum auction that raised $7.7 billion in 2005 for PCS licenses.  APC operated under the brand name of Sprint Spectrum and launched its service on November 15, 1995, in Washington, D.C. and in Baltimore, Maryland.  Vice President [[Al Gore]] in Washington, D.C. made the initial phone-call to launch the network, calling Mayor [[Kurt Schmoke]] in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-11-16/business/1995320051_1_cellular-sprint-pcs-network|title=PCS network launched in Baltimore-D.C. area - First system in nation offers digital challenge to cellular phone industry|first=Michael|last=Dresser|date=16 November 1995|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref>\n\nInitial growth of text messaging{{where?|date=February 2016}} was slow, with customers in 1995 sending on average only 0.4 messages per GSM customer per month.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gsmworld.com/news/press_2001/press_releases_4.shtml|title= GSM World press release|work= gsmworld.com|date= 12 February 2001|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20020215194430/http://www.gsmworld.com/news/press_2001/press_releases_4.shtml|archivedate= 15 February 2002}}</ref> One factor in the slow take-up of SMS was that operators were slow to set up charging systems, especially for prepaid subscribers, and to eliminate billing fraud, which was possible by changing [[Short message service center|SMSC]] settings on individual handsets to use the SMSCs of other operators.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Over time, this issue was eliminated by switch billing instead of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs to allow blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} SMS is available on a wide range of networks, including [[3G]] networks.

Texting is also used to communicate very brief messages, such as informing someone that you will be late or reminding a friend or colleague about a meeting. As with e-mail, informality and brevity have become an accepted part of text messaging. Some text messages such as SMS can also be used for the remote controlling of home appliances.

In many markets, the service is comparatively cheap. For example, in Australia, a message typically costs between [[Australian dollar|A$]]0.20 and $0.25 to send (some prepaid services charge $0.01 between their own phones), compared with a voice call, which costs somewhere between $0.40 and $2.00 per minute (commonly charged in half-minute blocks). The service is enormously profitable to the service providers. At a typical length of only 190&nbsp;bytes (including protocol overhead), more than 350 of these messages per minute can be transmitted at the same data rate as a usual voice call (9&nbsp;kbit/s). There are also free SMS services available, which are often sponsored, that allow sending<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://globfone.com/send-text/ |title = Send text free}}</ref> and receiving<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thesmsbay.com/ |title = Receive Texts for Free &#124; the SMS Bay}}</ref> SMS from a PC connected to the internet. Mobile service providers in New Zealand, such as [[Vodafone]] and [[Telecom NZ]], provide up to 2000 SMS messages for NZ$10 per month. Users on these plans send on average 1500 SMS messages every month. Text messaging has become so popular that advertising agencies and advertisers are now jumping into the text messaging business. Services that provide bulk text message sending are also becoming a popular way for clubs, associations, and advertisers to reach a group of opt-in subscribers quickly.\n\nResearch suggests that Internet-based mobile messaging will have grown to equal the popularity of SMS in 2013, with nearly 10 trillion messages being sent through each technology.<ref name=Tyntec>{{cite web|url=https://www.tyntec.com/fileadmin/tyntec.com/whitepapers/Whitepaper-GigaOM_tyntec_-_Converged_Mobile_Messaging_-_Jan_15_2013.pdf|title=Converged-mobile-messaging analysis and forecasts|work=tyntec.com|first=Peter|last=Crocker|date=15 January 2013|accessdate=23 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512203733/https://www.tyntec.com/fileadmin/tyntec.com/whitepapers/Whitepaper-GigaOM_tyntec_-_Converged_Mobile_Messaging_-_Jan_15_2013.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=mobilenewscwp>[http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk/2013/01/23/tyntec-predicts-surge-in-ip-based-messaging-this-year/ \"Mobile and SMS interaction service conducts study that says that IP-based mobile messaging will be just as popular as traditional SMS\"] mobile news, 23 January 2013.Retrieved: 23 January 2013</ref> Services such as [[Facebook Messenger]], [[Snapchat]], [[WhatsApp]] and [[Viber]] have led to a decline in the use of SMS in parts of the world.\n\nResearch has shown that [[women]] are more likely than men to use [[emoticons]] in text messages.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://news.rice.edu/2012/10/10/women-use-emoticons-more-than-men-in-text-messaging/ | title=Women use emoticons more than men in text messaging :-)}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n=== Microblogging ===\n{{Main|Microblogging}}\nOf many texting trends, a system known as microblogging has surfaced, which consists of a miniaturized blog, inspired mainly by people's tendency to jot down informal thoughts and post them online.

The study found that SMS message reminders could reduce the number of missed psychiatric appointments by 25\u201328%, representing a potential national yearly saving of over \u00a3150 million.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sims, H., Sanghara, H., Hayes, D., Wandiembe, S., Finch, M., Jakobsen, H., Tsakanikos, E., Okocha, C.I., Kravariti, E. |year=2012|title= Text message reminders of appointments: a pilot intervention at four community mental health clinics in london|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.201100211|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=63|issue=2|pages=161\u20138|pmid=22302334}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial uses ===\n[[File:Ejemplo de Mensaje Multimedia.jpg|right|thumb|A multimedia message displayed on a mobile phone]]\n\n==== Short codes ====\n[[Short codes]] are special telephone numbers, shorter than full telephone numbers, that can be used to address SMS and MMS messages from mobile phones or fixed phones. There are two types of short codes: dialing and messaging.\n\n==== Text messaging gateway providers ====\n[[SMS gateway]] providers facilitate the SMS traffic between businesses and mobile subscribers, being mainly responsible for carrying mission-critical messages, SMS for enterprises, content delivery and entertainment services involving SMS, e.g., TV voting. Considering SMS messaging performance and cost, as well as the level of text messaging services, [[SMS gateway]] providers can be classified as resellers of the text messaging capability of another provider's [[Short Message Service Center|SMSC]] or offering the text messaging capability as an operator of their own SMSC with [[Signaling System 7|SS7]].<ref>{{cite web|website=HSL Mobile|url=http://www.hslsms.com/technical/infrastructure/|title=Technical & Pricing Information|access-date=14 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530034309/http://www.hslsms.com/technical/infrastructure|archive-date=30 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=BudgetSMS|url=http://www.budgetsms.net/en/http-api/|title=HTTP SMS API - Easy to implement - BudgetSMS.net|access-date=14 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204203134/http://budgetsms.net/en/http-api/|archive-date=4 February 2016}}</ref> SMS messaging gateway providers can provide gateway-to-mobile (Mobile Terminated\u2013MT) services. Some suppliers can also supply mobile-to-gateway (text-in or Mobile Originated/MO services). Many operate text-in services on short codes or mobile number ranges, whereas others use lower-cost geographic text-in numbers.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|author=Andrew Orlowski|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/18/aql_textable_landlines/|title=Cheapo textable landline numbers for all|website=The Register|date=2008-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==== Premium content ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nSMS is widely used for delivering digital content, such as news alerts, financial information, pictures, GIFs, logos and ringtones. Such messages are also known as premium-rated short messages (PSMS).<ref>{{cite web|title=Short Message Service (SMS)|url=http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/encyclopedia/index/short-message-service-sms.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208221837/http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/encyclopedia/index/short-message-service-sms.html|archive-date=2014-12-08}}</ref>  The subscribers are charged extra for receiving this premium content, and the amount is typically divided between the [[mobile network operator]] and the [[Value-added service|value added service provider]] (VASP), either through revenue share or a fixed transport fee. Services like [[Texperts|82ASK]] and [[63336|Any Question Answered]] have used the PSMS model to enable rapid response to mobile consumers' questions, using on-call teams of experts and researchers. In November 2013, amidst complaints about unsolicited charges on bills, major mobile carriers in the US agreed to stop billing for PSMS in 45 states, effectively ending its use in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bud|first1=Andrew|title=Privacy and trust: The implications of U.S. carriers ending premium SMS billing|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/12/12/premium-sms-billing/|website=VentureBeat|publisher=VentureBeat|accessdate=17 January 2017|date=2013-12-12}}</ref>\n\nOutside the United States, premium short messages are increasingly being used for \"real-world\" services. For example, some vending machines now allow payment by sending a premium-rated short message, so that the cost of the item bought is added to the user's phone bill or subtracted from the user's prepaid credits. Recently, premium messaging companies have come under fire from consumer groups due to a large number of consumers racking up huge phone bills. A new type of free-premium or hybrid-premium content has emerged with the launch of text-service websites. These sites allow registered users to receive free text messages when items they are interested in go on sale, or when new items are introduced. An alternative to inbound SMS is based on [[long number]]s (international mobile number format, e.g., +44 7624 805000, or geographic numbers that can handle voice and SMS, e.g., 01133203040<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>), which can be used in place of short codes or premium-rated short messages for SMS reception in several applications, such as [[TV voting]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/vote|title=Vote! - Eurovision Song Contest Tel Aviv 2019}}</ref> product promotions and campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p2d9w/contact|title=BBC Radio 2 - The Chris Evans Breakfast Show - Contact Us}}</ref> Long numbers are internationally available, as well as enabling businesses to have their own number, rather than short codes, which are usually shared across a lot of brands. Additionally, long numbers are non-premium inbound numbers.\n\n=== In workplaces ===\nThe use of text messaging for workplace purposes has grown significantly during the mid-2000s (decade). As companies seek competitive advantages, many employees are using new technology, collaborative applications, and real-time messaging such as SMS, [[instant messaging]], and mobile communications to connect with teammates and customers. Some practical uses of text messaging include the use of SMS for confirming delivery or other tasks, for instant communication between a service provider and a client (e.g., a [[stockbroker]] and an investor), and for sending alerts. Several universities have implemented a system of texting students and faculties campus alerts. One such example is [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://live.psu.edu/story/29845 |title=Penn State Live \u2013 PSUTXT test a success |publisher=Live.psu.edu |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=29 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320094753/http://live.psu.edu/story/29845 |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As text messaging has proliferated in business, so too have regulations governing its use. One regulation specifically governing the use of text messaging in financial-services firms engaged in stocks, equities, and securities trading is ''Regulatory Notice 07-59, Supervision of Electronic Communications, December 2007'', issued to member firms by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]]. In 07-59, FINRA noted that \"electronic communications\", \"e-mail\", and \"electronic correspondence\" may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finra.org/RulesRegulation/NoticestoMembers/2007NoticestoMembers/P037554|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518161610/http://www.finra.org/RulesRegulation/NoticestoMembers/2007NoticestoMembers/P037554|archivedate=2008-05-18 |title=FINRA, Regulatory Notice 07-59, Supervision of Electronic Communications, December 2007 |publisher=Finra.org |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> Industry has had to develop new technology to allow companies to archive their employees' text messages.\n\nSecurity, confidentiality, reliability, and speed of SMS are among the most important guarantees industries such as financial services, energy and commodities trading, health care and enterprises demand in their mission-critical procedures. One way to guarantee such a quality of text messaging lies in introducing SLAs ([[Service Level Agreement]]), which are common in IT contracts. By providing measurable SLAs, corporations can define reliability parameters and set up a high quality of their services.<ref>[http://www.smstextnews.com/2008/04/tyntec_calls_for_industry_benchmarked_sms_service_level_agreements.html \"TynTec calls for industry benchmarked SMS service level agreements\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225236/http://www.smstextnews.com/2008/04/tyntec_calls_for_industry_benchmarked_sms_service_level_agreements.html |date=3 March 2016 }} Mobile Industry Review (29 April 2008)</ref> Just one of many SMS applications that have proven highly popular and successful in the financial services industry is mobile receipts. In January 2009, [[Mobile Marketing Association]] (MMA) published the ''Mobile Banking Overview'' for financial institutions in which it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of mobile channel platforms such as Short Message Services (SMS), Mobile Web, Mobile Client Applications, SMS with Mobile Web and Secure SMS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205230108/http://mmaglobal.com/mbankingoverview.pdf Mobile Banking Overview (NA)]. mmaglobal.com January 2009</ref>\n\nMobile interaction services are an alternative way of using SMS in business communications with greater certainty. Typical business-to-business applications are [[telematics]] and [[Machine-to-Machine]], in which two applications automatically communicate with each other. Incident alerts are also common, and staff communications are also another use for B2B scenarios. Businesses can use SMS for time-critical alerts, updates, and reminders, mobile campaigns, content and entertainment applications. Mobile interaction can also be used for consumer-to-business interactions, such as media voting and competitions, and consumer-to-consumer interaction, for example, with mobile social networking, chatting and dating.\n\nText messaging is widely used in business settings; as well, it is used in many [[civil service]] and [[non-governmental organization]] workplaces. The U.S. And Canadian civil service both adopted [[Blackberry (device)|Blackberry]] smartphones in the 2000s.\n\n===Group texts ===\nGroup texts involve more than two users.  In some cases, when one or more people on the group text are offline, in airplane mode, or has their device shut down, a text being sent to the group may reveal an error message that the text did not go through.  Users should rest assured, that all online or available users on the group received the message and that re-sending the message will only result in some participants receiving the message multiple times.\n\n=== Online SMS services ===\nThere are a growing number of websites that allow users to send free SMS messages online. Some websites provide free SMS for promoting premium business packages.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== Worldwide use ===\n==== Europe ====\n[[File: SMS roaming welcome messages - Redvers.jpg|thumb|SMS is used to send \"welcome\" messages to mobile phones [[roaming]] between countries. Here, [[T-Mobile]] welcomes a [[Proximus]] subscriber to the UK, and [[Base (mobile telephony provider)|Base]] welcomes an [[Orange United Kingdom|Orange]] UK customer to Belgium.]]\nEurope follows next behind Asia in terms of the popularity of the use of SMS. In 2003, an average of 16 billion messages were sent each month. Users in Spain sent a little more than fifty messages per month on average in 2003. In Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, the figure was around 35\u201340 SMS messages per month. In each of these countries, the cost of sending an SMS message varies from \u20ac0.04\u20130.23, depending on the payment plan (with many contractual plans including all or several texts for free). In the United Kingdom, text messages are charged between \u00a30.05\u20130.12. Curiously, France has not taken to SMS in the same way, sending just under 20 messages on average per user per month. France has the same [[GSM]] technology as other European countries, so the uptake is not hampered by technical restrictions.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, 1.5 billion messages are sent every quarter, on average 114 messages per person per month.<ref name=\"RTE report\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0926/comreg-business.html |title=RTE article on Ireland SMS usage |publisher=Rte.ie |date=26 September 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, {{as of|2012|03||lc=yes|post=,}} over 1 billion text messages were sent every week.<ref name=\"Mobile Data Association UK\">{{cite web|publisher=Mobile Data Association |url=http://www.text.it/mediacentre/press_release_list.cfm?thePublicationID=0F3FA21C-15C5-F4C0-99335F38D7517452 |title=One billion text messages are sent every week in the UK |accessdate=29 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402092410/http://www.text.it/mediacentre/press_release_list.cfm?thePublicationID=0F3FA21C-15C5-F4C0-99335F38D7517452 |archivedate=2 April 2012 }}</ref> The [[Eurovision Song Contest]] organized the first pan-European SMS voting in 2002, as a part of the voting system (there was also a voting over traditional landline phone lines). In 2005, the Eurovision Song Contest organized the biggest televoting ever (with SMS and phone voting). During [[roaming]], that is, when a user connects to another network in different country from his own, the prices may be higher, but in July 2009, EU legislation went into effect limiting this price to \u20ac0.11.<ref>{{cite web| title= The new proposal for reducing roaming prices | url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/roaming/regulation/index_en.htm | accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref>\n\nMobile-service providers in Finland offer contracts in which users can send 1000 text messages a month for \u20ac10. In Finland, which has very high mobile phone ownership rates, some TV channels began \"SMS chat\", which involved sending short messages to a phone number, and the messages would be shown on TV. Chats are always moderated, which prevents users from sending offensive material to the channel. The craze evolved into quizzes and strategy games and then faster-paced games designed for television and SMS control. Games require users to register their nickname and send short messages to control a character onscreen. Messages usually cost 0.05 to 0.86 Euro apiece, and games can require the player to send dozens of messages. In December 2003, a Finnish TV channel, [[MTV3]], put a [[Santa Claus]] character on-air reading aloud text messages sent in by viewers. On 12 March 2004, the first entirely \"interactive\" TV channel, VIISI, began operation in Finland. However, SBS Finland Oy took over the channel and turned it into a music channel named ''The Voice'' in November 2004. In 2006, the [[Prime Minister of Finland]], [[Matti Vanhanen]], made the news when he allegedly broke up with his girlfriend with a text message.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 2007, the first book written solely in text messages, ''[[Viimeiset viestit]]'' (''Last Messages''), was released by Finnish author [[Hannu Luntiala]]. It is about an executive who travels through Europe and India.\n\n==== United States ====\nIn the United States, text messaging is very popular; as reported by CTIA in December 2009, the 286 million US subscribers sent 152.7 billion text messages per month, for an average of 534 messages per subscriber per month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctia.org/consumer_info/service/index.cfm/AID/10323|title=Wireless Quick Facts|website=[[CTIA (organization)|CTIA]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420031936/http://www.ctia.org/consumer_info/service/index.cfm/AID/10323|archive-date=20 April 2010}}</ref> The [[Pew Research Center]] found in May 2010 that 72% of U.S. adult cellphone users send and receive text messages.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Kristen Purcell|author2=Roger Entner|author3=Nichole Henderson|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2010/09/14/the-rise-of-apps-culture/|title=The Rise of Apps Culture|website=Pew Research Center\u2019s Internet & American Life Project|date=14 September 2010|access-date=13 February 2020}}</ref> In the U.S., SMS is often charged both at the sender and at the destination, but, unlike phone calls, it cannot be rejected or dismissed. The reasons for lower uptake than other countries are varied. Many users have unlimited \"mobile-to-mobile\" minutes, high monthly minute allotments, or unlimited service. Moreover, \"[[push to talk]]\" services offer the instant connectivity of SMS and are typically unlimited. The integration between competing providers and technologies necessary for cross-network text messaging was not initially available. Some providers originally charged extra for texting, reducing its appeal. In the third quarter of 2006, at least 12 billion text messages were sent on AT&T's network, up almost 15% from the preceding quarter. In the U.S., while texting is mainly popular among people from 13\u201322 years old, it is also increasing among adults and business users. The age that a child receives his/her first cell phone has also decreased, making text messaging a popular way of communicating. The number of texts sent in the US has gone up over the years as the price has gone down to an average of $0.10 per text sent and received. To convince more customers to buy unlimited text messaging plans, some major cellphone providers have increased the price to send and receive text messages from $.15 to $.20 per message.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nextel.com/en/services/messaging/text_messaging.shtml|title=Sprint Nextel Text Messaging|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325030540/http://www.nextel.com/en/services/messaging/text_messaging.shtml|archive-date=25 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/globalText?contentType=Legal%20Notice&textId=122|title=Notice of Text Messaging Increase|website=[[Verizon Wireless]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519224413/http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/globalText?contentType=Legal%20Notice&textId=122|archive-date=May 19, 2010}}</ref> This is over $1,300 per [[megabyte]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/sen-to-carriers-why-do-text-messages-cost-1300-per-meg/|title=Sen. to carriers: Why do text messages cost $1,300 per meg?|website=[[ZDNet]]|date=10 September 2008}}</ref> Many providers offer unlimited plans, which can result in a lower rate per text, given sufficient volume.\n\n==== Japan ====\nJapan was among the first countries to adopt short messages widely, with pioneering non-GSM services including [[SoftBank Mobile|J-Phone]]'s [[SkyMail]] and [[NTT Docomo]]'s [[Short Mail]]. Japanese adolescents first began text messaging, because it was a cheaper form of communication than the other available forms. Thus, Japanese theorists created the selective interpersonal relationship theory, claiming that mobile phones can change social networks among young people (classified as 13- to 30-year-olds). They theorized this age group had extensive but low-quality relationships with friends, and mobile-phone usage may facilitate improvement in the quality of their relationships. They concluded this age group prefers \"selective interpersonal relationships in which they maintain particular, partial, but rich relations, depending on the situation.\"<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0265407505056492 |author=Igarashi, T., Takai, J., & Yoshida, T. |year=2005|title=Gender differences in social network development via mobile phone text messages: A longitudinal study|journal=[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]|volume=22|issue=5|pages=691\u2013713}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00023.x|author=Ishii, Kenichi|title=Implications of Mobility: The Uses of Personal Communication Media in Everyday Life|year=2006|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=56|issue=2|pages=346\u2013365}}</ref> The same studies showed participants rated friendships in which they communicated face-to-face and through text messaging as being more intimate than those in which they communicated solely face-to-face. This indicates participants make new relationships with face-to-face communication at an early stage but use text messaging to increase their contact later on. As the relationships between participants grew more intimate, the frequency of text messaging also increased. However, short messaging has been largely rendered obsolete by the prevalence of mobile Internet e-mail, which can be sent to and received from any e-mail address, mobile or otherwise. That said, while usually presented to the user simply as a uniform \"mail\" service (and most users are unaware of the distinction), the operators may still internally transmit the content as short messages, especially if the destination is on the same network.\n\n==== China ====\nText messaging is popular and cheap in China. About 700 billion messages were sent in 2007. Text message spam is also a problem in China. In 2007, 353.8 billion spam messages were sent, up 93% from the previous year. It is about 12.44 messages per week per person. It is routine that the People's Republic of China government monitor text messages across the country for illegal content.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/world/20text.html | work=The New York Times | first=Sharon | last=Lafraniere | title=China to Scan Text Messages to Spot 'Unhealthy Content' | date=20 January 2010}}</ref>\nAmong Chinese migrant workers with little formal education, it is common to refer to SMS manuals when text messaging.

In 1998, Philippine mobile-service providers launched SMS more widely across the country, with initial television marketing campaigns targeting hearing-impaired users. The service was initially free with subscriptions, but Filipinos quickly exploited the feature to communicate for free instead of using voice calls, which they would be charged for. After telephone companies realized this trend, they began charging for SMS. The rate across networks is 1 peso per SMS (about US$0.023).  Even after users were charged for SMS, it remained cheap, about one-tenth of the price of a voice call.  This low price led to about five million Filipinos owning a cell phone by 2001.<ref name=\"Rheingold, Howard 2002\"/> Because of the highly social nature of Philippine culture and the affordability of SMS compared to voice calls, SMS usage shot up. Filipinos used texting not only for social messages but also for political purposes, as it allowed the Filipinos to express their opinions on current events and political issues.<ref>[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/07/biztech/articles/05talk.html Manila's Talk of the Town Is Text Messaging].

A person may now carry out a conversation with another user without the constraint of being expected to reply within a short amount of time and without needing to set time aside to engage in conversation. With voice calling, both participants need to be free at the same time. Mobile phone users can maintain communication during situations in which a voice call is impractical, impossible, or unacceptable, such as during a school class or work meeting. Texting has provided a venue for [[participatory culture]], allowing viewers to vote in online and TV polls, as well as receive information while they are on the move. Texting can also bring people together and create a sense of community through \"[[Smart mob|Smart Mobs]]\" or \"Net War\", which create \"people power\".<ref name=\"Rheingold, Howard 2002\"/> \nResearch has also proven that text messaging is somehow making the social distances larger and could be ruining verbal communication skills for many people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremology.com/2015/03/five-harmful-effect-of-mobile-phone-in-our-social-life.html|title=5 Negative Effects of Mobile Phone In Our Social Life|author=Shoeb Adnan|date=14 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Effect on language ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2008}}\n{{Main|SMS language}}\n[[File:SillyModernSociety.jpg|thumb|This sticker seen in Paris satirizes the popularity of communication in SMS shorthand. In French: \"Is that you? / It's me! / Do you love me? / Shut up!\"]]\nThe small [[telephone keypad|phone keypad]] and the rapidity of typical text message exchanges has caused a number spelling abbreviations: as in the phrase \"txt msg\", \"u\" (an abbreviation for \"you\"), \"HMU\"(\u201chit me up\u201d; i.e., call me), or use of [[CamelCase]], such as in \"ThisIsVeryLame\". To avoid the even more limited message lengths allowed when using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] or [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters, speakers of languages written in those alphabets often use the [[Latin alphabet]] for their own [[language]]. In certain languages utilizing [[diacritic]] marks, such as Polish, SMS technology created an entire new variant of written language: characters normally written with diacritic marks (e.g., ''[[\u0105]]'', ''[[\u0119]]'', ''[[\u015b]]'', ''[[\u017c]]'' in Polish) are now being written without them (as ''a'', ''e'', ''s'', ''z'') to enable using cell phones without Polish [[Writing system|script]] or to save space in [[Unicode]] messages. Historically, this language developed out of shorthand used in [[bulletin board system]]s and later in Internet [[chat room]]s, where users would abbreviate some words to allow a response to be typed more quickly, though the amount of time saved was often inconsequential. However, this became much more pronounced in SMS, where mobile phone users either have a numeric keyboard (with older cellphones) or a small [[QWERTY]] keyboard (for 2010s-era smartphones), so more effort is required to type each character, and there is sometimes a limit on the number of characters that may be sent. In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], numbers that sound similar to words are used in place of those words. For example, the numbers 520 in Chinese (''w\u01d4 \u00e8r l\u00edng'') sound like the words for \"I love you\" (''w\u01d2 \u00e0i n\u01d0''). The sequence 748 (''q\u012b s\u00ec b\u0101'') sounds like the curse \"go to hell\" (''q\u00f9 s\u01d0 ba'').\n\n[[Predictive text]] software, which attempts to guess words ([[Tegic]]'s [[T9 (predictive text)|T9]] as well as [[iTap]]) or [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] (Eatoni's [[LetterWise]]) reduces the labour of time-consuming input. This makes abbreviations not only less necessary, but slower to type than regular words that are in the software's [[dictionary]]. However, it makes the messages longer, often requiring the text message to be sent in multiple parts and, therefore, costing more to send. The use of text messaging has changed the way that people talk and write essays, some<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/literacy/oconnor.htm|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613085439/http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/literacy/oconnor.htm|archive-date=13 June 2010|title=Instant Messaging: Friend or Foe of Student Writing? |publisher=Newhorizons.org |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> believing it to be harmful.

The use of [[diacritic]] marks is dropped in languages such as French, as well as symbols in [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian languages]]. In his book, ''[[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8]]'' (which translates as \"Texting: the Great Debate\"), [[David Crystal]] states that texters in all eleven languages use \"lol\" (\"laughing out loud\"), \"u\", \"brb\" (\"be right back\"), and \"gr8\" (\"great\"), all English-based shorthands. The use of pictograms and logograms in texts are present in every language. They shorten words by using symbols to represent the word or symbols whose name sounds like a syllable of the word such as in 2day or b4. This is commonly used in other languages as well. Crystal gives some examples in several languages such as Italian ''sei'', \"six\", is used for ''sei'', \"you are\". Example: dv6 = dove sei (\"where are you\") and French k7 = ''cassette'' (\"casette\"). There is also the use of numeral sequences, substituting for several syllables of a word and creating whole phrases using numerals. For example, in French, a12c4 can be said as ''\u00e0 un de ces quatres'', \"see you around\" (literally: \"to one of these four ''[days]''\"). An example of using symbols in texting and borrowing from English is the use of ''@''. Whenever it is used in texting, its intended use is with the English pronunciation. Crystal gives the example of the Welsh use of ''@'' in ''@F'', pronounced ataf, meaning \"to me\". In character-based languages such as Chinese and Japanese, numbers are assigned syllables based on the shortened form of the pronunciation of the number, sometimes the English pronunciation of the number. In this way, numbers alone can be used to communicate whole passages, such as in Chinese, \"8807701314520\" can be literally translated as \"Hug hug you, kiss kiss you, whole life, whole life I love you.\" English influences worldwide texting in variation but still in combination with the individual properties of languages.<ref>Crystal, David [https://books.google.com/books?id=pKBnEGwmtZoC&pg=PA131 Txtng: the gr8 db8]. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. pp. 131\u2013137 {{ISBN|0-19-162340-7}}</ref>\n\nAmerican [[popular culture]] is also recognized in shorthand. For example, [[Homer Simpson]] translates into: ~(_8^(|).<ref>''The New Yorker'' \"Thumbspeak\" Menand, Louis. 20 October 2008.</ref> Crystal also suggests that texting has led to more creativity in the English language, giving people opportunities to create their own slang, [[emoticon]]s, abbreviations, acronyms, etc. The feeling of individualism and freedom makes texting more popular and a more efficient way to communicate.<ref>Crystal, David: the gr8 db8. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Print.</ref> Crystal has also been quoted in saying that \"In a logical world, text messaging should not have survived.\" But text messaging didn't just come out of nowhere. It originally began as a messaging system that would send out emergency information. But it gained immediate popularity with the public. What followed is the SMS we see today, which is a very quick and efficient way of sharing information from person to person. Work by [[Richard Ling]] has shown that texting has a gendered dimension and it plays into the development of teen identity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=\"Girls Text Really Weird\": Gender, Texting and Identity Among Teens | doi=10.1080/17482798.2014.931290 | volume=8|issue=4 |journal=Journal of Children and Media|pages=423\u2013439|date=2014-10-02 |last1=Ling |first1=Rich |last2=Baron |first2=Naomi S. |last3=Lenhart |first3=Amanda |last4=Campbell |first4=Scott W. }}</ref> In addition we text to a very small number of other persons.

However, the exact opposite was true for informal writing. This suggests that perhaps the act of using textisms to shorten communication words leads young adults to produce more informal writing, which may then help them to be better \"informal\" writers. Due to text messaging, teens are writing more, and some teachers see that this comfort with language can be harnessed to make better writers.  This new form of communication may be encouraging students to put their thoughts and feelings into words and this may be able to be used as a bridge, to get them more interested in formal writing.{{According to whom|date=November 2015}}\n\n[[Joan H. Lee]] in her thesis ''What does txting do 2 language: The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints'' (2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/MR/75/MR75222.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220031841/http://gradworks.umi.com/MR/75/MR75222.html|archivedate=2012-02-20|title=What does txting do 2 language: The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints|accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> associates exposure to text messaging with more rigid acceptability constraints. The thesis suggests that more exposure to the colloquial, [[Generation text|Generation Text]] language of text messaging contributes to being less accepting of words. In contrast, Lee found that students with more exposure to traditional print media (such as books and magazines) were more accepting of both real and fictitious words. The thesis, which garnered international media attention, also presents a [[literature review]] of [[Academic publishing|academic literature]] on the effects of text messaging on language. Texting has also been shown to have had no effect or some positive effects on [[literacy]].

However, they also found that the gait pattern texters adopted was slower and more \"protective\", and consequently did not increase obstacle contact or tripping in a typical pedestrian context.<ref name=\"Licence2015\" />\n\nThere have also been technological approaches to increase the safety/awareness of pedestrians that are (inattentionally) blind while using a smart phone, e.g., using a [[Kinect]]<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Hincapi\u00e9-Ramos|first1=Juan David|last2=Irani|first2=Pourang|title=CrashAlert: Enhancing Peripheral Alertness for Eyes-busy Mobile Interaction While Walking|conference=SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|date=1 January 2013|pages=3385\u20133388|doi=10.1145/2470654.2466463|isbn=9781450318990}}</ref> or an ultrasound phone cover<ref>{{cite web|title=Samsung Releasing Smartphone-Paired Technologies for Blind People|url=http://www.medgadget.com/2014/03/samsung-releasing-smartphone-paired-technologies-for-blind-people.html|website=medGadget|accessdate=10 November 2016|date=2014-03-17}}</ref> as a virtual white cane, or using the built-in camera to algorithmically analyze single,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Peng|first1=En|last2=Peursum|first2=Patrick|last3=Li|first3=Ling|last4=Venkatesh|first4=Svetha|title=A Smartphone-Based Obstacle Sensor for the Visually Impaired|journal=International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing|volume=6406|date=26 October 2010|pages=590\u2013604|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-16355-5_45|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-642-16354-8|hdl=20.500.11937/14536}}</ref> respectively a stream of pictures<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Foerster|first1=Klaus-Tycho|last2=Gross|first2=Alex|last3=Hail|first3=Nino|last4=Uitto|first4=Jara|last5=Wattenhofer|first5=Roger|title=SpareEye: Enhancing the Safety of Inattentionally Blind Smartphone Users|conference=13th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia|date=1 January 2014|pages=68\u201372|doi=10.1145/2677972.2677973|isbn=9781450333047}}</ref> for obstacles, with Wang et al. proposing to use machine learning to specifically detect incoming vehicles.<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Wang|first1=Tianyu|last2=Cardone|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Corradi|first3=Antonio|last4=Torresani|first4=Lorenzo|last5=Campbell|first5=Andrew T.|title=WalkSafe: A Pedestrian Safety App for Mobile Phone Users Who Walk and Talk While Crossing Roads|conference=Twelfth Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems & Applications|date=1 January 2012|pages=5:1\u20135:6|doi=10.1145/2162081.2162089|isbn=9781450312073}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexting ===\n{{Main|Sexting}}\nSexting is slang for the act of sending sexually explicit or suggestive content between mobile devices using SMS.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Risks and Threats\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/encyclopedia/index/sexting.html|title=Encyclopedia of Risks and Threats|website=MySecureCyberspace|access-date=13 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922034520/http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/encyclopedia/index/sexting.html|archive-date=22 September 2009}}</ref> A genre of texting, it contains either text, images, or video that is intended to be sexually arousing.

One in five teen girls surveyed (22 percent)\u2014and 11 percent of teen girls aged 13\u201316 years old\u2014say they have electronically sent, or posted online, nude or semi-nude images of themselves. One-third (33 percent) of teen boys and one-quarter (25 percent) of teen girls say they were shown private nude or semi-nude images. According to the survey, sexually suggestive messages (text, e-mail, and instant messaging) were even more common than images, with 39 percent of teens having sent or posted such messages, and half of teens (50 percent) having received them. A 2012 study that has received wide international media attention was conducted at the [[University of Utah]] Department of Psychology by Donald S. Strassberg, Ryan Kelly McKinnon, Michael Susta\u00edta and Jordan Rullo. They surveyed 606 teenagers ages 14\u201318 and found that nearly 20 percent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves via cell phone, and nearly twice as many said that they had received a sexually explicit picture. Of those receiving such a picture, over 25 percent indicated that they had forwarded it to others.\n\nIn addition, of those who had sent a sexually explicit picture, over a third had done so despite believing that there could be serious legal and other consequences if they got caught. Students who had sent a picture by cell phone were more likely than others to find the activity acceptable. The authors conclude: \"These results argue for educational efforts such as cell phone safety assemblies, awareness days, integration into class curriculum and teacher training, designed to raise awareness about the potential consequences of sexting among young people.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strassberg|first=Donald|last2=McKinnon|first2=Ryan K.|title=Sexting by High School Students: An Exploratory and Descriptive Study|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=7 June 2012|doi=10.1007/s10508-012-9969-8|volume=42|issue=1|pages=15\u201321|pmid=22674035}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Maffly|first=Brian|title='Sexting' prevalent among high-schoolers, study finds|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54324965-78/explicit-messages-nearly-onlinetoday.html.csp|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Lois|title=As many as 20% of teens have 'sexted', according to new study|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765583658/As-many-as-20-of-teens-have-sexted.html?pg=all|newspaper=Deseret News|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=2012-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sending Sexually Explicit Photos by Cell Phone Is Common Among Teens|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120613132939.htm|website=Science Daily|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U Study Finds 'Sexting' More Common Among Teens Than You Might Think|url=http://unews.utah.edu/news_releases/u-study-finds-sending-sexually-explicit-photos-by-cell-phone-more-common-among-teen-than-you-might-think/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Sexting' Prevalent Among High-Schoolers, Study Finds|url=http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/display/NewsDisplay.asp?NewsNbr=59999|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414191154/http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/display/NewsDisplay.asp?NewsNbr=59999|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 April 2013|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Prevention Information Network|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nauert|first=Rick|title=1 in 5 Teens 'Sexting' \u2013 Many Without a Clue|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2012/06/14/1-in-5-teens-sexting-many-without-a-clue/40142.html|publisher=PsychCentral|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U study: More teens 'sext' than previously thought|url=http://fox13now.com/2012/06/14/u-of-u-study-says-high-percentage-of-teens-sharing-sexting-pics/|publisher=Fox 13 News|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=2012-06-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Most teens unaware about legal consequences of sexting: Study|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/personal-tech/computing/Most-teens-unaware-about-legal-consequences-of-sexting-Study/articleshow/14128744.cms|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615101011/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/personal-tech/computing/Most-teens-unaware-about-legal-consequences-of-sexting-Study/articleshow/14128744.cms|archivedate=2012-06-15|newspaper=Times of India|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sexting is More Common Among Teens Than Previously Thought, Say Researchers|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/352901/20120616/sexting-more-common-teens-previously-thought-researchers.htm|website=International Business Times|accessdate=5 July 2012|date=2012-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Why teens indulge in so much 'sexting'?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/sexandrelationships/why-teens-indulge-in-so-much-sexting/article1-872741.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306102703/http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/sexandrelationships/why-teens-indulge-in-so-much-sexting/article1-872741.aspx|archivedate=2014-03-06|newspaper=Hindustan Times|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> Sexting becomes a legal issue when teens (under 18) are involved, because any nude photos they may send of themselves would put the recipients in possession of child pornography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/schultz/blog/index.ssf/2008/12/connie_schultz_making_kids_to.html|title=Connie Schultz: Making kids to tell law's naked truth is the perfect sentence|website=The Plain Dealer|date=13 December 2008|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090201173208/http://www.cleveland.com/schultz/blog/index.ssf/2008/12/connie_schultz_making_kids_to.html|archive-date=1 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== In schools ===\n[[File:Textinginclass.jpg|thumb|Two girls text during class at school]]\nText messaging has affected students academically by creating an easier way to cheat on exams.

Text \"bullying\" of this sort can cause distress and damage reputations. In some cases, individuals who are bullied online have committed suicide. Harding and Rosenberg (2005) argue that the urge to forward text messages can be difficult to resist, describing text messages as \"loaded weapons\".<ref>Harding, S. & Rosenberg, D. (Ed). (2005).

In a study by Lewandowski and Harrington (2006), participants read a student's email sent to a professor that either contained text-messaging abbreviations (gr8, How R U?) or parallel text in standard English (great, How are you?), and then provided impressions of the sender.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The influence of phonetic abbreviations on evaluation of student performance |first1=Gary |last1=Lewandowski |first2=Samantha |last2=Harrington |journal=Current Research in Social Psychology |volume=11 |issue=15 |year=2006 |pages=215\u2013226 |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~grpproc/crisp/crisp11_15.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105223126/http://www.uiowa.edu/~grpproc/crisp/crisp11_15.pdf |archivedate=5 January 2014 }}</ref> Students who used abbreviations in their email were perceived as having a less favorable personality and as putting forth less effort on an essay they submitted along with the email. Specifically, abbreviation users were seen as less intelligent, responsible, motivated, studious, dependable, and hard-working. These findings suggest that the nature of a student's email communication can influence how others perceive the student and their work.\n\n=== Law and crime ===\nText messaging has been a subject of interest for police forces around the world. One of the issues of concern to [[law enforcement]] agencies is the use of [[encryption|encrypted]] text messages. In 2003, a British company developed a program called Fortress SMS which used 128 bit AES [[encryption]] to protect SMS messages.<ref>Fortress SMS technical report</ref> Police have also retrieved deleted text messages to aid them in solving crimes. For example, Swedish police retrieved deleted texts from a cult member who claimed she committed a double murder based on forwarded texts she received.<ref>Robert Burnett; Ylva H\u00e5rd af Segerstad (8 September 2005). \"The SMS murder mystery\" in Safety and Security in a Networked World.

Increasing cases of Internet [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]] are now also being linked to text messaging, as mobile phones are now more likely to have e-mail and Web capabilities to complement the ability to text.\n\n=== Etiquette ===\nTexting etiquette refers to what is considered appropriate texting behavior. These expectations may concern different areas, such as the context in which a text was sent and received/read, who each participant was with when the participant sent or received/read a text message or what constitutes impolite text messages.<ref name=\"Shuter 2010 123\">{{cite journal|last=Shuter|first=Robert|first2=Sumana|last2=Chattopadhyay|title=Emerging Interpersonal Norms of Text Messaging in India and the United States|journal=[[Journal of Intercultural Communication Research]]|year=2010|volume=29|issue=2|pages=123\u2013147|doi=10.1080/17475759.2010.526319}}</ref> At the website of [[The Emily Post Institute]], the topic of ''texting'' has spurred several articles with the \"do's and dont's\" regarding the new form of communication. One example from the site is: \"Keep your message brief.

Typing a text message in all capital letters will appear as though you are shouting at the recipient, and should be avoided.\"\n\nExpectations for etiquette may differ depending on various factors.  For example, expectations for appropriate behavior have been found to differ markedly between the U.S. and India.<ref name=\"Shuter 2010 123\"/>  Another example is generational differences. In ''The M-Factor: How the Millennial Generation Is Rocking the Workplace'', Lynne Lancaster and David Stillman note that younger Americans often do not consider it rude to answer their cell or begin texting in the middle of a face-to-face conversation with someone else, while older people, less used to the behavior and the accompanying lack of eye contact or attention, find this to be disruptive and ill-mannered.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} With regard to texting in the workplace, [[Plantronics]] studied how we communicate at work] and found that 58% of US knowledge workers have increased the use of text messaging for work in the past five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/howwework/|title=How do we communicate in business today?|website=[[Plantronics]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223174930/http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/howwework/|archive-date=23 December 2010}}</ref>  The same study found that 33% of knowledge workers felt text messaging was critical or very important to success and productivity at work.<ref name=alison>{{cite web|author=Alison Diana|website=InformationWeek|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/smb/network/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227501053|title=Executives Demand Communications Arsenal|date=30 September 2010|access-date=11 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120014407/http://www.informationweek.com/news/smb/network/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227501053|archive-date=20 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Challenges ==\n=== Spam ===\n{{Further|Mobile phone spam}}\nIn 2002, an increasing trend towards [[Mobile phone spam|spamming]] mobile phone users through SMS prompted cellular-service carriers to take steps against the practice, before it became a widespread problem.

[[AT&T Mobility]], along with most other service providers, charges texters 20 cents per message if they do not have a messaging plan or if they have exceeded their allotted number of texts. Given that an SMS message is at most 160 [[bytes]] in size, this cost scales to a cost of $1,310<ref name=\"crunchgear.com\"/> per megabyte sent via text message. This is in sharp contrast with the price of unlimited data plans offered by the same carriers, which allow the transmission of hundreds of megabytes of data for monthly prices of about $15 to $45 in addition to a voice plan.  As a comparison, a one-minute phone call uses up the same amount of network capacity as 600 text messages,<ref>Ashley Jones{{cite web|url=http://universe.byu.edu/node/1163 |title=Texting prices rise as carriers make profits \u2013 News & Opinion \u2013 The Daily Universe |accessdate=2011-04-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328180032/http://universe.byu.edu/node/1163 |archivedate=28 March 2010 |df=dmy }} . universe.byu.edu (2009-07-28)</ref> meaning that if the same cost-per-traffic formula were applied to phone calls, cell phone calls would cost $120 per minute.  With service providers gaining more customers and expanding their capacity, their overhead costs should be decreasing, not increasing. In 2005, text messaging generated nearly 70 billion dollars in revenue, as reported by Gartner, industry analysts, three times as much as Hollywood box office sales in 2005.

These services are much cheaper and offer more functionality like exchanging of multimedia content (e.g. photos, videos or audio notes) and group messaging. Especially in western countries some of these services attract more and more users.<ref>[http://www.phonearena.com/news/The-death-of-SMS-has-been-greatly-exaggerated_id19493 The death of SMS has been greatly exaggerated]. Phonearena.com. Retrieved on 2015-06-08.</ref>\n\n=== Security concerns ===\nConsumer SMS should not be used for confidential communication. The contents of common SMS messages are known to the network operator's systems and personnel. Therefore, consumer SMS is not an appropriate technology for secure communications.<ref name=\"Gartner Research Analytical Source\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=111720 |title=Don't Use SMS for Confidential Communication |publisher=Gartner Group |date=26 November 2002 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> To address this issue, many companies use an [[SMS gateway]] provider based on [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] connectivity to route the messages. The advantage of this international termination model is the ability to route data directly through [[Signaling System 7|SS7]], which gives the provider visibility of the complete path of the SMS. This means SMS messages can be sent directly to and from recipients without having to go through the [[Short Message Service Centre|SMS-C]] of other mobile operators. This approach reduces the number of mobile operators that handle the message; however, it should not be considered as an end-to-end secure communication, as the content of the message is exposed to the [[SMS gateway]] provider.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use end-to-end security software that runs on both the sending and receiving device, where the original text message is transmitted in encrypted form as a consumer SMS. By using key rotation, the encrypted text messages stored under [[Telecommunications data retention|data retention]] laws at the network operator cannot be decrypted even if one of the devices is compromised. A problem with this approach is that communicating devices needs to run compatible software. Failure rates without backward notification can be high between carriers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} International texting can be unreliable depending on the country of origin, destination and respective operators (US: \"carriers\").

For instance, the patron doesn't need to leave his seat and miss the event in order to report something important. Also, disruptive fans can be reported with relative anonymity. \"Text tattling\" also gives security personnel a useful tool to prioritize messages. For instance, a single complaint in one section about an unruly fan can be addressed when convenient, while multiple complaints by several different patrons can be acted upon immediately.\n\n=== Smart cars ===\nIn this context, \"tattle texting\" refers to an automatic text sent by the computer in an automobile, because a preset condition was met.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The most common use for this is for parents to receive texts from the car their child is driving, alerting them to speeding or other issues. Employers can also use the service to monitor their corporate vehicles. The technology is still new and (currently) only available on a few car models.\n\nCommon conditions that can be chosen to send a text are:\n\n* '''Speeding.''' With the use of [[GPS]], stored maps, and [[speed limit]] information, the onboard computer can determine if the driver is exceeding the current speed limit. The device can store this information and/or send it to another recipient.\n* '''Range.''' Parents/employers can set a maximum range from a fixed location after which a \"tattle text\" is sent. Not only can this keep children close to home and keep employees from using corporate vehicles inappropriately, but it can also be a crucial tool for quickly identifying stolen vehicles, car jackings, and kidnappings.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Instant messaging]]\n* [[Personal message]], also called private message or direct message\n* [[Messaging apps]]\n* [[Chat language]]\n* [[Enhanced Messaging Service]]\n* [[Mobile dial code]]\n* [[Operator messaging]]\n* [[Telegram]]\n* [[Tironian notes]], [[scribal abbreviation]]s and [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]]: Roman and medieval abbreviations used to save space on manuscripts and epigraphs\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Wiktionary}}\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

Text messages may be sent over a [[cellular network]], or may also be sent via an [[Internet]] connection.\n\nThe term originally referred to messages sent using the [[SMS|Short Message Service]] (SMS). It has grown beyond alphanumeric text to include multimedia messages using the [[Multimedia Messaging Service]] (MMS) \ncontaining digital images, videos, and sound content, as well as ideograms known as [[emoji]] ([[Smiley|happy face]]s, sad faces, and other icons).\n\nText messages are used for personal, family, business and social purposes. Governmental and non-governmental organizations use text messaging for communication between colleagues.  In the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages has become an accepted part of many cultures, as happened earlier with [[email]]ing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Robert|last2=Pinchot|first2=Jamie|date=2010|title=Conference on Information Systems Applied Research|url=http://proc.conisar.org/2010/pdf/1519.pdf|journal=How Mobile Technology is Changing Our Culture|volume=3|pages=10|via=CONISAR}}</ref> This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends, family and colleagues, including in contexts where a [[telephone call|call]] would be impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at night or when one knows the other person is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail and [[voicemail]] and unlike calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting does not require the caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits communication even between busy individuals.  Text messages can also be used to interact with automated systems, for example, to order products or services from [[e-commerce]] websites, or to participate in online contests. Advertisers and service providers use [[Direct Text Marketing|direct text marketing]] to send messages to mobile users about promotions, payment due dates, and other notifications instead of using [[Mail|postal mail]], [[email]], or [[voicemail]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe service is referred to by different [[colloquialism]]s depending on the region. It may simply be referred to as a \"text\" in North America, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines, an \"SMS\" in most of mainland Europe, or an \"MMS\" or \"SMS\" in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The sender of a text message is commonly referred to as a \"texter\".\n\n== History ==\nThe [[electrical telegraph]] systems, developed in the early 19th century, used simple electrical signals to send text messages. In the late 19th century, the [[wireless telegraphy]] was developed using [[radio waves]].\n\nIn 1933, the German ''[[Reichspost]]'' ([[Reich]] postal service) introduced the first \"[[telex]]\" service.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title                 = Fifty years of telex\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/?id=VjMgAQAAMAAJ&q=%22world%27s+first+public+teleprinter+network%22\n| journal               = Telecommunication Journal\n| date      = 1984\n| volume                = 51\n| page                  = 35 \n| access-date           = 2017-05-18\n| quote                 = Just over fifty years ago, in October 1933, the ''Deutsche Reichspost'' as it was then known, opened the world's first public teleprinter network.\n}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite news\n| last1                 = Herbst\n| first1                = Kris\n| last2                 = Ubois\n| first2                = Jeff\n| title                 = The competition\n| newspaper             = [[Network World]]\n| volume                = 5\n| issue                 = 46\n| date                  = November 14, 1988\n| publisher             = IDG Network World Inc\n| page                  = 68\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=exIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68\n| issn                  = 0887-7661\n| access-date           = 2017-12-29\n| quote                 = Telex originated in Germany and rapidly expanded to other countries after World War II. \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe University of Hawaii began using radio to send digital information as early as 1971, using [[ALOHAnet]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} [[Friedhelm Hillebrand]] conceptualised SMS in 1984 while working for [[Deutsche Telekom]].

Modern SMS text messaging is {{by whom|date=February 2016}} usually messaging from one mobile phone to another. Finnish [[Radiolinja]] became the first network to offer a commercial person-to-person SMS text messaging service in 1994. When Radiolinja's domestic competitor, Telecom Finland (now part of [[TeliaSonera]]) also launched SMS text messaging in 1995 and the two networks offered cross-network SMS functionality, Finland became the first nation where SMS text messaging was offered on a competitive as well as on a commercial basis. GSM was allowed{{by whom|date=February 2016}} in the United States and the radio frequencies were blocked and awarded to US \"Carriers\" to use US technology. Hence there is no \"development\" in the US in mobile messaging service. The GSM in the US had to use a frequency allocated for [[Personal Communications Service|private communication service]]s (PCS) \u2013 what the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] frequency r\u00e9gime had blocked for DECT \u2013 [[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications]] \u2013 1000-feet range picocell, but survived. American Personal Communications (APC), the first GSM carrier in America, provided the first text-messaging service in the United States.  Sprint Telecommunications Venture, a partnership of Sprint Corp. and three large cable-TV companies, owned 49 percent of APC. The Sprint venture was the largest single buyer at a government-run spectrum auction that raised $7.7 billion in 2005 for PCS licenses.  APC operated under the brand name of Sprint Spectrum and launched its service on November 15, 1995, in Washington, D.C. and in Baltimore, Maryland.

In many markets, the service is comparatively cheap. For example, in Australia, a message typically costs between [[Australian dollar|A$]]0.20 and $0.25 to send (some prepaid services charge $0.01 between their own phones), compared with a voice call, which costs somewhere between $0.40 and $2.00 per minute (commonly charged in half-minute blocks). The service is enormously profitable to the service providers. At a typical length of only 190&nbsp;bytes (including protocol overhead), more than 350 of these messages per minute can be transmitted at the same data rate as a usual voice call (9&nbsp;kbit/s). There are also free SMS services available, which are often sponsored, that allow sending<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://globfone.com/send-text/ |title = Send text free}}</ref> and receiving<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://thesmsbay.com/ |title = Receive Texts for Free &#124; the SMS Bay}}</ref> SMS from a PC connected to the internet. Mobile service providers in New Zealand, such as [[Vodafone]] and [[Telecom NZ]], provide up to 2000 SMS messages for NZ$10 per month. Users on these plans send on average 1500 SMS messages every month. Text messaging has become so popular that advertising agencies and advertisers are now jumping into the text messaging business. Services that provide bulk text message sending are also becoming a popular way for clubs, associations, and advertisers to reach a group of opt-in subscribers quickly.\n\nResearch suggests that Internet-based mobile messaging will have grown to equal the popularity of SMS in 2013, with nearly 10 trillion messages being sent through each technology.<ref name=Tyntec>{{cite web|url=https://www.tyntec.com/fileadmin/tyntec.com/whitepapers/Whitepaper-GigaOM_tyntec_-_Converged_Mobile_Messaging_-_Jan_15_2013.pdf|title=Converged-mobile-messaging analysis and forecasts|work=tyntec.com|first=Peter|last=Crocker|date=15 January 2013|accessdate=23 January 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512203733/https://www.tyntec.com/fileadmin/tyntec.com/whitepapers/Whitepaper-GigaOM_tyntec_-_Converged_Mobile_Messaging_-_Jan_15_2013.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=mobilenewscwp>[http://www.mobilenewscwp.co.uk/2013/01/23/tyntec-predicts-surge-in-ip-based-messaging-this-year/ \"Mobile and SMS interaction service conducts study that says that IP-based mobile messaging will be just as popular as traditional SMS\"] mobile news, 23 January 2013.Retrieved: 23 January 2013</ref> Services such as [[Facebook Messenger]], [[Snapchat]], [[WhatsApp]] and [[Viber]] have led to a decline in the use of SMS in parts of the world.\n\nResearch has shown that [[women]] are more likely than men to use [[emoticons]] in text messages.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://news.rice.edu/2012/10/10/women-use-emoticons-more-than-men-in-text-messaging/ | title=Women use emoticons more than men in text messaging :-)}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n=== Microblogging ===\n{{Main|Microblogging}}\nOf many texting trends, a system known as microblogging has surfaced, which consists of a miniaturized blog, inspired mainly by people's tendency to jot down informal thoughts and post them online. They consist of websites like [[Twitter]] and its Chinese equivalent [[Microblogging in China|Weibo]] (\u5fae\u535a). As of 2016, both of these websites were popular.\n\n=== Emergency services ===\nIn some countries, text messages can be used to contact emergency services. In the UK, text messages can be used to call emergency services only after registering with the emergency SMS service. This service is primarily aimed at people who, because of disability, are unable to make a voice call. It has recently been promoted as a means for walkers and climbers to call<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcofs.org.uk/news.asp?s=2&id=MCS-N10616&nc= |title=Mountaineering Council of Scotland news 24/11/10 |publisher=Mcofs.org.uk |date=24 November 2010 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.go4awalk.com/the-bunkhouse/walking-news-and-discussions/walking-news-and-discussions.php?news=710209 |title=goforawalk.com news December 2010 |publisher=Go4awalk.com |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> emergency services from areas where a voice call is not possible due to low signal strength.

Since the location of a handset is known, systems can alert everyone in an area that the events have made impossible to pass through e.g. an avalanche. A similar system, known as [[Emergency Alert Australia|Emergency Alert]], is used in Australia to notify the public of impending disasters through both SMS and landline phone calls. These messages can be sent based on either the location of the phone or the address to which the handset is registered.\n\n=== Reminders of hospital appointments ===\nSMS messages are used in some countries as reminders of hospital appointments. Missed outpatient clinic appointments cost the [[National Health Service (England)]] more than \u00a3600 million ($980 million) a year.<ref>Lakhani, Nina.

The Independent. Retrieved on 2012-04-05.</ref> SMS messages are thought to be more cost-effective, swifter to deliver, and more likely to receive a faster response than letters. A recent study by Sims and colleagues (2012) examined the outcomes of 24,709 outpatient appointments scheduled in mental health services in South-East London. The study found that SMS message reminders could reduce the number of missed psychiatric appointments by 25\u201328%, representing a potential national yearly saving of over \u00a3150 million.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sims, H., Sanghara, H., Hayes, D., Wandiembe, S., Finch, M., Jakobsen, H., Tsakanikos, E., Okocha, C.I., Kravariti, E. |year=2012|title= Text message reminders of appointments: a pilot intervention at four community mental health clinics in london|doi=10.1176/appi.ps.201100211|journal=Psychiatric Services|volume=63|issue=2|pages=161\u20138|pmid=22302334}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial uses ===\n[[File:Ejemplo de Mensaje Multimedia.jpg|right|thumb|A multimedia message displayed on a mobile phone]]\n\n==== Short codes ====\n[[Short codes]] are special telephone numbers, shorter than full telephone numbers, that can be used to address SMS and MMS messages from mobile phones or fixed phones. There are two types of short codes: dialing and messaging.\n\n==== Text messaging gateway providers ====\n[[SMS gateway]] providers facilitate the SMS traffic between businesses and mobile subscribers, being mainly responsible for carrying mission-critical messages, SMS for enterprises, content delivery and entertainment services involving SMS, e.g., TV voting. Considering SMS messaging performance and cost, as well as the level of text messaging services, [[SMS gateway]] providers can be classified as resellers of the text messaging capability of another provider's [[Short Message Service Center|SMSC]] or offering the text messaging capability as an operator of their own SMSC with [[Signaling System 7|SS7]].<ref>{{cite web|website=HSL Mobile|url=http://www.hslsms.com/technical/infrastructure/|title=Technical & Pricing Information|access-date=14 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530034309/http://www.hslsms.com/technical/infrastructure|archive-date=30 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=BudgetSMS|url=http://www.budgetsms.net/en/http-api/|title=HTTP SMS API - Easy to implement - BudgetSMS.net|access-date=14 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204203134/http://budgetsms.net/en/http-api/|archive-date=4 February 2016}}</ref> SMS messaging gateway providers can provide gateway-to-mobile (Mobile Terminated\u2013MT) services. Some suppliers can also supply mobile-to-gateway (text-in or Mobile Originated/MO services). Many operate text-in services on short codes or mobile number ranges, whereas others use lower-cost geographic text-in numbers.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|author=Andrew Orlowski|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/18/aql_textable_landlines/|title=Cheapo textable landline numbers for all|website=The Register|date=2008-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==== Premium content ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nSMS is widely used for delivering digital content, such as news alerts, financial information, pictures, GIFs, logos and ringtones. Such messages are also known as premium-rated short messages (PSMS).<ref>{{cite web|title=Short Message Service (SMS)|url=http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/encyclopedia/index/short-message-service-sms.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208221837/http://www.mysecurecyberspace.com/encyclopedia/index/short-message-service-sms.html|archive-date=2014-12-08}}</ref>  The subscribers are charged extra for receiving this premium content, and the amount is typically divided between the [[mobile network operator]] and the [[Value-added service|value added service provider]] (VASP), either through revenue share or a fixed transport fee. Services like [[Texperts|82ASK]] and [[63336|Any Question Answered]] have used the PSMS model to enable rapid response to mobile consumers' questions, using on-call teams of experts and researchers. In November 2013, amidst complaints about unsolicited charges on bills, major mobile carriers in the US agreed to stop billing for PSMS in 45 states, effectively ending its use in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bud|first1=Andrew|title=Privacy and trust: The implications of U.S. carriers ending premium SMS billing|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/12/12/premium-sms-billing/|website=VentureBeat|publisher=VentureBeat|accessdate=17 January 2017|date=2013-12-12}}</ref>\n\nOutside the United States, premium short messages are increasingly being used for \"real-world\" services. For example, some vending machines now allow payment by sending a premium-rated short message, so that the cost of the item bought is added to the user's phone bill or subtracted from the user's prepaid credits. Recently, premium messaging companies have come under fire from consumer groups due to a large number of consumers racking up huge phone bills. A new type of free-premium or hybrid-premium content has emerged with the launch of text-service websites. These sites allow registered users to receive free text messages when items they are interested in go on sale, or when new items are introduced. An alternative to inbound SMS is based on [[long number]]s (international mobile number format, e.g., +44 7624 805000, or geographic numbers that can handle voice and SMS, e.g., 01133203040<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>), which can be used in place of short codes or premium-rated short messages for SMS reception in several applications, such as [[TV voting]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/vote|title=Vote! - Eurovision Song Contest Tel Aviv 2019}}</ref> product promotions and campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00p2d9w/contact|title=BBC Radio 2 - The Chris Evans Breakfast Show - Contact Us}}</ref> Long numbers are internationally available, as well as enabling businesses to have their own number, rather than short codes, which are usually shared across a lot of brands. Additionally, long numbers are non-premium inbound numbers.\n\n=== In workplaces ===\nThe use of text messaging for workplace purposes has grown significantly during the mid-2000s (decade). As companies seek competitive advantages, many employees are using new technology, collaborative applications, and real-time messaging such as SMS, [[instant messaging]], and mobile communications to connect with teammates and customers. Some practical uses of text messaging include the use of SMS for confirming delivery or other tasks, for instant communication between a service provider and a client (e.g., a [[stockbroker]] and an investor), and for sending alerts. Several universities have implemented a system of texting students and faculties campus alerts. One such example is [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://live.psu.edu/story/29845 |title=Penn State Live \u2013 PSUTXT test a success |publisher=Live.psu.edu |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=29 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320094753/http://live.psu.edu/story/29845 |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As text messaging has proliferated in business, so too have regulations governing its use. One regulation specifically governing the use of text messaging in financial-services firms engaged in stocks, equities, and securities trading is ''Regulatory Notice 07-59, Supervision of Electronic Communications, December 2007'', issued to member firms by the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]]. In 07-59, FINRA noted that \"electronic communications\", \"e-mail\", and \"electronic correspondence\" may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finra.org/RulesRegulation/NoticestoMembers/2007NoticestoMembers/P037554|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518161610/http://www.finra.org/RulesRegulation/NoticestoMembers/2007NoticestoMembers/P037554|archivedate=2008-05-18 |title=FINRA, Regulatory Notice 07-59, Supervision of Electronic Communications, December 2007 |publisher=Finra.org |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> Industry has had to develop new technology to allow companies to archive their employees' text messages.\n\nSecurity, confidentiality, reliability, and speed of SMS are among the most important guarantees industries such as financial services, energy and commodities trading, health care and enterprises demand in their mission-critical procedures. One way to guarantee such a quality of text messaging lies in introducing SLAs ([[Service Level Agreement]]), which are common in IT contracts. By providing measurable SLAs, corporations can define reliability parameters and set up a high quality of their services.<ref>[http://www.smstextnews.com/2008/04/tyntec_calls_for_industry_benchmarked_sms_service_level_agreements.html \"TynTec calls for industry benchmarked SMS service level agreements\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225236/http://www.smstextnews.com/2008/04/tyntec_calls_for_industry_benchmarked_sms_service_level_agreements.html |date=3 March 2016 }} Mobile Industry Review (29 April 2008)</ref> Just one of many SMS applications that have proven highly popular and successful in the financial services industry is mobile receipts. In January 2009, [[Mobile Marketing Association]] (MMA) published the ''Mobile Banking Overview'' for financial institutions in which it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of mobile channel platforms such as Short Message Services (SMS), Mobile Web, Mobile Client Applications, SMS with Mobile Web and Secure SMS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205230108/http://mmaglobal.com/mbankingoverview.pdf Mobile Banking Overview (NA)]. mmaglobal.com January 2009</ref>\n\nMobile interaction services are an alternative way of using SMS in business communications with greater certainty. Typical business-to-business applications are [[telematics]] and [[Machine-to-Machine]], in which two applications automatically communicate with each other. Incident alerts are also common, and staff communications are also another use for B2B scenarios. Businesses can use SMS for time-critical alerts, updates, and reminders, mobile campaigns, content and entertainment applications. Mobile interaction can also be used for consumer-to-business interactions, such as media voting and competitions, and consumer-to-consumer interaction, for example, with mobile social networking, chatting and dating.\n\nText messaging is widely used in business settings; as well, it is used in many [[civil service]] and [[non-governmental organization]] workplaces. The U.S. And Canadian civil service both adopted [[Blackberry (device)|Blackberry]] smartphones in the 2000s.\n\n===Group texts ===\nGroup texts involve more than two users.  In some cases, when one or more people on the group text are offline, in airplane mode, or has their device shut down, a text being sent to the group may reveal an error message that the text did not go through.  Users should rest assured, that all online or available users on the group received the message and that re-sending the message will only result in some participants receiving the message multiple times.\n\n=== Online SMS services ===\nThere are a growing number of websites that allow users to send free SMS messages online. Some websites provide free SMS for promoting premium business packages.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n=== Worldwide use ===\n==== Europe ====\n[[File: SMS roaming welcome messages - Redvers.jpg|thumb|SMS is used to send \"welcome\" messages to mobile phones [[roaming]] between countries.

In 2003, an average of 16 billion messages were sent each month. Users in Spain sent a little more than fifty messages per month on average in 2003. In Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, the figure was around 35\u201340 SMS messages per month. In each of these countries, the cost of sending an SMS message varies from \u20ac0.04\u20130.23, depending on the payment plan (with many contractual plans including all or several texts for free). In the United Kingdom, text messages are charged between \u00a30.05\u20130.12. Curiously, France has not taken to SMS in the same way, sending just under 20 messages on average per user per month. France has the same [[GSM]] technology as other European countries, so the uptake is not hampered by technical restrictions.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, 1.5 billion messages are sent every quarter, on average 114 messages per person per month.<ref name=\"RTE report\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0926/comreg-business.html |title=RTE article on Ireland SMS usage |publisher=Rte.ie |date=26 September 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, {{as of|2012|03||lc=yes|post=,}} over 1 billion text messages were sent every week.<ref name=\"Mobile Data Association UK\">{{cite web|publisher=Mobile Data Association |url=http://www.text.it/mediacentre/press_release_list.cfm?thePublicationID=0F3FA21C-15C5-F4C0-99335F38D7517452 |title=One billion text messages are sent every week in the UK |accessdate=29 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402092410/http://www.text.it/mediacentre/press_release_list.cfm?thePublicationID=0F3FA21C-15C5-F4C0-99335F38D7517452 |archivedate=2 April 2012 }}</ref> The [[Eurovision Song Contest]] organized the first pan-European SMS voting in 2002, as a part of the voting system (there was also a voting over traditional landline phone lines). In 2005, the Eurovision Song Contest organized the biggest televoting ever (with SMS and phone voting). During [[roaming]], that is, when a user connects to another network in different country from his own, the prices may be higher, but in July 2009, EU legislation went into effect limiting this price to \u20ac0.11.<ref>{{cite web| title= The new proposal for reducing roaming prices | url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/roaming/regulation/index_en.htm | accessdate=2010-06-23}}</ref>\n\nMobile-service providers in Finland offer contracts in which users can send 1000 text messages a month for \u20ac10. In Finland, which has very high mobile phone ownership rates, some TV channels began \"SMS chat\", which involved sending short messages to a phone number, and the messages would be shown on TV. Chats are always moderated, which prevents users from sending offensive material to the channel. The craze evolved into quizzes and strategy games and then faster-paced games designed for television and SMS control. Games require users to register their nickname and send short messages to control a character onscreen. Messages usually cost 0.05 to 0.86 Euro apiece, and games can require the player to send dozens of messages. In December 2003, a Finnish TV channel, [[MTV3]], put a [[Santa Claus]] character on-air reading aloud text messages sent in by viewers. On 12 March 2004, the first entirely \"interactive\" TV channel, VIISI, began operation in Finland. However, SBS Finland Oy took over the channel and turned it into a music channel named ''The Voice'' in November 2004. In 2006, the [[Prime Minister of Finland]], [[Matti Vanhanen]], made the news when he allegedly broke up with his girlfriend with a text message.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In 2007, the first book written solely in text messages, ''[[Viimeiset viestit]]'' (''Last Messages''), was released by Finnish author [[Hannu Luntiala]]. It is about an executive who travels through Europe and India.\n\n==== United States ====\nIn the United States, text messaging is very popular; as reported by CTIA in December 2009, the 286 million US subscribers sent 152.7 billion text messages per month, for an average of 534 messages per subscriber per month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctia.org/consumer_info/service/index.cfm/AID/10323|title=Wireless Quick Facts|website=[[CTIA (organization)|CTIA]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420031936/http://www.ctia.org/consumer_info/service/index.cfm/AID/10323|archive-date=20 April 2010}}</ref> The [[Pew Research Center]] found in May 2010 that 72% of U.S. adult cellphone users send and receive text messages.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Kristen Purcell|author2=Roger Entner|author3=Nichole Henderson|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2010/09/14/the-rise-of-apps-culture/|title=The Rise of Apps Culture|website=Pew Research Center\u2019s Internet & American Life Project|date=14 September 2010|access-date=13 February 2020}}</ref> In the U.S., SMS is often charged both at the sender and at the destination, but, unlike phone calls, it cannot be rejected or dismissed. The reasons for lower uptake than other countries are varied. Many users have unlimited \"mobile-to-mobile\" minutes, high monthly minute allotments, or unlimited service. Moreover, \"[[push to talk]]\" services offer the instant connectivity of SMS and are typically unlimited. The integration between competing providers and technologies necessary for cross-network text messaging was not initially available. Some providers originally charged extra for texting, reducing its appeal. In the third quarter of 2006, at least 12 billion text messages were sent on AT&T's network, up almost 15% from the preceding quarter. In the U.S., while texting is mainly popular among people from 13\u201322 years old, it is also increasing among adults and business users. The age that a child receives his/her first cell phone has also decreased, making text messaging a popular way of communicating. The number of texts sent in the US has gone up over the years as the price has gone down to an average of $0.10 per text sent and received. To convince more customers to buy unlimited text messaging plans, some major cellphone providers have increased the price to send and receive text messages from $.15 to $.20 per message.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nextel.com/en/services/messaging/text_messaging.shtml|title=Sprint Nextel Text Messaging|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325030540/http://www.nextel.com/en/services/messaging/text_messaging.shtml|archive-date=25 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/globalText?contentType=Legal%20Notice&textId=122|title=Notice of Text Messaging Increase|website=[[Verizon Wireless]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519224413/http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/globalText?contentType=Legal%20Notice&textId=122|archive-date=May 19, 2010}}</ref> This is over $1,300 per [[megabyte]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/sen-to-carriers-why-do-text-messages-cost-1300-per-meg/|title=Sen. to carriers: Why do text messages cost $1,300 per meg?|website=[[ZDNet]]|date=10 September 2008}}</ref> Many providers offer unlimited plans, which can result in a lower rate per text, given sufficient volume.\n\n==== Japan ====\nJapan was among the first countries to adopt short messages widely, with pioneering non-GSM services including [[SoftBank Mobile|J-Phone]]'s [[SkyMail]] and [[NTT Docomo]]'s [[Short Mail]]. Japanese adolescents first began text messaging, because it was a cheaper form of communication than the other available forms. Thus, Japanese theorists created the selective interpersonal relationship theory, claiming that mobile phones can change social networks among young people (classified as 13- to 30-year-olds). They theorized this age group had extensive but low-quality relationships with friends, and mobile-phone usage may facilitate improvement in the quality of their relationships. They concluded this age group prefers \"selective interpersonal relationships in which they maintain particular, partial, but rich relations, depending on the situation.\"<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0265407505056492 |author=Igarashi, T., Takai, J., & Yoshida, T. |year=2005|title=Gender differences in social network development via mobile phone text messages: A longitudinal study|journal=[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]|volume=22|issue=5|pages=691\u2013713}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00023.x|author=Ishii, Kenichi|title=Implications of Mobility: The Uses of Personal Communication Media in Everyday Life|year=2006|journal=[[Journal of Communication]]|volume=56|issue=2|pages=346\u2013365}}</ref> The same studies showed participants rated friendships in which they communicated face-to-face and through text messaging as being more intimate than those in which they communicated solely face-to-face. This indicates participants make new relationships with face-to-face communication at an early stage but use text messaging to increase their contact later on. As the relationships between participants grew more intimate, the frequency of text messaging also increased. However, short messaging has been largely rendered obsolete by the prevalence of mobile Internet e-mail, which can be sent to and received from any e-mail address, mobile or otherwise. That said, while usually presented to the user simply as a uniform \"mail\" service (and most users are unaware of the distinction), the operators may still internally transmit the content as short messages, especially if the destination is on the same network.\n\n==== China ====\nText messaging is popular and cheap in China. About 700 billion messages were sent in 2007. Text message spam is also a problem in China. In 2007, 353.8 billion spam messages were sent, up 93% from the previous year. It is about 12.44 messages per week per person. It is routine that the People's Republic of China government monitor text messages across the country for illegal content.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/world/20text.html | work=The New York Times | first=Sharon | last=Lafraniere | title=China to Scan Text Messages to Spot 'Unhealthy Content' | date=20 January 2010}}</ref>\nAmong Chinese migrant workers with little formal education, it is common to refer to SMS manuals when text messaging.

In 1998, Philippine mobile-service providers launched SMS more widely across the country, with initial television marketing campaigns targeting hearing-impaired users. The service was initially free with subscriptions, but Filipinos quickly exploited the feature to communicate for free instead of using voice calls, which they would be charged for. After telephone companies realized this trend, they began charging for SMS. The rate across networks is 1 peso per SMS (about US$0.023).  Even after users were charged for SMS, it remained cheap, about one-tenth of the price of a voice call.  This low price led to about five million Filipinos owning a cell phone by 2001.<ref name=\"Rheingold, Howard 2002\"/> Because of the highly social nature of Philippine culture and the affordability of SMS compared to voice calls, SMS usage shot up. Filipinos used texting not only for social messages but also for political purposes, as it allowed the Filipinos to express their opinions on current events and political issues.<ref>[http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/07/biztech/articles/05talk.html Manila's Talk of the Town Is Text Messaging].

A person may now carry out a conversation with another user without the constraint of being expected to reply within a short amount of time and without needing to set time aside to engage in conversation. With voice calling, both participants need to be free at the same time. Mobile phone users can maintain communication during situations in which a voice call is impractical, impossible, or unacceptable, such as during a school class or work meeting. Texting has provided a venue for [[participatory culture]], allowing viewers to vote in online and TV polls, as well as receive information while they are on the move. Texting can also bring people together and create a sense of community through \"[[Smart mob|Smart Mobs]]\" or \"Net War\", which create \"people power\".<ref name=\"Rheingold, Howard 2002\"/> \nResearch has also proven that text messaging is somehow making the social distances larger and could be ruining verbal communication skills for many people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremology.com/2015/03/five-harmful-effect-of-mobile-phone-in-our-social-life.html|title=5 Negative Effects of Mobile Phone In Our Social Life|author=Shoeb Adnan|date=14 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Effect on language ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2008}}\n{{Main|SMS language}}\n[[File:SillyModernSociety.jpg|thumb|This sticker seen in Paris satirizes the popularity of communication in SMS shorthand. In French: \"Is that you? / It's me! / Do you love me? / Shut up!\"]]\nThe small [[telephone keypad|phone keypad]] and the rapidity of typical text message exchanges has caused a number spelling abbreviations: as in the phrase \"txt msg\", \"u\" (an abbreviation for \"you\"), \"HMU\"(\u201chit me up\u201d; i.e., call me), or use of [[CamelCase]], such as in \"ThisIsVeryLame\". To avoid the even more limited message lengths allowed when using [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] or [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letters, speakers of languages written in those alphabets often use the [[Latin alphabet]] for their own [[language]]. In certain languages utilizing [[diacritic]] marks, such as Polish, SMS technology created an entire new variant of written language: characters normally written with diacritic marks (e.g., ''[[\u0105]]'', ''[[\u0119]]'', ''[[\u015b]]'', ''[[\u017c]]'' in Polish) are now being written without them (as ''a'', ''e'', ''s'', ''z'') to enable using cell phones without Polish [[Writing system|script]] or to save space in [[Unicode]] messages. Historically, this language developed out of shorthand used in [[bulletin board system]]s and later in Internet [[chat room]]s, where users would abbreviate some words to allow a response to be typed more quickly, though the amount of time saved was often inconsequential. However, this became much more pronounced in SMS, where mobile phone users either have a numeric keyboard (with older cellphones) or a small [[QWERTY]] keyboard (for 2010s-era smartphones), so more effort is required to type each character, and there is sometimes a limit on the number of characters that may be sent. In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], numbers that sound similar to words are used in place of those words. For example, the numbers 520 in Chinese (''w\u01d4 \u00e8r l\u00edng'') sound like the words for \"I love you\" (''w\u01d2 \u00e0i n\u01d0''). The sequence 748 (''q\u012b s\u00ec b\u0101'') sounds like the curse \"go to hell\" (''q\u00f9 s\u01d0 ba'').\n\n[[Predictive text]] software, which attempts to guess words ([[Tegic]]'s [[T9 (predictive text)|T9]] as well as [[iTap]]) or [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] (Eatoni's [[LetterWise]]) reduces the labour of time-consuming input. This makes abbreviations not only less necessary, but slower to type than regular words that are in the software's [[dictionary]]. However, it makes the messages longer, often requiring the text message to be sent in multiple parts and, therefore, costing more to send. The use of text messaging has changed the way that people talk and write essays, some<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/literacy/oconnor.htm|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613085439/http://www.newhorizons.org/strategies/literacy/oconnor.htm|archive-date=13 June 2010|title=Instant Messaging: Friend or Foe of Student Writing? |publisher=Newhorizons.org |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> believing it to be harmful.

The use of [[diacritic]] marks is dropped in languages such as French, as well as symbols in [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopian languages]]. In his book, ''[[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8]]'' (which translates as \"Texting: the Great Debate\"), [[David Crystal]] states that texters in all eleven languages use \"lol\" (\"laughing out loud\"), \"u\", \"brb\" (\"be right back\"), and \"gr8\" (\"great\"), all English-based shorthands. The use of pictograms and logograms in texts are present in every language. They shorten words by using symbols to represent the word or symbols whose name sounds like a syllable of the word such as in 2day or b4. This is commonly used in other languages as well. Crystal gives some examples in several languages such as Italian ''sei'', \"six\", is used for ''sei'', \"you are\". Example: dv6 = dove sei (\"where are you\") and French k7 = ''cassette'' (\"casette\"). There is also the use of numeral sequences, substituting for several syllables of a word and creating whole phrases using numerals. For example, in French, a12c4 can be said as ''\u00e0 un de ces quatres'', \"see you around\" (literally: \"to one of these four ''[days]''\"). An example of using symbols in texting and borrowing from English is the use of ''@''. Whenever it is used in texting, its intended use is with the English pronunciation. Crystal gives the example of the Welsh use of ''@'' in ''@F'', pronounced ataf, meaning \"to me\". In character-based languages such as Chinese and Japanese, numbers are assigned syllables based on the shortened form of the pronunciation of the number, sometimes the English pronunciation of the number. In this way, numbers alone can be used to communicate whole passages, such as in Chinese, \"8807701314520\" can be literally translated as \"Hug hug you, kiss kiss you, whole life, whole life I love you.\" English influences worldwide texting in variation but still in combination with the individual properties of languages.<ref>Crystal, David [https://books.google.com/books?id=pKBnEGwmtZoC&pg=PA131 Txtng: the gr8 db8]. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. pp. 131\u2013137 {{ISBN|0-19-162340-7}}</ref>\n\nAmerican [[popular culture]] is also recognized in shorthand. For example, [[Homer Simpson]] translates into: ~(_8^(|).<ref>''The New Yorker'' \"Thumbspeak\" Menand, Louis. 20 October 2008.</ref> Crystal also suggests that texting has led to more creativity in the English language, giving people opportunities to create their own slang, [[emoticon]]s, abbreviations, acronyms, etc. The feeling of individualism and freedom makes texting more popular and a more efficient way to communicate.<ref>Crystal, David: the gr8 db8. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Print.</ref> Crystal has also been quoted in saying that \"In a logical world, text messaging should not have survived.\" But text messaging didn't just come out of nowhere. It originally began as a messaging system that would send out emergency information. But it gained immediate popularity with the public. What followed is the SMS we see today, which is a very quick and efficient way of sharing information from person to person. Work by [[Richard Ling]] has shown that texting has a gendered dimension and it plays into the development of teen identity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=\"Girls Text Really Weird\": Gender, Texting and Identity Among Teens | doi=10.1080/17482798.2014.931290 | volume=8|issue=4 |journal=Journal of Children and Media|pages=423\u2013439|date=2014-10-02 |last1=Ling |first1=Rich |last2=Baron |first2=Naomi S. |last3=Lenhart |first3=Amanda |last4=Campbell |first4=Scott W. }}</ref> In addition we text to a very small number of other persons.

However, the exact opposite was true for informal writing. This suggests that perhaps the act of using textisms to shorten communication words leads young adults to produce more informal writing, which may then help them to be better \"informal\" writers. Due to text messaging, teens are writing more, and some teachers see that this comfort with language can be harnessed to make better writers.  This new form of communication may be encouraging students to put their thoughts and feelings into words and this may be able to be used as a bridge, to get them more interested in formal writing.{{According to whom|date=November 2015}}\n\n[[Joan H. Lee]] in her thesis ''What does txting do 2 language: The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints'' (2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/MR/75/MR75222.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220031841/http://gradworks.umi.com/MR/75/MR75222.html|archivedate=2012-02-20|title=What does txting do 2 language: The influences of exposure to messaging and print media on acceptability constraints|accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> associates exposure to text messaging with more rigid acceptability constraints. The thesis suggests that more exposure to the colloquial, [[Generation text|Generation Text]] language of text messaging contributes to being less accepting of words. In contrast, Lee found that students with more exposure to traditional print media (such as books and magazines) were more accepting of both real and fictitious words. The thesis, which garnered international media attention, also presents a [[literature review]] of [[Academic publishing|academic literature]] on the effects of text messaging on language. Texting has also been shown to have had no effect or some positive effects on [[literacy]].

One in five teen girls surveyed (22 percent)\u2014and 11 percent of teen girls aged 13\u201316 years old\u2014say they have electronically sent, or posted online, nude or semi-nude images of themselves. One-third (33 percent) of teen boys and one-quarter (25 percent) of teen girls say they were shown private nude or semi-nude images. According to the survey, sexually suggestive messages (text, e-mail, and instant messaging) were even more common than images, with 39 percent of teens having sent or posted such messages, and half of teens (50 percent) having received them. A 2012 study that has received wide international media attention was conducted at the [[University of Utah]] Department of Psychology by Donald S. Strassberg, Ryan Kelly McKinnon, Michael Susta\u00edta and Jordan Rullo. They surveyed 606 teenagers ages 14\u201318 and found that nearly 20 percent of the students said they had sent a sexually explicit image of themselves via cell phone, and nearly twice as many said that they had received a sexually explicit picture. Of those receiving such a picture, over 25 percent indicated that they had forwarded it to others.\n\nIn addition, of those who had sent a sexually explicit picture, over a third had done so despite believing that there could be serious legal and other consequences if they got caught. Students who had sent a picture by cell phone were more likely than others to find the activity acceptable. The authors conclude: \"These results argue for educational efforts such as cell phone safety assemblies, awareness days, integration into class curriculum and teacher training, designed to raise awareness about the potential consequences of sexting among young people.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strassberg|first=Donald|last2=McKinnon|first2=Ryan K.|title=Sexting by High School Students: An Exploratory and Descriptive Study|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=7 June 2012|doi=10.1007/s10508-012-9969-8|volume=42|issue=1|pages=15\u201321|pmid=22674035}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Maffly|first=Brian|title='Sexting' prevalent among high-schoolers, study finds|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54324965-78/explicit-messages-nearly-onlinetoday.html.csp|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Lois|title=As many as 20% of teens have 'sexted', according to new study|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765583658/As-many-as-20-of-teens-have-sexted.html?pg=all|newspaper=Deseret News|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=2012-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sending Sexually Explicit Photos by Cell Phone Is Common Among Teens|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120613132939.htm|website=Science Daily|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U Study Finds 'Sexting' More Common Among Teens Than You Might Think|url=http://unews.utah.edu/news_releases/u-study-finds-sending-sexually-explicit-photos-by-cell-phone-more-common-among-teen-than-you-might-think/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Sexting' Prevalent Among High-Schoolers, Study Finds|url=http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/display/NewsDisplay.asp?NewsNbr=59999|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130414191154/http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/display/NewsDisplay.asp?NewsNbr=59999|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 April 2013|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Prevention Information Network|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nauert|first=Rick|title=1 in 5 Teens 'Sexting' \u2013 Many Without a Clue|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2012/06/14/1-in-5-teens-sexting-many-without-a-clue/40142.html|publisher=PsychCentral|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=U study: More teens 'sext' than previously thought|url=http://fox13now.com/2012/06/14/u-of-u-study-says-high-percentage-of-teens-sharing-sexting-pics/|publisher=Fox 13 News|accessdate=4 July 2012|date=2012-06-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Most teens unaware about legal consequences of sexting: Study|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/personal-tech/computing/Most-teens-unaware-about-legal-consequences-of-sexting-Study/articleshow/14128744.cms|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615101011/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/personal-tech/computing/Most-teens-unaware-about-legal-consequences-of-sexting-Study/articleshow/14128744.cms|archivedate=2012-06-15|newspaper=Times of India|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sexting is More Common Among Teens Than Previously Thought, Say Researchers|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/352901/20120616/sexting-more-common-teens-previously-thought-researchers.htm|website=International Business Times|accessdate=5 July 2012|date=2012-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Why teens indulge in so much 'sexting'?|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/sexandrelationships/why-teens-indulge-in-so-much-sexting/article1-872741.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306102703/http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/sexandrelationships/why-teens-indulge-in-so-much-sexting/article1-872741.aspx|archivedate=2014-03-06|newspaper=Hindustan Times|accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref> Sexting becomes a legal issue when teens (under 18) are involved, because any nude photos they may send of themselves would put the recipients in possession of child pornography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/schultz/blog/index.ssf/2008/12/connie_schultz_making_kids_to.html|title=Connie Schultz: Making kids to tell law's naked truth is the perfect sentence|website=The Plain Dealer|date=13 December 2008|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090201173208/http://www.cleveland.com/schultz/blog/index.ssf/2008/12/connie_schultz_making_kids_to.html|archive-date=1 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== In schools ===\n[[File:Textinginclass.jpg|thumb|Two girls text during class at school]]\nText messaging has affected students academically by creating an easier way to cheat on exams.

Text \"bullying\" of this sort can cause distress and damage reputations. In some cases, individuals who are bullied online have committed suicide. Harding and Rosenberg (2005) argue that the urge to forward text messages can be difficult to resist, describing text messages as \"loaded weapons\".<ref>Harding, S. & Rosenberg, D. (Ed). (2005).

In a study by Lewandowski and Harrington (2006), participants read a student's email sent to a professor that either contained text-messaging abbreviations (gr8, How R U?) or parallel text in standard English (great, How are you?), and then provided impressions of the sender.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The influence of phonetic abbreviations on evaluation of student performance |first1=Gary |last1=Lewandowski |first2=Samantha |last2=Harrington |journal=Current Research in Social Psychology |volume=11 |issue=15 |year=2006 |pages=215\u2013226 |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~grpproc/crisp/crisp11_15.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105223126/http://www.uiowa.edu/~grpproc/crisp/crisp11_15.pdf |archivedate=5 January 2014 }}</ref> Students who used abbreviations in their email were perceived as having a less favorable personality and as putting forth less effort on an essay they submitted along with the email. Specifically, abbreviation users were seen as less intelligent, responsible, motivated, studious, dependable, and hard-working. These findings suggest that the nature of a student's email communication can influence how others perceive the student and their work.\n\n=== Law and crime ===\nText messaging has been a subject of interest for police forces around the world. One of the issues of concern to [[law enforcement]] agencies is the use of [[encryption|encrypted]] text messages. In 2003, a British company developed a program called Fortress SMS which used 128 bit AES [[encryption]] to protect SMS messages.<ref>Fortress SMS technical report</ref> Police have also retrieved deleted text messages to aid them in solving crimes. For example, Swedish police retrieved deleted texts from a cult member who claimed she committed a double murder based on forwarded texts she received.<ref>Robert Burnett; Ylva H\u00e5rd af Segerstad (8 September 2005). \"The SMS murder mystery\" in Safety and Security in a Networked World.

Increasing cases of Internet [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]] are now also being linked to text messaging, as mobile phones are now more likely to have e-mail and Web capabilities to complement the ability to text.\n\n=== Etiquette ===\nTexting etiquette refers to what is considered appropriate texting behavior. These expectations may concern different areas, such as the context in which a text was sent and received/read, who each participant was with when the participant sent or received/read a text message or what constitutes impolite text messages.<ref name=\"Shuter 2010 123\">{{cite journal|last=Shuter|first=Robert|first2=Sumana|last2=Chattopadhyay|title=Emerging Interpersonal Norms of Text Messaging in India and the United States|journal=[[Journal of Intercultural Communication Research]]|year=2010|volume=29|issue=2|pages=123\u2013147|doi=10.1080/17475759.2010.526319}}</ref> At the website of [[The Emily Post Institute]], the topic of ''texting'' has spurred several articles with the \"do's and dont's\" regarding the new form of communication. One example from the site is: \"Keep your message brief.

Typing a text message in all capital letters will appear as though you are shouting at the recipient, and should be avoided.\"\n\nExpectations for etiquette may differ depending on various factors.  For example, expectations for appropriate behavior have been found to differ markedly between the U.S. and India.<ref name=\"Shuter 2010 123\"/>  Another example is generational differences. In ''The M-Factor: How the Millennial Generation Is Rocking the Workplace'', Lynne Lancaster and David Stillman note that younger Americans often do not consider it rude to answer their cell or begin texting in the middle of a face-to-face conversation with someone else, while older people, less used to the behavior and the accompanying lack of eye contact or attention, find this to be disruptive and ill-mannered.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} With regard to texting in the workplace, [[Plantronics]] studied how we communicate at work] and found that 58% of US knowledge workers have increased the use of text messaging for work in the past five years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/howwework/|title=How do we communicate in business today?|website=[[Plantronics]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223174930/http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/howwework/|archive-date=23 December 2010}}</ref>  The same study found that 33% of knowledge workers felt text messaging was critical or very important to success and productivity at work.<ref name=alison>{{cite web|author=Alison Diana|website=InformationWeek|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/smb/network/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227501053|title=Executives Demand Communications Arsenal|date=30 September 2010|access-date=11 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120014407/http://www.informationweek.com/news/smb/network/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=227501053|archive-date=20 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Challenges ==\n=== Spam ===\n{{Further|Mobile phone spam}}\nIn 2002, an increasing trend towards [[Mobile phone spam|spamming]] mobile phone users through SMS prompted cellular-service carriers to take steps against the practice, before it became a widespread problem.

[[AT&T Mobility]], along with most other service providers, charges texters 20 cents per message if they do not have a messaging plan or if they have exceeded their allotted number of texts. Given that an SMS message is at most 160 [[bytes]] in size, this cost scales to a cost of $1,310<ref name=\"crunchgear.com\"/> per megabyte sent via text message. This is in sharp contrast with the price of unlimited data plans offered by the same carriers, which allow the transmission of hundreds of megabytes of data for monthly prices of about $15 to $45 in addition to a voice plan.  As a comparison, a one-minute phone call uses up the same amount of network capacity as 600 text messages,<ref>Ashley Jones{{cite web|url=http://universe.byu.edu/node/1163 |title=Texting prices rise as carriers make profits \u2013 News & Opinion \u2013 The Daily Universe |accessdate=2011-04-09 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328180032/http://universe.byu.edu/node/1163 |archivedate=28 March 2010 |df=dmy }} . universe.byu.edu (2009-07-28)</ref> meaning that if the same cost-per-traffic formula were applied to phone calls, cell phone calls would cost $120 per minute.  With service providers gaining more customers and expanding their capacity, their overhead costs should be decreasing, not increasing. In 2005, text messaging generated nearly 70 billion dollars in revenue, as reported by Gartner, industry analysts, three times as much as Hollywood box office sales in 2005.

These services are much cheaper and offer more functionality like exchanging of multimedia content (e.g. photos, videos or audio notes) and group messaging. Especially in western countries some of these services attract more and more users.<ref>[http://www.phonearena.com/news/The-death-of-SMS-has-been-greatly-exaggerated_id19493 The death of SMS has been greatly exaggerated]. Phonearena.com. Retrieved on 2015-06-08.</ref>\n\n=== Security concerns ===\nConsumer SMS should not be used for confidential communication. The contents of common SMS messages are known to the network operator's systems and personnel. Therefore, consumer SMS is not an appropriate technology for secure communications.<ref name=\"Gartner Research Analytical Source\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=111720 |title=Don't Use SMS for Confidential Communication |publisher=Gartner Group |date=26 November 2002 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref> To address this issue, many companies use an [[SMS gateway]] provider based on [[Signaling System 7|SS7]] connectivity to route the messages. The advantage of this international termination model is the ability to route data directly through [[Signaling System 7|SS7]], which gives the provider visibility of the complete path of the SMS. This means SMS messages can be sent directly to and from recipients without having to go through the [[Short Message Service Centre|SMS-C]] of other mobile operators. This approach reduces the number of mobile operators that handle the message; however, it should not be considered as an end-to-end secure communication, as the content of the message is exposed to the [[SMS gateway]] provider.\n\nAn alternative approach is to use end-to-end security software that runs on both the sending and receiving device, where the original text message is transmitted in encrypted form as a consumer SMS. By using key rotation, the encrypted text messages stored under [[Telecommunications data retention|data retention]] laws at the network operator cannot be decrypted even if one of the devices is compromised. A problem with this approach is that communicating devices needs to run compatible software. Failure rates without backward notification can be high between carriers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} International texting can be unreliable depending on the country of origin, destination and respective operators (US: \"carriers\").

''sportsbusinessdaily.com'' (21 November 2011).</ref>  These programs have been praised by patrons and security personnel as more effective than traditional methods. For instance, the patron doesn't need to leave his seat and miss the event in order to report something important. Also, disruptive fans can be reported with relative anonymity. \"Text tattling\" also gives security personnel a useful tool to prioritize messages. For instance, a single complaint in one section about an unruly fan can be addressed when convenient, while multiple complaints by several different patrons can be acted upon immediately.\n\n=== Smart cars ===\nIn this context, \"tattle texting\" refers to an automatic text sent by the computer in an automobile, because a preset condition was met.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The most common use for this is for parents to receive texts from the car their child is driving, alerting them to speeding or other issues. Employers can also use the service to monitor their corporate vehicles. The technology is still new and (currently) only available on a few car models.\n\nCommon conditions that can be chosen to send a text are:\n\n* '''Speeding.''' With the use of [[GPS]], stored maps, and [[speed limit]] information, the onboard computer can determine if the driver is exceeding the current speed limit. The device can store this information and/or send it to another recipient.\n* '''Range.''' Parents/employers can set a maximum range from a fixed location after which a \"tattle text\" is sent. Not only can this keep children close to home and keep employees from using corporate vehicles inappropriately, but it can also be a crucial tool for quickly identifying stolen vehicles, car jackings, and kidnappings.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Instant messaging]]\n* [[Personal message]], also called private message or direct message\n* [[Messaging apps]]\n* [[Chat language]]\n* [[Enhanced Messaging Service]]\n* [[Mobile dial code]]\n* [[Operator messaging]]\n* [[Telegram]]\n* [[Tironian notes]], [[scribal abbreviation]]s and [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]]: Roman and medieval abbreviations used to save space on manuscripts and epigraphs\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Wiktionary}}\n<!--===========================({{NoMoreLinks}})===============================-->\n<!--| DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

The first structure to be built on this uninhabited oceanfront was the Biscayne House of Refuge, constructed in 1876 by the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] through an executive order issued by [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Biscayne House of Refuge |url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=75990 |website=HMdb.org |accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> at approximately 72nd Street. Its purpose was to provide food, water, and a return to civilization for people who were shipwrecked. The structure, which had fallen into disuse by the time the Life-Saving Service became the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] in 1915, was destroyed in the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]] and never rebuilt.\n \nThe next step in the development of the future Miami Beach was the planting of a coconut plantation along the shore in the 1880s by New Jersey entrepreneurs Ezra Osborn and Elnathan T. Field, but this was a failed venture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elnathan T. Field |url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/ingraham/expedition/FieldE.htm |website=University of Florida Library |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref> One of the investors in the project was agriculturist [[John S. Collins]], who achieved success by buying out other partners and planting different crops, notably avocados, on the land that would later become Miami Beach. Meanwhile, across Biscayne Bay, the City of Miami was established in 1896 with the arrival of the railroad and developed further as a port when the shipping channel of [[Government Cut]] was created in 1905, cutting off Fisher Island from the south end of the Miami Beach peninsula.\n\nCollins' family members saw the potential in developing the beach as a resort. This effort got underway in the early years of the 20th century by the Collins/Pancoast family, the Lummus brothers (bankers from Miami), and [[Indianapolis]] entrepreneur [[Carl G. Fisher]]. Until then, the beach here was only the destination for day-trips by ferry from Miami, across the bay. By 1912, Collins and Pancoast were working together to clear the land, plant crops, supervise the construction of canals to get their avocado crop to market, and set up the Miami Beach Improvement Company.<ref name=\"wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com\">{{cite web|url=https://wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/return-in-time-to-the-lincoln-hotel-miami-beach-late-january-1921/|title=RETURN IN TIME TO THE LINCOLN HOTEL, MIAMI BEACH, LATE JANUARY, 1921|author=|date=October 24, 2012|work=Wordpress.com|access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> There were bathhouses and food stands, but no hotel until Brown's Hotel was built in 1915 (still standing, at 112 Ocean Drive). Much of the interior landmass at that time was a tangled jungle of mangroves. Clearing it, deepening the channels and water bodies, and eliminating native growth almost everywhere in favor of landfill for development, was expensive. Once a 1600-acre, jungle-matted sand bar three miles out in the Atlantic, it grew to 2,800 acres when dredging and filling operations were completed.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Florida. A Guide to the Southernmost State\n|date=1939\n|place=New York\n|author=Federal Writers' Project\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|page=210}}</ref>\n\nWith loans from the Lummus brothers, Collins had begun work on a 2\u00bd-mile-long wooden bridge, the world's longest wooden bridge at the time, to connect the island to the mainland. When funds ran dry and construction work stalled, Indianapolis millionaire and recent Miami transplant Fisher intervened, providing the financing needed to complete the bridge the following year in return for a land swap deal.<ref name=\"wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com\"/> That transaction kicked off the island's first real estate boom. Fisher helped by organizing an annual speed boat regatta, and by promoting Miami Beach as an Atlantic City-style playground and winter retreat for the wealthy. By 1915, Lummus, Collins, Pancoast, and Fisher were all living in mansions on the island, three hotels and two bathhouses had been erected, an aquarium built, and an 18-hole golf course landscaped.\n[[File:Roney Plaza Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|Roller skating waitresses at Roney Plaza Hotel, 1939]]\n\nThe Town of Miami Beach was chartered on March 26, 1915; it grew to become a City in 1917. Even after the town was incorporated in 1915 under the name of Miami Beach, many visitors thought of the beach strip as Alton Beach, indicating just how well Fisher had advertised his interests there. The Lummus property was called Ocean Beach, with only the Collins interests previously referred to as Miami Beach.<ref>http://digitalcollections.fiu.edu/tequesta/files/1955/55_1_01.pdf</ref>\n\nCarl Fisher was the main promoter of Miami Beach's development in the 1920s as the site for wealthy industrialists from the north and Midwest to and build their winter homes here. Many other Northerners were targeted to vacation on the island. To accommodate the wealthy tourists, several grand hotels were built, among them: The [[Flamingo Hotel, Miami Beach|Flamingo Hotel]], The Fleetwood Hotel, The Floridian, The Nautilus, and the Roney Plaza Hotel. In the 1920s, Fisher and others created much of Miami Beach as landfill by dredging Biscayne Bay; this man-made territory includes Star, Palm, and Hibiscus Islands, the Sunset Islands, much of Normandy Isle, and all of the Venetian Islands except Belle Isle. The Miami Beach peninsula became an island in April 1925 when Haulover Cut was opened, connecting the ocean to the bay, north of present-day [[Bal Harbour, Florida|Bal Harbour]]. The great [[1926 Miami hurricane]] put an end to this prosperous era of the [[Florida Boom]], but in the 1930s Miami Beach still attracted tourists, and investors constructed the mostly small-scale, stucco hotels and rooming houses, for seasonal rental, that comprise much of the present \"[[Art Deco]]\" historic district.\n\nCarl Fisher brought Steve Hannagan to Miami Beach in 1925 as his chief publicist.<ref>Ross, Edward Ellis; interview notebook; source: New York University Archives; p. 79.\n</ref> Hannagan set-up the Miami Beach News Bureau and notified news editors that they could \"Print anything you want about Miami Beach; just make sure you get our name right.\"<ref name=\":0\">Cooke, Bill (September 20, 2010); \"Selling Miami Beach with Sex and Celebrities Is Nothing New;\" <nowiki>http://www.miamibeach411.com/news/selling-miami</nowiki>; Miami Beach; 411.</ref> The News Bureau sent thousands of pictures of bathing beauties and press releases to columnists like Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan.<ref name=\":0\" /> One of Hannagan's favorite venues was a billboard in Times Square, New York City, where he ran two taglines: \"'It's always June in Miami Beach' and 'Miami Beach, Where Summer Spends the Winter.'\"<ref>Fisher, Jane (1947); The Fabulous Hoosier; Robert M.

Like much of Florida, there is a marked wet and dry season in Miami Beach. The tropical rainy season runs from May through October, when showers and late day thunderstorms are common. The dry season is from November through April, when few showers, sunshine, and low humidity prevail. The island location of Miami Beach, however, creates fewer convective thunderstorms, so Miami Beach receives less rainfall in a given year than neighboring areas such as Miami and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]. Proximity to the moderating influence of the Atlantic gives Miami Beach lower high temperatures and higher lows than inland areas of Florida. According to the [[National Weather Service]], other than [[Key West]], Miami Beach is the only U.S. city (mainland) to never report freezing temperatures, with the record low of 32.3 F in January 1989.<ref name=Transmiami>{{Cite web|url=http://transmiami.com/|title=Car Service Miami &#124; Sedan Service Miami &#124; Transmiami Limos|website=transmiami.com}}</ref>\n\nMiami Beach's location on the [[Atlantic Ocean]], near its confluence with the [[Gulf of Mexico]], make it extraordinarily vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s and [[tropical storm]]s.

This unfortunate reality of climate change contributes to the City of Miami Beach's $400\u2013500 Million of expenditures to address sea level rise over the next five years. After urgent meetings with city planners and engineers, Miami Beach officials decided on raising roads and installing pumps as the best course of action. Citizens have raised concerns that more pumps will simply exacerbate pollution in the bay, harming wildlife and decreasing biodiversity which in turn could harm tourism. Since they've turned on the pumps, seaside residents have complained of a lower quality of life due to the lack of stingrays, manatees, tarpin, and other wildlife. The tubes pump out a brown soot-like liquid, dangering those residents of lower property values. A hydrologist from Florida International University, Henry Brice\u00f1o, is studying the validity of the city's claims that the output from the pipes is just harmless turbidity in the bay. \u201cRemember,\u201d Brice\u00f1o argues, \u201cwe live here in Miami Beach out of tourism.\u201d Anthropologist Kenny Broad sees that Miami residents understand that their livelihoods are at stake, and they feel the realities of climate change beyond partisan lines. This alarmed mindset is catalyzing support for a proposal to turn a public golf course back into wetlands, a more deep ecology approach than the pump installations.\n\nThe urgency and apparency of flooding coupled with the many other golf courses that the public and tourists can access in Miami have curbed public opposition to an extent, but in preparation for varied public opinion, Miami Beach has proposed three options. The first would not affect the golf course other than retrofitting it with greener, water-absorbing features. The second would repurpose nine holes into wetlands with a recreation center, while the third option goes all the way in a total reimagination of the course into a 145-acre eco-district reminiscent of Central Park in New York City. This move wouldn't be unprecedented: a private conservancy group purchased an aging golf course on Florida's Gulf Coast and repurposed it as a wetland and wildflower preserve.\n\nAdditionally, to accommodate water filtration that the pipes inadequately attempt to clean, the golf course is just one piece of a larger plan to add plant-based systems that will filter water before they enter the high water table of Miami and return to Biscayne Bay. This plan is similar to dealing with sewage through aquatic water treatment plants and steps that other cities such as Houston are beginning to take to increase permeability in their cities for water to drain into.\n\n===Water temperature===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Average coastal water temperature for the Atlantic Ocean based on historical measurements.<ref name=\"water_temperature\">{{cite web|last1=Sun|first1=Charles|title=Coastal Water Temperature Table|url=https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/dsdt/cwtg/all_meanT.html|website=www.nodc.noaa.gov|publisher=[[National Oceanographic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 5, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905202557/https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/dsdt/cwtg/all_meanT.html|archivedate=September 5, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n!January\n| {{convert|71|F|C|1}}\n!May 1\u201315\n| {{convert|80|F|C|1}}\n!July 16\u201331\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!October 1\u201315\n| {{convert|83|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!February\n| {{convert|73|F|C|1}}\n!May 16\u201331\n| {{convert|81|F|C|1}}\n!August 1\u201315\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!October 16\u201331\n| {{convert|79|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!March\n| {{convert|75|F|C|1}}\n!June 1\u201315\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!August 16\u201331\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!November\n| {{convert|76|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!April 1\u201315\n| {{convert|78|F|C|1}}\n!June 16\u201330\n| {{convert|85|F|C|1}}\n!September 1\u201315\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!December\n| {{convert|73|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!April 16\u201330\n| {{convert|78|F|C|1}}\n!July 1\u201315\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!September 16\u201330\n| {{convert|83|F|C|1}}\n|}\n\n===Surrounding areas===\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Surrounding areas of Miami Beach'''\n|Northwest = [[Biscayne Bay]]\n|North     = [[Indian Creek, Florida|Indian Creek]], [[Surfside, Florida|Surfside]]\n|Northeast = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n|West      = [[Biscayne Bay]], [[North Bay Village, Florida|North Bay Village]], [[Miami]], [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|Centre    = Miami Beach\n|East      = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n|Southwest = [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|South     = [[Government Cut]], [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|Southeast = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 644\n|1930= 6494\n|1940= 28012\n|1950= 46282\n|1960= 63145\n|1970= 87072\n|1980= 96298\n|1990= 92639\n|2000= 87933\n|2010= 87779\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=91718\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 2em; width: 35%; font-size: 75%;\" \n!colspan=4|Miami Beach demographics\n|-\n![[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]||Miami Beach||Miami-Dade County||Florida\n|-\n|Total population||87,779||2,496,435||18,801,310\n|-\n|Population, percent change, 2000 to 2010||-0.2%||+10.8%||+17.6%\n|-\n|Population density||11,511.1/sq&nbsp;mi||1,315.5/sq&nbsp;mi||350.6/sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n|[[White (U.S. Census)|White or Caucasian]] (including [[White Hispanic]])||87.4%||73.8%||75.0%\n|-\n|([[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White or Caucasian]])||40.5%||15.4%||57.9%\n|-\n|[[Black (U.S. Census)|Black or African-American]]||4.4%||18.9%||16.0%\n|-\n|[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic or Latino (of any race)]]||53.0%||65.0%||22.5%\n|-\n|[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]]||1.9%||1.5%||2.4%\n|-\n|[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]]||0.3%||0.2%||0.4%\n|-\n|[[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]] or [[Native Hawaiian]]||0.1%||0.0%||0.1%\n|-\n|[[Multiracial American|Two or more races (Multiracial)]]||2.7%||2.4%||2.5%\n|-\n|[[Other races (U.S. Census)|Some Other Race]]||3.2%||3.2%||3.6%\n|}\n\n{{As of|2010}}, those of Hispanic or Latino ancestry accounted for 53.0% of Miami Beach's population.

The first structure to be built on this uninhabited oceanfront was the Biscayne House of Refuge, constructed in 1876 by the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] through an executive order issued by [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Biscayne House of Refuge |url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=75990 |website=HMdb.org |accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref> at approximately 72nd Street. Its purpose was to provide food, water, and a return to civilization for people who were shipwrecked. The structure, which had fallen into disuse by the time the Life-Saving Service became the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] in 1915, was destroyed in the [[1926 Miami Hurricane]] and never rebuilt.\n \nThe next step in the development of the future Miami Beach was the planting of a coconut plantation along the shore in the 1880s by New Jersey entrepreneurs Ezra Osborn and Elnathan T. Field, but this was a failed venture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elnathan T. Field |url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/ingraham/expedition/FieldE.htm |website=University of Florida Library |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref> One of the investors in the project was agriculturist [[John S. Collins]], who achieved success by buying out other partners and planting different crops, notably avocados, on the land that would later become Miami Beach. Meanwhile, across Biscayne Bay, the City of Miami was established in 1896 with the arrival of the railroad and developed further as a port when the shipping channel of [[Government Cut]] was created in 1905, cutting off Fisher Island from the south end of the Miami Beach peninsula.\n\nCollins' family members saw the potential in developing the beach as a resort. This effort got underway in the early years of the 20th century by the Collins/Pancoast family, the Lummus brothers (bankers from Miami), and [[Indianapolis]] entrepreneur [[Carl G. Fisher]]. Until then, the beach here was only the destination for day-trips by ferry from Miami, across the bay. By 1912, Collins and Pancoast were working together to clear the land, plant crops, supervise the construction of canals to get their avocado crop to market, and set up the Miami Beach Improvement Company.<ref name=\"wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com\">{{cite web|url=https://wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com/2012/10/24/return-in-time-to-the-lincoln-hotel-miami-beach-late-january-1921/|title=RETURN IN TIME TO THE LINCOLN HOTEL, MIAMI BEACH, LATE JANUARY, 1921|author=|date=October 24, 2012|work=Wordpress.com|access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> There were bathhouses and food stands, but no hotel until Brown's Hotel was built in 1915 (still standing, at 112 Ocean Drive). Much of the interior landmass at that time was a tangled jungle of mangroves. Clearing it, deepening the channels and water bodies, and eliminating native growth almost everywhere in favor of landfill for development, was expensive. Once a 1600-acre, jungle-matted sand bar three miles out in the Atlantic, it grew to 2,800 acres when dredging and filling operations were completed.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Florida. A Guide to the Southernmost State\n|date=1939\n|place=New York\n|author=Federal Writers' Project\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|page=210}}</ref>\n\nWith loans from the Lummus brothers, Collins had begun work on a 2\u00bd-mile-long wooden bridge, the world's longest wooden bridge at the time, to connect the island to the mainland. When funds ran dry and construction work stalled, Indianapolis millionaire and recent Miami transplant Fisher intervened, providing the financing needed to complete the bridge the following year in return for a land swap deal.<ref name=\"wolfsonianfiulibrary.wordpress.com\"/> That transaction kicked off the island's first real estate boom. Fisher helped by organizing an annual speed boat regatta, and by promoting Miami Beach as an Atlantic City-style playground and winter retreat for the wealthy. By 1915, Lummus, Collins, Pancoast, and Fisher were all living in mansions on the island, three hotels and two bathhouses had been erected, an aquarium built, and an 18-hole golf course landscaped.\n[[File:Roney Plaza Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|Roller skating waitresses at Roney Plaza Hotel, 1939]]\n\nThe Town of Miami Beach was chartered on March 26, 1915; it grew to become a City in 1917. Even after the town was incorporated in 1915 under the name of Miami Beach, many visitors thought of the beach strip as Alton Beach, indicating just how well Fisher had advertised his interests there. The Lummus property was called Ocean Beach, with only the Collins interests previously referred to as Miami Beach.<ref>http://digitalcollections.fiu.edu/tequesta/files/1955/55_1_01.pdf</ref>\n\nCarl Fisher was the main promoter of Miami Beach's development in the 1920s as the site for wealthy industrialists from the north and Midwest to and build their winter homes here. Many other Northerners were targeted to vacation on the island. To accommodate the wealthy tourists, several grand hotels were built, among them: The [[Flamingo Hotel, Miami Beach|Flamingo Hotel]], The Fleetwood Hotel, The Floridian, The Nautilus, and the Roney Plaza Hotel. In the 1920s, Fisher and others created much of Miami Beach as landfill by dredging Biscayne Bay; this man-made territory includes Star, Palm, and Hibiscus Islands, the Sunset Islands, much of Normandy Isle, and all of the Venetian Islands except Belle Isle. The Miami Beach peninsula became an island in April 1925 when Haulover Cut was opened, connecting the ocean to the bay, north of present-day [[Bal Harbour, Florida|Bal Harbour]]. The great [[1926 Miami hurricane]] put an end to this prosperous era of the [[Florida Boom]], but in the 1930s Miami Beach still attracted tourists, and investors constructed the mostly small-scale, stucco hotels and rooming houses, for seasonal rental, that comprise much of the present \"[[Art Deco]]\" historic district.\n\nCarl Fisher brought Steve Hannagan to Miami Beach in 1925 as his chief publicist.<ref>Ross, Edward Ellis; interview notebook; source: New York University Archives; p. 79.\n</ref> Hannagan set-up the Miami Beach News Bureau and notified news editors that they could \"Print anything you want about Miami Beach; just make sure you get our name right.\"<ref name=\":0\">Cooke, Bill (September 20, 2010); \"Selling Miami Beach with Sex and Celebrities Is Nothing New;\" <nowiki>http://www.miamibeach411.com/news/selling-miami</nowiki>; Miami Beach; 411.</ref> The News Bureau sent thousands of pictures of bathing beauties and press releases to columnists like Walter Winchell and Ed Sullivan.<ref name=\":0\" /> One of Hannagan's favorite venues was a billboard in Times Square, New York City, where he ran two taglines: \"'It's always June in Miami Beach' and 'Miami Beach, Where Summer Spends the Winter.'\"<ref>Fisher, Jane (1947); The Fabulous Hoosier; Robert M.

Like much of Florida, there is a marked wet and dry season in Miami Beach. The tropical rainy season runs from May through October, when showers and late day thunderstorms are common. The dry season is from November through April, when few showers, sunshine, and low humidity prevail. The island location of Miami Beach, however, creates fewer convective thunderstorms, so Miami Beach receives less rainfall in a given year than neighboring areas such as Miami and [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]. Proximity to the moderating influence of the Atlantic gives Miami Beach lower high temperatures and higher lows than inland areas of Florida. According to the [[National Weather Service]], other than [[Key West]], Miami Beach is the only U.S. city (mainland) to never report freezing temperatures, with the record low of 32.3 F in January 1989.<ref name=Transmiami>{{Cite web|url=http://transmiami.com/|title=Car Service Miami &#124; Sedan Service Miami &#124; Transmiami Limos|website=transmiami.com}}</ref>\n\nMiami Beach's location on the [[Atlantic Ocean]], near its confluence with the [[Gulf of Mexico]], make it extraordinarily vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s and [[tropical storm]]s.

This unfortunate reality of climate change contributes to the City of Miami Beach's $400\u2013500 Million of expenditures to address sea level rise over the next five years. After urgent meetings with city planners and engineers, Miami Beach officials decided on raising roads and installing pumps as the best course of action. Citizens have raised concerns that more pumps will simply exacerbate pollution in the bay, harming wildlife and decreasing biodiversity which in turn could harm tourism. Since they've turned on the pumps, seaside residents have complained of a lower quality of life due to the lack of stingrays, manatees, tarpin, and other wildlife. The tubes pump out a brown soot-like liquid, dangering those residents of lower property values. A hydrologist from Florida International University, Henry Brice\u00f1o, is studying the validity of the city's claims that the output from the pipes is just harmless turbidity in the bay. \u201cRemember,\u201d Brice\u00f1o argues, \u201cwe live here in Miami Beach out of tourism.\u201d Anthropologist Kenny Broad sees that Miami residents understand that their livelihoods are at stake, and they feel the realities of climate change beyond partisan lines. This alarmed mindset is catalyzing support for a proposal to turn a public golf course back into wetlands, a more deep ecology approach than the pump installations.\n\nThe urgency and apparency of flooding coupled with the many other golf courses that the public and tourists can access in Miami have curbed public opposition to an extent, but in preparation for varied public opinion, Miami Beach has proposed three options. The first would not affect the golf course other than retrofitting it with greener, water-absorbing features. The second would repurpose nine holes into wetlands with a recreation center, while the third option goes all the way in a total reimagination of the course into a 145-acre eco-district reminiscent of Central Park in New York City. This move wouldn't be unprecedented: a private conservancy group purchased an aging golf course on Florida's Gulf Coast and repurposed it as a wetland and wildflower preserve.\n\nAdditionally, to accommodate water filtration that the pipes inadequately attempt to clean, the golf course is just one piece of a larger plan to add plant-based systems that will filter water before they enter the high water table of Miami and return to Biscayne Bay. This plan is similar to dealing with sewage through aquatic water treatment plants and steps that other cities such as Houston are beginning to take to increase permeability in their cities for water to drain into.\n\n===Water temperature===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Average coastal water temperature for the Atlantic Ocean based on historical measurements.<ref name=\"water_temperature\">{{cite web|last1=Sun|first1=Charles|title=Coastal Water Temperature Table|url=https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/dsdt/cwtg/all_meanT.html|website=www.nodc.noaa.gov|publisher=[[National Oceanographic Data Center]]|accessdate=September 5, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905202557/https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/dsdt/cwtg/all_meanT.html|archivedate=September 5, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n!January\n| {{convert|71|F|C|1}}\n!May 1\u201315\n| {{convert|80|F|C|1}}\n!July 16\u201331\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!October 1\u201315\n| {{convert|83|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!February\n| {{convert|73|F|C|1}}\n!May 16\u201331\n| {{convert|81|F|C|1}}\n!August 1\u201315\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!October 16\u201331\n| {{convert|79|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!March\n| {{convert|75|F|C|1}}\n!June 1\u201315\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!August 16\u201331\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!November\n| {{convert|76|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!April 1\u201315\n| {{convert|78|F|C|1}}\n!June 16\u201330\n| {{convert|85|F|C|1}}\n!September 1\u201315\n| {{convert|84|F|C|1}}\n!December\n| {{convert|73|F|C|1}}\n|-\n!April 16\u201330\n| {{convert|78|F|C|1}}\n!July 1\u201315\n| {{convert|86|F|C|1}}\n!September 16\u201330\n| {{convert|83|F|C|1}}\n|}\n\n===Surrounding areas===\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Surrounding areas of Miami Beach'''\n|Northwest = [[Biscayne Bay]]\n|North     = [[Indian Creek, Florida|Indian Creek]], [[Surfside, Florida|Surfside]]\n|Northeast = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n|West      = [[Biscayne Bay]], [[North Bay Village, Florida|North Bay Village]], [[Miami]], [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|Centre    = Miami Beach\n|East      = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n|Southwest = [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|South     = [[Government Cut]], [[Fisher Island, Florida|Fisher Island]]\n|Southeast = [[Atlantic Ocean]]\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 644\n|1930= 6494\n|1940= 28012\n|1950= 46282\n|1960= 63145\n|1970= 87072\n|1980= 96298\n|1990= 92639\n|2000= 87933\n|2010= 87779\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=91718\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 2em; width: 35%; font-size: 75%;\" \n!colspan=4|Miami Beach demographics\n|-\n![[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]]||Miami Beach||Miami-Dade County||Florida\n|-\n|Total population||87,779||2,496,435||18,801,310\n|-\n|Population, percent change, 2000 to 2010||-0.2%||+10.8%||+17.6%\n|-\n|Population density||11,511.1/sq&nbsp;mi||1,315.5/sq&nbsp;mi||350.6/sq&nbsp;mi\n|-\n|[[White (U.S. Census)|White or Caucasian]] (including [[White Hispanic]])||87.4%||73.8%||75.0%\n|-\n|([[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White or Caucasian]])||40.5%||15.4%||57.9%\n|-\n|[[Black (U.S. Census)|Black or African-American]]||4.4%||18.9%||16.0%\n|-\n|[[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic or Latino (of any race)]]||53.0%||65.0%||22.5%\n|-\n|[[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]]||1.9%||1.5%||2.4%\n|-\n|[[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]] or [[Native Alaskan]]||0.3%||0.2%||0.4%\n|-\n|[[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]] or [[Native Hawaiian]]||0.1%||0.0%||0.1%\n|-\n|[[Multiracial American|Two or more races (Multiracial)]]||2.7%||2.4%||2.5%\n|-\n|[[Other races (U.S. Census)|Some Other Race]]||3.2%||3.2%||3.6%\n|}\n\n{{As of|2010}}, those of Hispanic or Latino ancestry accounted for 53.0% of Miami Beach's population.

Secular jazz musicians often performed renditions of spirituals, hymns and early gospel songs as part of their repertoire. Later many other jazz artists borrowed from black [[gospel music]]. Prior to [[World War II]], American churches, black and white, regarded jazz and blues with suspicion or outright hostility as \"the devil's music.\" It was only after World War II that a few jazz musicians began to compose and perform extended works intended for religious settings and/or as religious expression. Since the 1950's, sacred and liturgical music has been performed and recorded by many prominent jazz composers and musicians. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowes |first1=Malcolm |title=Jazz in the chapel |journal=Music Journal |date=11 January 1966 |volume=24 |issue=9 |page=45}}</ref> \n\nFew music historians or musicologists have written about sacred jazz. One of the first and the most extensive treatise to date is a 2013 doctoral dissertation, in which Angelo Versace examined the development of sacred jazz in the 1950s using disciplines of [[musicology]] and history.<ref name=\"Versace\" /> He noted that the historically parallel traditions of black gospel music and jazz were combined in the 1950s to produce \"sacred jazz.\" The two are similar in religious intent but differ in gospel's lack of extended instrumental passages and instrumental improvisation and in gospel's hymn-like structure, and concern with social and political issues. Prominent artists [[Mahalia Jackson]] and [[Rosetta Tharpe]] contributed to gospel and sacred jazz. Versace maintained that the religious intent separates sacred from secular jazz. Most prominent in initiating the sacred jazz movement were pianist and composer [[Mary Lou Williams]], known for her jazz masses in the 1950s and [[Duke Ellington]]. Prior to his later sacred compositions, Ellington included \"Come Sunday\" and \"Twenty-third Psalm\" in his \"Black, Brown and Beige\", which he recorded in 1958 with Mahalia Jackson. However, a number of other jazz artists, black and white, contributed to the movement.\n\nThe marked societal changes of the [[1960s]] included changes in attitudes toward the arts in both [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]] Churches, which slowly became more open to the liturgical use of jazz.<ref name=\"Versace\" /> Mary Lou Williams continued composing sacred jazz including her \"Black Christ of the Andes\" (1964) in honor of newly canonized Martin De Porres. Prior to his death in 1974 in response to contacts from Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, [[Duke Ellington]] wrote three Sacred Concerts: 1965 - A Concert of Sacred Music; 1968 - Second Sacred Concert; 1973 - Third Sacred Concert. Other popular and influential artists including [[John Coltrane]], [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Lalo Schifrin]] and [[Vince Guaraldi]] performed and recorded major sacred jazz works. Most works were in the [[Christianity|Christian]] tradition but some were inspired by Asian and African religious traditions, e.g. John Contrane's \"[[A Love Supreme]],\" [[Alice Coltrane]]'s \"Universal Consciousness\", and [[Pharoah Sanders]]' \"Karma.\"\n\nThe last decades of the [[20th century]] and the first of the [[21st century]] saw continued regular composition, performance and recording of sacred jazz by established and new artists. Yet, sacred jazz never achieved a high visibility in the mainstream [[Media (communication)|media]] or even among jazz lovers or much commercial success.<ref name=\"Versace\" /> However, this is a testament to the sincere religious motivation of its practitioners and advocates who persist in their calling.<ref name=\"Reed\" />\n\n==The jazz mass==\nThe most common form of sacred jazz is the jazz mass. Although most often performed in a concert setting rather than church worship setting, this form has many examples. An eminent example of composers of the jazz mass was [[Mary Lou Williams]]. Having become disillusioned with her life as a secular performer, Williams converted to Catholicism in 1957.<ref name=\"MLW\">{{cite web |last1=Aquilina |first1=Grace |title=Mary Lou Williams, pioneer of sacred jazz {{!}} Angelus News |url=https://angelusnews.com/arts-culture/mary-lou-williams-pioneer-of-sacred-jazz/ |website=Angelus |publisher=Angelus |accessdate=31 March 2020 |date=7 November 2019}}</ref> and proceeded to compose three masses in the jazz idiom.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Corbin |first1=Ian M. |title=A jazz mass?

It was performed once in 1975 in St Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. Williams pursued composing and advocating for sacred jazz as a divine vocation. However the [[Catholic Church]] has not embraced jazz as appropriate for worship. \n\nIn 1966 Joe Masters recorded \"Jazz Mass\" for Columbia Records. A jazz ensemble was joined by soloists and choir using the English text of the Roman Catholic Mass. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Connor |first1=Norman |title=The Jazz Mass by Joe Masters |journal=Choral Journal |date=1 February 1970 |volume=10 |issue=5 |page=19}}</ref> Other examples include  \"Jazz Mass in Concert\" by [[Lalo Schiffrin]](Aleph Records, 1998, UPC 0651702632725) and \"Jazz Mass\" by [[Vince Guaraldi]] (Fantasy Records, 1965). In England, classical composer [[Will Todd]] recorded his \"Jazz Missa Brevis\" with jazz ensemble, solists and the St Martin's Voices on a 2018 Signum Records release, \"Passion Music/Jazz Missa Brevis\" also released as \"Mass in Blue,\" and jazz organist James Taylor composed \"The Rochester Mass\"   (Cherry Red Records, 2015) <ref>{{cite news |last1=Peel |first1=Adrian |title='The Rochester Mass,' a new concept from organist James Taylor |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/music/the-rochester-mass-a-new-concept-from-organist-james-taylor/article/450967 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |agency=Digital Journal |publisher=Digital Journal |date=2 December 2015}}</ref>.

Although most often performed in a concert setting rather than church worship setting, this form has many examples. An eminent example of composers of the jazz mass was [[Mary Lou Williams]]. Having become disillusioned with her life as a secular performer, Williams converted to Catholicism in 1957.<ref name=\"MLW\">{{cite web |last1=Aquilina |first1=Grace |title=Mary Lou Williams, pioneer of sacred jazz {{!}} Angelus News |url=https://angelusnews.com/arts-culture/mary-lou-williams-pioneer-of-sacred-jazz/ |website=Angelus |publisher=Angelus |accessdate=31 March 2020 |date=7 November 2019}}</ref> and proceeded to compose three masses in the jazz idiom.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Corbin |first1=Ian M. |title=A jazz mass?

It was performed once in 1975 in St Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. Williams pursued composing and advocating for sacred jazz as a divine vocation. However the [[Catholic Church]] has not embraced jazz as appropriate for worship. \n\nIn 1966 Joe Masters recorded \"Jazz Mass\" for Columbia Records. A jazz ensemble was joined by soloists and choir using the English text of the Roman Catholic Mass. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Connor |first1=Norman |title=The Jazz Mass by Joe Masters |journal=Choral Journal |date=1 February 1970 |volume=10 |issue=5 |page=19}}</ref> Other examples include  \"Jazz Mass in Concert\" by [[Lalo Schiffrin]](Aleph Records, 1998, UPC 0651702632725) and \"Jazz Mass\" by [[Vince Guaraldi]] (Fantasy Records, 1965). In England, classical composer [[Will Todd]] recorded his \"Jazz Missa Brevis\" with jazz ensemble, solists and the St Martin's Voices on a 2018 Signum Records release, \"Passion Music/Jazz Missa Brevis\" also released as \"Mass in Blue,\" and jazz organist James Taylor composed \"The Rochester Mass\"   (Cherry Red Records, 2015) <ref>{{cite news |last1=Peel |first1=Adrian |title='The Rochester Mass,' a new concept from organist James Taylor |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/a-and-e/music/the-rochester-mass-a-new-concept-from-organist-james-taylor/article/450967 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |agency=Digital Journal |publisher=Digital Journal |date=2 December 2015}}</ref>.

It is located {{convert|23|km|mi|0}} south-west of [[Indore]] city, towards [[Mumbai]] on the old [[National Highway 3 (India)|Mumbai-Agra Road]]. The town was renamed as ''Dr. Ambedkar Nagar'' in 2003, by the [[Government of Madhya Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-06-28/india/27179994_1_bhopal-notification-madhya-pradesh-government|location=[[Bhopal]]|work=[[The Times of India]]|title=Mhow town renamed as Dr Ambedkar Nagar|date=28 June 2003|access-date=21 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome articles in popular literature state that 'MHOW' stands for '''M'''ilitary '''H'''eadquarters '''O'''f '''W'''ar. However, this is a [[backronym]], and there is no proof to support the theory that the name of the village comes from the acronym. The village near Mhow was called Mhow Gaon in the pre-[[British Raj|British]] era, when English was not used in India. The Cantonment which came up in 1818 came to be known as Mhow Cantt after the name of this village. [[Sir John Malcolm]] spelt the name of this town as MOW in his writings. The 1918 edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica also mentions 'MAU'. However, the Cantonment was referred to by British officers as Mhow at least as early as the end of 1823 (letter from Lt Edward Squibb to his father in London).\n\nIn 2003, the town was renamed Dr. Ambedkar Nagar in honour of [[B. R. Ambedkar]], who was born here.\n\n==History==\n\nThis cantonment town was founded in 1818 by [[John Malcolm]] as a result of the Treaty of Mandsaur between the English and the [[Holkar]]s who were the [[Maratha]] [[Maharaja]]s of [[Indore]]. John Malcolm's forces had defeated the [[Holkar]]s of the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha Confederacy]] at the [[Battle of Mahidpur]] in 1818. It was after this battle that the capital of the Holkars shifted from the town of [[Maheshwar]] on the banks of the Narmada to Indore.\n\nMhow used to be the headquarters of the [[5th (Mhow) Division]] of the [[Southern Command (India)|Southern Command]] during the [[British Raj]]. Today this small town is associated with the [[Indian Army]] and with [[Bharat Ratna]] Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]] an economist, philosopher, jurist, anthropologist, Buddhist activist, a revolutionary, a prolific writer, and a political leader who was born here.\n\nMhow was a meter gauge railway district headquarters during the British Raj and even after 1947.<ref>Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway (B.B.& C.I. Railway) which later got incorporated in Western Railway.</ref> The irony is that Mhow finally has a broad gauge connection with Indore but regular train services are yet to commence.\n\nAccording to [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious texts, [[Janapav]] Kuti near Mhow is said to be the birthplace{{citation needed|date= March 2015}} of [[Parashurama]], an avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n\n== Climate ==\n\nMhow has a pleasant climate more often than not, however the peak summer and winter periods may get extremely hot and cold, respectively. Temperatures may go as high as 43 degrees Celsius during summers and as low as 4 degrees Celsius during winter.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2011}} India [[census]],<ref>[http://www.census2011.co.in/data/town/802275-mhow-cantt-madhya-pradesh.html]</ref> Mhow had a population of 85,023. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Mhow has an average literacy rate of 72%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy is 78%, and female literacy is 65%. The Mhow Cantt Cantonment Board has population of 81,702 of which 43,888 are males while 37,814 are females as per report released by Census India 2011.\n\nPopulation of Children with age of 0-6 is 9308 which is 11.39% of total population of Mhow Cantt (CB). In Mhow Cantt Cantonment Board, Female Sex Ratio is of 862 against state average of 931. Moreover, Child Sex Ratio in Mhow Cantt is around 908 compared to Madhya Pradesh state average of 918. Literacy rate of Mhow Cantt city is 85.78%; higher than state average of 69.32%. In Mhow Cantt, Male literacy is around 90.42% while female literacy rate is 80.37%.\n\n== Cantonment ==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2019}}\nAs early as 1818, the Indian Army has had a presence in Mhow. Up until World War II, Mhow was the headquarters of the [[5th (Mhow) Division|5th Division]] of the Southern Army. According to local legend, [[Winston Churchill]] also spent a few months in Mhow when he was a [[subaltern]] serving with his regiment in India. The house on the mall where he is supposed to have lived, gradually crumbled due to neglect and age. It was pulled down and a jogger's park has been built on its grounds by the Infantry School.\n\nMhow houses three premier training institutions of the Indian Army; The Infantry School, The [[Military College of Telecommunication Engineering]] (MCTE) and The [[Army War College, Mhow|Army War College]].\n\nIn addition to these institutes, Mhow is where Army Training Command or ARTRAC was born. ARTRAC was based in Mhow from 1991 to 1994, before it shifted to Shimla ([[Himachal Pradesh]]). At that time its General Officer Commanding in Chief (GOC-in-C) was Lt. General [[Shankar Roy Chowdhary]] who went on to become the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). Its first GOC-in-C was Lt. General A.S. Kalkat who had earlier commanded the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka.  ARTRAC was housed in the campus of the present Army School. This was used as All Arms Wing of MCTE for many decades. It was originally built and used as the British Military Hospital (BMH).\n\n===The Infantry School===\n\nThe Infantry School is a training establishment of the [[Indian Army]]. It is responsible for the training of officers and infantry. The Commando Wing of this school is in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]]. The Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) is a part of the Infantry School and has produced many medal winning shooters. Field Marshal [[Sam Manekshaw]] was the first Indian Commandant of this school in 1955-56 when he was a Brigadier.\nCommandant Lt Gen PN Ananthanarayanan.\n\n===Military College of Telecommunication Engineering (MCTE)===\n\nThe first training institution in Mhow, MCTE was known as the School of Signals till 1967. It is the alma mater of the Corps of Signals. MCTE conducts telecommunications and information technology courses for officers, JCOS, NCOs and soldiers of the Indian Army. Officers and men from other countries also attend courses there. It also trains gentlemen cadets for a bachelor's degree in engineering at the Cadets Training Wing (CTW). On completion of their training, most of the cadets get commissioned into the Indian Army's Corps of Signals, however, some are also commissioned into other branches.\nCommandant: Lt Gen Milind Burke\n\n===The Army War College===\n{{main article|Army War College, Mhow}}\nArmy War College, Mhow (AWC) is a tactical training and research institution of the Indian Army. It develops and evaluates concepts and doctrines for tactics and logistics. The college trains about 1,200 officers, as well as paramilitary forces each year.\n\nThe college was originally established as the College of Combat at Mhow on 1 April 1971. It was spun out of the Infantry School, Mhow. It continued to operate from the campus of the Infantry School until 1988, when the college moved to its new campus. In 2003, the college was renamed as the Army War College, Mhow.\n\nThe College mainly conducts three courses\u2014the Junior Command (JC) course, the Senior Command (SC) course and the Higher Command (HC) course. The former [[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chiefs of Army Staff (COAS)]] General K. Sundarji and General V. N. Sharma have served as the Commandant of the College. The present commandant is Lt Gen Dushyant Singh, PVSM, AVSM\n\n==Government and politics==\n\nMhow has one seat in the State Legislative Assembly (the Vidhan Sabha). The first elected MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) was the late [[R.C. Jall]] ([[Indian National Congress]]) who belonged to the [[Parsi]] community.\n\nSince 2008, the MLA from Mhow is [[Kailash Vijayvargiya]] of the [[BJP]] who was the Urban Administration Minister in the cabinet of Chief Minister [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]]. Previous MLA: [[Antar Singh Darbar]] of the [[Indian National Congress]].\n\nUntil 2009, Mhow Tehsil was part of the Indore Lok Sabha constituency. Under the delimitation exercise carried out all over the nation, Mhow is now in the [[Dhar]] Parliamentary constituency though it continues to be in Indore district for administrative purposes. Present Member of Parliament for Mhow is the Dhar MP Mrs [[Savitri Thakur]] of the BJP.\n\nMhow (and the rest of MP) went to the polls on Monday 25 November 2013. Mhow recorded what could well be its highest ever turnout in a Vidhan Sabha election - 78.11%. Total number of voters 220553. As per Mhow Control Room: Men constitute 79.34% and Women 76.76% with Overall - 78.11%.\n\nOn 8 December 2013 [[Kailash Vijayvargiya]] of the [[BJP]] was declared the winner from Mhow Vidhan Sabha constituency. He defeated Shri[[Antar Singh Darbar]] of the [[Indian National Congress]].\n\nOn 11 December 2018 [[Usha Thakur]] of the [[BJP]] was declared the winner from Mhow Vidhan Sabha constituency. She defeated Shri [[Antar Singh Darbar]] of the [[Indian National Congress]].\n\n== Tourism ==\n\n[[File:jamgate.jpg|thumb|[[Jamgate ]]|alt=|320x320px]]\n\nTourist spots in and around Mhow include:\n* [[Bhim Janmabhoomi]], a memorial\n* [[Patalpani waterfall]]\n* [[Janapav]] hill Temple\n\n=== Janapav===\n{{main|Janapav}}\nThe river [[Chambal River|Chambal]] which flows through the dacoit infested areas of northern India is said to begin at the hill of Janapav which is in a village named Kuti, around 15&nbsp;km from Mhow town. On top of the hill of Janapav is a temple and ashram. According to local legend this used to be the ashram of [[Jamadagni]], the father of [[Parashurama]] (an [[Avatar]] or reincarnation of [[Vishnu]], the Hindu God of sustenance). A mela, or religious fair, is held at Kuti every year on the auspicious day of Kartik Purnima - the first full moon after [[Diwali]], which is also celebrated as [[Guru Nanak]]'s birthday by the [[Sikh]] community - and people from villages far and near come to pray and pay their obeisance. The next day the same mela shifts to the Balaji temple in Badgonda village.\n\nThe river Gambhir which eventually joins the Kshipra - the river on whose banks the ancient, holy city of [[Ujjain]] is built - also begins at the hill of Janapav. From there it flows north towards Mhow.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:MHOW based YDM-4 loco with 52957 (Ratlam-Mhow) Passenger.jpg|thumb|MHOW YDM-4 diesel loco with 52957 RTM MHOW Passenger]]\n{{See also|Mhow railway station}}\n\nThe railway station, a meter gauge line, was founded in the 1870s as part of the Holkar State Railway. Mhow was connected to [[Indore]] and Khandwa by metre gauge railway lines. On 18 January 2008, the work of broad gauge track between Mhow-Indore was completed in 2016 and the services are currently active. On the other side the work is in progress for the gauge conversion to Khandwa. \nThe cost of the gauge conversion would be about Rs.1421.25 crore and Mhow has [[YDM-4]] Metre Gauge(M.G) locomotives in [[Ratlam]] diesel loco shed.{{Clarify|date=May 2017}}\nThe Patalpani Kalakund Ghat Section will function as a heritage railway from 25 December 2018.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nSome books about Mhow include:\n\n* ''Diaries and letters from India, 1895-1900'' by [[Violet Jacob]]; Non fiction\n* ''Last Post At Mhow'' by Arthur Hawkey; London: Jarrolds, 1969; Non fiction\n* ''Chinnery's Hotel'' by Jaysinh Birjepatil; Ravi Dayal Publishers (India); 2005; fiction\n\nThere are references to Mhow in the works of [[Rudyard Kipling]]:\n\n* His poem \"The Ladies\"\n* A reference to the train from Ajmer to Mhow in Chapter 1 of ''The Man Who would be King'' and\n* A reference to Mhow in chapter 11 of ''Kim''.\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n* [[B.R.

It is located {{convert|23|km|mi|0}} south-west of [[Indore]] city, towards [[Mumbai]] on the old [[National Highway 3 (India)|Mumbai-Agra Road]]. The town was renamed as ''Dr. Ambedkar Nagar'' in 2003, by the [[Government of Madhya Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-06-28/india/27179994_1_bhopal-notification-madhya-pradesh-government|location=[[Bhopal]]|work=[[The Times of India]]|title=Mhow town renamed as Dr Ambedkar Nagar|date=28 June 2003|access-date=21 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome articles in popular literature state that 'MHOW' stands for '''M'''ilitary '''H'''eadquarters '''O'''f '''W'''ar. However, this is a [[backronym]], and there is no proof to support the theory that the name of the village comes from the acronym. The village near Mhow was called Mhow Gaon in the pre-[[British Raj|British]] era, when English was not used in India. The Cantonment which came up in 1818 came to be known as Mhow Cantt after the name of this village. [[Sir John Malcolm]] spelt the name of this town as MOW in his writings. The 1918 edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica also mentions 'MAU'. However, the Cantonment was referred to by British officers as Mhow at least as early as the end of 1823 (letter from Lt Edward Squibb to his father in London).\n\nIn 2003, the town was renamed Dr. Ambedkar Nagar in honour of [[B. R. Ambedkar]], who was born here.\n\n==History==\n\nThis cantonment town was founded in 1818 by [[John Malcolm]] as a result of the Treaty of Mandsaur between the English and the [[Holkar]]s who were the [[Maratha]] [[Maharaja]]s of [[Indore]]. John Malcolm's forces had defeated the [[Holkar]]s of the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha Confederacy]] at the [[Battle of Mahidpur]] in 1818. It was after this battle that the capital of the Holkars shifted from the town of [[Maheshwar]] on the banks of the Narmada to Indore.\n\nMhow used to be the headquarters of the [[5th (Mhow) Division]] of the [[Southern Command (India)|Southern Command]] during the [[British Raj]]. Today this small town is associated with the [[Indian Army]] and with [[Bharat Ratna]] Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]] an economist, philosopher, jurist, anthropologist, Buddhist activist, a revolutionary, a prolific writer, and a political leader who was born here.\n\nMhow was a meter gauge railway district headquarters during the British Raj and even after 1947.<ref>Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway (B.B.& C.I. Railway) which later got incorporated in Western Railway.</ref> The irony is that Mhow finally has a broad gauge connection with Indore but regular train services are yet to commence.\n\nAccording to [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious texts, [[Janapav]] Kuti near Mhow is said to be the birthplace{{citation needed|date= March 2015}} of [[Parashurama]], an avatar of [[Vishnu]].\n\n== Climate ==\n\nMhow has a pleasant climate more often than not, however the peak summer and winter periods may get extremely hot and cold, respectively. Temperatures may go as high as 43 degrees Celsius during summers and as low as 4 degrees Celsius during winter.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2011}} India [[census]],<ref>[http://www.census2011.co.in/data/town/802275-mhow-cantt-madhya-pradesh.html]</ref> Mhow had a population of 85,023. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Mhow has an average literacy rate of 72%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; male literacy is 78%, and female literacy is 65%. The Mhow Cantt Cantonment Board has population of 81,702 of which 43,888 are males while 37,814 are females as per report released by Census India 2011.\n\nPopulation of Children with age of 0-6 is 9308 which is 11.39% of total population of Mhow Cantt (CB). In Mhow Cantt Cantonment Board, Female Sex Ratio is of 862 against state average of 931. Moreover, Child Sex Ratio in Mhow Cantt is around 908 compared to Madhya Pradesh state average of 918. Literacy rate of Mhow Cantt city is 85.78%; higher than state average of 69.32%. In Mhow Cantt, Male literacy is around 90.42% while female literacy rate is 80.37%.\n\n== Cantonment ==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2019}}\nAs early as 1818, the Indian Army has had a presence in Mhow. Up until World War II, Mhow was the headquarters of the [[5th (Mhow) Division|5th Division]] of the Southern Army. According to local legend, [[Winston Churchill]] also spent a few months in Mhow when he was a [[subaltern]] serving with his regiment in India. The house on the mall where he is supposed to have lived, gradually crumbled due to neglect and age. It was pulled down and a jogger's park has been built on its grounds by the Infantry School.\n\nMhow houses three premier training institutions of the Indian Army; The Infantry School, The [[Military College of Telecommunication Engineering]] (MCTE) and The [[Army War College, Mhow|Army War College]].\n\nIn addition to these institutes, Mhow is where Army Training Command or ARTRAC was born. ARTRAC was based in Mhow from 1991 to 1994, before it shifted to Shimla ([[Himachal Pradesh]]). At that time its General Officer Commanding in Chief (GOC-in-C) was Lt. General [[Shankar Roy Chowdhary]] who went on to become the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). Its first GOC-in-C was Lt. General A.S. Kalkat who had earlier commanded the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka.  ARTRAC was housed in the campus of the present Army School. This was used as All Arms Wing of MCTE for many decades. It was originally built and used as the British Military Hospital (BMH).\n\n===The Infantry School===\n\nThe Infantry School is a training establishment of the [[Indian Army]]. It is responsible for the training of officers and infantry. The Commando Wing of this school is in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]]. The Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) is a part of the Infantry School and has produced many medal winning shooters. Field Marshal [[Sam Manekshaw]] was the first Indian Commandant of this school in 1955-56 when he was a Brigadier.\nCommandant Lt Gen PN Ananthanarayanan.\n\n===Military College of Telecommunication Engineering (MCTE)===\n\nThe first training institution in Mhow, MCTE was known as the School of Signals till 1967. It is the alma mater of the Corps of Signals. MCTE conducts telecommunications and information technology courses for officers, JCOS, NCOs and soldiers of the Indian Army. Officers and men from other countries also attend courses there. It also trains gentlemen cadets for a bachelor's degree in engineering at the Cadets Training Wing (CTW). On completion of their training, most of the cadets get commissioned into the Indian Army's Corps of Signals, however, some are also commissioned into other branches.\nCommandant: Lt Gen Milind Burke\n\n===The Army War College===\n{{main article|Army War College, Mhow}}\nArmy War College, Mhow (AWC) is a tactical training and research institution of the Indian Army. It develops and evaluates concepts and doctrines for tactics and logistics. The college trains about 1,200 officers, as well as paramilitary forces each year.\n\nThe college was originally established as the College of Combat at Mhow on 1 April 1971. It was spun out of the Infantry School, Mhow. It continued to operate from the campus of the Infantry School until 1988, when the college moved to its new campus. In 2003, the college was renamed as the Army War College, Mhow.\n\nThe College mainly conducts three courses\u2014the Junior Command (JC) course, the Senior Command (SC) course and the Higher Command (HC) course. The former [[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chiefs of Army Staff (COAS)]] General K. Sundarji and General V. N. Sharma have served as the Commandant of the College. The present commandant is Lt Gen Dushyant Singh, PVSM, AVSM\n\n==Government and politics==\n\nMhow has one seat in the State Legislative Assembly (the Vidhan Sabha). The first elected MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) was the late [[R.C. Jall]] ([[Indian National Congress]]) who belonged to the [[Parsi]] community.\n\nSince 2008, the MLA from Mhow is [[Kailash Vijayvargiya]] of the [[BJP]] who was the Urban Administration Minister in the cabinet of Chief Minister [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]]. Previous MLA: [[Antar Singh Darbar]] of the [[Indian National Congress]].\n\nUntil 2009, Mhow Tehsil was part of the Indore Lok Sabha constituency. Under the delimitation exercise carried out all over the nation, Mhow is now in the [[Dhar]] Parliamentary constituency though it continues to be in Indore district for administrative purposes. Present Member of Parliament for Mhow is the Dhar MP Mrs [[Savitri Thakur]] of the BJP.\n\nMhow (and the rest of MP) went to the polls on Monday 25 November 2013. Mhow recorded what could well be its highest ever turnout in a Vidhan Sabha election - 78.11%. Total number of voters 220553. As per Mhow Control Room: Men constitute 79.34% and Women 76.76% with Overall - 78.11%.\n\nOn 8 December 2013 [[Kailash Vijayvargiya]] of the [[BJP]] was declared the winner from Mhow Vidhan Sabha constituency.

On top of the hill of Janapav is a temple and ashram. According to local legend this used to be the ashram of [[Jamadagni]], the father of [[Parashurama]] (an [[Avatar]] or reincarnation of [[Vishnu]], the Hindu God of sustenance). A mela, or religious fair, is held at Kuti every year on the auspicious day of Kartik Purnima - the first full moon after [[Diwali]], which is also celebrated as [[Guru Nanak]]'s birthday by the [[Sikh]] community - and people from villages far and near come to pray and pay their obeisance. The next day the same mela shifts to the Balaji temple in Badgonda village.\n\nThe river Gambhir which eventually joins the Kshipra - the river on whose banks the ancient, holy city of [[Ujjain]] is built - also begins at the hill of Janapav. From there it flows north towards Mhow.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:MHOW based YDM-4 loco with 52957 (Ratlam-Mhow) Passenger.jpg|thumb|MHOW YDM-4 diesel loco with 52957 RTM MHOW Passenger]]\n{{See also|Mhow railway station}}\n\nThe railway station, a meter gauge line, was founded in the 1870s as part of the Holkar State Railway.
