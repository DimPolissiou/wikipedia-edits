[[Morse code]] and other [[narrowband]] modes are found toward the bottom portion of the band, [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] from 28.300&nbsp;MHz up, and [[wideband]] modes ([[Amplitude Modulation|AM]] and [[Frequency Modulation|FM]]) are found near the upper part of the bottom portion of the band. Digital modes, such as [[PSK-31]], are also allowed in the upper portion of the band, with 28.120 being a popular PSK-31 frequency.\n\n== Propagation characteristics ==\n{{See also|Radio propagation}}\nDue to its unique spot in the spectrum, 10 meters can occasionally be challenging to work. At peak times of the [[solar cycle]] when many [[sunspots]] appear on the Sun's surface, 10 meters can be alive with extremely long-distance signals, refracting from the [[F region|F2 layer]] in the [[ionosphere]]. Generally speaking, the most effective and efficient propagation of 10-meter radio waves takes place during local daylight hours.  During periods of increased sunspot activity, band openings may begin well before sunrise and continue into the night.\n\nLong-distance opportunities via F2 seem to follow the sun across the globe. In North America, for instance, F2 might bring Europe and western Asia in the morning, the Americas during midday, and the Pacific and East Asia in late afternoon and early evening.\n\nEven in times of [[solar minimum]], when F2 is rarely available, 10 meters still has some long distance possibilities. [[Sporadic E propagation]] can bring in signals from a hundred to many thousands of miles away. Sporadic E on 10 meters is mainly a seasonal event, with late spring and early summer being prime time for the mode. A shorter, less-intense period occurs during mid-winter, often between Christmas and the new year. Other, off-peak openings may be seen almost anytime. Even during solar minimum, F2 openings often occur on [[TV-FM DX|transequatorial paths]], for example between Europe and [[Southern Africa]] or between Pacific [[North America]] and the Eastern Pacific islands.\n\nIn tropical latitudes 10 meters is open throughout the sunspot cycle, although propagation is often confined to other areas lying along the equator. For example, a good path from West Africa to the Caribbean exists on 10 meters even at solar minimum.\n\n== 10-meter sub-bands ==\nAlthough 10 meters has a worldwide amateur radio allocation, in some countries the use of portions of 10 meters is allocated by the government by license class, by signal mode or signal bandwidth.

The Novice sub-bands consist of two frequency ranges; one for CW and Data operation, and the other for SSB phone operation.\n\n==== Novice CW ====\n28.000&nbsp;MHz - 28.300&nbsp;MHz is a very active part of 10 meters for CW operation.\n\n==== Novice/Technician phone ====\n28.300&nbsp;MHz - 28.500&nbsp;MHz is probably the most active part of the 10-meter band. Operation in this segment is almost exclusively SSB worldwide.\n\n=== Beacons ===\nBecause the propagation on 10 meters can vary drastically throughout the day, [[Radio propagation beacon|propagation beacons]] are very important to gauge the current conditions of the band. With some differences in each [[ITU Region]]s and also from country to country, the beacon sub-bands fall between 28.100&nbsp;MHz and 28.300&nbsp;MHz. ITU Region 1 is generally 28.190&nbsp;MHz - 28.225&nbsp;MHz and ITU Region 2 is generally 28.200&nbsp;MHz - 28.300&nbsp;MHz.\n\nA list of 10-meter propagation beacons is available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qsl.net/wj5o/bcn.htm |title=10-metre propagation beacons}}</ref>\n\n<!-- <ref>{{cite web |url=http://userpages.troycable.net/~wj5o/bcn.htm |title=10-metre propagation beacons |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205121353/http://userpages.troycable.net/~wj5o/bcn.htm |archivedate=2012-02-05 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n-->\n\n=== AM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.000&nbsp;MHz to 29.200&nbsp;MHz. Formerly-common practice was to use the band in 10&nbsp;kHz steps: e.g. 29.010, 29.020, 29.030,... etc. This has not been the case since the 1970s, which saw an influx of surplus 23-channel [[Citizens band radio|CB]] equipment modified for use on the 10-meter amateur band. The surplus equipment would land in 10&nbsp;kHz steps on the 5&nbsp;kHz step such as: 29.015, 29.025, 29.035, etc. Users of the surplus equipment also inherited those radios' odd channel spacing, which on CB skipped channels that were not used there, because they were set aside for remote control operations.\n\n=== Satellite sub-band ===\nFrom 29.300&nbsp;MHz to 29.510&nbsp;MHz the satellite sub band allows amateur radio operators to communicate with orbiting [[OSCAR]]s.\n\n==== Satellite operation ====\nMany amateur radio satellites have either an uplink or a downlink in the 29&nbsp;MHz range. Information about particular satellites and operational modes is available from AMSAT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww2.amsat.org/ |title=AMSAT-NA |url-status=dead |accessdate=28 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528231659/http://ww2.amsat.org/ |archive-date=2013-05-28 }}</ref> \n\nAs of the current writing, only AO-7's 10m downlink is active.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |title=Operational OSCAR Satellite Status Summary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115132508/http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |archivedate=2013-01-15 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> \n\n=== FM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.510&nbsp;MHz to 29.700, The FM sub-band is usually channelized into [[repeater]] and [[Simplex communication|simplex]] frequencies. The channels are commonly grouped into repeater inputs, simplex, and repeater output frequencies.\n\nRepeater Input Channels:\n29.520, 29.540, 29.560, and 29.580&nbsp;MHz.\n\n'''Simplex Channel, Worldwide calling FM: 29.600&nbsp;MHz'''\n\nRepeater Output Channels:\n29.620, 29.640, 29.660, and 29.680&nbsp;MHz.\n\n==== Repeater operation ====\nCommon practice for 10-meter repeaters is to use a 100&nbsp;kHz negative offset for repeater operation. Due to the very few available repeater channels, \"odd-splits\" (offsets differing from 100&nbsp;kHz) and non-standard frequencies are not uncommon. Since 10 meters can frequently open up to propagate globally, most 10-meter repeaters use a [[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System|CTCSS]] sub-audible access tone. 16&nbsp;kHz wide signals with 5&nbsp;kHz deviation is normal in this band. 8&nbsp;kHz narrow signals with 2.5&nbsp;kHz deviation can also be found.\n\n=== FM simplex channels ===\n29.300&nbsp;MHz is a common frequency to find JA hams on. British hams commonly use the 29.400 to 29.500&nbsp;MHz band for FM as well with 29.400, 29.450, and 29.500&nbsp;MHz being common. USA hams can be found on FM anywhere above 29.000&nbsp;MHz, commonly on the above frequencies talking to overseas hams.  29.200 to 29.300&nbsp;MHz is set aside in some area band plans for FM Simplex use.\n\n== Organizations and enthusiasts ==\n* [http://www.ten-ten.org Ten-Ten International]\n* [https://breezeshooters.org/ The Breeze Shooters ARC]\n* [[Hamwave]]\n* [[Margarita & Martini 10-10 Chapter of Georgia]]\n\nDue to its unique nature, 10 meters has a large following of hobbyists who spend most of their time on this frequency band.

The Novice sub-bands consist of two frequency ranges; one for CW and Data operation, and the other for SSB phone operation.\n\n==== Novice CW ====\n28.000&nbsp;MHz - 28.300&nbsp;MHz is a very active part of 10 meters for CW operation.\n\n==== Novice/Technician phone ====\n28.300&nbsp;MHz - 28.500&nbsp;MHz is probably the most active part of the 10-meter band. Operation in this segment is almost exclusively SSB worldwide.\n\n=== Beacons ===\nBecause the propagation on 10 meters can vary drastically throughout the day, [[Radio propagation beacon|propagation beacons]] are very important to gauge the current conditions of the band. With some differences in each [[ITU Region]]s and also from country to country, the beacon sub-bands fall between 28.100&nbsp;MHz and 28.300&nbsp;MHz. ITU Region 1 is generally 28.190&nbsp;MHz - 28.225&nbsp;MHz and ITU Region 2 is generally 28.200&nbsp;MHz - 28.300&nbsp;MHz.\n\nA list of 10-meter propagation beacons is available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qsl.net/wj5o/bcn.htm |title=10-metre propagation beacons}}</ref>\n\n<!-- <ref>{{cite web |url=http://userpages.troycable.net/~wj5o/bcn.htm |title=10-metre propagation beacons |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205121353/http://userpages.troycable.net/~wj5o/bcn.htm |archivedate=2012-02-05 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n-->\n\n=== AM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.000&nbsp;MHz to 29.200&nbsp;MHz. Formerly-common practice was to use the band in 10&nbsp;kHz steps: e.g. 29.010, 29.020, 29.030,... etc. This has not been the case since the 1970s, which saw an influx of surplus 23-channel [[Citizens band radio|CB]] equipment modified for use on the 10-meter amateur band. The surplus equipment would land in 10&nbsp;kHz steps on the 5&nbsp;kHz step such as: 29.015, 29.025, 29.035, etc. Users of the surplus equipment also inherited those radios' odd channel spacing, which on CB skipped channels that were not used there, because they were set aside for remote control operations.\n\n=== Satellite sub-band ===\nFrom 29.300&nbsp;MHz to 29.510&nbsp;MHz the satellite sub band allows amateur radio operators to communicate with orbiting [[OSCAR]]s.\n\n==== Satellite operation ====\nMany amateur radio satellites have either an uplink or a downlink in the 29&nbsp;MHz range. Information about particular satellites and operational modes is available from AMSAT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww2.amsat.org/ |title=AMSAT-NA |url-status=dead |accessdate=28 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528231659/http://ww2.amsat.org/ |archive-date=2013-05-28 }}</ref> \n\nAs of the current writing, only AO-7's 10m downlink is active.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |title=Operational OSCAR Satellite Status Summary |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115132508/http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/satellites/status.php |archivedate=2013-01-15 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref> \n\n=== FM sub-band ===\nFrom 29.510&nbsp;MHz to 29.700, The FM sub-band is usually channelized into [[repeater]] and [[Simplex communication|simplex]] frequencies. The channels are commonly grouped into repeater inputs, simplex, and repeater output frequencies.\n\nRepeater Input Channels:\n29.520, 29.540, 29.560, and 29.580&nbsp;MHz.\n\n'''Simplex Channel, Worldwide calling FM: 29.600&nbsp;MHz'''\n\nRepeater Output Channels:\n29.620, 29.640, 29.660, and 29.680&nbsp;MHz.\n\n==== Repeater operation ====\nCommon practice for 10-meter repeaters is to use a 100&nbsp;kHz negative offset for repeater operation. Due to the very few available repeater channels, \"odd-splits\" (offsets differing from 100&nbsp;kHz) and non-standard frequencies are not uncommon. Since 10 meters can frequently open up to propagate globally, most 10-meter repeaters use a [[Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System|CTCSS]] sub-audible access tone. 16&nbsp;kHz wide signals with 5&nbsp;kHz deviation is normal in this band. 8&nbsp;kHz narrow signals with 2.5&nbsp;kHz deviation can also be found.\n\n=== FM simplex channels ===\n29.300&nbsp;MHz is a common frequency to find JA hams on. British hams commonly use the 29.400 to 29.500&nbsp;MHz band for FM as well with 29.400, 29.450, and 29.500&nbsp;MHz being common. USA hams can be found on FM anywhere above 29.000&nbsp;MHz, commonly on the above frequencies talking to overseas hams.  29.200 to 29.300&nbsp;MHz is set aside in some area band plans for FM Simplex use.\n\n== Organizations and enthusiasts ==\n* [http://www.ten-ten.org Ten-Ten International]\n* [https://breezeshooters.org/ The Breeze Shooters ARC]\n* [[Hamwave]]\n* [[Margarita & Martini 10-10 Chapter of Georgia]]\n\nDue to its unique nature, 10 meters has a large following of hobbyists who spend most of their time on this frequency band. The major group of enthusiasts is Ten-Ten which has been organized since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ten-ten.org/ |title=10-10 International |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=FCCTable>\n{{cite web\n|url         = http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/spectrum/table/fcctable.pdf\n|title       = FCC Online Table of Frequency Allocations\n|date        = June 2, 2011\n|work        = 47 C.F.R.\n|publisher   = Federal Communications Commission\n|format      = PDF\n|accessdate  = 28 May 2013\n|quote       = \n}}\n</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{AmateurRadioBands-MFHF}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:10-meter Band}}\n\n[[Category:Amateur radio bands]]\n", "name_user": "Stereorock", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUSA", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-meter_band"}

He first attended school at [[St. Edward's School, Shimla]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/jameson/biography.html|title=Antony Jameson's Home Page, Dept. of Aeronautics & Astronautics|website=aero-comlab.stanford.edu|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>.

On coming out of the army he worked in the compressor design section of [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol Aero-Engines]] in the summer of 1955, before studying engineering at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]].  Jameson graduated with first class honours in 1958. Subsequently, he stayed on at Cambridge to obtain a PhD in [[Magnetohydrodynamics]], and he was a Research Fellow of Trinity Hall from 1960 to 1963.\n\n==Career in the UK==\nOn leaving Cambridge he worked as an economist for the [[Trades Union Congress]] in 1964\u20131965. He then became Chief Mathematician at [[Hawker Siddeley]] in [[Coventry]].\n\n==Career in the United States==\nIn 1966, Jameson joined the Aerodynamics Section of [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]] in [[Bethpage, New York]]. In this period, his work was largely directed toward the application of [[automatic control]] theory to [[Autopilot|stability augmentation]] systems. Starting in 1970, he began to concentrate on the problem of predicting [[transonic]] flow. Existing numerical methods were not equal to the task, and it was clear that new methods would have to be developed. At that time limitations in computer capabilities also precluded any attempt to calculate the flow past a complete aircraft, but useful efforts could be made for simpler configurations such as [[airfoils]] and wings.\n\nIn 1972 Jameson moved to the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] at [[New York University]], where he continued his work on transonic flow. In 1974 he was appointed Professor of [[Computer Science]] at [[New York University]]. He joined [[Princeton University]] in 1980, and in 1982 he was appointed [[James Smith McDonnell]] Distinguished University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. He was Director of the University's Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics from 1986 to 1988.  He was a Professor of Engineering in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics from 1997\u20132015, [[Stanford University]]. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University.\n\n==Computational fluid dynamics methods==\nDuring his career, Professor Jameson has devised a variety of new schemes for solving the [[Euler]] and [[Navier-Stokes]] equations for [[inviscid]] and [[viscous]] compressible flows.  For example, he devised a [[multigrid]]-scheme for the solution of steady flow problems and the [[dual time stepping scheme]] for unsteady flows.\n\nJameson also wrote the FLO and SYN series of computer programs which have been widely used in the [[aircraft industry]].\n\n==Awards==\nIn 1980 he received the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement in recognition of his earlier work on transonic potential flow. In 1988 he received the Gold Medal of the British [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] for his outstanding contribution to the development of methods for the calculation of transonic flow over real aircraft configurations. In 1991 he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]], and he was also elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In 1993, he was selected to receive the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Fluid Dynamics Award in recognition of numerous contributions to computational fluid dynamics and the development of many widely used computer programs which have immeasurably improved the capability to analyse and understand complex flows. In 1995 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]] for Improving Natural Knowledge. In 1995, he was selected by [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] to receive The Spirit of St. Louis Medal for numerous outstanding contributions to computational fluid dynamics and the development of many widely used computer programs that have immeasurably improved understanding of complex flow fields and become a dominant tool for aerodynamic design. In 1996 he was selected to receive the Theodorsen Lectureship Award from ICASE/NASA, Langley.

He has published more than 300 scientific papers (authored or co-authored) in a wide range of areas including computational fluid dynamics, [[aerodynamics]], and [[control theory]].<ref name=boxcluster />\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Gillingham, Kent]], UK Jameson spent much of his early childhood in [[India]] where his father was stationed as a [[British Army]] Officer. He first attended school at [[St. Edward's School, Shimla]]. Subsequently, he was educated in England at [[Mowden Hall School]] and [[Winchester College]].<ref name=\"Stanford ACL\">{{cite web |title=Antony Jameson |url=http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/jameson/ |website=Aerospace Computing Laboratory |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=11 January 2015 |quote=Old Wykehamist Fellow, AD Portas, Winchester College, 2011.}}</ref>\n\nJameson served as a lieutenant in the British Army in 1953\u20131955, and was sent to [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]]. On coming out of the army he worked in the compressor design section of [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol Aero-Engines]] in the summer of 1955, before studying engineering at [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]].  Jameson graduated with first class honours in 1958. Subsequently, he stayed on at Cambridge to obtain a PhD in [[Magnetohydrodynamics]], and he was a Research Fellow of Trinity Hall from 1960 to 1963.\n\n==Career in the UK==\nOn leaving Cambridge he worked as an economist for the [[Trades Union Congress]] in 1964\u20131965. He then became Chief Mathematician at [[Hawker Siddeley]] in [[Coventry]].\n\n==Career in the United States==\nIn 1966, Jameson joined the Aerodynamics Section of [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]] in [[Bethpage, New York]]. In this period, his work was largely directed toward the application of [[automatic control]] theory to [[Autopilot|stability augmentation]] systems. Starting in 1970, he began to concentrate on the problem of predicting [[transonic]] flow. Existing numerical methods were not equal to the task, and it was clear that new methods would have to be developed. At that time limitations in computer capabilities also precluded any attempt to calculate the flow past a complete aircraft, but useful efforts could be made for simpler configurations such as [[airfoils]] and wings.\n\nIn 1972 Jameson moved to the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] at [[New York University]], where he continued his work on transonic flow. In 1974 he was appointed Professor of [[Computer Science]] at [[New York University]]. He joined [[Princeton University]] in 1980, and in 1982 he was appointed [[James Smith McDonnell]] Distinguished University Professor of Aerospace Engineering. He was Director of the University's Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics from 1986 to 1988.  He was a Professor of Engineering in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics from 1997\u20132015, [[Stanford University]]. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University.\n\n==Computational fluid dynamics methods==\nDuring his career, Professor Jameson has devised a variety of new schemes for solving the [[Euler]] and [[Navier-Stokes]] equations for [[inviscid]] and [[viscous]] compressible flows.  For example, he devised a [[multigrid]]-scheme for the solution of steady flow problems and the [[dual time stepping scheme]] for unsteady flows.\n\nJameson also wrote the FLO and SYN series of computer programs which have been widely used in the [[aircraft industry]].\n\n==Awards==\nIn 1980 he received the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement in recognition of his earlier work on transonic potential flow. In 1988 he received the Gold Medal of the British [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] for his outstanding contribution to the development of methods for the calculation of transonic flow over real aircraft configurations. In 1991 he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]], and he was also elected an Honorary Fellow of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In 1993, he was selected to receive the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Fluid Dynamics Award in recognition of numerous contributions to computational fluid dynamics and the development of many widely used computer programs which have immeasurably improved the capability to analyse and understand complex flows. In 1995 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]] for Improving Natural Knowledge. In 1995, he was selected by [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] to receive The Spirit of St. Louis Medal for numerous outstanding contributions to computational fluid dynamics and the development of many widely used computer programs that have immeasurably improved understanding of complex flow fields and become a dominant tool for aerodynamic design. In 1996 he was selected to receive the Theodorsen Lectureship Award from ICASE/NASA, Langley. In 1997 he was elected as a Foreign Associate to the [[National Academy of Engineering]].<ref>[http://www.nae.edu/nae/naepub.nsf/Members+By+UNID/A2F69FB5867C838486257552006B33EA?opendocument Dr. Jameson] at the [[National Academy of Engineering]]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529195138/http://www.nae.edu/nae/naepub.nsf/Members%2BBy%2BUNID/A2F69FB5867C838486257552006B33EA?opendocument |date=29 May 2010 }}</ref> In 2001 he received the degree Docteur Honoris Causa from the [[University of Paris]], and in 2002 he received the degree Docteur Honoris Causa from [[Uppsala University]].

The station is owned by {{nowrap|[[iHeartMedia, Inc.]]}}, through licensee Citicasters, and brands as \"Channel 93.3\", sounded out as \"Channel 9-3-3\".  The station's studios are located in San Diego's [[Serra Mesa, San Diego|Serra Mesa]] area, while the transmitter is located in Chollas View, which is east of [[Balboa Park, San Diego|Balboa Park]] and west of Emerald Hills, sharing facilities with [[KLSD]]. The station is available in [[HD Radio]]; the HD2 subchannel airs an [[LGBT]]-leaning [[Electronic dance music|dance hits]] format, carrying iHeart's [[Pride Radio]] network.\n\nCurrently, KHTS-FM is the most listened to radio station in all of the San Diego region, averaging nearly 1,000,000 listeners.<ref>http://www.allaccess.com/arbitron/q/market/107</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early beginnings, KECR (1961\u20131995)===\nThe station signed on in 1961 as '''KECR''', later becoming '''KECR-FM'''. For most of its existence prior to 1995, the station was owned by the religious [[Family Radio]] organization and aired its [[Christian radio|talk radio]] programming. Originally, the station maintained a localized board operator to air local news and weather, but when satellite technology became available, it became a repeater for [[KEAR (AM)|KEAR]] in San Francisco. This religious format continued until 1995, when [[Jacor Communications]] purchased KECR-FM for $13.8 million.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RandR-IDX/IDX/90s/95/RR-1995-10-06-OCR-Page-0004.pdf |title=Heftel Takes Sole Possession Of Miami Duopoly In $19.8 Million Deal |magazine=Radio and Records |page=4 |date=October 6, 1995 |access-date=February 15, 2019 }}</ref> Family Radio now broadcasts in San Diego on [[KECR]] (910 AM). This acquisition marked Jacor's entry into San Diego. Shortly after the acquisition closed, the station acquired the '''KHTS''' callsign.\n\n===Channel 933 launches (1996\u20131998)===\nIn March 1996, KHTS began [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with a [[simulcast]] of [[Tampa, Florida]]-based [[WFLZ-FM]] (coincidentally, also on 93.3 FM in that market) in an early form of [[voicetracking]], allowing Jacor to plan for and hire for a new station without having to depend on a commercial-free \"many-songs-in-a-row\" gimmick during the transition period.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RandR-IDX/IDX/90s/96/R&R-1996-03-22-OCR-Page-0018.pdf |title=Rumors |magazine=Radio and Records |page=18 |date=March 22, 1996 |access-date=February 15, 2019 }}</ref> This brought personalities such as [[Bubba The Love Sponge]] to the market, along with WFLZ referencing San Diego weather and events in their programming. This also allowed sufficient time to finish construction on the studios, which at the time, were located on Pacific Highway, about a mile from [[Pechanga Arena]]. The simulcast was broken on August 30, 1996, with the stunting shifting to a 43-hour loop of remixes of the then-popular song \"[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]\" by [[Los Del Rio]].\n\nOn September 1, 1996 at 10 a.m., the stunting shifted to a broadcast of that day's [[San Diego Chargers]] game in place of [[XEWW-AM|XETRA-AM]], which is required by law to carry Mexican presidential addresses under its Mexican radio license. At 4 p.m. that day, KHTS officially flipped to a dance-heavy [[Rhythmic contemporary]] format, branded as \"Channel 933\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-09-06.pdf |title=KHTS/SD Channels In On CHR/Rhythmic |magazine=Radio and Records |pages=3, 28 |date=September 6, 1996 |access-date=February 14, 2019 }}</ref> The station would also air attack liners against rivals [[XHITZ-FM]], [[KFBG (FM)|KFMB-FM]], and [[KLNV|KKLQ]]; the latter two have since changed formats.\n\n===Nationwide/Jacor merger, Clear Channel acquisition (1998\u20132003)===\nBy summer 1998, KHTS would move away from its dance-heavy approach to a more mainstream direction due to the Nationwide/Jacor merger. The merger would have brought KKLQ into the same ownership, but that station was spun off to Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation (now [[Univision Radio]]) in order to comply with the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] ownership limits.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-09-04.pdf |title=Skinning The Cat Six Ways, Jacor Style |magazine=Radio and Records |pages=46, 48 |date=September 4, 1998 |access-date=February 15, 2019 }}</ref> During the first week of August in 1998, KHTS flipped to its present CHR format, inheriting the playlist from KKLQ (now [[KLNV]]). The station also launched ''Club 933'', a dance mix show featuring dance remixes of contemporary hits. By 2000, outdoor advertising firm [[Clear Channel Outdoor|Clear Channel]] (through its [[Clear Channel Communications|radio and communications]] division) took ownership of the station. During this time, the station's transmitter was on Mount San Miguel, given El Cajon being its [[city of license]]. In 2001, the transmitter moved to its present site, sharing an antenna with sister station [[KLSD]], in order to provide better coverage of the San Diego metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fybush.com/sites/2009/site-090327.html |title=KGB and KOGO, San Diego |website=Fybush.com |date=March 27, 2009 |access-date=February 14, 2019 }}</ref> The station's studios were also moved to their present location in Serra Mesa. Despite all these changes, the station remains licensed to El Cajon.\n\n===New technology (2003\u20132013)===\nOn May 28, 2003, the station's callsign received the -FM suffix, becoming '''KHTS-FM'''. This was a legal change in order to avoid confusion of [[KHTS (AM)|an AM talk radio station with the same call letters]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fccdata.org/?lang=en&facid=20697 |title=KHTS-FM |website=FCCData.org |access-date=February 14, 2019 }}</ref> The callsign meaning also became \"Hits\" to reference the top 40 format. From 2001 until 2009, the station was the San Diego home for AJ Machado, at which time the show was called AJ's Playhouse. In 2004, the station began [[Radio Data System|RDS]] broadcasting in preparation for a commencement of [[HD Radio]] broadcasting in 2005, showing song titles and other text information on certified devices. The technology was also fitted to sister station [[KGB-FM]], and has since been fitted to the other three FM sisters in the cluster.\n\nIn 2006, the station added notable personality Geena The Latina, who came in from [[KIIS-FM]], to co-host [[Drive time|morning drive]] with AJ Machado.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/7203/geena-the-latina-rolls-into-mornings-at-khts |title=Geena The Latina Rolls Into Mornings At KHTS |website=All Access |publisher=All Access Music Group |date=March 13, 2006 |access-date=February 15, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Harris Fire]] in October 2007, KHTS-FM suspended all music programming to air news updates from AM sister station [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]], which applied to all of its sister stations. In addition, the news updates included the [[Witch Fire]]. This began on October 21, while normal programming resumed on the 24th at 11:00pm.\n\nThe station began to maintain a rhythmic-leaning direction (with occasional [[alternative music]] tracks) in 2013 while continuing to air dance mixes on weekends. This was mainly to compete with KEGY, but also due to [[XHITZ-FM]] de-emphasizing hip-hop around this time.\n\n===iHeart ownership (2014\u2013present)===\nOn September 16, 2014, Clear Channel spun off its radio and communications divisions into a new company; KHTS-FM then became a part of iHeartMedia, its present owner. At the same time, the station began airing programming from [[iHeartRadio]]. The station also unveiled a new logo, using the green and purple from the previous logo, but now adding a green decimal point for its frequency. Despite this, the numbers are still pronounced individually.\n\nIn July 2017, the station became the San Diego affiliate for [[American Top 40|AT40]], and in February 2018, the station began airing the weekly, network-wide [[iHeartRadio Countdown]] show, hosted by KIIS-FM personality [[JoJo Wright]].\n\nIn early 2020, iHeartMedia announced major personality layoffs across their portfolio of stations. On January 20, 2020, It was confirmed on social media that KHTS-FM had been affected, as Kramer from the Kramer and Geena morning show was out as morning host.<ref>{{cite news|last=Venta|first=Lance|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/183270/ongoing-list-of-those-affected-by-iheartmedia-cuts/|title=Ongoing List Of Those Affected By iHeartMedia Cuts|publisher=Radio Insight|date=20 January 2020|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> An on-air statement explaining the situation was made on January 21, 2020.

The station is owned by {{nowrap|[[iHeartMedia, Inc.]]}}, through licensee Citicasters, and brands as \"Channel 93.3\", sounded out as \"Channel 9-3-3\".  The station's studios are located in San Diego's [[Serra Mesa, San Diego|Serra Mesa]] area, while the transmitter is located in Chollas View, which is east of [[Balboa Park, San Diego|Balboa Park]] and west of Emerald Hills, sharing facilities with [[KLSD]]. The station is available in [[HD Radio]]; the HD2 subchannel airs an [[LGBT]]-leaning [[Electronic dance music|dance hits]] format, carrying iHeart's [[Pride Radio]] network.\n\nCurrently, KHTS-FM is the most listened to radio station in all of the San Diego region, averaging nearly 1,000,000 listeners.<ref>http://www.allaccess.com/arbitron/q/market/107</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early beginnings, KECR (1961\u20131995)===\nThe station signed on in 1961 as '''KECR''', later becoming '''KECR-FM'''. For most of its existence prior to 1995, the station was owned by the religious [[Family Radio]] organization and aired its [[Christian radio|talk radio]] programming. Originally, the station maintained a localized board operator to air local news and weather, but when satellite technology became available, it became a repeater for [[KEAR (AM)|KEAR]] in San Francisco. This religious format continued until 1995, when [[Jacor Communications]] purchased KECR-FM for $13.8 million.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RandR-IDX/IDX/90s/95/RR-1995-10-06-OCR-Page-0004.pdf |title=Heftel Takes Sole Possession Of Miami Duopoly In $19.8 Million Deal |magazine=Radio and Records |page=4 |date=October 6, 1995 |access-date=February 15, 2019 }}</ref> Family Radio now broadcasts in San Diego on [[KECR]] (910 AM). This acquisition marked Jacor's entry into San Diego. Shortly after the acquisition closed, the station acquired the '''KHTS''' callsign.\n\n===Channel 933 launches (1996\u20131998)===\nIn March 1996, KHTS began [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with a [[simulcast]] of [[Tampa, Florida]]-based [[WFLZ-FM]] (coincidentally, also on 93.3 FM in that market) in an early form of [[voicetracking]], allowing Jacor to plan for and hire for a new station without having to depend on a commercial-free \"many-songs-in-a-row\" gimmick during the transition period.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Music/Archive-RandR-IDX/IDX/90s/96/R&R-1996-03-22-OCR-Page-0018.pdf |title=Rumors |magazine=Radio and Records |page=18 |date=March 22, 1996 |access-date=February 15, 2019 }}</ref> This brought personalities such as [[Bubba The Love Sponge]] to the market, along with WFLZ referencing San Diego weather and events in their programming. This also allowed sufficient time to finish construction on the studios, which at the time, were located on Pacific Highway, about a mile from [[Pechanga Arena]]. The simulcast was broken on August 30, 1996, with the stunting shifting to a 43-hour loop of remixes of the then-popular song \"[[Macarena (song)|Macarena]]\" by [[Los Del Rio]].\n\nOn September 1, 1996 at 10 a.m., the stunting shifted to a broadcast of that day's [[San Diego Chargers]] game in place of [[XEWW-AM|XETRA-AM]], which is required by law to carry Mexican presidential addresses under its Mexican radio license. At 4 p.m. that day, KHTS officially flipped to a dance-heavy [[Rhythmic contemporary]] format, branded as \"Channel 933\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-09-06.pdf |title=KHTS/SD Channels In On CHR/Rhythmic |magazine=Radio and Records |pages=3, 28 |date=September 6, 1996 |access-date=February 14, 2019 }}</ref> The station would also air attack liners against rivals [[XHITZ-FM]], [[KFMB-FM]], and [[KLNV|KKLQ]]; the latter two have since changed formats.\n\n===Nationwide/Jacor merger, Clear Channel acquisition (1998\u20132003)===\nBy summer 1998, KHTS would move away from its dance-heavy approach to a more mainstream direction due to the Nationwide/Jacor merger. The merger would have brought KKLQ into the same ownership, but that station was spun off to Hispanic Broadcasting Corporation (now [[Univision Radio]]) in order to comply with the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] ownership limits.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-09-04.pdf |title=Skinning The Cat Six Ways, Jacor Style |magazine=Radio and Records |pages=46, 48 |date=September 4, 1998 |access-date=February 15, 2019 }}</ref> During the first week of August in 1998, KHTS flipped to its present CHR format, inheriting the playlist from KKLQ (now [[KLNV]]). The station also launched ''Club 933'', a dance mix show featuring dance remixes of contemporary hits. By 2000, outdoor advertising firm [[Clear Channel Outdoor|Clear Channel]] (through its [[Clear Channel Communications|radio and communications]] division) took ownership of the station. During this time, the station's transmitter was on Mount San Miguel, given El Cajon being its [[city of license]]. In 2001, the transmitter moved to its present site, sharing an antenna with sister station [[KLSD]], in order to provide better coverage of the San Diego metropolitan area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fybush.com/sites/2009/site-090327.html |title=KGB and KOGO, San Diego |website=Fybush.com |date=March 27, 2009 |access-date=February 14, 2019 }}</ref> The station's studios were also moved to their present location in Serra Mesa. Despite all these changes, the station remains licensed to El Cajon.\n\n===New technology (2003\u20132013)===\nOn May 28, 2003, the station's callsign received the -FM suffix, becoming '''KHTS-FM'''. This was a legal change in order to avoid confusion of [[KHTS (AM)|an AM talk radio station with the same call letters]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fccdata.org/?lang=en&facid=20697 |title=KHTS-FM |website=FCCData.org |access-date=February 14, 2019 }}</ref> The callsign meaning also became \"Hits\" to reference the top 40 format. From 2001 until 2009, the station was the San Diego home for AJ Machado, at which time the show was called AJ's Playhouse. In 2004, the station began [[Radio Data System|RDS]] broadcasting in preparation for a commencement of [[HD Radio]] broadcasting in 2005, showing song titles and other text information on certified devices. The technology was also fitted to sister station [[KGB-FM]], and has since been fitted to the other three FM sisters in the cluster.\n\nIn 2006, the station added notable personality Geena The Latina, who came in from [[KIIS-FM]], to co-host [[Drive time|morning drive]] with AJ Machado.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/7203/geena-the-latina-rolls-into-mornings-at-khts |title=Geena The Latina Rolls Into Mornings At KHTS |website=All Access |publisher=All Access Music Group |date=March 13, 2006 |access-date=February 15, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Harris Fire]] in October 2007, KHTS-FM suspended all music programming to air news updates from AM sister station [[KOGO (AM)|KOGO]], which applied to all of its sister stations. In addition, the news updates included the [[Witch Fire]]. This began on October 21, while normal programming resumed on the 24th at 11:00pm.\n\nThe station began to maintain a rhythmic-leaning direction (with occasional [[alternative music]] tracks) in 2013 while continuing to air dance mixes on weekends. This was mainly to compete with KEGY, but also due to [[XHITZ-FM]] de-emphasizing hip-hop around this time.\n\n===iHeart ownership (2014\u2013present)===\nOn September 16, 2014, Clear Channel spun off its radio and communications divisions into a new company; KHTS-FM then became a part of iHeartMedia, its present owner. At the same time, the station began airing programming from [[iHeartRadio]]. The station also unveiled a new logo, using the green and purple from the previous logo, but now adding a green decimal point for its frequency. Despite this, the numbers are still pronounced individually.\n\nIn July 2017, the station became the San Diego affiliate for [[American Top 40|AT40]], and in February 2018, the station began airing the weekly, network-wide [[iHeartRadio Countdown]] show, hosted by KIIS-FM personality [[JoJo Wright]].\n\nIn early 2020, iHeartMedia announced major personality layoffs across their portfolio of stations. On January 20, 2020, It was confirmed on social media that KHTS-FM had been affected, as Kramer from the Kramer and Geena morning show was out as morning host.<ref>{{cite news|last=Venta|first=Lance|url=https://radioinsight.com/headlines/183270/ongoing-list-of-those-affected-by-iheartmedia-cuts/|title=Ongoing List Of Those Affected By iHeartMedia Cuts|publisher=Radio Insight|date=20 January 2020|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> An on-air statement explaining the situation was made on January 21, 2020.
