B.O.Y.D. then transfers half of the fortune to his account for his new parents ([[Yuri Lowenthal]] & [[Tara Platt]]), allowing them to finally ground Doofus.

After Scrooge locks the boys in a room for making fun of him, the triplets come across Webby Vanderquack, who befriends them and shows off a collection of relics and artifacts that Scrooge and Donald collected during their previous adventures, only to accidentally release various ancient evils housed in them. After the kids help him contain them, Scrooge finds his thirst for adventure rekindled and decides to take them all, along with his driver/pilot Launchpad McQuack, to find the Lost Jewel of [[Atlantis]]. However, the group are unaware that Scrooge's rival, [[Flintheart Glomgold]] ([[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]), seeks the jewel as well and has hired Donald as his sailor; leading to a race against time to claim the relic. During their quest, Dewey argues with Scrooge about locking him and his brothers up and not wanting them around, though they later reconcile. In the end, Scrooge gets the Jewel, and Donald and the boys move into McDuck Manor after an accident costs them their houseboat.

After Violet saves his life, he admits she's a better Woodchuck and forfeits the competition. Meanwhile, Scrooge finds a map to the treasure of famed adventurer Isabella Finch, but his attempts to find it are thwarted when the rest of the family decide to follow a strange bird instead. While he insists they are missing out, the others remind him that it is more meaningful to have your own adventure than to follow someone else's. The bird ultimately leads them to Finch's treasure: her lost adventure journal which contains a list of legendary treasures she was unable to find. The group resolve to hunt the treasures down, unaware that F.O.W.L. is spying on them and plotting to claim them first.\n|LineColor        = 960018\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 49\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Quack Pack!\n |RTitle          =\n |DirectedBy      = Tanner Johnson\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Francisco Angones, Madison Bateman, Colleen Evanson, Christian Magalhaes & Bob Snow|t=Snow}}\n |Aux2            = Vince Aparo, Kristen Gish & Victoria Harris\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|4}}\n |ProdCode        = 303\n |Viewers         = 0.19<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-saturday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-4-20.html|title=Top 150 Saturday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.4.2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|author=Mitch Metcalf|date=April 7, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = While on an adventure to find the Lost Lamp of Collie Baba, Donald wishes for a normal life, unaware he was next to the lamp. Fulfilling Donald's wish, [[List of DuckTales characters#Gene the Genie|Gene the Genie]] ([[Jaleel White]]) sends the family into a '90s sitcom called ''[[Quack Pack]]'' and erases their memories. While focusing on taking the perfect family photo, Huey suspects something is wrong after hearing Donald's normal voice and slowly manages to convince the others. Donald tries his best to hide his secret by maintaining the plot and reluctantly hiring his wacky neighbor, [[Goofy]] ([[Bill Farmer]]), to be the photographer. The family eventually finds Gene and demand he send them back home, but he tells them only Donald can reverse the wish since he made it. Donald refuses and storms off with Goofy. When the others try to escape, the wish fights back to maintain itself. Using his son [[Max Goof|Max]] as inspiration, Goofy helps Donald realize that different families can have their own idea of \"normal\" before helping him save his. Amidst the chaos, Goofy finds the lamp and Donald uses his second wish to undo his first.

However, this theory has been disputed even before cinema was introduced in 1895. \nIf \"persistence of vision\" is explained as \"flicker fusion\", it can be seen as an important factor in the illusion of moving pictures in cinema and related [[optical toys]], but not as its sole principle.\n\nEarly descriptions of the illusion often attributed the effect purely to imperfections of the eye, particularly of the [[retina]]. Nerves and parts of the brain later became part of explanations.\n\n[[Sensory memory]] has been cited as a cause.<ref>Goldstein, B. (2011). ''Cognitive Psychology: Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience--with coglab manual. (3rd ed.).'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth: 120.</ref>\n\n==Natural occurrences and applications==\nSome natural phenomena and the principles of some optical toys have been attributed to the persistence of vision effect. Patrick d'Arcy recognised the effect in \"the luminous ring that we see by turning a torch quickly, the fire wheels in the fireworks, the flattened spindle shape we see in a vibrating cord, the continuous circle we see in a cogwheel that turns with speed\".<ref name=d'Arcy1768 /> Basically everything that resembles [[motion blur]] seen in fast moving objects could be regarded as \"persistence of vision\".\n\n===Sparkler's trail effect===\nThe fact that a glowing coal appears as a line of light when it is moved around quickly has often been used to illustrate the idea of persistence of vision.<ref name=Cyclop\u00e6dia/>\nIt is known as the \"sparkler's trail effect\", named after the trail that appears when a [[sparkler]] is moved around quickly.\n\nThe effect has been applied in the arts by writing or drawing with a light source recorded by a camera with a long exposure time.\n\n===Color-top / Newton disc===\n{{Main|Newton disc}}\nColors on spinning tops or rotating wheels mix together if the motion is too fast to register the details. A colored dot then appears as a circle and one line can make the whole surface appear in one uniform hue.\n\nThe Newton disc optically mixes wedges of [[Isaac Newton]]'s primary colors into one (off-)white surface when it spins fast.\n\n===Thaumatrope===\nIn April 1825 the first ''[[Thaumatrope]]'' was published by W. Phillips (in anonymous association with [[John Ayrton Paris]]).<ref name=\"Herbert\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/thaumatropeTEXT1.htm |last=Herbert |first=Stephen |title=Wheel of Life - The Taumatrope}}</ref> The fact that the image of one side of the disc seems to blend with the image of the other side when it is looked at while it is twirled very fast, is often used as an illustration of persistence of vision.\n\n===Kaleidoscopic colour-top===\nIn April 1858 John Gorham patented his ''Kaleidoscopic colour-top''.<ref>[http://www.fleaglass.com/ads/gorham-patent-kaleidoscopic-top/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> This is a [[top]] on which two small discs are placed, usually one with colors and a black one with cut-out patterns. When the discs spin and the top disc is retarded into regular jerky motions the toy exhibits \"beautiful forms which are similar to those of the [[kaleidoscope]]\" with multiplied colours. Gorham described how the colours appear mixed on the spinning top \"from the duration of successive impressions on the retina\". Gorham founded the principle on \"the well-known experiment of whirling a stick, ignited at one end\" (a.k.a. the sparkler's trail effect).<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrdbAAAAcAAJ&dq|last=Gorham|first=John|title=The Rotation of Coloured Discs|date=January 1859}}</ref>\n\n===Rubber pencil trick===\nA pencil or another rigid straight line can appear as bending and becoming rubbery when it is wiggled fast enough between fingers, or otherwise undergoing rigid motion.\n\nPersistence of vision has been discarded as sole cause of the illusion. It is thought that the eye movements of the observer fail to track the motions of features of the object.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Illusory bending of a rigidly moving line segment: Effects of image motion and smooth pursuit eye movements|first1=Lore|last1=Thaler|first2=James T.|last2=Todd|first3=Miriam|last3=Spering|first4=Karl R.|last4=Gegenfurtner|date=1 April 2007|journal=Journal of Vision|volume=7|issue=6|page=9|doi=10.1167/7.6.9|pmid = 17685792}}</ref>\n\nThis effect is known as an entertaining \"magic\" trick for children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/rubber-pencil-kids-magic-tricks-2267012|title=Easy Magic Tricks for Kids: The Rubber Pencil|website=TheSpruce.com|access-date=29 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===LED POV displays===\nThe term \"persistence of vision display\" or \"POV display\" has been used for [[LED]] display devices that compose images by displaying one spatial portion at a time in rapid succession (for example, one column of pixels every few milliseconds){{citation needed|date=May 2017}}. A two-dimensional POV display is often accomplished by means of rapidly moving a single row of LEDs along a linear or circular path.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The effect is that the image is perceived as a whole by the viewer as long as the entire path is completed during the visual persistence time of the human eye.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} A further effect is often to give the illusion of the image floating in mid-air.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  A three-dimensional POV display is often constructed using a 2D grid of LEDs which is swept or rotated through a volume.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} POV display devices can be used in combination with long camera exposures to produce [[light writing]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nA common example of this can be seen in the use of bicycle wheel lights that produce patterns.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==History==\nAlthough the theory of persistence of vision as the (main) reason we see film as motion has been disproved since 1912, film historians have persisted in citing the theory as well as historical references to afterimages and similar illusions. The following developments are relevant to that story.\n\n===Historical references to afterimages===\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) noted that the image of the sun remained in his vision after he stopped looking at it.\n\nThe discovery of persistence of vision is sometimes attributed to the Roman poet [[Lucretius]] (c. 15 October 99 BCE \u2013 c. 55 BCE), although he only mentions something similar in connection with images seen in a dream.<ref>Herbert, S. (2000). A history of pre-cinema. London. Routledge. p 121</ref>\n\nAround 165 CE [[Ptolemy]] described in his book ''[[Optics (Ptolemy)|Optics]]'' a rotating potter's wheel with different colors on it. He noted how the different colors of sectors mixed together into one color and how dots appeared as circles when the wheel was spinning very fast. When lines are drawn across the axis of the disc they make the whole surface appear to be of a uniform color. \"The visual impression that is created in the first revolution is invariably followed by repeated instances that subsequently produce an identical impression. This also happens in the case of shooting stars, whose light seems distended on account of their speed of motion, all according to the amount of\nperceptible distance it passes along with the sensible impression that arises in the visual faculty.\"<ref name=smith>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ASILAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA43&dq=ptolemy+potter's+wheel&pg=PA43#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Ptolemy and the Foundations of Ancient Mathematical Optics: A Source Based Guided Study|first=A.

Certain intervals between repeated impressions are not detected. A white or black spot on a spinning cone (or top) appears as a circle of that color and a line on the top makes the whole surface appear in that color. \"Because of the  swiftness of the movement we receive the impression of the line on every part of the cone as the line moves.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c6QKDgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA137&dq=ptolemy+spinning+top&pg=PA137#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Porphyry's Commentary on Ptolemy's Harmonics: A Greek Text and Annotated Translation|date=15 September 2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|access-date=29 October 2017|via=Google Books|isbn=9781316239681}}</ref>\n\nIn the 11th century [[Ibn al-Haytham]], who was familiar with Ptolemy's writings, described how colored lines on a spinning top could not be discerned as different colors but appeared as one new color composed of all of the colors of the lines. He deducted that sight needs some time to discern a color. al-Haytam also noted that the top appeared motionless when spun extremely quick \"for none of its points remains fixed in the same spot for any perceptible time\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3x0LAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA639&dq=ptolemy+optics+color+rotating+wheel&pg=PA444#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Alhacen's Theory of Visual Perception: A Critical Edition, with English Translation and Commentary, of the First Three Books of Alhacen's De Aspectibus, the Medieval Latin Version of Ibn Al-Haytham's Kitab Al-Manazir|last1=Alhazen|first2=A.

In his 1704 book ''[[Opticks]]'' he described a machine with prisms, a lens and a large moving comb with teeth causing alternating colors to be projected successively. If this was done quickly enough, the alternating colours could no longer be perceived separately but were seen as white. Newton compared its principle to the sparkler's trail effect: a gyrating burning coal could appear as a circle of fire because \"the sensation of the coal in the several places of that circle remains impress'd on the sensorium, until the coal return again to the same place.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnAFAAAAQAAJ&dq=newton+Theory+about+Light+and+Colors&pg=PA123|title=Opticks:: Or, A Treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light|first=Sir Isaac|last=Newton|date=29 October 2017|publisher=William Innys at the West-End of St. Paul's.|access-date=29 October 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn 1768 [[Patrick d'Arcy]] (1725-1779) reported how he had measured a duration of 0,13 seconds for one full rotation of a burning coal while it was seen as a full circle of light.

However, a unique part of Faraday's experiments concerned turning wheels in front of a mirror and this inspired Plateau with the idea for new illusions.

However, this theory has been disputed even before cinema was introduced in 1895. \nIf \"persistence of vision\" is explained as \"flicker fusion\", it can be seen as an important factor in the illusion of moving pictures in cinema and related [[optical toys]], but not as its sole principle.\n\nEarly descriptions of the illusion often attributed the effect purely to imperfections of the eye, particularly of the [[retina]]. Nerves and parts of the brain later became part of explanations.\n\n[[Sensory memory]] has been cited as a cause.<ref>Goldstein, B. (2011). ''Cognitive Psychology: Connecting Mind, Research, and Everyday Experience--with coglab manual. (3rd ed.).'' Belmont, CA: Wadsworth: 120.</ref>\n\n==Natural occurrences and applications==\nSome natural phenomena and the principles of some optical toys have been attributed to the persistence of vision effect. Patrick d'Arcy recognised the effect in \"the luminous ring that we see by turning a torch quickly, the fire wheels in the fireworks, the flattened spindle shape we see in a vibrating cord, the continuous circle we see in a cogwheel that turns with speed\".<ref name=d'Arcy1768 /> Basically everything that resembles [[motion blur]] seen in fast moving objects could be regarded as \"persistence of vision\".\n\n===Sparkler's trail effect===\nThe fact that a glowing coal appears as a line of light when it is moved around quickly has often been used to illustrate the idea of persistence of vision.<ref name=Cyclop\u00e6dia/>\nIt is known as the \"sparkler's trail effect\", named after the trail that appears when a [[sparkler]] is moved around quickly.\n\nThe effect has been applied in the arts by writing or drawing with a light source recorded by a camera with a long exposure time.\n\n===Color-top / Newton disc===\n{{Main|Newton disc}}\nColors on spinning tops or rotating wheels mix together if the motion is too fast to register the details. A colored dot then appears as a circle and one line can make the whole surface appear in one uniform hue.\n\nThe Newton disc optically mixes wedges of [[Isaac Newton]]'s primary colors into one (off-)white surface when it spins fast.\n\n===Thaumatrope===\nIn April 1825 the first ''[[Thaumatrope]]'' was published by W.

When the discs spin and the top disc is retarded into regular jerky motions the toy exhibits \"beautiful forms which are similar to those of the [[kaleidoscope]]\" with multiplied colours. Gorham described how the colours appear mixed on the spinning top \"from the duration of successive impressions on the retina\". Gorham founded the principle on \"the well-known experiment of whirling a stick, ignited at one end\" (a.k.a. the sparkler's trail effect).<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrdbAAAAcAAJ&dq|last=Gorham|first=John|title=The Rotation of Coloured Discs|date=January 1859}}</ref>\n\n===Rubber pencil trick===\nA pencil or another rigid straight line can appear as bending and becoming rubbery when it is wiggled fast enough between fingers, or otherwise undergoing rigid motion.\n\nPersistence of vision has been discarded as sole cause of the illusion.

He noted how the different colors of sectors mixed together into one color and how dots appeared as circles when the wheel was spinning very fast. When lines are drawn across the axis of the disc they make the whole surface appear to be of a uniform color. \"The visual impression that is created in the first revolution is invariably followed by repeated instances that subsequently produce an identical impression.

He added: \"It is also to be noticed that, however rapidly the wheel revolves, each individual spoke, during the moment it is viewed, appears to be at rest.\" Roget claimed that the illusion is due to the fact \"that an impression made by a pencil of rays on the retina, if sufficiently vivid, will remain for a certain time after the cause has ceased.\" He also provided mathematical details about the appearing curvatures.<ref>{{cite publication|url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/115/131.full.pdf+html|title=Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures|date=1824-12-09|last=Roget|first=Peter Mark}}</ref>\n\nAs a university student [[Joseph Plateau]] noticed in some of his early experiments that when looking from a small distance at two concentric cogwheels which turned fast in opposite directions, it produced the optical illusion of a motionless wheel.

However, a unique part of Faraday's experiments concerned turning wheels in front of a mirror and this inspired Plateau with the idea for new illusions.

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] uses the [[Latin]] form ''Esox'' in reference to a large fish in the [[Rhine]] normally identified with [[Salmonidae]] (''lax'' or salmon). [[Carolus Linn\u00e6us]] attributes Esox to the pike fish which is of similar form and appearance but taxonomically different from the salmoniformes, whereas the first mention of Esox as a marine animal appears in the writings of Hesych(ius).\n\n[[Image:Hecht.jpg|thumb|left|A young ''[[Esox lucius|E. lucius]]'' specimen\u2014a \"[[Chain pickerel]]\" in the original sense\u2014in an [[aquarium]].]]\n\nThe [[English language|English]] common name \"pike\" is an apparent shortening of \"pike-fish\", in reference to its pointed head, [[Old English language|Old English]] ''p\u00edc'' originally referring to a [[pickaxe]]. The plural of pike is pike.\n\nA northern English and [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] name for the pike, ''ged'', similarly derives from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''gaddr'' (spike) (cf. the modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]] name for the pike, ''g\u00e4dda'', the Danish \"gedde\", the Norwegian \"gjedde\" and [[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''geadais''). <!--We have links to other language wikipedias for this [[Polish language|Polish]] - szczupak, [[French language|French]] - brochet, [[German language|German]] - Hecht, [[Russian language|Russian]] - \u0429\u0443\u043a\u0430, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] - lucio, [[Italian language|Italian]] - luccio.--> The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for the pike (''snoek'') has been given to a wide variety of fish reminding sailors of the pike (see snoek, [[snook (disambiguation)|snook]]).\n\nThe English \"pike\" originally referred specifically to the adult fish, the diminutive form \"'''pickerel'''\" (now used to name some of the smaller pike, ''[[Esox americanus|E. americanus]]'' and ''[[Esox niger|E. niger]]'') referring to the young. The [[walleye]] (''Sander vitreus'') is sometimes called a pickerel, but it is unrelated to the pike, being a member of the perch family ([[Percidae]]).  Pike are not to be confused with the unrelated [[pikeminnows]] (traditionally known as [[squawfish]]) of genus ''[[Ptychocheilus]]'' (family [[Cyprinidae]]) or [[pikeperch]] (''Sander lucioperca'') which is more akin to walleye than to pike.  Pike are also called \"jackfish\" in North America and informally \"slough shark\" in Western Canada.\n\n==Diet==\n[[Image:Esox hdm.JPG|thumb|right|Pike in [[Haus des Meeres]], [[Vienna]]]]\nPike feed on a wide range of food sources, predominantly smaller [[shoal fish]]. Pike are also cannibalistic, sometimes preying upon smaller members of their own species. This can be seen clearly in the [[northern pike]].\n\nThey will also prey on [[insect]]s and [[amphibian]]s such as [[newt]]s or [[frog]]s in times when their usual food is scarce, and occasionally on small [[mammal]]s like [[Mole (animal)|moles]] or [[mouse|mice]] when caught water-borne<ref>https://forum.americanexpedition.us/northern-pike-information-facts-photos-and-fishing-tips</ref>. Small birds such as [[duck#Predators|duckling]]s may become a target for hungry pike. Pike are also known to prey on swimming [[snake]]s.\n\nThey are, however, undeserving of their reputation for being overly vicious predators. There are few substantiated incidents of pike \"attacks\" on people.  Pike's further reputation as a [[coarse fish|pest]] seems to lie predominantly amongst a small handful of anglers and fishery managers who think, perhaps unfairly, that pike are a threat to native rough fish and also other sport fish.\n\n==Angling==\n[[File:SaveDePike.jpg|thumb|280px|Sign on the [[River Shannon]], [[Ireland]]]][[File:HandlingBigPike.JPG|thumb|280px|A caught pike]]\n\nEffective methods for catching this hard-fighting fish include dead baits, live baits, and lure fishing. Pike can easily be damaged when handled since they are not as robust as their reputation would suggest. Colour of lure can be influenced by water clarity and weather conditions. Since pike have numerous sharp teeth it is wise to take extreme care when unhooking them. The use of a wet leather [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] and [[surgical forceps]] to remove hooks is highly recommended on safety grounds. If practicing catch and release fishing, care for the pike should be the pike angler's utmost concern. The formerly recommended practice of grasping a pike by its eye sockets (misinterpreted as \"its eyes\") resulted in numerous released pike that quickly died from inability to see prey any longer.\n\nThe current recommended method of grasping pike is to close the hand firmly over the [[Operculum (fish)|gill covers]], and to make the period of handling as short as possible before release. Grabbing a pike by the gill covers is not feasible when a pike is very big, but it is easy to handle a pike by inserting the fingers at the bottom of the gill opening and grabbing the lower jaw. Big pike should also be supported at the belly. When a pike is held this way it is also easier to keep the mouth open to remove a hook. Some anglers now use special grips to grab the pike's front lower jaw, which can add to the safety of an anglers because of the danger imposed by the hooks of the lure or tackle and the pike's teeth. However these can cause serious damage to a pike's lower jaw. The Pike Anglers Club was formed in 1977 to campaign for the preservation of pike and the sport of pike fishing.\n\nPike are susceptible to ''gut hooking'' when fished for with natural bait. Upon taking the bait, the pike will hold it for a short time in its mouth as it moves off. The pike will then, usually, turn the bait in its mouth, so that it sits in alignment with its throat to ease swallowing. It is recommended that when pike fishing the process is not allowed to go this far and a strike is recommended as soon as a bite is indicated. Otherwise, what is known as ''gut hooking'' will result, which will normally kill or seriously injure the fish. Dutch research shows that cutting the line immediately when the fish is gut hooked will still give low mortality (14%). The hooks in the gut or stomach were either encapsulated or removed from the body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hsvdekleuter.nl/documents/snoek-kennis.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327035307/http://www.hsvdekleuter.nl/documents/snoek-kennis.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Placing hooks near the rear of the bait reduces the risk of deep hooking.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pikeanglersclub.co.uk/coping-with-deep-hooked-pike/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913060224/http://www.pikeanglersclub.co.uk/coping-with-deep-hooked-pike/ |archive-date=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOther methods of catching and handing pike that are now frowned upon are the [[Fishing gaff|gaff]] and the gag. The gaff is a metal hook on the end of a pole used to hook through the fish's body in place of a more humane landing net. A gag is a device for holding open the pike's mouth whilst unhooking. These are now illegal in Scotland, as they put a huge amount of pressure on a pike's jaw, thus causing irreparable damage.\n\n==Cuisine==\n\nThe taste of pike and pickerel is highly esteemed, but the \"multitude of long, fine, forked bones\" are problematic.<ref name=\"root\">Waverley Root, ''Food'', 1996, p. 353</ref>\n<ref>'Piscator', \"Pike Fishing\", ''The Sportsman'' (Second Series), '''2''':3:[https://books.google.com/books?id=ISkGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA139 139] (March 1840)</ref> The dish of ''[[quenelles de brochet]]'' (pike dumplings), which puts the meat through a sieve, was invented to deal with this.<ref>Marthe Daudet, Shirley King, translator and adaptor, ''Pampille's Table: Recipes and Writings from the French Countryside from Marthe Daudet's ''Les Bons Plats de France'' [1934]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=fEDNMxPABLAC&pg=PA153 p. 153]</ref> Indeed, [[Escoffier]] believed, falsely, that ''quenelles'' had completely displaced the whole fish from the menu.<ref name=\"root\"/>\n\n== In mythology ==\n[[Image:Fossil - Hecht (Esox).jpg|thumb|Fossil ''Esox'']]\nRussian mythology holds that the pike is one of several forms assumed by evil water spirits called [[vodyanoy]], and a ravenous mythical pike is traditionally blamed for decimating the fish population in the [[Sheksna River]].

[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] uses the [[Latin]] form ''Esox'' in reference to a large fish in the [[Rhine]] normally identified with [[Salmonidae]] (''lax'' or salmon). [[Carolus Linn\u00e6us]] attributes Esox to the pike fish which is of similar form and appearance but taxonomically different from the salmoniformes, whereas the first mention of Esox as a marine animal appears in the writings of Hesych(ius).\n\n[[Image:Hecht.jpg|thumb|left|A young ''[[Esox lucius|E. lucius]]'' specimen\u2014a \"[[Chain pickerel]]\" in the original sense\u2014in an [[aquarium]].]]\n\nThe [[English language|English]] common name \"pike\" is an apparent shortening of \"pike-fish\", in reference to its pointed head, [[Old English language|Old English]] ''p\u00edc'' originally referring to a [[pickaxe]]. The plural of pike is pike.\n\nA northern English and [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] name for the pike, ''ged'', similarly derives from [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''gaddr'' (spike) (cf. the modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]] name for the pike, ''g\u00e4dda'', the Danish \"gedde\", the Norwegian \"gjedde\" and [[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''geadais''). <!--We have links to other language wikipedias for this [[Polish language|Polish]] - szczupak, [[French language|French]] - brochet, [[German language|German]] - Hecht, [[Russian language|Russian]] - \u0429\u0443\u043a\u0430, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] - lucio, [[Italian language|Italian]] - luccio.--> The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name for the pike (''snoek'') has been given to a wide variety of fish reminding sailors of the pike (see snoek, [[snook (disambiguation)|snook]]).\n\nThe English \"pike\" originally referred specifically to the adult fish, the diminutive form \"'''pickerel'''\" (now used to name some of the smaller pike, ''[[Esox americanus|E. americanus]]'' and ''[[Esox niger|E. niger]]'') referring to the young. The [[walleye]] (''Sander vitreus'') is sometimes called a pickerel, but it is unrelated to the pike, being a member of the perch family ([[Percidae]]).  Pike are not to be confused with the unrelated [[pikeminnows]] (traditionally known as [[squawfish]]) of genus ''[[Ptychocheilus]]'' (family [[Cyprinidae]]) or [[pikeperch]] (''Sander lucioperca'') which is more akin to walleye than to pike.  Pike are also called \"jackfish\" in North America and informally \"slough shark\" in Western Canada.\n\n==Diet==\n[[Image:Esox hdm.JPG|thumb|right|Pike in [[Haus des Meeres]], [[Vienna]]]]\nPike feed on a wide range of food sources, predominantly smaller [[shoal fish]]. Pike are also cannibalistic, sometimes preying upon smaller members of their own species. This can be seen clearly in the [[northern pike]].\n\nThey will also prey on [[insect]]s and [[amphibian]]s such as [[newt]]s or [[frog]]s in times when their usual food is scarce, and occasionally on small [[mammal]]s like [[Mole (animal)|moles]] or [[mouse|mice]] when caught water-borne. Small birds such as [[duck#Predators|duckling]]s may become a target for hungry pike. Pike are also known to prey on swimming [[snake]]s.\n\nThey are, however, undeserving of their reputation for being overly vicious predators. There are few substantiated incidents of pike \"attacks\" on people.  Pike's further reputation as a [[coarse fish|pest]] seems to lie predominantly amongst a small handful of anglers and fishery managers who think, perhaps unfairly, that pike are a threat to native rough fish and also other sport fish.\n\n==Angling==\n[[File:SaveDePike.jpg|thumb|280px|Sign on the [[River Shannon]], [[Ireland]]]][[File:HandlingBigPike.JPG|thumb|280px|A caught pike]]\n\nEffective methods for catching this hard-fighting fish include dead baits, live baits, and lure fishing. Pike can easily be damaged when handled since they are not as robust as their reputation would suggest. Colour of lure can be influenced by water clarity and weather conditions. Since pike have numerous sharp teeth it is wise to take extreme care when unhooking them. The use of a wet leather [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlet]] and [[surgical forceps]] to remove hooks is highly recommended on safety grounds. If practicing catch and release fishing, care for the pike should be the pike angler's utmost concern. The formerly recommended practice of grasping a pike by its eye sockets (misinterpreted as \"its eyes\") resulted in numerous released pike that quickly died from inability to see prey any longer.\n\nThe current recommended method of grasping pike is to close the hand firmly over the [[Operculum (fish)|gill covers]], and to make the period of handling as short as possible before release. Grabbing a pike by the gill covers is not feasible when a pike is very big, but it is easy to handle a pike by inserting the fingers at the bottom of the gill opening and grabbing the lower jaw. Big pike should also be supported at the belly. When a pike is held this way it is also easier to keep the mouth open to remove a hook. Some anglers now use special grips to grab the pike's front lower jaw, which can add to the safety of an anglers because of the danger imposed by the hooks of the lure or tackle and the pike's teeth. However these can cause serious damage to a pike's lower jaw. The Pike Anglers Club was formed in 1977 to campaign for the preservation of pike and the sport of pike fishing.\n\nPike are susceptible to ''gut hooking'' when fished for with natural bait. Upon taking the bait, the pike will hold it for a short time in its mouth as it moves off. The pike will then, usually, turn the bait in its mouth, so that it sits in alignment with its throat to ease swallowing. It is recommended that when pike fishing the process is not allowed to go this far and a strike is recommended as soon as a bite is indicated. Otherwise, what is known as ''gut hooking'' will result, which will normally kill or seriously injure the fish. Dutch research shows that cutting the line immediately when the fish is gut hooked will still give low mortality (14%). The hooks in the gut or stomach were either encapsulated or removed from the body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hsvdekleuter.nl/documents/snoek-kennis.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327035307/http://www.hsvdekleuter.nl/documents/snoek-kennis.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Placing hooks near the rear of the bait reduces the risk of deep hooking.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pikeanglersclub.co.uk/coping-with-deep-hooked-pike/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913060224/http://www.pikeanglersclub.co.uk/coping-with-deep-hooked-pike/ |archive-date=13 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOther methods of catching and handing pike that are now frowned upon are the [[Fishing gaff|gaff]] and the gag. The gaff is a metal hook on the end of a pole used to hook through the fish's body in place of a more humane landing net. A gag is a device for holding open the pike's mouth whilst unhooking. These are now illegal in Scotland, as they put a huge amount of pressure on a pike's jaw, thus causing irreparable damage.\n\n==Cuisine==\n\nThe taste of pike and pickerel is highly esteemed, but the \"multitude of long, fine, forked bones\" are problematic.<ref name=\"root\">Waverley Root, ''Food'', 1996, p. 353</ref>\n<ref>'Piscator', \"Pike Fishing\", ''The Sportsman'' (Second Series), '''2''':3:[https://books.google.com/books?id=ISkGAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA139 139] (March 1840)</ref> The dish of ''[[quenelles de brochet]]'' (pike dumplings), which puts the meat through a sieve, was invented to deal with this.<ref>Marthe Daudet, Shirley King, translator and adaptor, ''Pampille's Table: Recipes and Writings from the French Countryside from Marthe Daudet's ''Les Bons Plats de France'' [1934]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=fEDNMxPABLAC&pg=PA153 p. 153]</ref> Indeed, [[Escoffier]] believed, falsely, that ''quenelles'' had completely displaced the whole fish from the menu.<ref name=\"root\"/>\n\n== In mythology ==\n[[Image:Fossil - Hecht (Esox).jpg|thumb|Fossil ''Esox'']]\nRussian mythology holds that the pike is one of several forms assumed by evil water spirits called [[vodyanoy]], and a ravenous mythical pike is traditionally blamed for decimating the fish population in the [[Sheksna River]]. Russian fairy tales, on the other hand, also tell about an old wise pike that can fulfil wishes of the one who catches it, if its catcher releases it back into its habitat.<ref>\"Emelya the Simpleton\", russian folklore fairy tale. [[At the Pike%27s Behest]]</ref>\n\nIn the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'', [[V\u00e4in\u00e4m\u00f6inen]] creates a [[kantele]] (string instrument) from the jawbone of a pike.\n\n==Submarines and tanks==\nTwo [[United States Navy]] [[submarine]]s have been named ''Pike'' \u2013 [[USS Pike (SS-6)|SS-6]] of 1903 and [[USS Pike (SS-173)|SS-173]] of 1935 \u2013 and three \u2013 [[USS F-3 (SS-22)|SS-22]] of 1912, [[USS Pickerel (SS-177)|SS-177]] of 1936, and [[USS Pickerel (SS-524)|SS-524]] of 1944 \u2013 named ''Pickerel''. In addition, the [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]] submarines known to [[NATO]] as the [[Victor-class submarine|Victor III class]] and [[Akula-class submarine|Akula class]] are called the ''Shchuka'' (\u0429\u0443\u043a\u0430, \"pike\") class in [[Russian language|Russian]]. The Soviet [[IS tank family|Iosif Stalin tank (IS-3)]] was also nicknamed ''Shchuka'', in reference to its sharply pointed hull front.\n\n==Heraldry==\nIn [[heraldry]], the pike is called a '''lucy''' (English heraldry) or a [[ged (heraldry)|ged]] (Scottish heraldry).<ref name=\"Fox-Davies\">{{Cite book |last=Fox-Davies |first=Arthur Charles |year=1909 |url=https://openlibrary.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxdrich |title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry |publisher=London: T.C. & E.C.
