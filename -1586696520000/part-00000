Naarden hosts the bi-annual Naarden Photo Festival and, on [[Good Friday]], a performance of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s [[St. Matthew Passion (Bach)|St. Matthew Passion]] in the local church, which is called the Great Church or St. Vitus Church.\n\n[[File:The Great Church, Naarden.JPG|thumb|The Great Church]]\n\nThe Great Church (''Grote Kerk'') is situated on the Markstraat and dates from the 15th century. Prior to the [[Protestant Reformation]] it was named for [[Vitus|St. Vitus]]. It is one of the oldest surviving churches in The Netherlands, having had the good fortune to survive the Spanish invasion of 1572 and the subsequent burning of the town. The church has numerous wooden vaults that are painted with scenes from the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s. These were hidden for many years and were only rediscovered in a recent restoration. The church is the venue for a number of cultural activities such as organ music nights and the bi-annual Naarden Photo festival.\n\n[[File:The Spanish House, Naarden.JPG|thumb|right|The Spanish House, with design commemorating the massacre of 1572]]\n\nThe Spanish House (''Spaanse Huis''), situated at Turfpoortstraat 27, was originally a church building converted to house migrants. In 1572 Spanish troops [[Massacre of Naarden|conducted a massacre]] of some 700 inhabitants who had gathered to hear a peace proposal. The Spanish then fired on the assembled citizens, and went on to set fire to the town. A plaque above the lintel of the door and below the eaves commemorates the massacre.  In 1615, after the population had reestablished itself, they built the city hall on the site. Part of the building was given over to De Waag (The Scales House), the municipal office entrusted with the verification of weights and measures. The building later served a French garrison as a bakery, turning out over 1000 loaves per day. From 1967 until 1992 it served as the Comenius museum. Today, the historic building serves as the Weegschaal Museum.\n\nNaarden is also the place where John Amos Comenius is buried in a mausoleum on Klooster straat. \nThis place receives many visitors from Czechia, where he was born.

Lower courts had blocked enforcement of the law for violating a woman's right to abortion under privacy concerns within the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], as previously found in the landmark cases ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]''. The lower courts also blocked enforcement of another portion of the law that required the disposal of aborted fetuses through burial or cremation. The ''[[per curiam]]'' decision by the Supreme Court overturned the injunction on the fetal disposal portion of the law, but otherwise did not challenge or confirm the lower courts' ruling on the non-discrimination clauses, leaving these in place.\n\nThe case gained national interest as the first major abortion-related case to be heard by the Supreme Court since the retirement of Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] (who tended to favor abortion rights) with his replacement Justice [[Brett Kavanaugh]] (who has appeared to rule against such rights in his previous limited judicial history). Court observers expressed concern that in opposing comments raised between Justices [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] could result in later abortion-related challenges reaching the Supreme Court and potentially overturn parts of ''Roe v. Wade''.\n\n==Background==\nSince around 2010, several states with Republican leadership and conservative populations started to pass laws restricting abortion rights to some degree. In more recent years, with the onset of the presidency of [[Donald Trump]] and his nominations of Justices [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] to the Supreme Court to replace [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Anthony Kennedy]], these laws have appeared designed to create a necessary legal vehicle to be heard by the Supreme Court as to challenge the long-standing provision of the 1973 landmark case ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. That case decided that women have constitutional rights to an abortion, but this is not an absolute right, and states can enact abortion-restricting laws to protect women and their unborn children during the latter trimesters of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/abortion-alabama-ban.html | title = As States Race to Limit Abortions, Alabama Goes Further, Seeking to Outlaw Most of Them | first1 = Timothy | last1 = Williams | first2 = Alan | last2=  Blinder | date = May 8, 2019 | accessdate = May 29, 2019 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref> One type of law passed placed limits on the locations of abortion clinics, requiring them to be near hospitals and requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at that hospital, purportedly to ensure that if something goes wrong during the abortion process, the female patient can receive immediate care. This type of restriction was determined to be unconstitutional in the Supreme Court case ''[[Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt]]'' that struck down a Texas law with these limits.\n\nIn the present case, the Republican-controlled legislation of Indiana passed House Bill 1337, a \"Sex Selective and Disability Abortion Ban\", and which was signed into law by [[Mike Pence]] in March 2016. Among other requirements, the bill added three key clauses related to those seeking abortions and their practice. The non-discrimination clause banned abortions which were being performed for reasons solely related to gender, race, ethnicity, or detectable disabilities, such as [[Down syndrome]], and put liabilities on doctors that proceeded to perform such abortions. The informed consent clause required that women undergoing abortions be notified at least 18 hours before their operation regarding the non-discrimination clause and the legal ramifications. Finally, the fetal disposition clause required that abortion clinics bury or incinerate fetal material if the female patient did not take control of it, treating the fetal remains the same as a deceased person. On passage, the law was met with sharp criticism from pro-abortion groups, including [[Planned Parenthood]] since the law strictly limited abortion rights.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/25/us/indiana-governor-mike-pence-signs-abortion-bill.html | title = Indiana Governor Signs Abortion Bill With Added Restrictions | first= Mitch | last = Smith | date = March 24, 2016 | accessdate = May 29, 2019 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\nWithin weeks of passage, Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.

As a result, two groups of [[Tribosphenida|tribosphenic mammals]] evolved separately on the newly formed landmasses: the [[Boreosphenida]] (marsupials and placentals) in Laurasia and the [[Australosphenida]] (monotremes and extinct relatives) in Gondwana.  The fossil record, however, suggests the intermittent presence of a Trans-Tethys land bridge, though the location and duration of such a land bridge remains enigmatic.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gheerbrant|Rage|2006|loc=Introduction, p. 225}}</ref>\n\n[[Pinaceae|Pine trees]] evolved in the early Mesozoic c. 250&nbsp;Mya and the [[List of Pinus species|pine genus]] originated in Laurasia in the Early Cretaceous c. 130&nbsp;Mya in competition with faster growing [[angiosperm|flowering plants]].  Pines adapted to cold and arid climates in environments were the growing season was shorter or wildfire common; this evolution limited pine range to between 31\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 north and resulted in a split into two subgenera: ''Strobus'' adapted to stressful environments and ''Pinus'' to fire-prone landscapes.  By the end of the Cretaceous pines were established across Laurasia, from North America to East Asia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeley|2012|loc=Introduction, pp. 445\u2013446; Mesozoic origin and diversification, pp. 450\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nFrom the Triassic to the Early Jurassic, before the break-up of Pangaea, [[archosaur]]s (crocodiles and dinosaurs including birds) had a global distribution.  This cosmopolitanism ended as Gondwana fragmented and Laurasia was assembled.  [[Pterosaur]] diversity reach a maximum in the Late Jurassic\u2014Early Cretaceous and plate tectonic didn't affect the distribution of these flying reptiles.  Crocodiles also diversified during the Early Cretaceous but were divided into Laurasian and Gondwanan populations; modern crocodiles evolved from the former.  The distribution of the three major groups of [[dinosaur]]s&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Theropoda|theropods]], [[Sauropoda|sauropods]], and [[Ornithischia|ornithischians]]&nbsp;\u2013 was similar that of the crocodiles.  East Asia remained isolated with endemic species including [[Psittacosaurus|psittacosaurs]] (horned dinosaurs) and [[Ankylosauridae]] (club-tailed, armoured dinosaurs).<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=319}}</ref>\n\nIn the early Eocene a peak in global warming led to a pan-Arctic fauna with alligators and amphibians present north of the Arctic Circle.  In the early Palaeogene, landbridges still connected continents, allowing land animals to migrate between them.  On the other hand, submerged areas occasionally divided continents: the [[Turgai Sea]] separated Europe and Asia from the Middle Jurassic to the Oligocene and as this sea or strait dried out, a massive faunal interchange took place and the resulting extinction event in Europe is known as the ''[[Grande Coupure]]''.<ref> {{Harvnb|Milner|Milner|Evans|2000|p=328}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Coraciiformes]] (an order of birds including kingfishers) evolved in Laurasia. While this group now has a mostly tropical distribution, they originated in the Arctic in the late Eocene c. 35&nbsp;Mya from where they diversified across Laurasia and farther south across the Equator.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCullough|Moyle|Smith|Andersen|2019|loc=Conclusion, p. 7}}</ref>\n\n===Final split===\n{{Multiple image | total_width = 600 | align = right | perrow = 3\n | image1 = Opening of North Atlantic 090Ma.jpg\n | image2 = Opening of North Atlantic 050Ma.jpg\n | image3 = Opening of North Atlantic 030Ma.jpg\n | footer = Opening of the North Atlantic Ocean 90, 50, and 30 Mya.\n}}\nIn the Triassic\u2013Early Jurassic (c. 200&nbsp;Mya), the opening of the Central [[Atlantic Ocean]] was preceded by the formation of a series of large rift basins, such as the [[Newark Basin]], between eastern North America, from what is today the Gulf of Mexico to Nova Scotia, and in Africa and Europe, from Morocco to Greenland.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olsen|1997|loc=Introduction, p. 338}}</ref>\n\nBy {{circa|83&nbsp;Mya}} spreading had begun in the North Atlantic between the [[Rockall Plateau]], a continental fragment sitting on top of the Eurasian Plate, and North America.

It is a fairly recent development compared to other styles of bock beers, frequently associated with springtime and the month of May. Colour can range from deep gold to light amber with a large, creamy, persistent white head, and moderate to moderately high carbonation, while alcohol content ranges from 6.3% to 7.4% by volume. The flavour is typically less malty than a traditional bock, and may be drier, hoppier, and more bitter, but still with a relatively low hop flavour, with a mild spicy or peppery quality from the hops, increased carbonation and alcohol content. The following commercial products are indicative of the style: [[Ayinger]] Maibock, Mahr's Bock, [[Hacker-Pschorr]] Hubertus Bock, Capital Maibock, Einbecker Mai-Urbock, [[Staatliches Hofbr\u00e4uhaus in M\u00fcnchen|Hofbr\u00e4u]] Maibock, [[Victory Brewing Company|Victory]] St. Boisterous, [[Gordon Biersch]] Blonde Bock, [[Smuttynose Brewing Company|Smuttynose]] Maibock, [[Old Dominion Brewing Company]] Big Thaw Bock, [Brewery 85's Quittin' Time], [[Rogue Ales|Rogue]] Dead Guy [[Ale]], [[Franconia Brewing Company]] Maibock [[Ale]], Church Street maibock, and [[Tr\u00f6egs Brewing Company|Tr\u00f6egs]] Cultivator.\n\n===Doppelbock===\n''Doppelbock'' or ''double bock'' is a stronger version of traditional bock that was first brewed in Munich by the Paulaner Friars, a Franciscan order founded by [[Francis of Paola|St. Francis of Paula]].<ref name=GBI /> Historically, doppelbock was high in alcohol and sweet, thus serving as \"liquid bread\" for the Friars during times of fasting, when solid food was not permitted. Today, doppelbock is still strong\u2014ranging from 7%\u201312% or more by volume. It isn't clear, with colour ranging from dark gold, for the paler version, to dark brown with ruby highlights for darker version. It has a large, creamy, persistent head (although head retention may be impaired by alcohol in the stronger versions). The aroma is intensely malty, with some toasty notes, and possibly some alcohol presence as well; darker versions may have a chocolate-like or fruity aroma. The flavour is very rich and malty, with toasty notes and noticeable alcoholic strength, and little or no detectable hops (16\u201326 IBUs). Paler versions may have a drier finish. The monks who originally brewed doppelbock named their beer \"Salvator\" (literally \"Savior\", but actually a malapropism for \"Sankt Vater\", \"St. Father\", originally brewed for the feast of St. Francis of Paola on 2 April which often falls into Lent), which today is trademarked by [[Paulaner]].<ref name=GBI /> Brewers of modern doppelbocks often add \"[[wikt:-ator|-ator]]\" to their beer's name as a signpost of the style; there are 200 \"-ator\" doppelbock names registered with the German patent office.<ref name=GBI /> The following are representative examples of the style: [[Paulaner]] Salvator, [[Ayinger]] Celebrator, [[Weihenstephaner]] Korbinian, [[Andechser]] Doppelbock Dunkel, [[Spaten]] Optimator, [[Augustiner]] Maximator, Tucher Bajuvator, Weltenburger Kloster Asam-Bock, [[Capital Brewery|Capital]] Autumnal Fire, EKU 28, [[Eggenberg Castle, Vorchdorf|Eggenberg]] Urbock 23\u00ba, [[Bell's brewery|Bell's]] Consecrator, [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]] La Rossa, [[Samuel Adams]] Double Bock, [[Tr\u00f6egs Brewing Company|Tr\u00f6egs]] Tr\u00f6egenator Double Bock, Wasatch Brewery Devastator, [[Great Lakes Brewing Company|Great Lakes]] Doppelrock, [[Abita Brewing Company|Abita]] Andygator, Wolverine State Brewing Company Predator, Burly Brewing's Burlynator, and Christian Moerlein Emancipator Doppelbock.\n\n===Eisbock===\n[[File:Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock.jpg|thumb|right|Eisbock beer, made by removing ice from partially frozen barrels of beer, resulting in higher alcohol content.]]\nEisbock is a traditional specialty beer of the [[Kulmbach (district)|Kulmbach district]] of Germany that is made by [[freeze distillation|partially freezing]] a doppelbock and removing the water ice to concentrate the flavour and alcohol content, which ranges from 9% to 13% by volume.  It is clear, with a colour ranging from deep copper to dark brown in colour, often with ruby highlights. Although it can pour with a thin off-white head, head retention is frequently impaired by the higher alcohol content. The aroma is intense, with no hop presence, but frequently can contain fruity notes, especially of prunes, raisins, and plums. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with significant alcohol, although this should not be hot or sharp. The flavour is rich and sweet, often with toasty notes, and sometimes hints of chocolate, always balanced by a significant alcohol presence. The following are representative examples of the style: Colorado Team Brew \"Warning Sign\", Kulmbacher Reichelbr\u00e4u Eisbock, [[Schloss Eggenberg|Eggenberg]], [[G.

The flavour is very rich and malty, with toasty notes and noticeable alcoholic strength, and little or no detectable hops (16\u201326 IBUs). Paler versions may have a drier finish. The monks who originally brewed doppelbock named their beer \"Salvator\" (literally \"Savior\", but actually a malapropism for \"Sankt Vater\", \"St. Father\", originally brewed for the feast of St. Francis of Paola on 2 April which often falls into Lent), which today is trademarked by [[Paulaner]].<ref name=GBI /> Brewers of modern doppelbocks often add \"[[wikt:-ator|-ator]]\" to their beer's name as a signpost of the style; there are 200 \"-ator\" doppelbock names registered with the German patent office.<ref name=GBI /> The following are representative examples of the style: [[Paulaner]] Salvator, [[Ayinger]] Celebrator, [[Weihenstephaner]] Korbinian, [[Andechser]] Doppelbock Dunkel, [[Spaten]] Optimator, [[Augustiner]] Maximator, Tucher Bajuvator, Weltenburger Kloster Asam-Bock, [[Capital Brewery|Capital]] Autumnal Fire, EKU 28, [[Eggenberg Castle, Vorchdorf|Eggenberg]] Urbock 23\u00ba, [[Bell's brewery|Bell's]] Consecrator, [[Birra Moretti|Moretti]] La Rossa, [[Samuel Adams]] Double Bock, [[Tr\u00f6egs Brewing Company|Tr\u00f6egs]] Tr\u00f6egenator Double Bock, Wasatch Brewery Devastator, [[Great Lakes Brewing Company|Great Lakes]] Doppelrock, [[Abita Brewing Company|Abita]] Andygator, Wolverine State Brewing Company Predator, Burly Brewing's Burlynator, and Christian Moerlein Emancipator Doppelbock.\n\n===Eisbock===\n[[File:Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock.jpg|thumb|right|Eisbock beer, made by removing ice from partially frozen barrels of beer, resulting in higher alcohol content.]]\nEisbock is a traditional specialty beer of the [[Kulmbach (district)|Kulmbach district]] of Germany that is made by [[freeze distillation|partially freezing]] a doppelbock and removing the water ice to concentrate the flavour and alcohol content, which ranges from 9% to 13% by volume.  It is clear, with a colour ranging from deep copper to dark brown in colour, often with ruby highlights. Although it can pour with a thin off-white head, head retention is frequently impaired by the higher alcohol content. The aroma is intense, with no hop presence, but frequently can contain fruity notes, especially of prunes, raisins, and plums. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with significant alcohol, although this should not be hot or sharp. The flavour is rich and sweet, often with toasty notes, and sometimes hints of chocolate, always balanced by a significant alcohol presence. The following are representative examples of the style: Colorado Team Brew \"Warning Sign\", Kulmbacher Reichelbr\u00e4u Eisbock, [[Schloss Eggenberg|Eggenberg]], [[G. Schneider & Sohn|Schneider]] [[Aventinus (beer)|Aventinus]] Eisbock, Urbock Dunkel Eisbock, [[Franconia Brewing Company]] Ice Bock 17%.\n\nThe strongest ice-beer, Schorschbr\u00e4u, is produced by a Franconian company; it has 57% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] (alcohol by volume), which claims to be a world record for beer ABV.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.schorschbraeu.de/portfolio-item/schorschbraeu-57-033/|title=Schorschbr\u00e4u 57% 0,33|language=German|website=Schorschbraeu|date=  |author= |accessdate= 23 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Weizenbock===\nWeizenbock is a style of bock brewed using wheat instead of barley. It was first produced in [[Bavaria]] in 1907 by [[G. Schneider & Sohn]] and was named ''[[Aventinus (beer)|Aventinus]]'' after a Bavarian historian.

''Miseinen Dakedo Kodomo Janai'' was [[serial (literature)|serialized]] in the bimonthly [[List of manga magazines|manga magazine]] ''[[Sho-Comi]]'' from December 5, 2012 to February 5, 2016. A live-action film adaptation of the same name was released on December 23, 2017 with the international title ''Teen Bride''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nKarin Oriyama is a first-year high school student who has spent her entire life living in luxury and being spoiled by her father. She sets her sights on Nao Tsurugi, a popular third-year student at her school, and believes him to be the perfect candidate for her boyfriend. On her 16th birthday, Karin's father suddenly announces that she will be wed to Nao, who she had been secretly betrothed to since birth. Overjoyed with the news, Karin and Nao marry and move into a run-down apartment building to spend their newlywed life. To Karin's surprise, however, Nao confesses that he agreed to the marriage for financial independence, and he wants nothing to do with her. He proposes several rules for their co-habitance: they must not mention they are married at school; they must cook and clean after themselves; they must not enter each other's rooms; and they are allowed to date other people. Karin is crushed by the reality of her marriage, but she must overcome her ego and become more self-sufficient to earn Nao's respect.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Karin Oriyama|\u6298\u5c71 \u9999\u7433|Oriyama Karin}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]] (movie comic)<ref name=\"natalie 2017-09-04\"/>}}; portrayed by: [[Yuna Taira]] (film)<ref name=\"natalie 2017-06-15\"/>\n:Karin is a 16-year-old daughter from a [[nouveau riche]] family.

''Miseinen Dakedo Kodomo Janai'' was [[serial (literature)|serialized]] in the bimonthly [[List of manga magazines|manga magazine]] ''[[Sho-Comi]]'' from December 5, 2012 to February 5, 2016. A live-action film adaptation of the same name was released on December 23, 2017 with the international title ''Teen Bride''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nKarin Oriyama is a first-year high school student who has spent her entire life living in luxury and being spoiled by her father. She sets her sights on Nao Tsurugi, a popular third-year student at her school, and believes him to be the perfect candidate for her boyfriend. On her 16th birthday, Karin's father suddenly announces that she will be wed to Nao, who she had been secretly betrothed to since birth. Overjoyed with the news, Karin and Nao marry and move into a run-down apartment building to spend their newlywed life. To Karin's surprise, however, Nao confesses that he agreed to the marriage for financial independence, and he wants nothing to do with her. He proposes several rules for their co-habitance: they must not mention they are married at school; they must cook and clean after themselves; they must not enter each other's rooms; and they are allowed to date other people. Karin is crushed by the reality of her marriage, but she must overcome her ego and become more self-sufficient to earn Nao's respect.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Karin Oriyama|\u6298\u5c71 \u9999\u7433|Oriyama Karin}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]] (movie comic)<ref name=\"natalie 2017-09-04\"/>}}; portrayed by: [[Yuna Taira]] (film)<ref name=\"natalie 2017-06-15\"/>\n:Karin is a 16-year-old daughter from a [[nouveau riche]] family.

He agrees to get married to Karin only out of financial gain and independence from his parents. After his parents' company became bankrupt, their fights have caused Nao to get occasional panic attacks and avoid getting into romantic relationships. Nao initially wants nothing to do with Karin, but he slowly becomes fond of her the more time they spend together.\n;{{nihongo|Isuzu Ebina|\u6d77\u8001\u540d \u4e94\u5341\u9234|Ebina Isuzu}}\n:{{voiced by|K\u014ddai Sakai (movie comic)<ref name=\"natalie 2017-09-04\"/>}}; portrayed by: [[Yuri Chinen]] (film)<ref name=\"natalie 2017-06-15\"/>\n:Isuzu is Karin's childhood friend, who she nicknames \"Rin Rin.\" He is popular at school for his androgynous looks, but because Karin had always defended him from unwanted attention, he is in love with her.
