The film is jointly produced by [[Suresh Oberoi]], [[Sandip Ssingh]], Anand Pandit, [[Acharya Manish]] under the banner of Legend Studios. The film's plot is loosely based on the life of [[Narendra Modi]], the 14th [[Prime Minister of India]]. The film stars [[Vivek Oberoi]] as [[Narendra Modi]], [[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] as [[Amit Shah]], [[Boman Irani]] as [[Ratan Tata]], [[Barkha Sengupta]] as [[Jashodaben]], [[Aanjjan Srivastav]] as [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee|Atal Bihari Vajpaye]], and [[Zarina Wahab]] as [[Hiraben Modi]].\n\nPrincipal photography for the film began in January 2019. The soundtrack was composed by [[Hitesh Modak]] and Shashi-Khushi. The credits in the movie for lyrics was given to [[Javed Akhtar]], [[Sameer (lyricist)|Sameer]], Abhendra Upadhyay, [[Irshad Kamil]], Parry G. and Lavraj, and released under the banner [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]]. Javed Akhtar later confirmed that he has not written any songs in the film and is shocked to see his name.in the credits. The film was theatrically released in India on 24 May 2019. It received generally negative reviews from critics, who termed it a [[hagiography]] and panned Oberoi's performance. It has grossed over {{INR|link=yes}}23 [[crore]] worldwide.\n== Plot ==\nNarendra Modi begins his career as a poor tea seller(Chaiwala 1 repee). He leaves his home at a young age, denying his marriage with [[Jashodaben]], to become a [[Sannyasa|Sanyasi]] in the [[Himalayas]]. After his journey, he returns to [[Gujarat]], becomes a [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] member and gets assigned to the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] in 1980, after fighting back the [[The Emergency (India)|State of Emergency]] imposed by [[Indira Gandhi]] in 1975. He also leads the Ekta Yatra to unite all Indians. He heads along the [[Indian Army]] and some other members, fighting against the terrorists to the [[Lal Chowk]] and plants the national [[flag of India]].\n\nHe struggles and ground works in many areas of Gujarat to help people and gain support. Due to the teamwork of the people and the BJP members, the Party wins the Gujarat CM elections and [[Keshubhai Patel]] becomes the [[Chief Minister of Gujarat]]. Soon, he feels insecure seeing Modi's rise to fame and popularity. He forces the BJP founders- [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], [[L. K. Advani]] and [[Murli Manohar Joshi]] to transfer Modi to some other place. In grief, Modi submits his resignation which is eventually declined as he had done a lot of work for the party. He was transferred to New Delhi for groundwork. He returned to Gujarat from Delhi in 2001, just a month before the events of the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake]]. He replaced Keshubhai Patel from his position and was also chosen as the CM Candidate for the upcoming election, and he became the Chief Minister.\n\nJust after being elected, he faced the [[2002 Gujarat riots]]. He sought help from other State Governments and from the Government of India, but in vain. Due to his planning and strict law enforcement, he was successful to end the violence. Just after the riots ended, an [[Akshardham Temple attack|attack]] on the [[Akshardham (Gandhinagar)|Akshardham Temple]] by the terrorists again brought tensions among the communities.&nbsp;Finally, the tensions got solved, peace was brought amongst people, the work of reconstruction and further developments were begun. Under his tenure, Gujarat became the best State of India, and 3rd best state of world. Streets were planned, roads were constructed, employment opportunities were brought, many Indian as well as International Companies began to invest in Gujarat, corruption was eliminated, security was tightened etc. By seeing his work, the BJP heads asked him to be the PM Candidate for the [[2014 Indian general election]]. He campaigned all over India. His popularity resulted in him being prominently targeted by terrorists. He also survives an [[2013 Patna bombings|attempt]] made by the terrorists to assassinate him.\n\nThe film ends with Modi taking his oath as the 14th [[Prime Minister of India]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Vivek Oberoi]] as [[Narendra Modi]]\n*[[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] as [[Amit Shah]]<ref name=indiatimes67422379>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/vivek-oberois-first-look-as-pm-modi-revealed-cm-fadnavis-says-film-will-create-history/articleshow/67422379.cms|title=Vivek Oberoi's first look as PM Modi revealed; CM Fadnavis says film will create history|date=7 January 2019|work=The Economic Times|access-date=7 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107233435/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/vivek-oberois-first-look-as-pm-modi-revealed-cm-fadnavis-says-film-will-create-history/articleshow/67422379.cms|archive-date=7 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=news181994449>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/movies/pm-narendra-modi-poster-vivek-oberoi-is-unrecognisable-in-this-biopic-1994449.html|title=PM Narendra Modi Poster: Vivek Oberoi is Unrecognisable in This Biopic|website=News18|access-date=7 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107233029/https://www.news18.com/news/movies/pm-narendra-modi-poster-vivek-oberoi-is-unrecognisable-in-this-biopic-1994449.html|archive-date=7 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=timesnownews339599>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/people/article/after-the-accidental-prime-minister-a-film-on-pm-narendra-modi-to-go-on-floors-with-vivek-oberoi-in-the-lead/339599|title=After The Accidental Prime Minister, a film on PM Narendra Modi to go on floors with Vivek Oberoi in the lead?

The credits in the movie for lyrics was given to [[Javed Akhtar]], [[Sameer (lyricist)|Sameer]], Abhendra Upadhyay, [[Irshad Kamil]], Parry G. and Lavraj, and released under the banner [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]]. Javed Akhtar later confirmed that he has not written any songs in the film and is shocked to see his name.in the credits. The film was theatrically released in India on 24 May 2019. It received generally negative reviews from critics, who termed it a [[hagiography]] and panned Oberoi's performance. It has grossed over {{INR|link=yes}}23 [[crore]] worldwide.\n== Plot ==\nNarendra Modi begins his career as a poor tea seller(Chaiwala 1 repee). He leaves his home at a young age, denying his marriage with [[Jashodaben]], to become a [[Sannyasa|Sanyasi]] in the [[Himalayas]]. After his journey, he returns to [[Gujarat]], becomes a [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] member and gets assigned to the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] in 1980, after fighting back the [[The Emergency (India)|State of Emergency]] imposed by [[Indira Gandhi]] in 1975. He also leads the Ekta Yatra to unite all Indians. He heads along the [[Indian Army]] and some other members, fighting against the terrorists to the [[Lal Chowk]] and plants the national [[flag of India]].\n\nHe struggles and ground works in many areas of Gujarat to help people and gain support. Due to the teamwork of the people and the BJP members, the Party wins the Gujarat CM elections and [[Keshubhai Patel]] becomes the [[Chief Minister of Gujarat]]. Soon, he feels insecure seeing Modi's rise to fame and popularity. He forces the BJP founders- [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], [[L. K. Advani]] and [[Murli Manohar Joshi]] to transfer Modi to some other place. In grief, Modi submits his resignation which is eventually declined as he had done a lot of work for the party. He was transferred to New Delhi for groundwork. He returned to Gujarat from Delhi in 2001, just a month before the events of the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake]]. He replaced Keshubhai Patel from his position and was also chosen as the CM Candidate for the upcoming election, and he became the Chief Minister.\n\nJust after being elected, he faced the [[2002 Gujarat riots]]. He sought help from other State Governments and from the Government of India, but in vain. Due to his planning and strict law enforcement, he was successful to end the violence. Just after the riots ended, an [[Akshardham Temple attack|attack]] on the [[Akshardham (Gandhinagar)|Akshardham Temple]] by the terrorists again brought tensions among the communities.&nbsp;Finally, the tensions got solved, peace was brought amongst people, the work of reconstruction and further developments were begun. Under his tenure, Gujarat became the best State of India, and 3rd best state of world. Streets were planned, roads were constructed, employment opportunities were brought, many Indian as well as International Companies began to invest in Gujarat, corruption was eliminated, security was tightened etc. By seeing his work, the BJP heads asked him to be the PM Candidate for the [[2014 Indian general election]]. He campaigned all over India. His popularity resulted in him being prominently targeted by terrorists. He also survives an [[2013 Patna bombings|attempt]] made by the terrorists to assassinate him.\n\nThe film ends with Modi taking his oath as the 14th [[Prime Minister of India]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Vivek Oberoi]] as [[Narendra Modi]]\n*[[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]] as [[Amit Shah]]<ref name=indiatimes67422379>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/vivek-oberois-first-look-as-pm-modi-revealed-cm-fadnavis-says-film-will-create-history/articleshow/67422379.cms|title=Vivek Oberoi's first look as PM Modi revealed; CM Fadnavis says film will create history|date=7 January 2019|work=The Economic Times|access-date=7 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107233435/https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/vivek-oberois-first-look-as-pm-modi-revealed-cm-fadnavis-says-film-will-create-history/articleshow/67422379.cms|archive-date=7 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=news181994449>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/movies/pm-narendra-modi-poster-vivek-oberoi-is-unrecognisable-in-this-biopic-1994449.html|title=PM Narendra Modi Poster: Vivek Oberoi is Unrecognisable in This Biopic|website=News18|access-date=7 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107233029/https://www.news18.com/news/movies/pm-narendra-modi-poster-vivek-oberoi-is-unrecognisable-in-this-biopic-1994449.html|archive-date=7 January 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=timesnownews339599>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/news/people/article/after-the-accidental-prime-minister-a-film-on-pm-narendra-modi-to-go-on-floors-with-vivek-oberoi-in-the-lead/339599|title=After The Accidental Prime Minister, a film on PM Narendra Modi to go on floors with Vivek Oberoi in the lead?

He was published regularly in science fiction \"[[pulp magazine|pulp]]\" magazines.\n\n==Life and work==\nVincent was born in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1893. He attended a technical high school, then enrolled in [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]. Vincent left RPI without completing his freshman year, in order to marry.<ref name=amz38>\"Meet the Authors\", ''Amazing Stories'', December 1938, p.144</ref> He married Ruth Hoff, and they had two children, a son and a daughter. Vincent worked as a mechanical engineer for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], specializing in the installation and testing of large electrical apparatus. Later he was employed as a sales engineer, becoming the manager of a local steam division.<ref name=amz38 /><ref name=Bleiler>{{cite book|author1=Bleiler, Everett Franklin |author2=Bleiler, Richard |title=Science-fiction: The Gernsback Years : a Complete Coverage of the Genre Magazines ... from 1926 Through 1936|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PbMdeizaCNcC&pg=PR22 |year=1998 |publisher=Kent State University Press |isbn=978-0-87338-604-3 |page=451}}</ref>\n\nVincent\u2019s writing career began after he began reading [[Hugo Gernsback]]\u2019s pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Vincent\u2019s first published story, \u201cThe Golden Girl of Munan\u201d, appeared in the June 1928 issue of the magazine. During the next fourteen years, Vincent published more than seventy science fiction stories. Although most of his work appeared in the early science fiction magazines, he published twice in the general fiction pulp magazine ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]''.\n\nAlthough he ceased publishing during the early 1940s, Vincent remained involved with science fiction. After relocating to [[Los Angeles]], Vincent joined the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society]] and the Count Dracula Society, as well as attending local science fiction conventions. Vincent resumed writing late in life, publishing the novel ''The Doomsday Planet'' in 1966 and the story \u201cInvader\u201d in the September 1967 issue of ''[[If (magazine)|If]]''.<ref name=Bleiler/>\n\nVincent died in Los Angeles on May 5, 1968 of emphysema and pneumonia complications.\n\n==Works by Harl Vincent==\n[[File:Alex Schomburg - Harl Vincent - Marvel Science Stories for April-May 1939 - Illustration for Newscast.jpg|Illustration to ''Newscast'' in the April\u2013May 1939 issue of ''[[Marvel Science Stories]]''.
