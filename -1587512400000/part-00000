He believes that the only thing keeping him safe is his house. When his parents decide to move, Willy isn't thrilled with the idea of going to a new school and living in a strange home. One day, Gooby, a teddy bear that Willy had as a little boy, arrives at the new home. This version of Gooby is nearly six feet tall, able to talk, and wants to help; Willy decides that the two will be friends, but he must hide Gooby from his parents.\n\nLeft alone for long hours while Willy goes to school, Gooby is frequently bored. He passes the time by causing trouble, convincing the nanny that there are critters inside the house, stealing cookies from the kitchen, ransacking the garage for parts to build Willy's fantasy racer and sneaking around Willy's school where anyone could see him. When Willy's teacher goes on maternity leave, she is replaced by Mr. Nerdlinger, a children's book writer who desperately wants to become famous. When he catches sight of Gooby, he becomes determined to photograph him. Willy has trouble making friends, and when Gooby's appearance outside Mr. Nerdlinger's class makes Willy freak out (earning him and three of his classmates two weeks of after school detention) his reputation at school is only worsened. On Halloween day, Willy and Gooby go out during daylight to have fun (Willy convinces Gooby to pretend to be Willy's father in a costume) and Willy makes friends with the most popular kids in school by having Gooby buy them all tickets to an R-rated action movie. Gooby becomes envious of Willy when he begins to spend more time with his newfound friends. The two get into an argument, resulting in Gooby running away.\n\nWilly's grades start to drop, and his parents begin to worry. When Gooby eventually returns one night, he convinces Willy to follow him to a surprise location. Willy's parents notice that their son is missing and call the police, but meanwhile Gooby shows Willy what he has discovered: his father's childhood home. While exploring it, Willy gets scared to the point of falling backwards, breaking through the floor and catching a metal pipe too far down for Gooby to help him up. Gooby uses Willy's cellphone to call his father, who comes to the rescue. After saving Willy, Gooby talks to Mr. Dandrige and reminds him of how when he was a child his father never spent enough time with him. Willy's mother and father decide to stop working so hard and focus more on their son. One day, while shopping for materials to build Willy a playhouse, the family foils Mr. Nerdlinger's attempt to get pictures of Gooby when Willy notices that Gooby has wandered off. Gooby explains to Willy that now that he is happy and no longer so alone (and afraid of imaginary creatures), it's time for Gooby to move on and help another child. Gooby transforms back into a teddy bear and Willy offers him to a little girl who is being ignored by her parents.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as Gooby (voice)\n** Derek Scott as Gooby (performance)\n* [[David James Elliott]] as Jack Dandridge\n* [[Ingrid Kavelaars]] as Elize Dandridge\n* [[Matthew Knight]] as Willy Dandridge\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Mr. Nerdlinger\n* Mary Haney as Mrs. Williams\n* Len Doncheff as Mr. Ogilvey\n* Paula Boudreau as Mrs. Deacon\n* Elle Downs as Mrs. Donnelly\n* Ricky Hegarty as Colin\n* [[Alexander Conti]] as Eric\n* [[Luke Bilyk]] as Cute Kid\n* [[Jack Duffy]] as Grocery Store Manager\n* [[Daniel DeSanto]] as Crane\n* Avery Bisbee as Little Girl\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|1132588|Gooby}}\n* {{Mojo title|gooby|Gooby}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gooby}}\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:Canadian films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s fantasy films]]\n[[Category:2000s children's fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Canadian children's films]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the children's film|the [[Disney]] character parodied in [[Internet meme]]s as \"Gooby\"|Goofy}}\n{{Italic title}}\n{{Refimprove|stub|date=September 2010}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Gooby\n| image          = Gooby.jpg\n| alt            = <!-- see WP:ALT -->\n| caption        = \n| director       = Wilson Coneybeare\n| producer       = Wilson Coneybeare\n| writer         = Wilson Coneybeare\n| starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--- Per billing block --->\n*[[Robbie Coltrane]]\n*[[David James Elliott]]\n*[[Matthew Knight]]\n*[[Ingrid Kavelaars]]\n*[[Eugene Levy]]}}\n| music          = {{Plainlist|\n*Kevin Lau\n*Ronald Royer}}\n| cinematography = Michael Storey\n| editing        = Ellen Fine\n| studio         = Coneybeare Stories Inc.\n| distributor    = [[E1 Entertainment]]\n| released       = {{Film date|2009|4|17|df=y}}\n| runtime        = 95 minutes\n| country        = Canada\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = $3,234\n}}\n'''''Gooby''''' (also known as '''''A Ted Named Gooby''''') is a 2009 Canadian [[Comedy film|comedy]] [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[drama film]] written and directed by Wilson Coneybeare featuring [[Robbie Coltrane]] as the voice of Gooby, a living [[teddy bear]], and [[Matthew Knight]] as Willy, an 11-year-old child who is scared of his new house.\n\nThe film was shot on a budget of $6.5 million.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] rates it 20% positive (\"rotten\") based on five reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gooby/ |title=Gooby Movie Reviews, Pictures |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWilly is an 11-year-old boy who believes weird creatures are lurking, just waiting to attack him.

The school is located in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Jose in California]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Congregation of Holy Cross|Brothers of Holy Cross]] opened Saint Francis High School as an all-girls school in September 1955. The original teaching facility was a small frame building, renovated from a grammar school and named Grant Hall after Harry Grant, the first student to enroll. Other buildings included a former residence, Andre House, and some peripheral structures. The grounds were largely orchards. Four Brothers comprised the first-year faculty. The first principal was Brother Donatus Schmitz. He was soon replaced by Brother Fisher Iwasko, who remained several years and is considered the principal founder.\n\nSoon afterwards, the [[Congregation of Holy Cross|Brothers of Holy Cross]] invested $210,000 of their own funds and $225,000 of borrowed funds to build Holy Cross Hall. The building contained eight classrooms, three science laboratories, and administrative offices, and was completed in December 1956.\n\nIn 1959, Raskob Memorial Gymnasium was built on land donated by Ira and Elise Higgins. By 1962, the student body had grown to 685. In 1972, Saint Francis merged with Holy Cross High School, necessitating additional facilities.\n\nIn 2012 the school made a $15,000 investment into the website [[Snap Inc.]]; it had taken money from the endowment fund.<ref>{{cite web|author=Redell, Bob|author2=Rhea Mabhubhani|author3=Michelle Roberts|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Mountain-View-High-School-Poised-to-Rake-in-Millions-After-Snaps-Explosive-IPO-First-Day-Trading-415246063.html|title=Mountain View High School Rakes in Millions After Snap's Explosive IPO's First-Day Trading|publisher=NBC Bay Area|date=2017-03-03|accessdate=2017-03-07}}</ref> This investment grew to $24 million by 2017.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Kennedy, Mike|url=http://asumag.com/business-finance/catholic-schools-15000-tech-investment-reaps-windfall-24-million|title=Catholic school's $15,000 tech investment reaps windfall of $24 million|magazine=[[American School and University]]|date=2017-03-03|accessdate=2017-03-07}}</ref>\n\n== Academics ==\nSaint Francis provides honors and Advanced Placement.
