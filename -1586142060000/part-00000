As one of the domestic CPU of China, Loongson 3A3000 is being commercialized, and in the recently exhibition in Nanjing (2017), based on the Loongson 3A3000 motherboard developers computer quietly debut.\n[[File:Loongson-3A3000 1.jpg|220px|thumb|Loongson 3A3000 CPU]]\n \n3A3000 is Loongson latest CPU model (2017), it is using a LoongISA instruction set and designed with quad-core 64-bit and clocked at 1.5&nbsp;GHz, power consumption is only 30W. For the performance, because the frequency is only 1.5GHz, 3A3000 single-threaded performance is significantly behind to intel or AMD products. 3A3000 is only about one-third of Intel i5 4460 (3.2G).\n\n====Loongson 3A4000====\nIn late-2019, Loongson released latest versions, 3A4000 and 3B4000. The processors are designed with four cores, 8MB of L3 cache and operating clocks between 1.8 GHz to 2 GHz.\n\n==Hardware-assisted x86 emulation==\nThe Loongson 3 adds over 200 new instructions over Loongson 2. Their addition has the specific benefit of speeding up Intel x86 CPU emulation at a cost of 5% of the total [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] area. The new instructions help with emulation performance, for example [[QEMU]] (the only known example). The new instructions reduce the impact of executing x86/[[complex instruction set computer|CISC]]-style instructions in the MIPS pipeline. With added improvements in QEMU from ICT, Loongson-3 achieves an average of 70% the performance of executing native binaries when running x86 binaries from nine benchmarks.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Godson-3: A Scalable Multicore RISC Processor with x86 Emulation |journal=IEEE Micro |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=17\u201329 |publisher=[[IEEE]] |doi=10.1109/MM.2009.30 |year=2009 |last1=Hu |first1=Weiwu |last2=Wang |first2=Jian |last3=Gao |first3=Xiang |last4=Chen |first4=Yunji |last5=Liu |first5=Qi |last6=Li |first6=Guojie }}</ref>\n\n==Supported software==\nUnlike processors from [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Advanced Micro Devices]] or [[VIA Technologies]], Loongson does not directly support the [[x86 instruction set]].

The manufacturer states that the user experience of the desktop solution has been significantly improved over its Loongson-3A based predecessor. Results of a benchmark test, conducted in April 2014, are available<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://openbenchmarking.org/result/1404098-SO-3B1W2703307|title=3B1W Benchmarks [1404098-SO-3B1W2703307] - OpenBenchmarking.org|website=openbenchmarking.org}}</ref>\n\n====Loongson 3A3000====\nIn 2017, Loongson released latest version of 3A cpu, 3A3000. As one of the domestic CPU of China, Loongson 3A3000 is being commercialized, and in the recently exhibition in Nanjing (2017), based on the Loongson 3A3000 motherboard developers computer quietly debut.\n[[File:Loongson-3A3000 1.jpg|220px|thumb|Loongson 3A3000 CPU]]\n \n3A3000 is Loongson latest CPU model (2017), it is using a LoongISA instruction set and designed with quad-core 64-bit and clocked at 1.5&nbsp;GHz, power consumption is only 30W. For the performance, because the frequency is only 1.5GHz, 3A3000 single-threaded performance is significantly behind to intel or AMD products. 3A3000 is only about one-third of Intel i5 4460 (3.2G).\n\n====Loongson 3A4000====\nIn late-2019, Loongson released latest versions, 3A4000 and 3B4000. The processors are designed with four cores, 8MB of L3 cache and operating clocks between 1.8 GHz to 2 GHz.\n\n==Hardware-assisted x86 emulation==\nThe Loongson 3 adds over 200 new instructions over Loongson 2. Their addition has the specific benefit of speeding up Intel x86 CPU emulation at a cost of 5% of the total [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] area. The new instructions help with emulation performance, for example [[QEMU]] (the only known example). The new instructions reduce the impact of executing x86/[[complex instruction set computer|CISC]]-style instructions in the MIPS pipeline. With added improvements in QEMU from ICT, Loongson-3 achieves an average of 70% the performance of executing native binaries when running x86 binaries from nine benchmarks.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Godson-3: A Scalable Multicore RISC Processor with x86 Emulation |journal=IEEE Micro |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=17\u201329 |publisher=[[IEEE]] |doi=10.1109/MM.2009.30 |year=2009 |last1=Hu |first1=Weiwu |last2=Wang |first2=Jian |last3=Gao |first3=Xiang |last4=Chen |first4=Yunji |last5=Liu |first5=Qi |last6=Li |first6=Guojie }}</ref>\n\n==Supported software==\nUnlike processors from [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Advanced Micro Devices]] or [[VIA Technologies]], Loongson does not directly support the [[x86 instruction set]].

In her view, all disease has its ultimate root in some type of blocked or inhibited soul life.  Therefore, healing consists of releasing the soul, that is the establishing of a right relation between the soul and the personality where the personality is defined as the instrument of soul expression. Eliminating [[inflammation|obstructions]] and congestion, the source of a major part of disease. The whole process of healing is directed by thought, the mind of the healer and sometimes emotional synergy to inhibit causes of disease. Healing becomes automatic where the practitioner no longer is directed by energies, currents, centers, that include the nadis as one area of focus, the abstract is related back to the practices where appropriate but healing is directed without effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lucistrust.org/books/ponder_on_this/ponder_online/contents/part_2/books_ponder_on_this_ponder_online_contents_part_2_068_070|title=068-070 (Lucis Trust)|website=www.lucistrust.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lucistrust.org/online_books/esoteric_healing_obooks/part_one_the_basic_causes_disease/chapter_the_psychological_causes_disease_part1|title=CHAPTER I - The Psychological Causes of Disease - Part 1 - Online Books (Lucis Trust)|website=www.lucistrust.org}}</ref>\n\n=== The constitution of man ===\nIn line with previous Theosophical teachings,<ref>Leadbeater, C.

For instance, the noted contemporary Theosophical writer [[Geoffrey Hodson]] wrote a highly favorable review of one her books, saying, \"Once more Alice Bailey has placed occult students in her debt.\"<ref>Hodson, Geoffrey, ''World Theosophy Magazine,'' February 1931&nbsp;\u2013 June 1931, The Theosophical Society, 1931</ref> Olav Hammer writes, \"Her first book, ''Initiation Human and Solar,'' was at first favorably received by her fellow theosophists. Soon, however, her claims to be recipient of ageless wisdom from the Masters met with opposition.\"<ref>[[Olav Hammer|Hammer, Olav]], ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of epistemology from theosophy to the new age''. BRILL, 2001, p. 65</ref> The conflict is understandable since her works contain some criticisms of Theosophy, and at the time of the break she voiced her criticism of what she saw as dogmatic structures within the society, while questioning the pledges of loyalty to Theosophical leaders that were required. \"During the annual convention of 1920 in Chicago, there was a power struggle between forces loyal to Besant and the Esoteric Section and others who believed that the latter had become too powerful. Below the surface was a hidden controversy regarding Alice's work with the Tibetan.\"<ref name=\"Keller, Rosemary 2006 p 762\" /> For a more recent example of Bailey/Theosophy division, see [[Theosophy in Scandinavia]].\n\nCampbell writes that Bailey's books are a reworking of major Theosophical themes, with some distinctive emphases, and that they present a comprehensive system of esoteric science and occult philosophy, cognizant of contemporary social and political developments.<ref>Campbell, Bruce, F., ''Ancient Wisdom Revived, a History of the Theosophical Movement'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1980, p. 152</ref> Steven J. Sutcliffe points out that both Bailey and Blavatsky's work evoke a picture of [[Tibet]] as the spiritual home of the Masters and that Bailey claimed a more-or-less direct lineage to Blavatsky. He describes Bailey as a 'post-Theosophical' theorist, reporting that Bailey received instruction from \"former personal pupils of Blavatsky\" and notes that her third book (''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'') not only reproduces Blavatsky's apocryphal [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] but is dedicated to Blavatsky, as well.<ref>Sutcliffe, Steven J, ''Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices.''

Bailey|author=Weeks, Nicholas|publisher=blavatskyarchives.com}}</ref>\n\nNicholas Weeks, writing for the Theosophical magazine ''Fohat'' in 1997, felt Bailey's assertion that \"...{{nbsp}}her teachings are grounded in and do not oppose in any fundamental way Theosophy as lived and taught by HPB and her Gurus\" was false. Her books are in fact \"rooted in the [[Neo-Theosophy|pseudo-theosophy]] pioneered by C. W. Leadbeater.\" He stated Bailey accepted Leadbeater's \"fantasy\" of the return of Christ and disparaged Bailey's ''[[Great Invocation]]'', a prayer supposed to \"induce Christ and his Masters to leave their hidden ashrams [and] enter into major cities\" to lead the [[Aquarian Age]]. This contrasts with the Theosophy of Blavatsky, he says, which emphasizes reliance on \"the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)#Maitreya and the \"Christ Principle\"|Christos principle]] within each person\".<ref name=blava_arc />\n\n=== Ideas about races and evolution ===\nBailey described a concept of racial differentiation that posited a division of humanity into races that are on different levels in a \"ladder of evolution\". These '\"races\" do not represent a national or physical type but a stage of evolution. For example, she states that the [[Aryan]] [[root race]] (or '5th race'), is an \"emerging new race\" and so a relative new evolutionary phenomena.  The term \"Aryan\" as used by her has a different meaning than a separative or racist use of the word. She stated that this newer type is forming in every land but primarily in lands where [[Caucasian race|Caucasian peoples]] are found and indicates a culture where thought or intellect is dominant. Bailey considered the Aryan race to be determined by a state of consciousness rather than by genetic or racial traits.  She stated that as evolution proceeds, things are accelerated and humanity will soon be predominantly distinguished by the Aryan consciousness. \"I speak not in terms of the Aryan race as it is generally understood today or in its [[Nordic race|Nordic]] implications.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=Glamour, A World Problem |url=https://archive.org/details/glamourworldprob00bail|url-access=registration|publisher=Lucis Publishing |year=1950 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/glamourworldprob00bail/page/113 113\u2013114] |isbn=978-0-85330-109-7}}</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Education in the New Age'', Bailey made predictions about the use of this esoteric racial concept in the schools of the future and that these schools would incorporate the idea of \"root races\".  These \"races\" are a way of conceptualizing evolution as it occurs over vast prehistoric spans of time, and during which humanity developed body (Lemurian), emotion (Atlantean), and mind (Aryan).  She states that there is now being developed a \"new race\" with a spiritual dimension that expresses as \"group qualities and consciousness and idealistic vision\".<ref>Bailey, ''Education in the New Age'', p. 69\u201371</ref> However, she stated that this new development may take many thousands of years and may therefore not be the quick advance some of her [[New Age]] followers wish for. In her ''The Destiny of the Nations'', Bailey described a process by which this \"new race\" will evolve, after which \"very low grade human bodies will disappear, causing a general shift in the racial types toward a higher standard.\"<ref name=Penn>Penn, Lee, ''False Dawn: The United Religions Initiative, Globalism, and the Quest for a One-World Religion'', p. 264, Sophia Perennis, {{ISBN|1-59731-000-X}}</ref>  For Bailey, the evolution of humanity was intimately bound up with its relationship to this Spiritual Hierarchy. She believed that the influences of religions, philosophies, sciences, educational movements, and human culture in general are the result of this relationship.<ref>Jurriaance, Aart, ''Bridges, \" Bridges Trust, South Africa, c. 1978, p. 209, 261, 268''</ref>\n\nBailey's sometimes elusive and abstract ideas on the races are perhaps more clear in following passage in which she addresses [[Miscegenation|mixing of races]].\n\nfrom page 222 of her book, ''Esoteric Healing'' and it provides context for the criticisms that follow.\n\n<blockquote>... Inter-marriage between nations and races, the fusion of bloods for hundreds of years\u2014due to migration, travel, education and mental unity\u2014has led to there being no really pure racial types today.  This is far more certainly the case than the most enlightened think, if the long, long history of mankind is considered.  Sexual intercourse knows no impenetrable barriers, and people today have in them all the strains and the blood of all the races, and this (as a result of the world war, 1914\u20131945) will be increasingly the case.  This development is definitely a part of the divine plan, no matter how undesirable it may appear to those who idealize purity of relationship ... Something intended is being brought about and it cannot be avoided.</blockquote>\n\n==== Criticism of her ideas on races ====\nBailey's ideas about race were criticized by Victor Shnirelman, a [[cultural anthropologist]] and ethnographer, who in a survey of modern [[Neopaganism]] in Russia, drew particular attention to \"...{{nbsp}}groups [that] take an extremely negative view of [[Multiculturalism|multi-culturalism]], object to the 'mixture' of kinds, [and] support isolationism and the prohibition of immigration.\"  Shnirelman saw some of Bailey's ideas on race as similar to the racism he perceived in the writing of [[Julius Evola]], saying that \"...{{nbsp}}racist and antisemitic trends are explicit, for example, in the occult teachings of Alice Bailey and her followers, who wish to cleanse Christianity of its \"Jewish inheritance\" and reject the \"[[Hebrew Bible|Jewish Bible]]\" as a prerequisite for entering the Age of Aquarius.\"<ref name=\"Shnirelman\">[http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/13shnir.html Shnirelman, Victor A.

Turnstone Press Limited. 1984.</ref>\n\n=== Influence on neopaganism ===\nSeveral writers have mentioned the affinity of some of Bailey's concepts with modern expressions of [[paganism]].<ref>Roberts, Richard H., & Joanne Pearson, Geoffrey Samuel, ''Nature Religion Today: paganism in the modern world'', Edinburgh University Press, 1998, pp 34, 41\u201343, 203, 219</ref><ref>Kemp, Daren, ''New Age: A Guide,'' Edinburgh University Press, 2004, p. 57</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the [[neopagan]] author and [[ceremonial magic]] ritualist Caroll Poke Runyon published a magazine called ''The Seventh Ray,'' its name taken from the writings of Alice Bailey. In the 1990s, two volumes of collected articles from the magazine were published as ''The Seventh Ray Book I, The Blue Ray'' and ''The Seventh Ray Book II, the Red Ray.''\n\nIn contrast to this, Daren Kemp in ''Handbook to the New Age'' sees critical differences between neopaganism and New Age movements and indicates that it is a mistake to conflate them.<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xsCwCQAAQBAJ\n| title = Handbook of New Age\n| last = Kemp\n| first = Daren\n| last2 = Lewis\n| first2 = James\n| date = 2007-05-28\n| publisher = BRILL\n| isbn = 9789047420132\n| language = en\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Influence on women in religion ===\nAuthor [[Catherine Wessinger]] wrote that Bailey was a liberated woman \"...{{nbsp}}sixty years before it became popular\" and that Bailey's books expressed a similar \"millennial view\" to the works of Annie Besant.  Wessinger stated that they were \"an important source of the contemporary New Age movement.\"<ref>Wessinger, Catherine Lowman, ''Women's Leadership in Marginal Religions: Explorations Outside The Mainstream.'' University of Illinois, Press, 1993, p. 80</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Encyclopedia of Women And Religion in North America'', several leaders of New Age philosophy have further developed Bailey's teachings, including the well-known personalities [[JZ Knight]] (who channels the entity known by the name [[Ramtha]]), [[Helen Schucman]] (author of [[A Course in Miracles]] through the process of telepathic dictation she called \"scribing\"), and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] (who published what she referred to as \"dictations from Ascended Masters\").  These developments have been referred to by other sources as \"spin-offs\" and splinter groups.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=S_Leq4U5ihkC\n| title = Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma\n| last = McClelland\n| first = Norman C.\n| date = 2010-04-01\n| publisher = McFarland\n| isbn = 978-0-7864-5675-8\n| language = en\n}}</ref> (p. 65)<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3N4mGlbutbgC\n| title = Encyclopedia of Hinduism\n| last = Cush\n| first = Denise\n| last2 = Robinson\n| first2 = Catherine\n| last3 = York\n| first3 = Michael\n| date = 2012-08-21\n| publisher = Routledge\n| isbn = 978-1-135-18978-5\n| language = en\n}}</ref> (p. 557)  The differences between Theosophy, Bailey and Elizabeth Clare Prophet can be noted in connection with Elizabeth Clare Prophet's radical concepts of catastrophic change and survivalism, including the building of fall-out shelters.<ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KHxYZdQ5CXQC\n| title = Women's Leadership in Marginal Religions: Explorations Outside the Mainstream\n| last = Wessinger\n| first = Catherine\n| date = 1993-01-01\n| publisher = University of Illinois Press\n| isbn = 978-0-252-06332-9\n| language = en\n}}</ref> (p. 81)  The validity of the  Elizabeth Clare Prophet's writings was \"...{{nbsp}}disputed by Theosophical writers\".{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe \"Tibetan\" teacher, Djwhal Khul, whom Bailey claimed was the co-author of many of her books, has also been claimed as co-author by two new female channelers, Violet Starre and Moriah Marston. Starre claims to have channeled Bailey's old teacher twice: the title of her first book, ''Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays & More'', owes an obvious debt to Bailey's writings, and is sometimes listed in book catalogues under the full title \"''Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays & More (Teachings Similar to Those Given to Alice A.

Marston's ''Soul Searching with Djwahl Khul, the Tibetan'', was published in 2006, and according to her publisher, Airleaf Books, \"She has been a conscious channel for Ascended Master Djwhal Khul since 1986.\"\n\nThe many claims and teachings of the spin-off groups underscores their divergences, for example there appears to be a widespread confusion about the phrase and meaning of \"Ascendant Master\" in that it was adopted by Mark and Elizabeth Prophet but not by Theosophists or Alice Bailey.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine?id=2382\n| title = Theosophical Society in America\n| last = Sender\n| first = Pablo\n| website = www.theosophical.org\n| access-date = 2016-02-25\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_O9zBgAAQBAJ\n| title = The Esoteric Codex: Theosophy I\n| last = Rogers\n| first = Mark\n| date = 2014-02-13\n| publisher = Lulu.com\n| isbn = 978-1-312-01114-4\n| language = en\n}}{{self-published source}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} (p.&nbsp;111) The concepts and language have been conflated in the popular mind.<ref>[https://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine?id=2382 ]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Influence on psychotherapy and healing ===\nIn 1930, with the patronage of English-Dutch spiritualist, theosophist and scholar [[Olga Froebe-Kapteyn]], Bailey established the short-lived \"School of Spiritual Research\" located on Froebe-Kapteyn's estate, Casa Gabriella, in Switzerland. (In 1932 the school was closed because of personal conflict between Bailey and Froebe-Kapteyn, at which time Froebe-Kapteyn replaced it with the [[Eranos]] group.)\n\n[[Roberto Assagioli]], founder of [[Psychosynthesis]], was a lecturer at School of Spiritual Research.<ref>McGuire, William. ''An Adventure in Collecting the Past''. Princeton University Press. 1989, p 23</ref> He continued a close association with Bailey during the 1930s; some of his writings were published in Bailey's magazine ''The Beacon''; and he was a trustee of Bailey's organization, the Lucis Trust.<ref>Roberts, Richard H., & Joanne Pearson, Geoffrey Samuel, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World,'' p.44</ref> He had developed his approach to psychology, called Psychosynthesis, beginning in 1910; his methods were later influenced by some elements of Bailey's work.<ref>Grof, Stanislav, ''The Adventure of Self-Discovery,'' SUNY Press, 1988 p. 123</ref><ref>Bromley, David G. & Phillip E.

These ideas may partially account for an association in minds of some between Bailey, and others of the Theosophical schools, and UFOs. For instance, Christopher Partridge wrote of this association as \"easily transferred\".<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/nr.2004.8.2.110?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]</ref> The connection does exist in the sense that there is a subset of persons interested in both esoteric writings and UFOs and who link them as shown by the fact that some books that cite Alice Bailey or Theosophy also cite UFOs.<ref>http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/harper/millenial4.html</ref>\n\nChristopher Partridge wrote that the works of Bailey, Rudolf Steiner, and Theosophy in general all influenced what he called the \"[[UFO religion]]s\".<ref name=\"Partridge 2003\">{{cite book |last=Partridge |first=Christopher H. |title=UFO Religions |publisher=Routledge |year=2003}} Pages 8&nbsp;\u2013 9</ref> He explained that \"...{{nbsp}}Theosophy has several prominent branches, and, strictly speaking, the branch which has had the most important influence on the UFO religion is that developed by Alice Bailey.\".<ref>Partridge, Christopher H.

Ellwood of the University of Southern California investigated a wide range of religious and spiritual groups in the United States during the 1970s, including a nationwide group of UFO believers called Understanding, Inc., which had been founded by a [[contactee]] named [[Daniel Fry]]. He reported that, \"There is no particular religious practice connected with the meeting, although the New Age Prayer derived from the Alice Bailey writings is used as an invocation.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellwood |first=Robert S. |title=Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1973|isbn=0-13-773317-8}} Pages 143&nbsp;\u2013 145: \"Understanding, Inc.\" and \"Reading Selection: Understanding, Inc.\"</ref>\n\n[[George D.

Author Ryan H. Walsh suggests that book had an influence on the Velvet's second album, ''[[White Light/White Heat]].''<ref>''Astral Weeks: A Secret History of 1968'' (NY: Penguin Press, 2018), 123\u201324.</ref>\n\nIn 1975, [[Todd Rundgren]] released an album titled ''[[Initiation (Todd Rundgren album)|Initiation]]'' which has a song called \"Initiation\" on side one. The title of the album is apparently based on the Theosophical concept of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Initiation]], taught by Alice A. Bailey and C.W. Leadbeater. The entire second side of the album is taken up by a song called \"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire\"; the three parts of the song are listed as: \"I. The Internal Fire, or Fire by Friction; II. The Fire of Spirit, or Electric Fire; The Fire of Mind, or Solar Fire.\" The second parts of these three phrases are taken directly from Alice A. Bailey's book ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire''. Also in 1975, Rundgren released an album by his side-project [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] titled \"[[Another Live]]\".  This album contained a song titled \"The Seven Rays\" (see reference above). Finally, in 1977, Rundgren followed up with another Bailey reference with a song entitled \"Love in Action\" from the Utopia album [[Oops! Wrong Planet]]. Love in Action was the concept promoted by Bailey's and Foster Bailey's \"World Goodwill\" organization.{{Original research inline|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1982, Bailey's influence appeared in [[popular culture|pop culture]], with the release of [[Van Morrison]]'s album ''[[Beautiful Vision]]'', in which he directly referred to the teachings and the Tibetan in the lyrics of the songs \"[[Dweller on the Threshold (song)|Dweller on the Threshold]]\" and \"Aryan Mist\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Music for Inner Space|last=Drury|first=Nevill|year=1985|publisher=Prism Press|page=60|isbn=0-9589759-0-6}}</ref> Morrison also used the phrase \"world of glamour\", reminiscent of Bailey's ''Glamour: A World Problem'', in the songs \"[[Ivory Tower (Van Morrison song)|Ivory Tower]]\" and \"Green Mansions\". The song [[Ancient of Days (song)|Ancient of Days]] from the 1984 [[Sense of Wonder]] album appears to be a reference to a Bailey concept found in such books as ''[[The Externalization of the Hierarchy]]''. Alice A. Bailey and the Tibetan's ''Glamour: A World Problem'' is also directly cited in the liner notes to Morrison's album ''[[Inarticulate Speech of the Heart]]''.{{Original research inline|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Wikipedia article on [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega]], Argentina's Minister of Social Welfare during the Peronist government, cites his interest in esoteric studies.

World Goodwill is intended to promote better human relations through goodwill which they define as \"love in action\".  That \"action\" included support of the [[United Nations]]. The \"Triangles\" are groups of three people who agree to link up in thought each day and to meditate on right human relations,  visualizing light and love pouring into human minds and hearts, followed by the use of the [[Great Invocation]]. It is not necessary for each person to link in thought at the same time each day and need only take a few moments of time.\n\nAlice and Foster Bailey founded, \"Lucifer Publishing Company\".

In her view, all disease has its ultimate root in some type of blocked or inhibited soul life.  Therefore, healing consists of releasing the soul, that is the establishing of a right relation between the soul and the personality where the personality is defined as the instrument of soul expression. Eliminating [[inflammation|obstructions]] and congestion, the source of a major part of disease. The whole process of healing is directed by thought, the mind of the healer and sometimes emotional synergy to inhibit causes of disease. Healing becomes automatic where the practitioner no longer is directed by energies, currents, centers, that include the nadis as one area of focus, the abstract is related back to the practices where appropriate but healing is directed without effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lucistrust.org/books/ponder_on_this/ponder_online/contents/part_2/books_ponder_on_this_ponder_online_contents_part_2_068_070|title=068-070 (Lucis Trust)|website=www.lucistrust.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lucistrust.org/online_books/esoteric_healing_obooks/part_one_the_basic_causes_disease/chapter_the_psychological_causes_disease_part1|title=CHAPTER I - The Psychological Causes of Disease - Part 1 - Online Books (Lucis Trust)|website=www.lucistrust.org}}</ref>\n\n=== The constitution of man ===\nIn line with previous Theosophical teachings,<ref>Leadbeater, C.

For instance, the noted contemporary Theosophical writer [[Geoffrey Hodson]] wrote a highly favorable review of one her books, saying, \"Once more Alice Bailey has placed occult students in her debt.\"<ref>Hodson, Geoffrey, ''World Theosophy Magazine,'' February 1931&nbsp;\u2013 June 1931, The Theosophical Society, 1931</ref> Olav Hammer writes, \"Her first book, ''Initiation Human and Solar,'' was at first favorably received by her fellow theosophists. Soon, however, her claims to be recipient of ageless wisdom from the Masters met with opposition.\"<ref>[[Olav Hammer|Hammer, Olav]], ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of epistemology from theosophy to the new age''. BRILL, 2001, p. 65</ref> The conflict is understandable since her works contain some criticisms of Theosophy, and at the time of the break she voiced her criticism of what she saw as dogmatic structures within the society, while questioning the pledges of loyalty to Theosophical leaders that were required. \"During the annual convention of 1920 in Chicago, there was a power struggle between forces loyal to Besant and the Esoteric Section and others who believed that the latter had become too powerful. Below the surface was a hidden controversy regarding Alice's work with the Tibetan.\"<ref name=\"Keller, Rosemary 2006 p 762\" /> For a more recent example of Bailey/Theosophy division, see [[Theosophy in Scandinavia]].\n\nCampbell writes that Bailey's books are a reworking of major Theosophical themes, with some distinctive emphases, and that they present a comprehensive system of esoteric science and occult philosophy, cognizant of contemporary social and political developments.<ref>Campbell, Bruce, F., ''Ancient Wisdom Revived, a History of the Theosophical Movement'', [[University of California Press]], Berkeley, 1980, p. 152</ref> Steven J. Sutcliffe points out that both Bailey and Blavatsky's work evoke a picture of [[Tibet]] as the spiritual home of the Masters and that Bailey claimed a more-or-less direct lineage to Blavatsky. He describes Bailey as a 'post-Theosophical' theorist, reporting that Bailey received instruction from \"former personal pupils of Blavatsky\" and notes that her third book (''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'') not only reproduces Blavatsky's apocryphal [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] but is dedicated to Blavatsky, as well.<ref>Sutcliffe, Steven J, ''Children of the New Age: A History of Spiritual Practices.''

Bailey|author=Weeks, Nicholas|publisher=blavatskyarchives.com}}</ref>\n\nNicholas Weeks, writing for the Theosophical magazine ''Fohat'' in 1997, felt Bailey's assertion that \"...{{nbsp}}her teachings are grounded in and do not oppose in any fundamental way Theosophy as lived and taught by HPB and her Gurus\" was false. Her books are in fact \"rooted in the [[Neo-Theosophy|pseudo-theosophy]] pioneered by C. W. Leadbeater.\" He stated Bailey accepted Leadbeater's \"fantasy\" of the return of Christ and disparaged Bailey's ''[[Great Invocation]]'', a prayer supposed to \"induce Christ and his Masters to leave their hidden ashrams [and] enter into major cities\" to lead the [[Aquarian Age]]. This contrasts with the Theosophy of Blavatsky, he says, which emphasizes reliance on \"the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)#Maitreya and the \"Christ Principle\"|Christos principle]] within each person\".<ref name=blava_arc />\n\n=== Ideas about races and evolution ===\nBailey described a concept of racial differentiation that posited a division of humanity into races that are on different levels in a \"ladder of evolution\". These '\"races\" do not represent a national or physical type but a stage of evolution. For example, she states that the [[Aryan]] [[root race]] (or '5th race'), is an \"emerging new race\" and so a relative new evolutionary phenomena.  The term \"Aryan\" as used by her has a different meaning than a separative or racist use of the word. She stated that this newer type is forming in every land but primarily in lands where [[Caucasian race|Caucasian peoples]] are found and indicates a culture where thought or intellect is dominant. Bailey considered the Aryan race to be determined by a state of consciousness rather than by genetic or racial traits.  She stated that as evolution proceeds, things are accelerated and humanity will soon be predominantly distinguished by the Aryan consciousness. \"I speak not in terms of the Aryan race as it is generally understood today or in its [[Nordic race|Nordic]] implications.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bailey|first=Alice A.|title=Glamour, A World Problem |url=https://archive.org/details/glamourworldprob00bail|url-access=registration|publisher=Lucis Publishing |year=1950 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/glamourworldprob00bail/page/113 113\u2013114] |isbn=978-0-85330-109-7}}</ref>\n\nIn her book ''Education in the New Age'', Bailey made predictions about the use of this esoteric racial concept in the schools of the future and that these schools would incorporate the idea of \"root races\".  These \"races\" are a way of conceptualizing evolution as it occurs over vast prehistoric spans of time, and during which humanity developed body (Lemurian), emotion (Atlantean), and mind (Aryan).  She states that there is now being developed a \"new race\" with a spiritual dimension that expresses as \"group qualities and consciousness and idealistic vision\".<ref>Bailey, ''Education in the New Age'', p. 69\u201371</ref> However, she stated that this new development may take many thousands of years and may therefore not be the quick advance some of her [[New Age]] followers wish for. In her ''The Destiny of the Nations'', Bailey described a process by which this \"new race\" will evolve, after which \"very low grade human bodies will disappear, causing a general shift in the racial types toward a higher standard.\"<ref name=Penn>Penn, Lee, ''False Dawn: The United Religions Initiative, Globalism, and the Quest for a One-World Religion'', p. 264, Sophia Perennis, {{ISBN|1-59731-000-X}}</ref>  For Bailey, the evolution of humanity was intimately bound up with its relationship to this Spiritual Hierarchy. She believed that the influences of religions, philosophies, sciences, educational movements, and human culture in general are the result of this relationship.<ref>Jurriaance, Aart, ''Bridges, \" Bridges Trust, South Africa, c. 1978, p. 209, 261, 268''</ref>\n\nBailey's sometimes elusive and abstract ideas on the races are perhaps more clear in following passage in which she addresses [[Miscegenation|mixing of races]].\n\nfrom page 222 of her book, ''Esoteric Healing'' and it provides context for the criticisms that follow.\n\n<blockquote>... Inter-marriage between nations and races, the fusion of bloods for hundreds of years\u2014due to migration, travel, education and mental unity\u2014has led to there being no really pure racial types today.  This is far more certainly the case than the most enlightened think, if the long, long history of mankind is considered.  Sexual intercourse knows no impenetrable barriers, and people today have in them all the strains and the blood of all the races, and this (as a result of the world war, 1914\u20131945) will be increasingly the case.  This development is definitely a part of the divine plan, no matter how undesirable it may appear to those who idealize purity of relationship ... Something intended is being brought about and it cannot be avoided.</blockquote>\n\n==== Criticism of her ideas on races ====\nBailey's ideas about race were criticized by Victor Shnirelman, a [[cultural anthropologist]] and ethnographer, who in a survey of modern [[Neopaganism]] in Russia, drew particular attention to \"...{{nbsp}}groups [that] take an extremely negative view of [[Multiculturalism|multi-culturalism]], object to the 'mixture' of kinds, [and] support isolationism and the prohibition of immigration.\"  Shnirelman saw some of Bailey's ideas on race as similar to the racism he perceived in the writing of [[Julius Evola]], saying that \"...{{nbsp}}racist and antisemitic trends are explicit, for example, in the occult teachings of Alice Bailey and her followers, who wish to cleanse Christianity of its \"Jewish inheritance\" and reject the \"[[Hebrew Bible|Jewish Bible]]\" as a prerequisite for entering the Age of Aquarius.\"<ref name=\"Shnirelman\">[http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/13shnir.html Shnirelman, Victor A.

Starre claims to have channeled Bailey's old teacher twice: the title of her first book, ''Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays & More'', owes an obvious debt to Bailey's writings, and is sometimes listed in book catalogues under the full title \"''Diamond Light, Cosmic Psychology of Being, 4th Dimension, 7 Rays & More (Teachings Similar to Those Given to Alice A.

(In 1932 the school was closed because of personal conflict between Bailey and Froebe-Kapteyn, at which time Froebe-Kapteyn replaced it with the [[Eranos]] group.)\n\n[[Roberto Assagioli]], founder of [[Psychosynthesis]], was a lecturer at School of Spiritual Research.<ref>McGuire, William. ''An Adventure in Collecting the Past''. Princeton University Press. 1989, p 23</ref> He continued a close association with Bailey during the 1930s; some of his writings were published in Bailey's magazine ''The Beacon''; and he was a trustee of Bailey's organization, the Lucis Trust.<ref>Roberts, Richard H., & Joanne Pearson, Geoffrey Samuel, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World,'' p.44</ref> He had developed his approach to psychology, called Psychosynthesis, beginning in 1910; his methods were later influenced by some elements of Bailey's work.<ref>Grof, Stanislav, ''The Adventure of Self-Discovery,'' SUNY Press, 1988 p. 123</ref><ref>Bromley, David G. & Phillip E.

These ideas may partially account for an association in minds of some between Bailey, and others of the Theosophical schools, and UFOs. For instance, Christopher Partridge wrote of this association as \"easily transferred\".<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/nr.2004.8.2.110?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents]</ref> The connection does exist in the sense that there is a subset of persons interested in both esoteric writings and UFOs and who link them as shown by the fact that some books that cite Alice Bailey or Theosophy also cite UFOs.<ref>http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/harper/millenial4.html</ref>\n\nChristopher Partridge wrote that the works of Bailey, Rudolf Steiner, and Theosophy in general all influenced what he called the \"[[UFO religion]]s\".<ref name=\"Partridge 2003\">{{cite book |last=Partridge |first=Christopher H. |title=UFO Religions |publisher=Routledge |year=2003}} Pages 8&nbsp;\u2013 9</ref> He explained that \"...{{nbsp}}Theosophy has several prominent branches, and, strictly speaking, the branch which has had the most important influence on the UFO religion is that developed by Alice Bailey.\".<ref>Partridge, Christopher H.

Ellwood of the University of Southern California investigated a wide range of religious and spiritual groups in the United States during the 1970s, including a nationwide group of UFO believers called Understanding, Inc., which had been founded by a [[contactee]] named [[Daniel Fry]]. He reported that, \"There is no particular religious practice connected with the meeting, although the New Age Prayer derived from the Alice Bailey writings is used as an invocation.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellwood |first=Robert S. |title=Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1973|isbn=0-13-773317-8}} Pages 143&nbsp;\u2013 145: \"Understanding, Inc.\" and \"Reading Selection: Understanding, Inc.\"</ref>\n\n[[George D.

An untitled paper] presented at the [[CESNUR]] Conference held in Palermo, Sicily, 2005.</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n[[Lou Reed]] of [[the Velvet Underground]] was a devoted reader of Bailey's work, especially her book ''A Treatise on White Magic'', which he urged on others. Author Ryan H. Walsh suggests that book had an influence on the Velvet's second album, ''[[White Light/White Heat]].''<ref>''Astral Weeks: A Secret History of 1968'' (NY: Penguin Press, 2018), 123\u201324.</ref>\n\nIn 1975, [[Todd Rundgren]] released an album titled ''[[Initiation (Todd Rundgren album)|Initiation]]'' which has a song called \"Initiation\" on side one. The title of the album is apparently based on the Theosophical concept of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Initiation]], taught by Alice A. Bailey and C.W. Leadbeater. The entire second side of the album is taken up by a song called \"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire\"; the three parts of the song are listed as: \"I. The Internal Fire, or Fire by Friction; II. The Fire of Spirit, or Electric Fire; The Fire of Mind, or Solar Fire.\" The second parts of these three phrases are taken directly from Alice A. Bailey's book ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire''. Also in 1975, Rundgren released an album by his side-project [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] titled \"[[Another Live]]\".  This album contained a song titled \"The Seven Rays\" (see reference above). Finally, in 1977, Rundgren followed up with another Bailey reference with a song entitled \"Love in Action\" from the Utopia album [[Oops! Wrong Planet]]. Love in Action was the concept promoted by Bailey's and Foster Bailey's \"World Goodwill\" organization.{{Original research inline|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1982, Bailey's influence appeared in [[popular culture|pop culture]], with the release of [[Van Morrison]]'s album ''[[Beautiful Vision]]'', in which he directly referred to the teachings and the Tibetan in the lyrics of the songs \"[[Dweller on the Threshold (song)|Dweller on the Threshold]]\" and \"Aryan Mist\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Music for Inner Space|last=Drury|first=Nevill|year=1985|publisher=Prism Press|page=60|isbn=0-9589759-0-6}}</ref> Morrison also used the phrase \"world of glamour\", reminiscent of Bailey's ''Glamour: A World Problem'', in the songs \"[[Ivory Tower (Van Morrison song)|Ivory Tower]]\" and \"Green Mansions\". The song [[Ancient of Days (song)|Ancient of Days]] from the 1984 [[Sense of Wonder]] album appears to be a reference to a Bailey concept found in such books as ''[[The Externalization of the Hierarchy]]''. Alice A. Bailey and the Tibetan's ''Glamour: A World Problem'' is also directly cited in the liner notes to Morrison's album ''[[Inarticulate Speech of the Heart]]''.{{Original research inline|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Wikipedia article on [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Rega]], Argentina's Minister of Social Welfare during the Peronist government, cites his interest in esoteric studies.

He trained in [[Stu Hart]]'s Dungeon pro wrestling school and briefly wrestled in Hart's [[Stampede Wrestling]] under his given name, forming a tag team with [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce Hart]]. He started wrestling as '''Billy Jack''' in the Pacific Northwest territory but had to change his name when [[Tom Laughlin]] (who starred in the movie ''[[Billy Jack]]'') threatened to sue him. He added his real last name to the gimmick and continued to work as a babyface.\nIt is rumored that Haynes served time for manslaughter before becoming a pro wrestler.<ref>https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/midcard-faces-billy-jack-haynes/</ref>\n\n===Championship Wrestling from Florida and Pacific Northwest Wrestling (1984\u20131986)===\nHe feuded heavily with Rip Oliver until 1984, when he had a run in [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] where he feuded with [[Kendo Nagasaki]] for the [[NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship]] winning the title from him. They then had a brief run in [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] in 1985, managed by Sunshine. Due to internal conflict between Fritz Von Erich and Billy, he was written out of the organization, jobbing to Rip Oliver in a storyline where Rip bloodies and injured Billy.  He rarely stayed put in any federation that he went to.  During that time he faced off against the debuting [[Shawn Michaels]]. He started splitting his time between [[Pacific Northwest Wrestling|Portland Wrestling]] and CWF and wrestled with partner [[Wahoo McDaniel]] and won the [[NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship]] and in [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] where they feuded with [[Ole Anderson|Ole]] and [[Arn Anderson]]. He had just begun a feud with [[Sione Vailahi|The Barbarian]] over who was the strongest man in the territory when he abruptly left the company after a confrontation with Jim Crockett in his office which became physical.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation (1986\u20131988)===\nIn 1986, Haynes went to the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and feuded with [[Randy Savage]] over the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]]<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/32 32]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/32}}</ref> and then with [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules Hernandez]] over who was stronger, more muscular, and who had a better version of the full nelson (their mutual finishing maneuver).
