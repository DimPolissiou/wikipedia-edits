Various Tagalog societies were also established in Calatagan, Tayabas, shores of Lake Laguna, Marinduque, and Malolos. The enhancements of these Tagalog societies until the middle of the 16th century made it possible for other Tagalog societies to spread and develop various cultural practices such as those concerning the [[dambana]].

Records have also shown that ''kare-kare'' is the Tagalog dish that the Spanish first tasted when the landed in pre-colonial Tondo.<ref>[http://southeastasianfood.about.com/od/meatrecipes/r/BistekTagalog.htm Filipino Fried Steak \u2013 Bistek Tagalog Recipe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412060810/http://southeastasianfood.about.com/od/meatrecipes/r/BistekTagalog.htm |date=April 12, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Clothing===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Tagalog dress, early 1800s.jpg|thumb|200px|Tagalog clothing during the 19th century. From ''Aventures d'un Gentilhomme Breton aux iles Philippines'' by Paul de la Gironiere, published in 1855.]]\n[[File:A Manila Man (c. 1900, Philippines).jpg|thumb|200px|A working-class Tagalog man, c. 1900]]\n[[File:A Manila Girl (c. 1900, Philippines).jpg|thumb|200px|A Tagalog woman in traditional dress, c. 1900]]\nMajority of Tagalogs before colonization wore garments woven by the locals, much of which showed sophisticated designs and techniques. The [[Boxer Codex]] also illuminates the intricate and high standard in Tagalog clothing, especially among the gold-draped high society. High society members, which include the datu and the katolonan, also wore accessories made of prized materials. Slaves on the other hand wore simple clothing, seldom loincloths.\n\nDuring later centuries, Tagalog nobles would wear the ''barong tagalog'' for men and the ''baro't saya'' for women. When the Philippines became independent, the barong Tagalog became popularised as the national costume of the country, as the wearers were the majority in the new capital, Manila.\n\n===Craftsmanship===\nThe Tagalog people were also craftsmen. The katolanan, specifically, of each barangay is tasked as the holder of arts and culture, and usually trains craftfolks if ever no craftfolks are living in the barangay. If the barangay has a craftsfolk, the present crafts-folks would teach their crafts to gifted students. Notable crafts made by ancient Tagalogs are boats, fans, agricultural materials, livestock instruments, spears, arrows, shields, accessories, jewelries, clothing, houses, paddles, fish gears, mortar and pestles, food utensils, musical instruments, bamboo and metal wears for inscribing messages, clay wears, toys, and many others.\n\n===Belief on the soul and ''pangangaluluwa''===\nThe Tagalog people traditionally believe in the two forms of the soul. The first is known as the ''kakambal'' (literally means twin), which is the soul of the living. Every time a person sleeps, the ''kakambal'' may travel to many mundane and supernatural places which sometimes leads to nightmares if a terrible event is encountered while the ''kakambal'' is travelling. When a person dies, the ''kakambal'' is ultimately transformed into the second form of the Tagalog soul, which is the ''kaluluwa'' (literally means spirit). In traditional Tagalog religion, the ''kaluluwa'' then travels to either ''Kasanaan'' (if the person was evil when he was living) or ''Maca'' (if the person was good when he was living) through sacred tomb-equipped psychopomp creatures known as ''buwaya''<ref name=\"aswangproject.com\">https://www.aswangproject.com/philippines-monster-islands/</ref><ref name=\"aswangproject.com\"/> or through divine intervention. Both domains are ruled by [[Bathala]], though Kasanaan is also ruled by the deity of souls.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/</ref>\n\nIn addition to the belief in the ''kaluluwa'', a tradition called ''pangangaluluwa'' sprang. The ''pangangaluluwa'' is a traditional Tagalog way of aiding ancestor spirits to arrive well in ''Maca'' (place where good spirits go) or to make ancestor spirits that may have been sent to ''Kasanaan''/''Kasamaan'' (place where bad spirits go) be given a chance to be cleansed and go to ''Maca''. The tradition includes the peoples (which represent the ''kaluluwa'' of people who have passed on), and their oral tradition conducted through a recitation or song. The people also ask for alms from townsfolk, where the alms are offered to the ''kaluluwa'' afterwards. This tradition, now absorbed even in the Christian beliefs of Tagalogs, is modernly-held between October 27 to November 1, although it may be held on any day of the year if need be during the old days. The traditional ''pangangaluluwa'' song's composition is:<ref name=\"tagaloglang.com\">https://www.tagaloglang.com/pangangaluluwa/</ref><ref name=\"newsinfo.inquirer.net\">http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/647988/pangangaluluwa-reviving-a-dying-custom</ref> ''Kaluluwa\u2019y dumaratal'' (The second souls are arriving); ''Sa tapat ng durungawan'' (In front of the window); ''Kampanilya\u2019y tinatantang'' (The bells are ringing); ''Ginigising ang may buhay'' (Waking up those who still have life); ''Kung kami po\u2019y lilimusan'' (If we are to be asked to give alms); ''Dali-daliin po lamang'' (Make it faster); ''Baka kami\u2019y mapagsarhan'' (We may be shut); ''Ng Pinto ng Kalangitan'' (From the doors of heaven).<ref name=\"tagaloglang.com\"/> The ''Kalangitan'' in the lyrics would have been ''Maca'' during the classical era.<ref name=\"tagaloglang.com\"/><ref name=\"newsinfo.inquirer.net\"/>\n\nAdditional lyrics are present in some localities. An example is the additional 4 lines from Nueva Ecija:<ref name=\"tagaloglang.com\"/><ref name=\"newsinfo.inquirer.net\"/> ''Bukas po ng umaga'' (Tomorrow morning); ''Tayong lahat ay magsisimba'' (We will go to the shrine); ''Doon natin makikita'' (There, we will see); ''Ang misa ng kaluluwa!'' (The mass of the second souls!)<ref name=\"tagaloglang.com\"/>\n\n===Belief on dreams===\nThe Tagalog people traditionally believe that when a person sleeps, he may or may not dream the omens of [[Bathala]]. The omens are either hazy illusions within a dream, the appearance of an omen creature such as [[tigmamanukan]], or sightings from the future. The dream omens do not leave traces on what a person must do to prevent or let the dream come true as it is up to the person to make the proper actions to prevent or make the dream come true. The omen dreams are only warnings and possibilities 'drafted by Bathala'.\n\nAdditionally, a person may sometimes encounter nightmares in dreams. There are two reasons why nightmares occur, the first is when the ''kakambal'' soul encounters a terrifying event while travelling from the body, or when a ''[[Batibat|bangungot]]'' creature sits on top of the sleeping person in a bid of vengeance due to the cutting of her tree home. Majority of the nightmares are said to be due to the ''kakambal'' soul encountering terrifying events while travelling.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/><ref>https://vanwinkles.com/11-mythical-sleep-creatures-from-around-the-world</ref>\n\n===Belief on the cosmos===\nAncient Tagalogs initially believed that the first deity of the sun and moon was [[Bathala]], as he is a primordial deity and the deity of everything. Later on, the title of deity of the moon was passed on to his favorite daughter, Mayari, while the title of deity of the sun was passed on to his grandson and honorary son, Apolaki. One of his daughters, [[Tala (goddess)|Tala]] is the deity of the stars and is the primary deity of the constellations, while Hanan was the deity of mornings and the new age. The Tagalog cosmic beliefs is not exempted from the moon-swallowing serpent myths prevalent throughout the different ethnic peoples of the Philippines. But unlike the moon-swallowing serpent stories of other ethnic peoples, which usually portrays the serpent as a god, the Tagalog people believe that the serpent which causes eclipses is a monster dragon, called ''Laho'', instead. The dragon, despite being strong, can easily be defeated by Mayari, the reason why the moon's darkness during eclipses diminishes within minutes.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/laho-moon-eater/</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the Tagalogs also had their own indigenous names for various constellations. An example is ''Balatik'' (Western counterpart is ''Orion'') which is depicted as a hunting trap.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2019/01/22/Filipinos-astronomy-beliefs.html</ref>\n\n===Burial practices===\nThe Tagalog people had numerous burial practices prior to Spanish colonization and Catholic introduction. These practices include, but not limited to, tree burials, cremation burials, sarcophagus burials, and underground burials.<ref name=\"DPPS\">Tacio, Henrylito D. [http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2005/10/30/feat/death.practices.philippine.style.html Death Practices Philippine Style] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125125636/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2005/10/30/feat/death.practices.philippine.style.html |date=2010-01-25 }}, sunstar.com, October 30, 2005</ref><ref>http://journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/asp/article/viewFile/3961/3606</ref>\n\nIn rural areas of [[Cavite]], trees are used as burial places. The dying person chooses the tree beforehand, thus when he or she becomes terminally ill or is evidently going to die because of old age, a hut is built close to the said tree. The deceased's corpse is then entombed vertically inside the hollowed-out tree trunk. Before colonization, a statue known as ''likha'' is also entombed with the dead inside the tree trunk. In [[Pila, Laguna]], a complex cremation-burial practice existed, where the body is let alone to decompose first. It is then followed by a ritual performance. The body is burned afterwards through cremation because, according to the belief of ancient people, the \u201cspirit is as clean as though washed in gold\" once the body is set on fire. ''Likha'' statues were also found in various cremation burial sites.<ref>http://journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/asp/article/viewFile/3961/3606</ref> In [[Mulanay, Quezon]] and nearby areas, the dead are entombed inside limestone sarcophagi along with a ''likha'' statue. However, the practice vanished in the 16th century due to Spanish colonization. In [[Calatagan, Batangas]] and nearby areas, the dead are buried under the earth along with ''likha'' statues. The statues, measuring 6\u201312 inches, are personified depictions of ''anitos''. ''Likha'' statues are not limited to burial practices as they are also used in homes, prayers, agriculture, medicine, travel, and other means; when these statues are used as such, they are known as ''larauan'', which literally means image.<ref name=\"DPPS\">Tacio, Henrylito D.

The statues afterwards serve as a connection of mortals to the divine and the afterlife.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/bathala/</ref> When the Spanish arrived, they recorded these statues in some accounts. The ''Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas'' of 1582 noted that there were even houses that contained \"one hundred or two hundred of these idols\". In the name colonization, the Spanish destroyed these statues throughout the archipelago. In present-time, only two statues (made of stone) have been found in good condition. These two statues are currently housed in the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] in [[Manila]].<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/bathala/</ref>\n\n===Sacred animals, trees, and number===\nThe ancient Tagalogs believed that there are three fauna and three flora that are deemed the most sacred. The three sacred fauna include [[dog]]s which are blessed by the deities to guide and become allies with mankind, [[fairy bluebird|tigmamanukan]]s which are the messengers of Bathala, [[crocodile]]s which are guardians of sacred swamps and believed to be [[psychopomp]]s<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/beautiful-history-symbolism-philippine-tattoo-culture/</ref>, while the three sacred flora include [[coconut]] palms which are the first vegetation from the ashes of Galang Kaluluwa and Ulilang Kaluluwa, [[balete tree]]s which are home to the supernaturals, and [[bamboo]]s which is where mankind sprang from.<ref>{{harvnb|Leticia Ramos Shahani, Fe B. Mangahas, Jenny R. Llaguno|pp=27, 28, 30}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|Sonia M. Zaide, Gregorio F. Zaide|pp=69}}</ref><ref>https://sites.google.com/site/philmyths/lesson-2</ref> The number three is believed to be sacred in ancient Tagalog beliefs. When Bathala and Ulilang Kaluluwa battled during the cosmic creation, the war lasted for three days and three nights. Additionally, Bathala had three divine daughters (Mayari, Tala, and Hanan) from a mortal women, and there are three divine abodes, namely, ''Maca'', ''Kasamaan'', and ''Kaluwalhatian''. Also, there were three divine beings during the cosmic creation, Bathala, Ulilang Kaluluwa, and Galang Kaluluwa. Later on, when Galang Kaluluwa and Ulilang Kaluluwa died, Aman Sinaya and Amihan joined Bathala in the trinity of deities. In later stories, Aman Sinaya chose to dwell underneath the ocean while Amihan chose to travel throughout the middleworld. During that time, the trinity of deities became Bathala, Lakapati, and Meylupa. Meylupa was later replaced by Sitan after Meylupa chose to live as a hermit. In the most recent trinity, after Bathala died (or went into a deep slumber according to other sources), the trinity consisted of Mayari, Apolaki, and Sitan.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/bathala/</ref>\n\nA 2018 archaeological research found that Tagalog [[dog]]s were indeed held in high regard prior to colonization and were treated as equals, backing the oral knowledge stating that dogs are beings blessed by the deities. Dogs were buried, ''never'' as sacrificial offerings or when a master dies, but always \"''individually''\", having their own right to proper burial practices. A burial site in Santa Ana, Manila exhibited a dog which was first buried, and after a few years, the dog's human child companion who died was buried above the dog's burial, exemplifying the human prestige given to dogs in ancient Tagalog beliefs.<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinakillgrove/2018/02/26/archaeologists-find-deformed-dog-buried-near-ancient-child-in-the-philippines/#4b89765d3897</ref><ref>https://filipiknow.net/prehistoric-animals-in-the-philippines/</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{main|Indigenous religious beliefs of the Tagalog people}}\nThe Tagalog people initially had their own unique religion, modernly known as Tagalismo as the original name of the religion is unknown and was not documented by the Spanish. Spanish accounts also call the Tagalog religion as ''Anitismo'' (or [[Religion in the Philippines#Anitism|Anitism]] in English) and Anitheria, the former is accepted by Tagalog scholars and present-day Anitist adherents while the later is seen as a derogatory term. The practices of Tagalismo were usually done within a [[dambana]]. When the Spanish arrived, Roman Catholicism was forcefully inputted by the colonizers who tried to destroy all other religions they deemed as 'lesser' than European religions. At the present, the majority of Tagalogs belong to the Roman Catholic Church, while a relatively smaller amount belong to various Protestant sects or nationalized Christian Churches. A small number of Tagalogs, however, have managed to revert to Tagalismo/Anitismo. Some Tagalogs also adhere to Islam, although their number is extremely small and fragmented.\n\n===Anitism/Tagalismo===\n{{see also|Deities of Philippine mythology|Dambana}}\nThe pre-colonial religion of the Tagalog people was a Syncretic form of indigenous Tagalog belief systems, [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. The religion revolved around the community through the katalonan and the [[dambana]], known also as ''lambana'' in the Old Tagalog language.<ref name=\"tribhanga\">[http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html tribhanga] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115234226/http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html |date=January 15, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"asj.upd.edu.ph\">http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-01-01-1963/Francisco%20Buddhist.pdf</ref><ref>Prehispanic Source Materials: for the study of Philippine History\" (Published by New Day Publishers, Copyright 1984) Written by William Henry Scott, Page 68.</ref>  The ancient [[Batangas|Batangue\u00f1os]] were influenced by [[India]] as shown in the origin of most languages from Sanskrit and certain ancient potteries. A Buddhist image was reproduced in mould on a clay medallion in bas-relief from the municipality of Calatagan. According to experts, the image in the pot strongly resembles the iconographic portrayal of [[Buddha]] in [[Siam]], India, and [[Nepal]]. The pot shows [[Buddha|Buddha Amithaba]] in the [[tribhanga]]<ref name=\"tribhanga\"/> pose inside an oval nimbus. Scholars also noted that there is a strong [[Mahayana|Mahayanic]] orientation in the image, since the Boddhisattva [[Avalokitesvara]] was also depicted.<ref name=\"asj.upd.edu.ph\"/> The [[Lokesvara]]  bronze statue of Lokesvara was found in Isla Puting Bato in [[Tondo, Manila]].<ref>http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-15-1977/francisco-indian-prespanish-philippines.pdf</ref>\n\nThe shamanistic mix of polytheism and animism, collectively called ''Tagalismo'' (Tagalog religion) or ''Anitism'' (Anito religion). Prior to Spanish arrival and Catholic seeding, the ancient Tagalog people used to cover the following: present-day [[Calabarzon]] region except the Polillo Islands, northern Quezon, Alabat island, the Bondoc Peninsula, and easternmost Quezon; [[Marinduque]]; [[Bulacan]] except for its eastern part; and southwest [[Nueva Ecija]], as much of Nueva Ecija used to be a vast rainforest where numerous nomadic ethnic groups stayed and left. When the polities of Tondo and Maynila fell due to the Spanish, the Tagalog-majority areas grew through Tagalog migrations in portions of Central Luzon and north Mimaropa as a Tagalog migration policy was implemented by Spain. This was continued by the Americans when they defeated Spain in a war. There have been attempts to restore the Tagalog indigenous religion as the religion for the Tagalog people.\n\nThe territories where the ancient Tagalog pantheon was worshiped were the areas that were under Tagalog-majority influence prior to the biggest expansion of [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]]. During that time, Hindu influences in customs and traditions were present due to trade with other Asian independent or vassal states. The first part as shown below are the residents of ''Kaluwalhatian'' (the abode of the gods, roughly corresponding to the [[Heaven in Christianity|Christian idea of Heaven]]). The term, ''[[anito]]'', has three meanings. The first is deity (gods and goddesses) including Bathala and the lower deities living and not living in Kaluwalhatian. The second is non-ancestral spirits, the beings sent by Bathala along with the deities to aid mankind in everyday life. These non-ancestral spirit anitos can be formless or possess forms of various beings. The last is ancestral spirits, the souls of human beings who have passed on. These ancestral spirit anitos can also be summoned by Bathala to aid their relatives and descendants in special cases, usually through dreams or flickers of light. Aside from the anitos, there are also beings lower than them. These beings are diverse in forms and are considered as monsters (example is the [[aswang]]) and/or guardians (example is the [[tikbalang]]) that roam the world along with mankind. These beings usually reside within the confines of nature, but when disturbed, can inflicts severe damages to man and even cause death. Tagalogs who had spiritual prowess to contact the deities and anitos were known as ''katolanon''. The ''katolanon'', being the spiritual leader and personified contact to the deities, also assumed the role of the ''datu'' if the ''datu'' has not yet returned from his travels. He also acts as the ''datu'' during transition periods, where the official ''datu'' (leader) has yet to be chosen. Like the ''datu'', the ''katolanon'' may be male or female. Katolanon may choose to have a wife or husband as partner with his or her spiritual activities, regardless of gender. The ''katolanon'', male or female, usually has a female gender expression, according to Spanish accounts. The reason for this is because a female expression is the embodiment of natural spiritual balance, and is pleasing to the Tagalog deities. In times when certain barangays choose to establish a unification pact with other barangays, the datus of each barangay will vote among themselves who will be considered as the ''lakan'' (also known as ''punong datu''), which is regarded as the head of all the datus within the pact. To establish the pact, a ''[[sandugo]]'' or blood compact is made. The katolanan of the datu, that was made into lakan, is also uplifted into the title of ''punong katolanan'' (head katolanan). The most known unification of barangays in pre-colonial Tagalog history are the unification of Tondo barangays (those at the northern edge of the Pasig river), the unification of Manila barangays (those at the southern edge of the Pasig river), the unification of Namayan barangays (those upstream of the Pasig), the unification of Kumintang barangays (those west of Batangas), and the unification of Pangil barangays (those east and south of Laguna de Bay). The first two barangay unification were most likely triggered by conflicts between the two Tagalog sides of the river, while the Namayan unification was most likely triggered by economic means as all trade between the barangays around Laguna de Bay and barangays at Manila Bay need to pass through Namayan via the Pasig river. The unification of Kumintang barangays was probably due to economic ties as traders from East Asia flocked the area, while the unification of Pangil barangays was said to be due to a certain Gat Pangilwhil{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} unified the barangays under his lakanship. Present-day Tondo is the southern section of Manila's Tondo district, while present-day Maynila is Manila's Intramuros district. Present-day Namayan is Manila's Santa Ana district. Present-day Pangil is the eastern and southern shores of Laguna and a small portion of northern Quezon province. Present-day Kumintang is the areas of western Batangas. The Kumintang barangays are sometimes referred as the 'homeland' of the Tagalog people, however, it is contested by the Tagalogs of Manila.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|Sonia M. Zaide, Gregorio F. Zaide|pp=69}}</ref>\n\n[[Dambana]] practices are performed through various means such as thanksgiving, wish prayers, or even memorializing an event. All deities, beings sent by Bathala, and [[Pitru Paksha|ancestral spirits]] are collectively called ''anito''. The deity who is most invoked in ''dambana'' practices is [[Bathala]], the supreme god of the Tagalog people who controls non-deity anitos and the [[tigmamanukan]] omens.

Unlike ''Kasanaan'', which is a 'village of grief and affliction', ''Maca'' is peaceful and filled with the joyous bounties good ancestral spirits deserve in the afterlife.

These include [[Maria Makiling|Makiling]], anito of Mount Makiling, and other community-based anitos. Ancestral spirits are also referred as anitos. These ancestral spirit anitos can be called upon by his or her descendants, relatives, friends, or stern followers in aid of a task. However, the approval of Bathala is needed first so that the ancestral spirit may be allowed to leave ''Maca'' and aid a person through dreams or apparitions. Popular ancestral spirits that are called upon are ''[[katalonan]]s'', ''[[datu]]s'', ''[[lakan]]s'', expert craftsmen, and brave warriors who have passed away and are believed to have journeyed to ''Maca'' successfully.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/bathala/</ref><ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/ancient-tagalog-deities-in-philippine-mythology/</ref>\n\nThe highest beings in Anitism are always the primordial deities, which is led by [[Bathala]].

Other sacred sites also include Tagalog places of death (ancient cemeteries), and temples (usually in the form of forts or enlarged huts with palisades). Usually, these sites are areas where a deities frequent, and thus serve as both a place of worship and a place for recharging the body and a person's amulet, known as anting-anting. The sites are also usually home to certain anitos or the ancestral spirits and spirits sent by Bathala to aid mankind. The following are traditionally considered as the most sacred, and still are, among the sites:\n\n*Lake Taal and Volcano\n*Mount Cristobal \u2013 sacred as a place for evil spirits, which should also be respected\n*Mount Banahaw \u2013 sacred as a place for good spirits, the helpers of Bathala\n*Mount Makiling \u2013 sacred as a place for good spirits, notably the anito, Makiling\n*Southern Sierra Madre \u2013 sacred as it is 'near the sky', and thus near to Kaluwalhatian\n*[[Laguna de Bay]] \u2013 the main commercial lake of the Tagalog people\n*[[Pasig River]] \u2013 the pathway of the ancient Tagalogs from freshwater into sea\n*[[Mount Arayat]] \u2013 a mountain in northeast Pampanga, which is also sacred to the Kapampangan people\n*Marinduque \u2013 the mountains of Marinduque and the Bathala caves\n*Ancient ruins \u2013 such as the Kamhantik ruins in Quezon, Angono petroglyphs in Rizal, and the Santa Ana ruins in Manila\n*Various cave sites \u2013 as caves are considered as 'home' to some anitos\n\n===Roman Catholicism===\n[[File:Feast of Black Nazarene, Quiapo, Manila.JPG|thumb|right|The Feast of the Black Nazarene in [[Quiapo, Manila]], which is held at every 9th of January.]]\n[[Roman Catholicism]] first arrived in Tagalog areas in the Philippines during the 16th century when the Spanish toppled the polities of Tondo and Maynila in the Pasig River. They later on imposed the European religion, and tried to replace the shamanistic belief systems of the natives. By the 18th century, majority of Tagalogs have adhered to Roman Catholicism, however, the shamanistic beliefs and other indigenous belief systems of Tagalogs were passed down secretly by the natives to the younger generations, effectively preserving their beliefs of creatures and supernatural crafts. In present time, the majority of Tagalogs continue to adhere to Roman Catholicism. The biggest Catholic procession in the Philippines is currently the ''[[Black Nazarene|Pista ng Itim na Nazareno]]'' (Feast of the Black Nazarene), which is dominantly Tagalog in nature.\n\nFor Tagalog Catholics, sacred sites include cathedrals, basilicas, churches, chapels, and cemeteries. However, due to the belief systems passed down from Tagalismo, certain mountains are also valued as sacred sites, such as [[Mount Makiling]] and [[Mount Banahaw]].\n\n==Language and writing system==\n===Indigenous===\n{{main|Tagalog language|Baybayin}}\n{{see also|Old Tagalog}}\n[[File:Baybayin alpha.jpg|thumb|[[Baybayin]], the traditional [[suyat]] script of the Tagalog people.]]\n[[File:Baybayinicon.png|thumb|right|180px|An example of a Baybayin character, ''Ka'', was used in one of the flags of Katipunan and is currently seen in some government logos.]]\nThe language of the Tagalog people evolved from [[Old Tagalog]] to [[Tagalog language|Modern Tagalog]]. Modern Tagalog has five distinct dialects:\n* The Northern Tagalog (Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Zambales, and Bataan) has words in-putted into it from the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] languages.\n* Southern Tagalog ([[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]] and Quezon) is unique as it necessitate the use of Tagalog without the combination of the English languages.\n* In contrast, Central Tagalog (Manila, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal except Tanay) is predominantly a mixture of Tagalog and English. \n* The Tagalog of [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]] maintains usage of the most native words despite influx from other cultures; it is the only highly preserved Tagalog dialect in mainland Luzon and is the most endangered Tagalog dialect.\n* Lastly, the Marinduque Tagalog dialect is known as the purest of all Tagalog dialects, as the dialect has little influence from past colonizers.\n\nThe writing [[suyat]] script of the indigenous Tagalogs is the [[Baybayin]]. Only few people today know how to read and write in Baybayin. Due to this, the ancient writing script of the Tagalog has been regarded as nearly extinct. A bill in [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] has been filed to make Baybayin the country's national script, however, it is still pending in the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]]. Nowadays, the Baybayin is artistically expressed in [[calligraphy]], as it has been traditionally.\n\nThe Tagalog people are also known for their [[tanaga]], an indigenous artistic poetic form of the Tagalog people's [[idioms]], feelings, teachings, and ways of life. The tanaga strictly has four lines only, each having seven syllables only.\n\n===Colonial===\nThe Tagalog people were skilled Spanish speakers from the 18th to 19th centuries due to the Spanish colonial occupation era. When the Americans arrived, English became the most important language in the 20th century. At present-time, the language of the Tagalogs are Tagalog, English, and a mix of the two, known in Tagalog pop culture as [[Taglish]]. Some Spanish words are still used by the Tagalog, though sentence construction in Spanish is no longer used.\n\nThe Spanish introduced the Roman alphabet as the writing script of the Philippines in the 16th century after destroying countless documents with Baybayin [[suyat]] writings. Eventually, the Roman alphabet replaced Baybayin after the Spanish colonial government imposed sanctions, usually by force, to all natives who continue to use the native Tagalog script.\n\n==Heritage towns and cities==\nThe predominantly Tagalog provinces of the Philippines possess the most heritage towns and cities in the entire country, notably due to their proximity with the capital, [[Manila]], which is also dominated by the Tagalog people. Numerous heritage structures in the following towns and cities attract tourists annually, the most famous of which are Manila, Taal, and Malolos. At present, the Tagalog people's regions are home to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] of [[San Agustin Church (Manila)|San Agustin Church]] in [[Manila]] and the [[ASEAN Heritage Park]] of [[Mount Makiling]] in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Divine Shepherdess Shrine in Gapan, Nueva Ecija.jpg|City of [[Gapan]], Nueva Ecija\nFile:Sanisidro35halljf.JPG|[[San Isidro, Nueva Ecija]]\nFile:Assissijf.JPG|[[Pe\u00f1aranda, Nueva Ecija]]\nFile:072jffOld_Provincial_Capitol_Cabanatuan_Cityfvf_03.jpg|[[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija\nFile:BalangaCathedraljf2894 07.JPG|[[Balanga, Bataan]]\nFile:Morongchurchjf7242 04.JPG|[[Morong, Bataan]]\nFile:ParishChurchofSt.CatherineofSienajf3477 04.JPG|[[Samal, Bataan]]\nFile:Barasoain Church in Malolos City.JPG|[[Malolos]], Bulacan\nFile:07029jfBaliuag, Bulacan Town Hall Municipal Office Buildingsfvf 40.jpg|[[Baliuag, Bulacan]]\nFile:Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim 2016.jpg|[[Bocaue, Bulacan]]\nFile:JC_Bulakan_23.jpg|[[Bulakan]], Bulacan\nFile:9637Hagonoy Roads Church School Park Landmarks Bulacan 26.jpg|[[Hagonoy, Bulacan]]\nFile:Obandochurch33jf.JPG|[[Obando, Bulacan]]\nFile:FvfSanIldefonso7970_19.JPG|[[San Ildefonso, Bulacan]]\nFile:San mIguel c.JPG|[[San Miguel, Bulacan]]\nFile:San_Rafael,_Bulacanjf4845_01.JPG|[[San Rafael, Bulacan]]\nFile:Immaculate Concepcion Parish Malabon.JPG|[[Malabon]]\nFile:UP Diliman Oblation Plaza in 2011.JPG|[[Quezon City]]\nFile:04762jfNational Museum of the Philippines Ermita Manilafvf 07.jpg|[[Manila]]\nFile:TaoistTemplejf4950 09.JPG|[[Caloocan]]\nFile:Front Facade of Lara House, Las Pi\u00f1as.jpg|Las Pi\u00f1as\nFile:OurLadyoftheAbandonedParishjf9827 03.JPG|[[Marikina]]\nFile:Antipolo Cathedral facade 2014.JPG|[[Antipolo]], Rizal\nFile:Tanay,_Rizal_Municipal_Hall.jpg|[[Tanay, Rizal]]\nFile:Baras Church facade.JPG|[[Baras, Rizal]]\nFile:Cainta, Rizal jf4100 09.jpg|[[Cainta]]\nFile:Rizal Shrine Outdoor (Calamba, Laguna).jpg|[[Calamba, Laguna]]\nFile:Church of Liliw, Facade.jpg|[[Liliw]], Laguna\nFile:Tanghalang Maria Makiling Los Banos.JPG|[[Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna]]\nFile:Lagunajf4360 18.JPG|[[Lumban, Laguna]]\nFile:Santa Maria Magdalena Church.jpg|[[Magdalena, Laguna]]\nFile:Saint_Gregory_the_Great_Parish_Church.jpg|[[Majayjay]], Laguna\nFile:UNDERGROUND CEMETERY,,,LAGUNA.jpg|[[Nagcarlan, Laguna]]\nFile:Facade of Paete Church, Laguna.jpg|[[Paete]], Laguna\nFile:Arch of Pagsanjan.jpg|[[Pagsanjan]], Laguna\nFile:The Pakil Church or the San Pedro de Alcantara Church in Pakil, Laguna.jpg|[[Pakil, Laguna]]\nFile:IJVPangilChurch1.jpg|[[Pangil]], Laguna\nFile:Pila church.jpg|[[Pila, Laguna]]\nFile:SantaCruzMunicipalHaljf9559 04.JPG|[[Santa Cruz, Laguna]]\nFile:Gov.

Various Tagalog societies were also established in Calatagan, Tayabas, shores of Lake Laguna, Marinduque, and Malolos.

From ''Aventures d'un Gentilhomme Breton aux iles Philippines'' by Paul de la Gironiere, published in 1855.]]\n[[File:A Manila Man (c. 1900, Philippines).jpg|thumb|200px|A working-class Tagalog man, c. 1900]]\n[[File:A Manila Girl (c. 1900, Philippines).jpg|thumb|200px|A Tagalog woman in traditional dress, c. 1900]]\nMajority of Tagalogs before colonization wore garments woven by the locals, much of which showed sophisticated designs and techniques. The [[Boxer Codex]] also illuminates the intricate and high standard in Tagalog clothing, especially among the gold-draped high society. High society members, which include the datu and the katolonan, also wore accessories made of prized materials. Slaves on the other hand wore simple clothing, seldom loincloths.\n\nDuring later centuries, Tagalog nobles would wear the ''barong tagalog'' for men and the ''baro't saya'' for women. When the Philippines became independent, the barong Tagalog became popularised as the national costume of the country, as the wearers were the majority in the new capital, Manila.\n\n===Craftsmanship===\nThe Tagalog people were also craftsmen. The katolanan, specifically, of each barangay is tasked as the holder of arts and culture, and usually trains craftfolks if ever no craftfolks are living in the barangay. If the barangay has a craftsfolk, the present crafts-folks would teach their crafts to gifted students. Notable crafts made by ancient Tagalogs are boats, fans, agricultural materials, livestock instruments, spears, arrows, shields, accessories, jewelries, clothing, houses, paddles, fish gears, mortar and pestles, food utensils, musical instruments, bamboo and metal wears for inscribing messages, clay wears, toys, and many others.\n\n===Belief on the soul and ''pangangaluluwa''===\nThe Tagalog people traditionally believe in the two forms of the soul. The first is known as the ''kakambal'' (literally means twin), which is the soul of the living. Every time a person sleeps, the ''kakambal'' may travel to many mundane and supernatural places which sometimes leads to nightmares if a terrible event is encountered while the ''kakambal'' is travelling. When a person dies, the ''kakambal'' is ultimately transformed into the second form of the Tagalog soul, which is the ''kaluluwa'' (literally means spirit). In traditional Tagalog religion, the ''kaluluwa'' then travels to either ''Kasanaan'' (if the person was evil when he was living) or ''Maca'' (if the person was good when he was living) through sacred tomb-equipped psychopomp creatures known as ''buwaya''<ref name=\"aswangproject.com\">https://www.aswangproject.com/philippines-monster-islands/</ref><ref name=\"aswangproject.com\"/> or through divine intervention. Both domains are ruled by [[Bathala]], though Kasanaan is also ruled by the deity of souls.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\">https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/</ref>\n\nIn addition to the belief in the ''kaluluwa'', a tradition called ''pangangaluluwa'' sprang. The ''pangangaluluwa'' is a traditional Tagalog way of aiding ancestor spirits to arrive well in ''Maca'' (place where good spirits go) or to make ancestor spirits that may have been sent to ''Kasanaan''/''Kasamaan'' (place where bad spirits go) be given a chance to be cleansed and go to ''Maca''. The tradition includes the peoples (which represent the ''kaluluwa'' of people who have passed on), and their oral tradition conducted through a recitation or song. The people also ask for alms from townsfolk, where the alms are offered to the ''kaluluwa'' afterwards. This tradition, now absorbed even in the Christian beliefs of Tagalogs, is modernly-held between October 27 to November 1, although it may be held on any day of the year if need be during the old days. The traditional ''pangangaluluwa'' song's composition is:<ref name=\"tagaloglang.com\">https://www.tagaloglang.com/pangangaluluwa/</ref><ref name=\"newsinfo.inquirer.net\">http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/647988/pangangaluluwa-reviving-a-dying-custom</ref> ''Kaluluwa\u2019y dumaratal'' (The second souls are arriving); ''Sa tapat ng durungawan'' (In front of the window); ''Kampanilya\u2019y tinatantang'' (The bells are ringing); ''Ginigising ang may buhay'' (Waking up those who still have life); ''Kung kami po\u2019y lilimusan'' (If we are to be asked to give alms); ''Dali-daliin po lamang'' (Make it faster); ''Baka kami\u2019y mapagsarhan'' (We may be shut); ''Ng Pinto ng Kalangitan'' (From the doors of heaven).<ref name=\"tagaloglang.com\"/> The ''Kalangitan'' in the lyrics would have been ''Maca'' during the classical era.<ref name=\"tagaloglang.com\"/><ref name=\"newsinfo.inquirer.net\"/>\n\nAdditional lyrics are present in some localities. An example is the additional 4 lines from Nueva Ecija:<ref name=\"tagaloglang.com\"/><ref name=\"newsinfo.inquirer.net\"/> ''Bukas po ng umaga'' (Tomorrow morning); ''Tayong lahat ay magsisimba'' (We will go to the shrine); ''Doon natin makikita'' (There, we will see); ''Ang misa ng kaluluwa!'' (The mass of the second souls!)<ref name=\"tagaloglang.com\"/>\n\n===Belief on dreams===\nThe Tagalog people traditionally believe that when a person sleeps, he may or may not dream the omens of [[Bathala]]. The omens are either hazy illusions within a dream, the appearance of an omen creature such as [[tigmamanukan]], or sightings from the future. The dream omens do not leave traces on what a person must do to prevent or let the dream come true as it is up to the person to make the proper actions to prevent or make the dream come true. The omen dreams are only warnings and possibilities 'drafted by Bathala'.\n\nAdditionally, a person may sometimes encounter nightmares in dreams. There are two reasons why nightmares occur, the first is when the ''kakambal'' soul encounters a terrifying event while travelling from the body, or when a ''[[Batibat|bangungot]]'' creature sits on top of the sleeping person in a bid of vengeance due to the cutting of her tree home. Majority of the nightmares are said to be due to the ''kakambal'' soul encountering terrifying events while travelling.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/><ref>https://vanwinkles.com/11-mythical-sleep-creatures-from-around-the-world</ref>\n\n===Belief on the cosmos===\nAncient Tagalogs initially believed that the first deity of the sun and moon was [[Bathala]], as he is a primordial deity and the deity of everything. Later on, the title of deity of the moon was passed on to his favorite daughter, Mayari, while the title of deity of the sun was passed on to his grandson and honorary son, Apolaki. One of his daughters, [[Tala (goddess)|Tala]] is the deity of the stars and is the primary deity of the constellations, while Hanan was the deity of mornings and the new age. The Tagalog cosmic beliefs is not exempted from the moon-swallowing serpent myths prevalent throughout the different ethnic peoples of the Philippines. But unlike the moon-swallowing serpent stories of other ethnic peoples, which usually portrays the serpent as a god, the Tagalog people believe that the serpent which causes eclipses is a monster dragon, called ''Laho'', instead. The dragon, despite being strong, can easily be defeated by Mayari, the reason why the moon's darkness during eclipses diminishes within minutes.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/laho-moon-eater/</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the Tagalogs also had their own indigenous names for various constellations. An example is ''Balatik'' (Western counterpart is ''Orion'') which is depicted as a hunting trap.<ref>http://cnnphilippines.com/life/culture/2019/01/22/Filipinos-astronomy-beliefs.html</ref>\n\n===Burial practices===\nThe Tagalog people had numerous burial practices prior to Spanish colonization and Catholic introduction. These practices include, but not limited to, tree burials, cremation burials, sarcophagus burials, and underground burials.<ref name=\"DPPS\">Tacio, Henrylito D. [http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2005/10/30/feat/death.practices.philippine.style.html Death Practices Philippine Style] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125125636/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/dav/2005/10/30/feat/death.practices.philippine.style.html |date=2010-01-25 }}, sunstar.com, October 30, 2005</ref><ref>http://journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/asp/article/viewFile/3961/3606</ref>\n\nIn rural areas of [[Cavite]], trees are used as burial places. The dying person chooses the tree beforehand, thus when he or she becomes terminally ill or is evidently going to die because of old age, a hut is built close to the said tree. The deceased's corpse is then entombed vertically inside the hollowed-out tree trunk. Before colonization, a statue known as ''likha'' is also entombed with the dead inside the tree trunk. In [[Pila, Laguna]], a complex cremation-burial practice existed, where the body is let alone to decompose first. It is then followed by a ritual performance. The body is burned afterwards through cremation because, according to the belief of ancient people, the \u201cspirit is as clean as though washed in gold\" once the body is set on fire. ''Likha'' statues were also found in various cremation burial sites.<ref>http://journals.upd.edu.ph/index.php/asp/article/viewFile/3961/3606</ref> In [[Mulanay, Quezon]] and nearby areas, the dead are entombed inside limestone sarcophagi along with a ''likha'' statue. However, the practice vanished in the 16th century due to Spanish colonization. In [[Calatagan, Batangas]] and nearby areas, the dead are buried under the earth along with ''likha'' statues. The statues, measuring 6\u201312 inches, are personified depictions of ''anitos''. ''Likha'' statues are not limited to burial practices as they are also used in homes, prayers, agriculture, medicine, travel, and other means; when these statues are used as such, they are known as ''larauan'', which literally means image.<ref name=\"DPPS\">Tacio, Henrylito D.

The statues afterwards serve as a connection of mortals to the divine and the afterlife.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/bathala/</ref> When the Spanish arrived, they recorded these statues in some accounts. The ''Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas'' of 1582 noted that there were even houses that contained \"one hundred or two hundred of these idols\". In the name colonization, the Spanish destroyed these statues throughout the archipelago. In present-time, only two statues (made of stone) have been found in good condition. These two statues are currently housed in the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] in [[Manila]].<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/bathala/</ref>\n\n===Sacred animals, trees, and number===\nThe ancient Tagalogs believed that there are three fauna and three flora that are deemed the most sacred. The three sacred fauna include [[dog]]s which are blessed by the deities to guide and become allies with mankind, [[fairy bluebird|tigmamanukan]]s which are the messengers of Bathala, [[crocodile]]s which are guardians of sacred swamps and believed to be [[psychopomp]]s<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/beautiful-history-symbolism-philippine-tattoo-culture/</ref>, while the three sacred flora include [[coconut]] palms which are the first vegetation from the ashes of Galang Kaluluwa and Ulilang Kaluluwa, [[balete tree]]s which are home to the supernaturals, and [[bamboo]]s which is where mankind sprang from.<ref>{{harvnb|Leticia Ramos Shahani, Fe B. Mangahas, Jenny R. Llaguno|pp=27, 28, 30}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|Sonia M. Zaide, Gregorio F. Zaide|pp=69}}</ref><ref>https://sites.google.com/site/philmyths/lesson-2</ref> The number three is believed to be sacred in ancient Tagalog beliefs. When Bathala and Ulilang Kaluluwa battled during the cosmic creation, the war lasted for three days and three nights. Additionally, Bathala had three divine daughters (Mayari, Tala, and Hanan) from a mortal women, and there are three divine abodes, namely, ''Maca'', ''Kasamaan'', and ''Kaluwalhatian''. Also, there were three divine beings during the cosmic creation, Bathala, Ulilang Kaluluwa, and Galang Kaluluwa. Later on, when Galang Kaluluwa and Ulilang Kaluluwa died, Aman Sinaya and Amihan joined Bathala in the trinity of deities. In later stories, Aman Sinaya chose to dwell underneath the ocean while Amihan chose to travel throughout the middleworld. During that time, the trinity of deities became Bathala, Lakapati, and Meylupa. Meylupa was later replaced by Sitan after Meylupa chose to live as a hermit. In the most recent trinity, after Bathala died (or went into a deep slumber according to other sources), the trinity consisted of Mayari, Apolaki, and Sitan.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/bathala/</ref>\n\nA 2018 archaeological research found that Tagalog [[dog]]s were indeed held in high regard prior to colonization and were treated as equals, backing the oral knowledge stating that dogs are beings blessed by the deities. Dogs were buried, ''never'' as sacrificial offerings or when a master dies, but always \"''individually''\", having their own right to proper burial practices. A burial site in Santa Ana, Manila exhibited a dog which was first buried, and after a few years, the dog's human child companion who died was buried above the dog's burial, exemplifying the human prestige given to dogs in ancient Tagalog beliefs.<ref>https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinakillgrove/2018/02/26/archaeologists-find-deformed-dog-buried-near-ancient-child-in-the-philippines/#4b89765d3897</ref><ref>https://filipiknow.net/prehistoric-animals-in-the-philippines/</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{main|Indigenous religious beliefs of the Tagalog people}}\nThe Tagalog people initially had their own unique religion, modernly known as Tagalismo as the original name of the religion is unknown and was not documented by the Spanish. Spanish accounts also call the Tagalog religion as ''Anitismo'' (or [[Religion in the Philippines#Anitism|Anitism]] in English) and Anitheria, the former is accepted by Tagalog scholars and present-day Anitist adherents while the later is seen as a derogatory term. The practices of Tagalismo were usually done within a [[dambana]]. When the Spanish arrived, Roman Catholicism was forcefully inputted by the colonizers who tried to destroy all other religions they deemed as 'lesser' than European religions. At the present, the majority of Tagalogs belong to the Roman Catholic Church, while a relatively smaller amount belong to various Protestant sects or nationalized Christian Churches. A small number of Tagalogs, however, have managed to revert to Tagalismo/Anitismo. Some Tagalogs also adhere to Islam, although their number is extremely small and fragmented.\n\n===Anitism/Tagalismo===\n{{see also|Deities of Philippine mythology|Dambana}}\nThe pre-colonial religion of the Tagalog people was a Syncretic form of indigenous Tagalog belief systems, [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. The religion revolved around the community through the katalonan and the [[dambana]], known also as ''lambana'' in the Old Tagalog language.<ref name=\"tribhanga\">[http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html tribhanga] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115234226/http://yet.typepad.com/round_dice/2006/02/tribhanga_strik.html |date=January 15, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"asj.upd.edu.ph\">http://asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-01-01-1963/Francisco%20Buddhist.pdf</ref><ref>Prehispanic Source Materials: for the study of Philippine History\" (Published by New Day Publishers, Copyright 1984) Written by William Henry Scott, Page 68.</ref>  The ancient [[Batangas|Batangue\u00f1os]] were influenced by [[India]] as shown in the origin of most languages from Sanskrit and certain ancient potteries.

The pot shows [[Buddha|Buddha Amithaba]] in the [[tribhanga]]<ref name=\"tribhanga\"/> pose inside an oval nimbus. Scholars also noted that there is a strong [[Mahayana|Mahayanic]] orientation in the image, since the Boddhisattva [[Avalokitesvara]] was also depicted.<ref name=\"asj.upd.edu.ph\"/> The [[Lokesvara]]  bronze statue of Lokesvara was found in Isla Puting Bato in [[Tondo, Manila]].<ref>http://www.asj.upd.edu.ph/mediabox/archive/ASJ-15-1977/francisco-indian-prespanish-philippines.pdf</ref>\n\nThe shamanistic mix of polytheism and animism, collectively called ''Tagalismo'' (Tagalog religion) or ''Anitism'' (Anito religion). Prior to Spanish arrival and Catholic seeding, the ancient Tagalog people used to cover the following: present-day [[Calabarzon]] region except the Polillo Islands, northern Quezon, Alabat island, the Bondoc Peninsula, and easternmost Quezon; [[Marinduque]]; [[Bulacan]] except for its eastern part; and southwest [[Nueva Ecija]], as much of Nueva Ecija used to be a vast rainforest where numerous nomadic ethnic groups stayed and left. When the polities of Tondo and Maynila fell due to the Spanish, the Tagalog-majority areas grew through Tagalog migrations in portions of Central Luzon and north Mimaropa as a Tagalog migration policy was implemented by Spain. This was continued by the Americans when they defeated Spain in a war. There have been attempts to restore the Tagalog indigenous religion as the religion for the Tagalog people.\n\nThe territories where the ancient Tagalog pantheon was worshiped were the areas that were under Tagalog-majority influence prior to the biggest expansion of [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]]. During that time, Hindu influences in customs and traditions were present due to trade with other Asian independent or vassal states. The first part as shown below are the residents of ''Kaluwalhatian'' (the abode of the gods, roughly corresponding to the [[Heaven in Christianity|Christian idea of Heaven]]). The term, ''[[anito]]'', has three meanings. The first is deity (gods and goddesses) including Bathala and the lower deities living and not living in Kaluwalhatian. The second is non-ancestral spirits, the beings sent by Bathala along with the deities to aid mankind in everyday life. These non-ancestral spirit anitos can be formless or possess forms of various beings. The last is ancestral spirits, the souls of human beings who have passed on. These ancestral spirit anitos can also be summoned by Bathala to aid their relatives and descendants in special cases, usually through dreams or flickers of light. Aside from the anitos, there are also beings lower than them. These beings are diverse in forms and are considered as monsters (example is the [[aswang]]) and/or guardians (example is the [[tikbalang]]) that roam the world along with mankind. These beings usually reside within the confines of nature, but when disturbed, can inflicts severe damages to man and even cause death. Tagalogs who had spiritual prowess to contact the deities and anitos were known as ''katolanon''. The ''katolanon'', being the spiritual leader and personified contact to the deities, also assumed the role of the ''datu'' if the ''datu'' has not yet returned from his travels. He also acts as the ''datu'' during transition periods, where the official ''datu'' (leader) has yet to be chosen. Like the ''datu'', the ''katolanon'' may be male or female. Katolanon may choose to have a wife or husband as partner with his or her spiritual activities, regardless of gender. The ''katolanon'', male or female, usually has a female gender expression, according to Spanish accounts. The reason for this is because a female expression is the embodiment of natural spiritual balance, and is pleasing to the Tagalog deities. In times when certain barangays choose to establish a unification pact with other barangays, the datus of each barangay will vote among themselves who will be considered as the ''lakan'' (also known as ''punong datu''), which is regarded as the head of all the datus within the pact. To establish the pact, a ''[[sandugo]]'' or blood compact is made. The katolanan of the datu, that was made into lakan, is also uplifted into the title of ''punong katolanan'' (head katolanan). The most known unification of barangays in pre-colonial Tagalog history are the unification of Tondo barangays (those at the northern edge of the Pasig river), the unification of Manila barangays (those at the southern edge of the Pasig river), the unification of Namayan barangays (those upstream of the Pasig), the unification of Kumintang barangays (those west of Batangas), and the unification of Pangil barangays (those east and south of Laguna de Bay). The first two barangay unification were most likely triggered by conflicts between the two Tagalog sides of the river, while the Namayan unification was most likely triggered by economic means as all trade between the barangays around Laguna de Bay and barangays at Manila Bay need to pass through Namayan via the Pasig river. The unification of Kumintang barangays was probably due to economic ties as traders from East Asia flocked the area, while the unification of Pangil barangays was said to be due to a certain Gat Pangilwhil{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} unified the barangays under his lakanship. Present-day Tondo is the southern section of Manila's Tondo district, while present-day Maynila is Manila's Intramuros district. Present-day Namayan is Manila's Santa Ana district. Present-day Pangil is the eastern and southern shores of Laguna and a small portion of northern Quezon province. Present-day Kumintang is the areas of western Batangas. The Kumintang barangays are sometimes referred as the 'homeland' of the Tagalog people, however, it is contested by the Tagalogs of Manila.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|Sonia M.

All deities, beings sent by Bathala, and [[Pitru Paksha|ancestral spirits]] are collectively called ''anito''. The deity who is most invoked in ''dambana'' practices is [[Bathala]], the supreme god of the Tagalog people who controls non-deity anitos and the [[tigmamanukan]] omens.

Unlike ''Kasanaan'', which is a 'village of grief and affliction', ''Maca'' is peaceful and filled with the joyous bounties good ancestral spirits deserve in the afterlife. ''Maca'' is ruled jointly by [[Bathala]], who has the prowess to summon and order spirits from ''Maca'' (and ''Kasamaan'') if he pleases, and Sitan while ''Kasamaan'' is ruled solely by a deity named Sitan, keeper of all souls and master of four evil deities, namely, Manggagaway, causer of diseases, Manisilat, destroyer of families, Mangkukulam, causer of fires, and Hukluban, causer of deaths.<ref>Thelma B.

Mangahas, Jenny R. Llaguno, pp. 27, 28</ref><ref>Sonia M. Zaide, Gregorio F. Zaide, pp. 69</ref>\n\nAnitos sent by Bathala to aid mankind, aside from the deities, are also called as anitos. These include [[Maria Makiling|Makiling]], anito of Mount Makiling, and other community-based anitos. Ancestral spirits are also referred as anitos. These ancestral spirit anitos can be called upon by his or her descendants, relatives, friends, or stern followers in aid of a task. However, the approval of Bathala is needed first so that the ancestral spirit may be allowed to leave ''Maca'' and aid a person through dreams or apparitions. Popular ancestral spirits that are called upon are ''[[katalonan]]s'', ''[[datu]]s'', ''[[lakan]]s'', expert craftsmen, and brave warriors who have passed away and are believed to have journeyed to ''Maca'' successfully.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/bathala/</ref><ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/ancient-tagalog-deities-in-philippine-mythology/</ref>\n\nThe highest beings in Anitism are always the primordial deities, which is led by [[Bathala]]. Of these five primordial deities, only Bathala, Amihan, and Aman Sinaya are living deities. The other two, Ulilang Kaluluwa and Galang Kaluluwa, have turned into ashes during the first centuries of the cosmic creation. The next in rank are the deity anitos, whether they live in ''Kaluwalhatian'', ''Kasamaan'', or in the middle world.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=gUt5v8ET4QYC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=likha+statue#v=onepage&q=likha%20statue&f=false | title=Philippine History| isbn=9789712339349| last1=Halili| first1=M.c| year=2004}}</ref> The third in rank are the anitos sent by Bathala to aid mankind.

Other sacred sites also include Tagalog places of death (ancient cemeteries), and temples (usually in the form of forts or enlarged huts with palisades). Usually, these sites are areas where a deities frequent, and thus serve as both a place of worship and a place for recharging the body and a person's amulet, known as anting-anting. The sites are also usually home to certain anitos or the ancestral spirits and spirits sent by Bathala to aid mankind. The following are traditionally considered as the most sacred, and still are, among the sites:\n\n*Lake Taal and Volcano\n*Mount Cristobal \u2013 sacred as a place for evil spirits, which should also be respected\n*Mount Banahaw \u2013 sacred as a place for good spirits, the helpers of Bathala\n*Mount Makiling \u2013 sacred as a place for good spirits, notably the anito, Makiling\n*Southern Sierra Madre \u2013 sacred as it is 'near the sky', and thus near to Kaluwalhatian\n*[[Laguna de Bay]] \u2013 the main commercial lake of the Tagalog people\n*[[Pasig River]] \u2013 the pathway of the ancient Tagalogs from freshwater into sea\n*[[Mount Arayat]] \u2013 a mountain in northeast Pampanga, which is also sacred to the Kapampangan people\n*Marinduque \u2013 the mountains of Marinduque and the Bathala caves\n*Ancient ruins \u2013 such as the Kamhantik ruins in Quezon, Angono petroglyphs in Rizal, and the Santa Ana ruins in Manila\n*Various cave sites \u2013 as caves are considered as 'home' to some anitos\n\n===Roman Catholicism===\n[[File:Feast of Black Nazarene, Quiapo, Manila.JPG|thumb|right|The Feast of the Black Nazarene in [[Quiapo, Manila]], which is held at every 9th of January.]]\n[[Roman Catholicism]] first arrived in Tagalog areas in the Philippines during the 16th century when the Spanish toppled the polities of Tondo and Maynila in the Pasig River. They later on imposed the European religion, and tried to replace the shamanistic belief systems of the natives. By the 18th century, majority of Tagalogs have adhered to Roman Catholicism, however, the shamanistic beliefs and other indigenous belief systems of Tagalogs were passed down secretly by the natives to the younger generations, effectively preserving their beliefs of creatures and supernatural crafts. In present time, the majority of Tagalogs continue to adhere to Roman Catholicism. The biggest Catholic procession in the Philippines is currently the ''[[Black Nazarene|Pista ng Itim na Nazareno]]'' (Feast of the Black Nazarene), which is dominantly Tagalog in nature.\n\nFor Tagalog Catholics, sacred sites include cathedrals, basilicas, churches, chapels, and cemeteries. However, due to the belief systems passed down from Tagalismo, certain mountains are also valued as sacred sites, such as [[Mount Makiling]] and [[Mount Banahaw]].\n\n==Language and writing system==\n===Indigenous===\n{{main|Tagalog language|Baybayin}}\n{{see also|Old Tagalog}}\n[[File:Baybayin alpha.jpg|thumb|[[Baybayin]], the traditional [[suyat]] script of the Tagalog people.]]\n[[File:Baybayinicon.png|thumb|right|180px|An example of a Baybayin character, ''Ka'', was used in one of the flags of Katipunan and is currently seen in some government logos.]]\nThe language of the Tagalog people evolved from [[Old Tagalog]] to [[Tagalog language|Modern Tagalog]]. Modern Tagalog has five distinct dialects:\n* The Northern Tagalog (Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Zambales, and Bataan) has words in-putted into it from the [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] and [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] languages.\n* Southern Tagalog ([[Batangas Tagalog|Batangas]] and Quezon) is unique as it necessitate the use of Tagalog without the combination of the English languages.\n* In contrast, Central Tagalog (Manila, Cavite, Laguna, and Rizal except Tanay) is predominantly a mixture of Tagalog and English. \n* The Tagalog of [[Tanay, Rizal|Tanay]] maintains usage of the most native words despite influx from other cultures; it is the only highly preserved Tagalog dialect in mainland Luzon and is the most endangered Tagalog dialect.\n* Lastly, the Marinduque Tagalog dialect is known as the purest of all Tagalog dialects, as the dialect has little influence from past colonizers.\n\nThe writing [[suyat]] script of the indigenous Tagalogs is the [[Baybayin]]. Only few people today know how to read and write in Baybayin. Due to this, the ancient writing script of the Tagalog has been regarded as nearly extinct. A bill in [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] has been filed to make Baybayin the country's national script, however, it is still pending in the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]]. Nowadays, the Baybayin is artistically expressed in [[calligraphy]], as it has been traditionally.\n\nThe Tagalog people are also known for their [[tanaga]], an indigenous artistic poetic form of the Tagalog people's [[idioms]], feelings, teachings, and ways of life. The tanaga strictly has four lines only, each having seven syllables only.\n\n===Colonial===\nThe Tagalog people were skilled Spanish speakers from the 18th to 19th centuries due to the Spanish colonial occupation era. When the Americans arrived, English became the most important language in the 20th century. At present-time, the language of the Tagalogs are Tagalog, English, and a mix of the two, known in Tagalog pop culture as [[Taglish]]. Some Spanish words are still used by the Tagalog, though sentence construction in Spanish is no longer used.\n\nThe Spanish introduced the Roman alphabet as the writing script of the Philippines in the 16th century after destroying countless documents with Baybayin [[suyat]] writings. Eventually, the Roman alphabet replaced Baybayin after the Spanish colonial government imposed sanctions, usually by force, to all natives who continue to use the native Tagalog script.\n\n==Heritage towns and cities==\nThe predominantly Tagalog provinces of the Philippines possess the most heritage towns and cities in the entire country, notably due to their proximity with the capital, [[Manila]], which is also dominated by the Tagalog people.

Historical sites in the Rathfarnham [[townland]]s include: Scholarstown, [[Kilmashogue]], [[Mount Venus]], [[Tibradden]] and [[Taylors Grange]].\n\n==Features==\nRathfarnham is home to several notable historic buildings, including [[Rathfarnham Castle]] and [[Loreto Abbey]], four parks: [[Marlay Park]], [[Dodder Park]], [[Saint Enda's Park|St Enda's]] and [[Bushy Park, Dublin|Bushy Park]], and several pubs including [[Rathfarnham#The Eden|The Eden]], [[Rathfarnham#Buglers|Buglers]], [[Rathfarnham#Revels|Revels]] and the landmark Yellow House. [[Padraig Pearse]] established [[St Enda's School]] for Boys, which is now a museum in his honour situated in [[Saint Enda's Park]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history of Rathfarnham===\nThe name Rathfarnham (''Fearnain's [[Ringfort]]'') suggests an earlier habitation but no remains of [[Pre-historic|prehistoric]] fortifications, burial places, early churches or old records have been found.\n\n===From Norman times===\nThe written history of Rathfarnham begins after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Terenurr and Kimmage (Cheming), both described as being in Rathfranham (sic) parish Dublin, are mentioned in an 1175 grant by Henry II to Walter the goldsmith ('Aurifaber') held at Canterbury Cathedral Archives.<ref>Grant CCA-DCc-ChAnt/C/1206 nd [MayxNov 1175]</ref>\n\nIn [[1199 in Ireland|1199]] these lands were granted to [[Milo le Bret]]. In 1199 he adapted an existing ridge to build a [[motte and bailey]] fort at what is now the start of the Braemor Road. It was apparently still in evidence up to the early 20th century.\n\nIn the following century no events of great importance are recorded as Rathfarnham, perhaps as it was protected on its south side by the ''[[Royal Forest]] of [[Glencree]]''. Rathfarnham became more exposed to attack when this deer park was overrun by the [[Clan]] [[O'Toole (family)|O'Toole]] from the [[Wicklow Mountains]] in the 14th century. [[Rathfarnham Castle]] was erected in part to protect the area from such attacks. [[Image:Rathfarnham Castle.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Rathfarnham Castle]]In addition, part of [[the Pale]]'s defences ran through the townland of Rathfarnham. Some traces of this are still extant.\n\n===From the 16th century===\nThe castle and much of the land around Rathfarnham belonged to the Eustace family of [[Baltinglass]]. However, their property was confiscated for their part in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]] of [[1579 in Ireland|1579]]-[[1583 in Ireland|83]]. The castle and its lands were then granted to the Loftus family.\n\nIn the 1640s, the Loftus family was at the centre of the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] arising out of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. In [[1649 in Ireland|1649]], the castle was seized by the Earl of Ormonde's Catholic and Royalist forces before the [[battle of Rathmines]]. However they were granted it back by the English parliamentarians after their victory in that battle. Reputedly, [[Oliver Cromwell]] stayed in Rathfarnham Castle on his way south to the [[Siege of Wexford]].\n\nEconomic activity in Rathfarnham was stepped up in the 17th century and in the early 18th century many gentlemen's residences were erected. Two key examples were Rathfarnham Castle and Ashfield.\n\n====Rathfarnham Castle====\n[[Rathfarnham Castle]] itself was re-modelled from a defensive stronghold into a stately home. Lower [[Dodder]] Road is still marked by a [[triumphal arch]], from this era, which originally led to the castle. [[Image:Elys Arch Rathfarnham.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Ely's Arch]] The erection of this gateway is attributed to [[Henry Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely|Henry Loftus]], [[Earl of Ely]] from [[1769 in Ireland|1769]] to [[1783 in Ireland|1783]] who was also responsible for the classical work on the castle itself. The arch is named the ''new gate'' on [[Frizell]]'s map of [[1779 in Ireland|1779]]. After the division of the estate in 1913 the arch became the entrance to the [[Castle Golf Club]] but was later abandoned in favour of the more direct ''Woodside Drive'' entrance. The area around the arch is a haven for wildlife, with the nearby [[River Dodder]] home to [[brown trout]], [[otter]] and many water-birds including [[kingfisher]], [[dipper]] and [[grey heron]]. Woodside Estate is home to [[red fox]], [[rabbits]] and [[grey squirrels]].\n\n====Ashfield====\nAshfield, the next house on the same side, was occupied during the 18th century by Protestant clergy. In the early part of the 19th century it became the home of [[Sir William Cusac Smith]], [[Baron of the Exchequer]] and from 1841 of the Tottenham family who continued in residence until 1913. After this the Brooks of Brooks Thomas Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooksgroup.ie/ |title=Brooks Thomas |publisher=Brooksgroup.ie |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> occupied it until about twenty years ago when the estate was divided up and houses built along the main road. A new road was later built along the side of the house and named Brookvale after the last occupants.\n\n===Industrial revolution===\nAn industrial revolution, especially in the production of paper, began on the [[Owendoher]] and [[Dodder]] rivers and many mills were erected. In the beginning of the 19th century most of them switched to cotton and wool and later were converted to flour mills. The introduction of steam engines marked the end of this era and replaced the need for mills. Many of the old buildings fell into disrepair and were demolished, and their millraces filled in.\n\nA millpond and extensive mill buildings formerly occupied the low-lying fields on the west side of the main Rathfarnham road, just beside the bridge. On a map by [[Frizell]] dated 1779 it is called the ''Widow Clifford's mill and mill holding'' and in 1843 it is named the ''Ely Cloth Factory''. A Mr. Murray then owned it but in 1850, it passed into the hands of Mr. Nickson who converted it into a flour mill. His family continued in occupation until 1875 when John Lennox took over. In 1880 this mill closed down, the buildings were demolished and not a trace now remains.\n\n===Historical features===\n\n====Military Road====\n''See main article:'' ''[[R115 road]]''<br />\n[[Image:Sally Gap R115-R759.JPG|thumb|225px|right| The Military Road at the Sally Gap]]\nRathfarnham is the start of the [[R115 road|Military Road]].\nThis road through the [[Wicklow Mountains]] (still in use mainly for tourist traffic) was built at the beginning of the 19th century to open up the Wicklow Mountains to the [[British Army]] to assist them in putting down the insurgents who were hiding there following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. Rathfarnham itself was the scene of some skirmishes in the early days of the Rising which extended to the final battle in \"Raheen\" (now Raheen City) in County Wexford.\n\nConstruction commenced on 12 August 1800 and was completed in October 1809. The road starts outside the Yellow House, passes the head of [[Glencree]], with a spur down that valley to [[Enniskerry]], rises to the Sally Gap and then dips down to [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]], over the hills into [[Glenmalure]], and finishes at [[Aghavannagh]]. Well known sections also include the [[Featherbed Mountain]], the section below [[Kippure|Kippure Mountain]]. The total distance was 34 Irish Miles, of which the spur to [[Enniskerry]] was 5 Irish Miles.\nThe engineer in charge was Alexander Taylor (born in 1746), who was responsible for many other roads in the country, including some \"[[Toll road|Turnpike Roads]]\", which are [[Toll road|Toll Roads]].\n\n====Rathfarnham Road====\nAccording to many writers the road to Rathfarnham follows the same route as the [[Sl\u00edghe Chualann]], the ancient highway, which in the time of [[Saint Patrick]] was used by travellers between [[Dublin]], [[Wicklow]] and [[Wexford]]. This road is believed to have crossed the [[Dodder]] at the [[Big Bridge]], now [[Pearse Bridge]], and re-crossed it again near [[Oldbawn]], an unnecessarily inconvenient route, considering that a road through [[Templeogue]] to [[Oldbawn]] would not necessitate any crossing. The first record of a bridge being built here was in [[1381 in Ireland|1381]] and in [[1652 in Ireland|1652]] it was described by [[Gerard Boate]] in his ''[[A Natural History of Ireland]]'' as a wooden bridge which 'though it be high and strong nevertheless hath several times been quite broke and carried away through the violence of sudden floods.' After three bridges had been demolished by the river, between [[1728 in Ireland|1728]] and [[1765 in Ireland|1765]], the present structure of a single stone arch was erected in the latter year. This was widened on the west side in 1953 when it was renamed in commemoration of [[Patrick Pearse|Patrick]] and [[William Pearse]].\n\nIn 1912 during the construction of a main drainage scheme to Rathfarnham, a stone causeway was uncovered {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} below the road level. It was {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and built of great blocks crossing the course of the river. Cut into the surface of the stone were a number of deep parallel grooves, as from the action of wheeled traffic over a long period. This was evidence for the existence here of a busy thoroughfare even before the construction of the earliest bridge.\n\n====The old graveyard====\nNext to Ashfield is the old graveyard containing the ruins of a church that was dedicated to [[Saint]]s [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]. This was a medieval church used for [[Protestant]] worship until [[1795 in Ireland|1795]] when it was found to be too small for the congregation and a new one was erected a short way off. The end walls of the old church still stand, the west gable containing a bell turret and the east pierced by a chancel arch, the chancel itself having disappeared. The north wall is gone and all that remains of the south wall is an arched opening.\n\nNear the entrance to the burial ground is the grave of ''Captain James Kelly'', an old [[Fenian]] who was associated with the [[Fenian Rising]] of [[1867 in Ireland|1867]]. He was organiser for the Rathfarnham district and was known in the area as '''The Knight of Glendoo'''. On one occasion when he was on the run he was hiding in the cellar of his business premises in [[Wicklow Street]] when police raided it. An employee named James Fitzpatrick who strongly resembled Capt. Kelly in appearance was arrested in error and was tried and sentenced to six months imprisonment, which he served without betraying his identity. Capt. Kelly died on 8 March 1915, aged 70.\n\nOn the opposite side of the road is [[Crannagh]] Park and Road, [[Rathfarnham Park]] and [[Ballytore]] Road, all built on part of the old Rathfarnham Estate. In the garden of a house formerly named ''Tower Court'' in Crannagh Road is an ancient circular pigeon house, a relic of [[Lord Ely]]'s occupation of Rathfarnham Castle. The entrance to this curious structure is by a low door on level with the ground and the inside is lined from floor to roof with holes for the pigeons. A later floor was inserted half way up, so as to make two rooms, and a second door broken through the wall at that level.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Rathfarnham Village====\nIn the castle grounds were several fish ponds which were supplied by a mill race taken from the stream which rises up at [[Kilmashogue]] and flows down through [[Marlay Park|Grange Golf Links]] and [[Saint Enda's Park]]. This served several mills before entering the fish ponds, whence it ran through the golf links while a smaller branch was conducted under the road to the flour mills which stood at the corner of Butterfield Lane, on the site later occupied by Borgward Hansa Motors Ltd.\nDescribed in 1836 as Sweetman's Flour Mills, it frequently changed hands before closing down in 1887. It was later operated as a saw mill. The dry mill race can still be seen here on the north side of Butterfield Avenue.\n[[File:Post Card brings van to your door (6363321657).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street, Rathfarnham, c. 1905]]\nRathfarnham [[Protestant]] [[Parish]] [[Church (building)|Church]] on the Main St was built in 1795 to replace the church in the old graveyard. Beside the church is the old school house that dates from early in the nineteenth century.\nImmediately adjoining is Church Lane at the corner of which is a bank built on the site of a [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] barracks that was burned down by [[Anti-Treaty IRA]] forces in September 1922 during the [[Irish Civil War]]. In the lane is an old blocked up doorway of an early eighteenth century type. Church Lane leads to Woodview cottages, which are built partly on the site of an old paper mill. The mill race previously mentioned passed under Butterfield Lane to the paper mill and continued on below Ashfield to turn the wheel of the Ely Cloth Factory. It was later turned into the Owen Doher River at Woodview Cottages. Until recently,{{when?|date=January 2020}} when the new road was made to Templeogue, the old mill race could still be traced through the grounds of Ashfield where its dry bed was still spanned by several stone bridges.\n\nThe paper mill, of which some old walls and brick arches still survive, has been described as the oldest in Ireland but there does not appear to be any evidence to support this. The earliest reference to a paper mill here is [[1719 in Ireland|1719]] when William Lake of Rathfarnham presented a petition for financial aid but we hear of one at Milltown as far back as [[1694 in Ireland|1694]]. In [[1751 in Ireland|1751]] William and Thomas Slater whose works were destroyed by fire in [[1775 in Ireland|1775]] made paper here. Archer's survey of [[1801 in Ireland|1801]] mentions two paper mills here, Freemans and Teelings, and both Dalton in [[1836 in Ireland|1836]] and Lewis in [[1837 in Ireland|1837]] state that one paper mill was still working and from 1836 to 1839 the name Henry Hayes, Rathfarnham Mill appears in the directories. If this can be identified with the mill at Woodview cottages it must have become idle soon afterwards as it is designated \"Old Mill\" on the 1843 edition of the O.S. map. In 1854 when this mill had neither water wheel nor machinery an attempt was made to re-open it for the manufacture of paper but it came to nothing. The mill race has now been completely removed to make way for a housing development.\n\nAt the end of the main street, on the right, the road to Lower Rathfarnham passes the site of the earliest Constabulary barracks. This closed down in 1890 when the establishment was transferred to a house named Leighton Lodge near Loreto Abbey.\n\n====Rathfarnham Lower====\nThe [[Catholic]] Church of the [[Annunciation]] was erected in 1878 to replace the old chapel in Willbrook Road. Outside the church door is a primitive type of font on a pedestal bearing the inscription ''FONT USED IN MASS HOUSE OF PENAL TIMES IN PARISH OF RATHFARNHAM FROM [[1732 in Ireland|1732]]''. The appearance of this font would suggest that it was originally a stone [[bullaun]] dating back to a period much earlier than the penal times.\n\nOn the opposite corner is the well-known Yellow House, a licensed premises built near the site of an inn of the same name which is marked on [[Alexander Taylor (engineer)|Taylor]]'s map of [[1816 in Ireland|1816]]. (The Catholic Church of the Annunciation (see above) is on the site of the original Yellow House). A tradition has been recorded by Mr. Hammond that in [[1798 in Ireland|1798]] a Michael Eades, who sheltered wanted men in his house, owned it. It was also frequented by the soldiers of the Rathfarnham Guard whose careless talk was carefully noted by the [[United Irishmen]] hiding on the premises. In [[1804 in Ireland|1804]] when the truth came to be known, the same military wrecked the place. Following Wilbrook road down between the Yellow House and the Annunciation, a large set of wrought iron gates can be observed. These gates, which now act as the pedestrian entrance to the Beaufort Downs housing estate, were originally the entrance to the Beaufort estate of the 18th century.\n\n====Nutgrove Avenue====\nA short distance past the church is Nutgrove Avenue, widened and extended during the 1960s to link up with [[Churchtown, Dublin|Churchtown]]. The old quiet tree shaded avenue has been completely swept away, along with the ''narrow lanes'' a cramped passage bounded on both sides by towering walls and full of right angled bends, which wended its crooked course between Loreto Convent cemetery and the garden of Nutgrove House. A massive gateway stood at the entrance to this avenue until about 1911, which bore the inscription ''Nutgrove School Established [[1802 in Ireland|1802]]''. In 1839 the school was under the supervision of Mr. Philip Jones, who continued to hold the post of principal until 1866 when the position was held by Mrs. Anne Jones. In 1876 the school closed down and the house was occupied as a private residence by various tenants becoming the parish council headquarters. The new avenue was laid through the former school grounds and the house, shorn of its ornamental gardens, stood with its front against the footpath. At some time the house had been disfigured with a rather unsightly concrete porch and the old brickwork covered with cement plaster, concealing the fact that this was a very interesting eighteenth century building containing a fine stairs and coved ceilings with good plaster decoration. Unfortunately the house fell into very bad repair and eventually was demolished. [[Weston St John Joyce|Joyce]] in his ''Neighbourhood of Dublin'' states that this house was at one time the [[dower house]] of [[Rathfarnham Castle]] but in this he is almost certainly mistaken, as [[Frizell]]'s map of 1779 shows that it was outside the estate. It is possible that he confused it with the other old house on the opposite side of the avenue which was formerly named [[Ely Cottage]], later altered to [[Ely Lodge]], and which was shown to be within the boundary of the estate. This house was in very bad repair but has recently{{when?|date=January 2020}} been restored in a very tasteful manner.{{says who?|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Loreto Abbey====\nLoreto Abbey in Lower Rathfarnham form a landmark visible for a number of miles south of the city.{{fact|date=January 2020}} It served as the headquarters of the [[Sisters of Loreto|Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n[[Image:Rathfarnham House, Loretto Abbey.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Rathfarnham House]]\nThe mansion which now forms the centrepiece of the group was built by Mr. [[William Palliser]] about [[1725 in Ireland|1725]]. No expense was spared in its construction and decoration, and its interior includes polished mahogany and, in one room, embossed [[leather wallpaper]]. William Palliser died in [[1768 in Ireland|1768]] without issue and [[Rathfarnham House]] passed to his cousin the Rev. John Palliser, who was rector of the parish.\n[[File:George Grierson, of Rathfarnham House by Gilbert Stuart (American, 1755-1828).jpg|thumb|left|150px|George Grierson ([[Gilbert Stuart]])]]\nAfter his death in [[1795 in Ireland|1795]] the house was purchased by [[George Grierson (printer)|George Grierson]], the [[Queen's Printer|King's Printer]] in Ireland, who resided here for a few years. When Grierson moved to his new abode in Woodtown in 1800 the house remained unoccupied until [[1821 in Ireland|1821]], when it was purchased by the Most Rev. Dr Murray for the newly founded Loreto Order.\n\nThe foundress Rev. [[Frances Mary Teresa Ball|Mother Mary Teresa Ball]] made a number of improvements to the place.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\nShe is said to have added a storey to the old house although there is no evidence from the exterior to support this. Many additions have been made over the years, the church was built in 1840, the novitiate in 1863 and six years later St Joseph's wing which contains the concert hall and refectory. St Anthony's wing was erected in 1896, St Francis Xavier's in 1903 and the Lisieux building in 1932 for the accommodation of visiting prelates to the [[Eucharistic Congress]]. In the 1920s, novice Agnes Bojaxhiu (later to become [[Mother Teresa]]) came to Loreto Abbey to learn [[English language|English]]. This was the language the Sisters of Loreto used to teach school children in [[India]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Clucas|first= Joan Graff|year=1988|title= Mother Teresa|url=https://archive.org/details/motherteresa0000cluc|url-access=registration|publisher= New York.

This house was occupied by Robert Hodgens J.P. (1793\u20131860) and then by his sons, John Conlan Hodgens and Henry Hodgens.<ref>Lewis's Topographical Dictionary, 1837</ref>  On the grounds is Loreto High School Beaufort which was founded in 1925.\n\n====The Ponds====\nLoreto Terrace on the north side of the Abbey was formerly known as '''The Ponds''', a name originating apparently from the large pond which two hundred years ago occupied the low lying field between Loreto Terrace and Nutgrove Avenue. This area was described in Weston St John Joyce's ''The Neighbourhood of Dublin'' in 1912 as \"the dilapidated locality known as the Ponds\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/Neighbourhood/chapter12.html |title=The Neighbourhood of Dublin, chapter 12 |publisher=Chaptersofdublin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> but it has since been largely rebuilt. An old photograph from Larry O'Connor's collection shows what it looked like at that time. The last of the old houses was demolished in the mid-1980s. It was a very early 18th century gabled residence named [[Grove Cottage]].\n\nThis place was the scene of a skirmish at the outbreak of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rising of 1798]]. The insurgents of the south county assembled at the Ponds on 24 May 1798 under the leadership of David Keely, James Byrne, Edward Keogh and Ledwich. The latter two had been members of Lord Ely's yeomanry but had taken to the field with the [[United Irishmen]]. The insurgents were attacked by the local [[yeomanry]] corps but were able to defend themselves and the yeomanry was forced to retreat. A party of regular troops was then sent against them and a stiff encounter took place. A number of the insurgents were killed or wounded and some prisoners taken including Keogh and Ledwich. The survivors retreated, joining up with a party from [[Clondalkin]], and a further engagement took place at the turnpike on the [[Rathcoole, Dublin|Rathcoole]] road where the enemy was successfully repulsed.\n\n====Grange Road to Harold's Grange and Taylors Grange====\nThe road to [[Harold's Grange]] continues southward from [[Loreto Abbey]]. The first is [[Snugborough]], which has its gable end to the road. The next is [[Washington Lodge]], its attractive 18th century facade hidden by a shrubbery. In later years new avenues have been laid out here on both sides of the road. Barton Drive, on the left, occupies the site of a house named Barton Lodge (occupied by William Conlan, a brewer in Dublin, until his death in 1829 - his daughter married into the local Hodgens family, who in the 1870s donated the lands for the Church of the Annunciation). On the other side is [[Silveracre]], once the home of [[James Henthorn Todd|Dr Henthorn Todd]], Professor of Hebrew in [[Trinity College, Dublin|T.C.D.]], who was connected by marriage to the Hudson family of the adjoining Hermitage estate. He was a well known Irish scholar and was the editor and translator of a number of Irish documents as well as the author of a life of St Patrick. He died here in 1869. About the middle of the last century the name of the house was changed to Silverton but it was later reverted to the original Silveracre. Most of the land is now built on. It was also the home in the early part of twentieth century of Surgeon Croly, who founded Baggot St Hospital.\n\n====St Enda's====\n[[Image:Pearse-Museum.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The Hermitage, site of St Enda's]]\nThe next estate on the same side is Hermitage or [[Enda of Aran|Saint Enda]]'s, the former home of [[Patrick Pearse]] and later of his sister [[Margaret Mary Pearse]]. The house, which is entirely faced with cut granite and has an imposing stone portico, was occupied in the eighteenth century by [[Edward Hudson (dentist)|Edward Hudson]], an eminent dentist. He had a passion for Irish antiquities, which he demonstrated in an unusual way by the erection of a number of romantic ruins around the estate. He built a small watch tower inside the boundary wall near the entrance gate and further along, a hermit's cave, a dolmen, a ruined abbey and beside a deep well, a tiny chamber with a stone bench and a narrow fireplace. At the corner of the road to Whitechurch the loopholed and crenulated structure known as the ''Fortification'', or ''Emmet's Fort'' was another of his creations. South of the house he built a grotto surmounted by a tall stone pillar, a [[Brehon's Chair]] and a fanciful construction consisting of two great boulders, one balanced on top of the other, which has since been demolished. Just inside the boundary wall he cut an inscription in [[Ogham]] on the two faces of a large rock. Translated they read: ''RIDENT VICINI GLEBASETS A KH A MOVENTEM EDUARDUM HUDSON''. In the pretty glen adjoining the [[Whitechurch road]] he erected a sort of temple with several small chambers and flights of steps. The estate was at that time known as the \"Fields of Oden\" and is so called on maps of the period. Within the grounds also, at the corner nearest to Whitechurch is an [[obelisk]], stated to have been erected by a former owner, [[Major Doyne]], over the grave of a horse that carried him through the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. The date however of Major Doyne's occupation does not support this. Meanwhile, P\u00e1draig Pearse wrote in An Macaomh that \"a monument in the wood, beyond the little lake, is said to mark the spot where a horse of Sarah Curran's was killed and is buried.\"<ref>http://pearsemuseum.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/An-Macaomh-Christmas-1910.compressed.pdf</ref> Unlike the constructions of [[Edward Hudson (dentist)|Edward Hudson]], which were purposely of the roughest material, this monument was of cut stone with small moulded pillars. After having been vandalized and toppled, it has since been re-erected without the pillars which were broken.\n\nEdward Hudson was succeeded by his son [[William Elliot Hudson]], who was born here in 1796. A distinguished scholar, he was a friend of [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]] and [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] and was a patron of Irish literature and art. Shortly before his death in 1857 he endowed the [[R.I.A.]] with a fund for the publication of its Irish Dictionary and he also left the Academy Library a valuable collection of books.\n\nFrom 1840 to 1858 Hermitage was the home of [[Richard Moore (Irish lawyer)|Richard Moore]], [[Attorney General]], and in 1859 it came into the possession of [[Major Richard Doyne]], stated to be a veteran of the [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. From 1872 to 1885 it was occupied by George Campbell, merchant of 58 Sackville St., and after lying vacant for a few years it was tenanted by [[Major Philip Doyne]] of the [[4th Dragoon Guards]]. In 1891 Colonel [[Frederick le Mesurier]], barrister is returned as occupier and in 1899 Mr. [[William Woodburn]].\n\n[[St Enda's School]] was founded by [[Padraig Pearse]] in 1909 and was at first housed in [[Cullenswood House]], [[Ranelagh]]. Pearse felt that the confined surroundings of this house gave no scope for the outdoor life that should play so large a part in the education of youth, so in 1910 he leased Hermitage from Mr. Woodburn and moved his college here. A long billiard room was converted into a study hall and chapel, the drawing room became a dormitory and the stables opening off an enclosed square became class rooms. In \"The Story of a Success\" Pearse tells of the realisation of one of his life's ambitions and it was from here that he set off for the city on his bicycle for the last time on Easter Sunday 1916. After the rising the college continued to function under the care of Margaret Pearse until it finally closed down in 1935. After the death of Margaret Pearse in 1968 St Enda's passed into the hands of the state and has since been opened as a public park and home of the [[Pearse Museum]].\n\n====Priory====\nDirectly opposite to St Enda's was Priory, the home of [[John Philpot Curran]], at the time of Emmet's rising. The house was formerly named Holly Park but when Curran bought it in 1790 he changed the name to Priory. He lived here for 27 years at the peak of his fame and here he was to endure the tragic events, which cast a shadow on his private life. First the untimely death of his daughter Gertrude, followed by the loss of his wife, who left him for another man, and lastly the discovery of the association of his daughter [[Sarah Curran]] with [[Robert Emmet]]. [[Gertrude Curran]] died in [[1792 in Ireland|1792]] at the age of 12 as the result of a fall from a window. Curran had her buried in the grounds of the Priory and over the grave he placed a recumbent slab, on which was fixed a metal plate bearing the inscription:\n\n:''Here lies the body of Gertrude Curran''\n:''fourth daughter of John Philpot Curran''\n:''who departed this life October 6, 1792''\n:''Age twelve years''.\n\nThe position of the grave was clearly marked on the early editions of the O.S. maps. It was about midway along the northern boundary of the corner field facing the fortification, on the north side of the boundary bank and a few yards from it. It was formerly enclosed by a grove of trees, which can be seen in J. J. Reynold's photograph of 1903 but these were cut down about 1928. Some time later the stumps were dug out and the stone slab broken up and thrown on the adjoining bank. The metal plate had already been taken by souvenir hunters. It was [[Sarah Curran]]'s desire to be buried here also but to this her father would not agree as he had come in for criticism on the previous occasion for burying his daughter in unconsecrated ground.\n\nIn this district nearly every ancient site is associated in tradition with either [[Sarah Curran]] or [[Robert Emmet]] and it is not surprising therefore to find that this burial place has been suggested as the last resting place of [[Robert Emmet]]. This tradition goes back for well over a century and it is rather surprising that this site was not investigated when the search for Emmet's remains was being made at places a great deal less accessible and no less improbable.\n\nIn October 1979 the opportunity offered itself to carry out this investigation. The Priory estate was being developed and heavy machinery moved in to lay the roads and sewers. A Mrs. Bernadette Foley of nearby ''Barton Drive'' drew attention to the need to carry out this work before the site was buried for ever under a concrete jungle. With the co-operation of Messrs Gallaghers, the developers, a small group undertook to investigate the site. First the exact location was checked on the original large scale manuscript map in the O.S., next the field was carefully chained and the site marked to within a few feet and then a narrow trench {{convert|3|ft|m}} deep was dug through where the burial should have been. The result was a complete blank. A second and a third trench were cut at intervals until a large area had been investigated without finding any burial, timber, brick or stone.\n\nThe developers then offered to investigate further with the excavator and carefully cleared an area of {{convert|20|yd|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide to a depth of {{convert|4|ft|m}} without finding any sign of disturbance. They then deepened this area by another two feet with no better result. All the accounts of the burial state that it was made in a vault and it is therefore surprising and disappointing that no evidence whatever was found and there does not seem to be any obvious explanation for it. The builders, Messrs Gallaghers Ltd. were commended for their interest in this aspect of the site and their painstaking excavation work under the supervision of Mr. Leslie Black was expertly carried out.\n\nPriory was occupied by the Curran family until 1875 and subsequently by the Taylors until 1923. At the beginning of the century the house and gardens were still in good repair but after the Taylor's time the place was neglected. Twenty years ago the walls were still standing but little now remains but some heaps of rubble.\n\n====St Columba's College====\nSt Columba's College is a privately run, Church of Ireland co-educational boarding school with c. 300 pupils. It was founded in 1843 by the then Primate of Ireland, Rev. William Sewell. In 1849 the college moved from Stackallan House in County Meath to its present site in Whitechurch, Rathfarnham.  The headmaster of the college is addressed as 'warden' and the vice-principal as 'sub-warden'.  The college school day is split up during the winter - school classes end at 13:00 and there are games and other outdoor activities after lunch from 14:00 - 15:30. Classes recommence at 16:15 and continue until 18:00.  The school week consists of five days from Monday to Saturday with Wednesday and Saturday being half-days. The college has a very high academic profile but it also focusses a considerable attention on music, drama and art.  The college caters for a wide range of academic abilities and provides an excellent special-needs service for children with mild learning deficits.  The geographical layout of the college does not accommodate or facilitate wheelchairs.\n\n==Rathfarnham today==\n\n===Amenities===\nRathfarnham has a wide range of shops and businesses, including two bank branches, notably in the ''Nutgrove Shopping Centre''. The area's other shopping centre is the small ''Rathfarnham Shopping Centre''. The area also has a Garda Station and two post offices, and is home to the city's main ''animal shelter''.\n\n[[Marlay Park]] is a large open parkland, with a craft centre near the old \"big house\"; the park hosts [[marlay park concerts|major concerts]] every year. Aside from St Enda's, [[Dodder Park]] and Bushy Park (see above), Loreto park and small green spaces, the area also hosts two golf clubs.\n\nBoth fine buildings of Loreto Abbey and Rathfarnham Castle also provide amenity value.\nThere are a number of schools.\n\nRathfarnham also has a number of pubs on offer including The Orchard and The Blue Haven.\n\n===Organisations and sport===\n[[File:Rathfarnham_5_km_run_2016.png|thumb|Rathfarnham 5&nbsp;km Run (2016)]]\nRathfarnham is home to the [[Dublin Metropolitan Scout Province|13th Dublin]], the 14th Dublin, the 31st Dublin (which was founded in 1917) and the 68th Dublin [[Scouting Ireland|Scout]] troops and the [[Rathfarnham Girl Guides]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.lycos.co.uk/rathfarnhamguides/ |title=Rathfarnham Girl Guides |publisher=Members.lycos.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> The area is also home to the [[Rathfarnham Concert Band]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcbs.ie |title=Rathfarnham Concert Band Society - Homepage |publisher=Rcbs.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>\n\nFor [[Gaelic games]], there is the [[Ballinteer St John's]] [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] Club, and also [[Ballyboden St. Enda's GAA]] which is one of the largest GAA clubs in Ireland. Rathfarnham has a number of soccer teams including Nutgrove Celtic, Rathfarnham Punters, Rathfarnham Rovers, [[Leicester Celtic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/dublin-football-clubs/leicester-celtic.htm |title=Leicester Celtic Club Information |publisher=Soccer-ireland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> Broadford Rovers and Whitechurch United.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccer-ireland.com/dublin-football-clubs/whitechurch-united.htm |title=Whitechurch United Club Information |publisher=Soccer-ireland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>\n\nRathfarnham has a number of boxing clubs, including Whitechurch Boxing Club.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Rathfarnham WSAF Athletic Club clubhouse in the old courthouse, Rathfarnham Village, won the AAI National 10K National Road Relays and National Marathon in 2012.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Falling population===\nAccording to the 2006 Census,<ref>[http://www.cso.ie/census/2006_preliminaryreport.htm Census 2006 Populations of Electoral Divisions, 2002 - 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318092616/http://www.cso.ie/census/2006_preliminaryreport.htm |date=March 18, 2007 }}</ref> Rathfarnham has a population of 17,333 \u2013 a drop of 2.1% since 2002. The population has gradually decreased over the years from 17,760 in 1996 to 17,717 in 2002.\n\nThe number of people living around the neighbourhoods of Ballyroan and St Endas fell notably by 8% and 7% respectively. On the other hand, there were minimal increases in the Butterfield and Hermitage areas.\n\nOne thing that is clear from the statistics is Rathfarnham is aging, with young couples that moved into the area in the 1960s entering retirement. There is a lack of suitable and affordable homes for young people in Rathfarnham and consequently they are flocking out to neighbouring suburbs such as [[Templeogue]], [[Tallaght]] and [[Firhouse]].\n\nOver the last four years,{{when?|date=January 2020}} there have not been many apartment block developments in the Rathfarnham area. The figures reflect this reality. Due to the fact that there aren't many suitable sites in the area for apartment building, two analysts including the Rathfarnham Community Website,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rathfarnham.com |title=Rathfarnham Community Website |publisher=Rathfarnham.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> predicted that Census 2010 would show further decreases.\n\n===Culture and entertainment===\n\n====Music====\nRathfarnham has become the focal point of the summer music festival scene in Ireland. Between May and August every year, high profile acts put on concerts for thousands of people at [[Marlay Park]]. Acts in 2007 have included [[Damien Rice]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Crowded House]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Damien Rice]], [[The Who]] and [[Peter Gabriel]]. [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[The Killers]], [[Lenny Kravitz]]/[[Alanis Morissette]] played in the park during 2008 [[Metallica]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Dizzee Rascal]] and [[Calvin Harris]] played there on August 1 and 2 in 2009. Marley Park has also hosted the Longitude Festival every July since 2013.\n\n====Film location====\nA number of films have shot some of their scenes in Rathfarnham.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1wQ8UO8CPQ |title=YouTube \u2013 Rathfarnham in the Movies |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> The opening scene in [[Intermission (film)|Intermission]] was recorded at Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. In one scene in the movie [[Ordinary Decent Criminal]], a car is blown up in front of the Pearse Museum in St Enda's Park. The Secret Scripture was filmed in Loreto Abbey, Rathfarnham in 2015.\n\n===Pubs===\n''Buglers'' pub is situated in Ballyboden House on the Ballyboden Road in [[Ballyboden]]. John Blake was the first known publican to be granted the licence in 1799.\n\nSituated on Main Street, ''The Castle Inn'' is, as its name implies, near Rathfarnham Castle. The interior is made of stone and light wood and it is one of the newer pubs in Rathfarnham.\n\n[[File:YellowHouse 4856w.jpg|thumb|225px|right| The Yellow House, Rathfarnham]]\n\n''The Eden House'' pub is situated on Grange Road near [[Marlay Park]] and is one of the highest pubs in Rathfarnham. The building was formerly ''Eden House'', one of the 18th century stately houses on Grange Road, before being converted to its present use.{{fact|date=January 2020}} The pub was then sold in 2006 for \u20ac5.5m and is now run by owners of The Morgue Pub in [[Templeogue]] Village. The pub was completely renovated by the new owners, who awaited the completion of road works on the Grange Road before opening a new beer garden.\n\n''The Old Orchard'' is on Butterfield Avenue near Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. The interior has a contemporary \"European\" styling. The 'island' bar is an unusual feature and provides service around the full 360\u00b0, earning it its local [[nickname]] of the \"\"[[British threepence coin|thripp'ny bit]]\".\n\n''The Tuning Fork'' was an old-style pub situated at the junction of Willbrook Road and Whitechurch Road near the ''Yellow House'' pub. Now demolished.\n\n''The Blue Haven'' is a meeting spot for young people and business people, situated on the junction of Ballyroan Road and Butterfield Avenue.\n\n''The Yellow House'', is at the corner of Willbrook Road and Grange Road, a short distance from Rathfarnham Castle. It is believed that the first pub bearing the name was a thatched cottage standing on the site of the present [[Catholic]] church, and that the licence went back as far as the early eighteenth century. Certainly, it was in business at the time of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. Some say it was used during the rebellion as a meeting room for the rebellion leaders. A new Yellow House was built in [[1825 in Ireland|1825]] by Mary Murphy and opened for business in 1827. The current building dates from 1885 [http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=SC&regno=11216006 NIAH]. It was extensively refurbished and extended in 1979. According to local folklore, the poet [[Francis Ledwidge]] worked there for two days as an apprentice before homesickness for his home town of [[Slane]], [[County Meath]], caused him to leave.\n\n===Eateries and restaurants===\nPlaces to eat within Rathfarnaham include fish and chip shops, Chinese takeaways and fast food chains such as [[McDonald's]] located in Nutgrove Shopping Centre. In addition most pubs in the area serve food.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Transport===\nRathfarnham is well served by the [[Dublin Bus]] network. The following Dublin Bus routes serve Rathfarnam:\n\n* 16 from [[Ballinteer]] to [[Dublin Airport]] via the city centre\n* 15B from Stocking Avenue to [[Grand Canal Dock]] via the city centre\n* 17 to [[University College Dublin|UCD]]\n* 61 to [[Eden Quay]]\n* 75 to [[Tallaght]] via [[Firhouse]], and to [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] via [[Stillorgan]] or [[Sandyford]]\n* 161 to [[Rockbrook]] from [[Dundrum, Dublin|Dundrum]] [[Luas]] station\n\nThe 16 route was the first bus route in Dublin to have free [[Internet]] [[Wi-Fi]] onboard.\n\nIn 2007, it was proposed that a [[Luas]] tram line stated in a feasibility study as Line E\nwould be routed through Rathfarnham. However, it was found that the proposal would not be feasible, due to the fact that the road network from Rathfarnham to the city centre is not wide enough to accommodate [[Luas]] trams. The roads would only be capable of accommodating trams if a significant number of front gardens of houses along the route were purchased to allow for road widening. This would have been a highly costly undertaking, so the project was not progressed any further.\n\n==People==\n\n===People born in Rathfarnham===\n*[[Damien Duff]], Irish footballer\n*[[Danielle Galligan]], Irish actress from Rathfarnham\n*[[Stephen Gwynn]] (1864\u20131950), journalist, biographer, author, poet and Nationalist politician.\n*[[Sarah Curran]], fianc\u00e9e of executed Irish patriot [[Robert Emmet]] and subject of several popular ballads including \u201cShe is Far From the Land\u201d.\n*[[Joe McKinney]], Irish stage and screen artist\n*[[John Millington Synge|J.

It is south of [[Terenure]], east of [[Templeogue]], and is in the postal districts of [[Dublin 14]] and [[Dublin 16|16]]. It is within the administrative areas of both [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]] and [[South Dublin]] County Councils.\n\n==Area==\nBeyond Rathfarnham village itself, the broad area of Rathfarnham includes [[Whitechurch, Dublin|Whitechurch]], [[Nutgrove]], [[Ballyboden]] and [[Ballyroan, County Dublin|Ballyroan]]. Historical sites in the Rathfarnham [[townland]]s include: Scholarstown, [[Kilmashogue]], [[Mount Venus]], [[Tibradden]] and [[Taylors Grange]].\n\n==Features==\nRathfarnham is home to several notable historic buildings, including [[Rathfarnham Castle]] and [[Loreto Abbey]], four parks: [[Marlay Park]], [[Dodder Park]], [[Saint Enda's Park|St Enda's]] and [[Bushy Park, Dublin|Bushy Park]], and several pubs including [[Rathfarnham#The Eden|The Eden]], [[Rathfarnham#Buglers|Buglers]], [[Rathfarnham#Revels|Revels]] and the landmark Yellow House. [[Padraig Pearse]] established [[St Enda's School]] for Boys, which is now a museum in his honour situated in [[Saint Enda's Park]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history of Rathfarnham===\nThe name Rathfarnham (''Fearnain's [[Ringfort]]'') suggests an earlier habitation but no remains of [[Pre-historic|prehistoric]] fortifications, burial places, early churches or old records have been found.\n\n===From Norman times===\nThe written history of Rathfarnham begins after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]]. Terenurr and Kimmage (Cheming), both described as being in Rathfranham (sic) parish Dublin, are mentioned in an 1175 grant by Henry II to Walter the goldsmith ('Aurifaber') held at Canterbury Cathedral Archives.<ref>Grant CCA-DCc-ChAnt/C/1206 nd [MayxNov 1175]</ref>\n\nIn [[1199 in Ireland|1199]] these lands were granted to [[Milo le Bret]]. In 1199 he adapted an existing ridge to build a [[motte and bailey]] fort at what is now the start of the Braemor Road. It was apparently still in evidence up to the early 20th century.\n\nIn the following century no events of great importance are recorded as Rathfarnham, perhaps as it was protected on its south side by the ''[[Royal Forest]] of [[Glencree]]''. Rathfarnham became more exposed to attack when this deer park was overrun by the [[Clan]] [[O'Toole (family)|O'Toole]] from the [[Wicklow Mountains]] in the 14th century. [[Rathfarnham Castle]] was erected in part to protect the area from such attacks. [[Image:Rathfarnham Castle.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Rathfarnham Castle]]In addition, part of [[the Pale]]'s defences ran through the townland of Rathfarnham. Some traces of this are still extant.\n\n===From the 16th century===\nThe castle and much of the land around Rathfarnham belonged to the Eustace family of [[Baltinglass]]. However, their property was confiscated for their part in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]] of [[1579 in Ireland|1579]]-[[1583 in Ireland|83]]. The castle and its lands were then granted to the Loftus family.\n\nIn the 1640s, the Loftus family was at the centre of the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] arising out of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. In [[1649 in Ireland|1649]], the castle was seized by the Earl of Ormonde's Catholic and Royalist forces before the [[battle of Rathmines]]. However they were granted it back by the English parliamentarians after their victory in that battle. Reputedly, [[Oliver Cromwell]] stayed in Rathfarnham Castle on his way south to the [[Siege of Wexford]].\n\nEconomic activity in Rathfarnham was stepped up in the 17th century and in the early 18th century many gentlemen's residences were erected. Two key examples were Rathfarnham Castle and Ashfield.\n\n====Rathfarnham Castle====\n[[Rathfarnham Castle]] itself was re-modelled from a defensive stronghold into a stately home. Lower [[Dodder]] Road is still marked by a [[triumphal arch]], from this era, which originally led to the castle. [[Image:Elys Arch Rathfarnham.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Ely's Arch]] The erection of this gateway is attributed to [[Henry Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely|Henry Loftus]], [[Earl of Ely]] from [[1769 in Ireland|1769]] to [[1783 in Ireland|1783]] who was also responsible for the classical work on the castle itself. The arch is named the ''new gate'' on [[Frizell]]'s map of [[1779 in Ireland|1779]]. After the division of the estate in 1913 the arch became the entrance to the [[Castle Golf Club]] but was later abandoned in favour of the more direct ''Woodside Drive'' entrance. The area around the arch is a haven for wildlife, with the nearby [[River Dodder]] home to [[brown trout]], [[otter]] and many water-birds including [[kingfisher]], [[dipper]] and [[grey heron]]. Woodside Estate is home to [[red fox]], [[rabbits]] and [[grey squirrels]].\n\n====Ashfield====\nAshfield, the next house on the same side, was occupied during the 18th century by Protestant clergy. In the early part of the 19th century it became the home of [[Sir William Cusac Smith]], [[Baron of the Exchequer]] and from 1841 of the Tottenham family who continued in residence until 1913. After this the Brooks of Brooks Thomas Ltd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooksgroup.ie/ |title=Brooks Thomas |publisher=Brooksgroup.ie |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> occupied it until about twenty years ago when the estate was divided up and houses built along the main road. A new road was later built along the side of the house and named Brookvale after the last occupants.\n\n===Industrial revolution===\nAn industrial revolution, especially in the production of paper, began on the [[Owendoher]] and [[Dodder]] rivers and many mills were erected. In the beginning of the 19th century most of them switched to cotton and wool and later were converted to flour mills. The introduction of steam engines marked the end of this era and replaced the need for mills. Many of the old buildings fell into disrepair and were demolished, and their millraces filled in.\n\nA millpond and extensive mill buildings formerly occupied the low-lying fields on the west side of the main Rathfarnham road, just beside the bridge. On a map by [[Frizell]] dated 1779 it is called the ''Widow Clifford's mill and mill holding'' and in 1843 it is named the ''Ely Cloth Factory''. A Mr. Murray then owned it but in 1850, it passed into the hands of Mr. Nickson who converted it into a flour mill. His family continued in occupation until 1875 when John Lennox took over. In 1880 this mill closed down, the buildings were demolished and not a trace now remains.\n\n===Historical features===\n\n====Military Road====\n''See main article:'' ''[[R115 road]]''<br />\n[[Image:Sally Gap R115-R759.JPG|thumb|225px|right| The Military Road at the Sally Gap]]\nRathfarnham is the start of the [[R115 road|Military Road]].\nThis road through the [[Wicklow Mountains]] (still in use mainly for tourist traffic) was built at the beginning of the 19th century to open up the Wicklow Mountains to the [[British Army]] to assist them in putting down the insurgents who were hiding there following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. Rathfarnham itself was the scene of some skirmishes in the early days of the Rising which extended to the final battle in \"Raheen\" (now Raheen City) in County Wexford.\n\nConstruction commenced on 12 August 1800 and was completed in October 1809. The road starts outside the Yellow House, passes the head of [[Glencree]], with a spur down that valley to [[Enniskerry]], rises to the Sally Gap and then dips down to [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]], over the hills into [[Glenmalure]], and finishes at [[Aghavannagh]]. Well known sections also include the [[Featherbed Mountain]], the section below [[Kippure|Kippure Mountain]]. The total distance was 34 Irish Miles, of which the spur to [[Enniskerry]] was 5 Irish Miles.\nThe engineer in charge was Alexander Taylor (born in 1746), who was responsible for many other roads in the country, including some \"[[Toll road|Turnpike Roads]]\", which are [[Toll road|Toll Roads]].\n\n====Rathfarnham Road====\nAccording to many writers the road to Rathfarnham follows the same route as the [[Sl\u00edghe Chualann]], the ancient highway, which in the time of [[Saint Patrick]] was used by travellers between [[Dublin]], [[Wicklow]] and [[Wexford]]. This road is believed to have crossed the [[Dodder]] at the [[Big Bridge]], now [[Pearse Bridge]], and re-crossed it again near [[Oldbawn]], an unnecessarily inconvenient route, considering that a road through [[Templeogue]] to [[Oldbawn]] would not necessitate any crossing. The first record of a bridge being built here was in [[1381 in Ireland|1381]] and in [[1652 in Ireland|1652]] it was described by [[Gerard Boate]] in his ''[[A Natural History of Ireland]]'' as a wooden bridge which 'though it be high and strong nevertheless hath several times been quite broke and carried away through the violence of sudden floods.' After three bridges had been demolished by the river, between [[1728 in Ireland|1728]] and [[1765 in Ireland|1765]], the present structure of a single stone arch was erected in the latter year. This was widened on the west side in 1953 when it was renamed in commemoration of [[Patrick Pearse|Patrick]] and [[William Pearse]].\n\nIn 1912 during the construction of a main drainage scheme to Rathfarnham, a stone causeway was uncovered {{convert|23|ft|m|abbr=on}} below the road level. It was {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide and built of great blocks crossing the course of the river. Cut into the surface of the stone were a number of deep parallel grooves, as from the action of wheeled traffic over a long period. This was evidence for the existence here of a busy thoroughfare even before the construction of the earliest bridge.\n\n====The old graveyard====\nNext to Ashfield is the old graveyard containing the ruins of a church that was dedicated to [[Saint]]s [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]]. This was a medieval church used for [[Protestant]] worship until [[1795 in Ireland|1795]] when it was found to be too small for the congregation and a new one was erected a short way off. The end walls of the old church still stand, the west gable containing a bell turret and the east pierced by a chancel arch, the chancel itself having disappeared. The north wall is gone and all that remains of the south wall is an arched opening.\n\nNear the entrance to the burial ground is the grave of ''Captain James Kelly'', an old [[Fenian]] who was associated with the [[Fenian Rising]] of [[1867 in Ireland|1867]]. He was organiser for the Rathfarnham district and was known in the area as '''The Knight of Glendoo'''. On one occasion when he was on the run he was hiding in the cellar of his business premises in [[Wicklow Street]] when police raided it. An employee named James Fitzpatrick who strongly resembled Capt. Kelly in appearance was arrested in error and was tried and sentenced to six months imprisonment, which he served without betraying his identity. Capt. Kelly died on 8 March 1915, aged 70.\n\nOn the opposite side of the road is [[Crannagh]] Park and Road, [[Rathfarnham Park]] and [[Ballytore]] Road, all built on part of the old Rathfarnham Estate. In the garden of a house formerly named ''Tower Court'' in Crannagh Road is an ancient circular pigeon house, a relic of [[Lord Ely]]'s occupation of Rathfarnham Castle. The entrance to this curious structure is by a low door on level with the ground and the inside is lined from floor to roof with holes for the pigeons. A later floor was inserted half way up, so as to make two rooms, and a second door broken through the wall at that level.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Rathfarnham Village====\nIn the castle grounds were several fish ponds which were supplied by a mill race taken from the stream which rises up at [[Kilmashogue]] and flows down through [[Marlay Park|Grange Golf Links]] and [[Saint Enda's Park]]. This served several mills before entering the fish ponds, whence it ran through the golf links while a smaller branch was conducted under the road to the flour mills which stood at the corner of Butterfield Lane, on the site later occupied by Borgward Hansa Motors Ltd.\nDescribed in 1836 as Sweetman's Flour Mills, it frequently changed hands before closing down in 1887. It was later operated as a saw mill. The dry mill race can still be seen here on the north side of Butterfield Avenue.\n[[File:Post Card brings van to your door (6363321657).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street, Rathfarnham, c. 1905]]\nRathfarnham [[Protestant]] [[Parish]] [[Church (building)|Church]] on the Main St was built in 1795 to replace the church in the old graveyard. Beside the church is the old school house that dates from early in the nineteenth century.\nImmediately adjoining is Church Lane at the corner of which is a bank built on the site of a [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] barracks that was burned down by [[Anti-Treaty IRA]] forces in September 1922 during the [[Irish Civil War]]. In the lane is an old blocked up doorway of an early eighteenth century type. Church Lane leads to Woodview cottages, which are built partly on the site of an old paper mill. The mill race previously mentioned passed under Butterfield Lane to the paper mill and continued on below Ashfield to turn the wheel of the Ely Cloth Factory. It was later turned into the Owen Doher River at Woodview Cottages. Until recently,{{when?|date=January 2020}} when the new road was made to Templeogue, the old mill race could still be traced through the grounds of Ashfield where its dry bed was still spanned by several stone bridges.\n\nThe paper mill, of which some old walls and brick arches still survive, has been described as the oldest in Ireland but there does not appear to be any evidence to support this. The earliest reference to a paper mill here is [[1719 in Ireland|1719]] when William Lake of Rathfarnham presented a petition for financial aid but we hear of one at Milltown as far back as [[1694 in Ireland|1694]]. In [[1751 in Ireland|1751]] William and Thomas Slater whose works were destroyed by fire in [[1775 in Ireland|1775]] made paper here. Archer's survey of [[1801 in Ireland|1801]] mentions two paper mills here, Freemans and Teelings, and both Dalton in [[1836 in Ireland|1836]] and Lewis in [[1837 in Ireland|1837]] state that one paper mill was still working and from 1836 to 1839 the name Henry Hayes, Rathfarnham Mill appears in the directories. If this can be identified with the mill at Woodview cottages it must have become idle soon afterwards as it is designated \"Old Mill\" on the 1843 edition of the O.S. map. In 1854 when this mill had neither water wheel nor machinery an attempt was made to re-open it for the manufacture of paper but it came to nothing. The mill race has now been completely removed to make way for a housing development.\n\nAt the end of the main street, on the right, the road to Lower Rathfarnham passes the site of the earliest Constabulary barracks. This closed down in 1890 when the establishment was transferred to a house named Leighton Lodge near Loreto Abbey.\n\n====Rathfarnham Lower====\nThe [[Catholic]] Church of the [[Annunciation]] was erected in 1878 to replace the old chapel in Willbrook Road. Outside the church door is a primitive type of font on a pedestal bearing the inscription ''FONT USED IN MASS HOUSE OF PENAL TIMES IN PARISH OF RATHFARNHAM FROM [[1732 in Ireland|1732]]''. The appearance of this font would suggest that it was originally a stone [[bullaun]] dating back to a period much earlier than the penal times.\n\nOn the opposite corner is the well-known Yellow House, a licensed premises built near the site of an inn of the same name which is marked on [[Alexander Taylor (engineer)|Taylor]]'s map of [[1816 in Ireland|1816]]. (The Catholic Church of the Annunciation (see above) is on the site of the original Yellow House). A tradition has been recorded by Mr. Hammond that in [[1798 in Ireland|1798]] a Michael Eades, who sheltered wanted men in his house, owned it. It was also frequented by the soldiers of the Rathfarnham Guard whose careless talk was carefully noted by the [[United Irishmen]] hiding on the premises. In [[1804 in Ireland|1804]] when the truth came to be known, the same military wrecked the place. Following Wilbrook road down between the Yellow House and the Annunciation, a large set of wrought iron gates can be observed. These gates, which now act as the pedestrian entrance to the Beaufort Downs housing estate, were originally the entrance to the Beaufort estate of the 18th century.\n\n====Nutgrove Avenue====\nA short distance past the church is Nutgrove Avenue, widened and extended during the 1960s to link up with [[Churchtown, Dublin|Churchtown]]. The old quiet tree shaded avenue has been completely swept away, along with the ''narrow lanes'' a cramped passage bounded on both sides by towering walls and full of right angled bends, which wended its crooked course between Loreto Convent cemetery and the garden of Nutgrove House. A massive gateway stood at the entrance to this avenue until about 1911, which bore the inscription ''Nutgrove School Established [[1802 in Ireland|1802]]''. In 1839 the school was under the supervision of Mr. Philip Jones, who continued to hold the post of principal until 1866 when the position was held by Mrs. Anne Jones. In 1876 the school closed down and the house was occupied as a private residence by various tenants becoming the parish council headquarters. The new avenue was laid through the former school grounds and the house, shorn of its ornamental gardens, stood with its front against the footpath. At some time the house had been disfigured with a rather unsightly concrete porch and the old brickwork covered with cement plaster, concealing the fact that this was a very interesting eighteenth century building containing a fine stairs and coved ceilings with good plaster decoration. Unfortunately the house fell into very bad repair and eventually was demolished. [[Weston St John Joyce|Joyce]] in his ''Neighbourhood of Dublin'' states that this house was at one time the [[dower house]] of [[Rathfarnham Castle]] but in this he is almost certainly mistaken, as [[Frizell]]'s map of 1779 shows that it was outside the estate. It is possible that he confused it with the other old house on the opposite side of the avenue which was formerly named [[Ely Cottage]], later altered to [[Ely Lodge]], and which was shown to be within the boundary of the estate. This house was in very bad repair but has recently{{when?|date=January 2020}} been restored in a very tasteful manner.{{says who?|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Loreto Abbey====\nLoreto Abbey in Lower Rathfarnham form a landmark visible for a number of miles south of the city.{{fact|date=January 2020}} It served as the headquarters of the [[Sisters of Loreto|Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].\n[[Image:Rathfarnham House, Loretto Abbey.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Rathfarnham House]]\nThe mansion which now forms the centrepiece of the group was built by Mr. [[William Palliser]] about [[1725 in Ireland|1725]]. No expense was spared in its construction and decoration, and its interior includes polished mahogany and, in one room, embossed [[leather wallpaper]]. William Palliser died in [[1768 in Ireland|1768]] without issue and [[Rathfarnham House]] passed to his cousin the Rev. John Palliser, who was rector of the parish.\n[[File:George Grierson, of Rathfarnham House by Gilbert Stuart (American, 1755-1828).jpg|thumb|left|150px|George Grierson ([[Gilbert Stuart]])]]\nAfter his death in [[1795 in Ireland|1795]] the house was purchased by [[George Grierson (printer)|George Grierson]], the [[Queen's Printer|King's Printer]] in Ireland, who resided here for a few years. When Grierson moved to his new abode in Woodtown in 1800 the house remained unoccupied until [[1821 in Ireland|1821]], when it was purchased by the Most Rev. Dr Murray for the newly founded Loreto Order.\n\nThe foundress Rev. [[Frances Mary Teresa Ball|Mother Mary Teresa Ball]] made a number of improvements to the place.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\nShe is said to have added a storey to the old house although there is no evidence from the exterior to support this. Many additions have been made over the years, the church was built in 1840, the novitiate in 1863 and six years later St Joseph's wing which contains the concert hall and refectory. St Anthony's wing was erected in 1896, St Francis Xavier's in 1903 and the Lisieux building in 1932 for the accommodation of visiting prelates to the [[Eucharistic Congress]]. In the 1920s, novice Agnes Bojaxhiu (later to become [[Mother Teresa]]) came to Loreto Abbey to learn [[English language|English]]. This was the language the Sisters of Loreto used to teach school children in [[India]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Clucas|first= Joan Graff|year=1988|title= Mother Teresa|url=https://archive.org/details/motherteresa0000cluc|url-access=registration|publisher= New York.

This house was occupied by Robert Hodgens J.P. (1793\u20131860) and then by his sons, John Conlan Hodgens and Henry Hodgens.<ref>Lewis's Topographical Dictionary, 1837</ref>  On the grounds is Loreto High School Beaufort which was founded in 1925.\n\n====The Ponds====\nLoreto Terrace on the north side of the Abbey was formerly known as '''The Ponds''', a name originating apparently from the large pond which two hundred years ago occupied the low lying field between Loreto Terrace and Nutgrove Avenue. This area was described in Weston St John Joyce's ''The Neighbourhood of Dublin'' in 1912 as \"the dilapidated locality known as the Ponds\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaptersofdublin.com/books/Neighbourhood/chapter12.html |title=The Neighbourhood of Dublin, chapter 12 |publisher=Chaptersofdublin.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> but it has since been largely rebuilt. An old photograph from Larry O'Connor's collection shows what it looked like at that time. The last of the old houses was demolished in the mid-1980s. It was a very early 18th century gabled residence named [[Grove Cottage]].\n\nThis place was the scene of a skirmish at the outbreak of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rising of 1798]]. The insurgents of the south county assembled at the Ponds on 24 May 1798 under the leadership of David Keely, James Byrne, Edward Keogh and Ledwich. The latter two had been members of Lord Ely's yeomanry but had taken to the field with the [[United Irishmen]]. The insurgents were attacked by the local [[yeomanry]] corps but were able to defend themselves and the yeomanry was forced to retreat. A party of regular troops was then sent against them and a stiff encounter took place. A number of the insurgents were killed or wounded and some prisoners taken including Keogh and Ledwich. The survivors retreated, joining up with a party from [[Clondalkin]], and a further engagement took place at the turnpike on the [[Rathcoole, Dublin|Rathcoole]] road where the enemy was successfully repulsed.\n\n====Grange Road to Harold's Grange and Taylors Grange====\nThe road to [[Harold's Grange]] continues southward from [[Loreto Abbey]]. The first is [[Snugborough]], which has its gable end to the road. The next is [[Washington Lodge]], its attractive 18th century facade hidden by a shrubbery. In later years new avenues have been laid out here on both sides of the road. Barton Drive, on the left, occupies the site of a house named Barton Lodge (occupied by William Conlan, a brewer in Dublin, until his death in 1829 - his daughter married into the local Hodgens family, who in the 1870s donated the lands for the Church of the Annunciation). On the other side is [[Silveracre]], once the home of [[James Henthorn Todd|Dr Henthorn Todd]], Professor of Hebrew in [[Trinity College, Dublin|T.C.D.]], who was connected by marriage to the Hudson family of the adjoining Hermitage estate. He was a well known Irish scholar and was the editor and translator of a number of Irish documents as well as the author of a life of St Patrick. He died here in 1869. About the middle of the last century the name of the house was changed to Silverton but it was later reverted to the original Silveracre. Most of the land is now built on. It was also the home in the early part of twentieth century of Surgeon Croly, who founded Baggot St Hospital.\n\n====St Enda's====\n[[Image:Pearse-Museum.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The Hermitage, site of St Enda's]]\nThe next estate on the same side is Hermitage or [[Enda of Aran|Saint Enda]]'s, the former home of [[Patrick Pearse]] and later of his sister [[Margaret Mary Pearse]]. The house, which is entirely faced with cut granite and has an imposing stone portico, was occupied in the eighteenth century by [[Edward Hudson (dentist)|Edward Hudson]], an eminent dentist. He had a passion for Irish antiquities, which he demonstrated in an unusual way by the erection of a number of romantic ruins around the estate. He built a small watch tower inside the boundary wall near the entrance gate and further along, a hermit's cave, a dolmen, a ruined abbey and beside a deep well, a tiny chamber with a stone bench and a narrow fireplace. At the corner of the road to Whitechurch the loopholed and crenulated structure known as the ''Fortification'', or ''Emmet's Fort'' was another of his creations. South of the house he built a grotto surmounted by a tall stone pillar, a [[Brehon's Chair]] and a fanciful construction consisting of two great boulders, one balanced on top of the other, which has since been demolished. Just inside the boundary wall he cut an inscription in [[Ogham]] on the two faces of a large rock. Translated they read: ''RIDENT VICINI GLEBASETS A KH A MOVENTEM EDUARDUM HUDSON''. In the pretty glen adjoining the [[Whitechurch road]] he erected a sort of temple with several small chambers and flights of steps. The estate was at that time known as the \"Fields of Oden\" and is so called on maps of the period. Within the grounds also, at the corner nearest to Whitechurch is an [[obelisk]], stated to have been erected by a former owner, [[Major Doyne]], over the grave of a horse that carried him through the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. The date however of Major Doyne's occupation does not support this. Meanwhile, P\u00e1draig Pearse wrote in An Macaomh that \"a monument in the wood, beyond the little lake, is said to mark the spot where a horse of Sarah Curran's was killed and is buried.\"<ref>http://pearsemuseum.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/An-Macaomh-Christmas-1910.compressed.pdf</ref> Unlike the constructions of [[Edward Hudson (dentist)|Edward Hudson]], which were purposely of the roughest material, this monument was of cut stone with small moulded pillars. After having been vandalized and toppled, it has since been re-erected without the pillars which were broken.\n\nEdward Hudson was succeeded by his son [[William Elliot Hudson]], who was born here in 1796. A distinguished scholar, he was a friend of [[Thomas Osborne Davis (Irish politician)|Thomas Davis]] and [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] and was a patron of Irish literature and art. Shortly before his death in 1857 he endowed the [[R.I.A.]] with a fund for the publication of its Irish Dictionary and he also left the Academy Library a valuable collection of books.\n\nFrom 1840 to 1858 Hermitage was the home of [[Richard Moore (Irish lawyer)|Richard Moore]], [[Attorney General]], and in 1859 it came into the possession of [[Major Richard Doyne]], stated to be a veteran of the [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. From 1872 to 1885 it was occupied by George Campbell, merchant of 58 Sackville St., and after lying vacant for a few years it was tenanted by [[Major Philip Doyne]] of the [[4th Dragoon Guards]]. In 1891 Colonel [[Frederick le Mesurier]], barrister is returned as occupier and in 1899 Mr. [[William Woodburn]].\n\n[[St Enda's School]] was founded by [[Padraig Pearse]] in 1909 and was at first housed in [[Cullenswood House]], [[Ranelagh]]. Pearse felt that the confined surroundings of this house gave no scope for the outdoor life that should play so large a part in the education of youth, so in 1910 he leased Hermitage from Mr. Woodburn and moved his college here. A long billiard room was converted into a study hall and chapel, the drawing room became a dormitory and the stables opening off an enclosed square became class rooms. In \"The Story of a Success\" Pearse tells of the realisation of one of his life's ambitions and it was from here that he set off for the city on his bicycle for the last time on Easter Sunday 1916. After the rising the college continued to function under the care of Margaret Pearse until it finally closed down in 1935. After the death of Margaret Pearse in 1968 St Enda's passed into the hands of the state and has since been opened as a public park and home of the [[Pearse Museum]].\n\n====Priory====\nDirectly opposite to St Enda's was Priory, the home of [[John Philpot Curran]], at the time of Emmet's rising. The house was formerly named Holly Park but when Curran bought it in 1790 he changed the name to Priory. He lived here for 27 years at the peak of his fame and here he was to endure the tragic events, which cast a shadow on his private life. First the untimely death of his daughter Gertrude, followed by the loss of his wife, who left him for another man, and lastly the discovery of the association of his daughter [[Sarah Curran]] with [[Robert Emmet]]. [[Gertrude Curran]] died in [[1792 in Ireland|1792]] at the age of 12 as the result of a fall from a window. Curran had her buried in the grounds of the Priory and over the grave he placed a recumbent slab, on which was fixed a metal plate bearing the inscription:\n\n:''Here lies the body of Gertrude Curran''\n:''fourth daughter of John Philpot Curran''\n:''who departed this life October 6, 1792''\n:''Age twelve years''.\n\nThe position of the grave was clearly marked on the early editions of the O.S. maps. It was about midway along the northern boundary of the corner field facing the fortification, on the north side of the boundary bank and a few yards from it. It was formerly enclosed by a grove of trees, which can be seen in J. J. Reynold's photograph of 1903 but these were cut down about 1928. Some time later the stumps were dug out and the stone slab broken up and thrown on the adjoining bank. The metal plate had already been taken by souvenir hunters. It was [[Sarah Curran]]'s desire to be buried here also but to this her father would not agree as he had come in for criticism on the previous occasion for burying his daughter in unconsecrated ground.\n\nIn this district nearly every ancient site is associated in tradition with either [[Sarah Curran]] or [[Robert Emmet]] and it is not surprising therefore to find that this burial place has been suggested as the last resting place of [[Robert Emmet]]. This tradition goes back for well over a century and it is rather surprising that this site was not investigated when the search for Emmet's remains was being made at places a great deal less accessible and no less improbable.\n\nIn October 1979 the opportunity offered itself to carry out this investigation. The Priory estate was being developed and heavy machinery moved in to lay the roads and sewers. A Mrs. Bernadette Foley of nearby ''Barton Drive'' drew attention to the need to carry out this work before the site was buried for ever under a concrete jungle. With the co-operation of Messrs Gallaghers, the developers, a small group undertook to investigate the site. First the exact location was checked on the original large scale manuscript map in the O.S., next the field was carefully chained and the site marked to within a few feet and then a narrow trench {{convert|3|ft|m}} deep was dug through where the burial should have been. The result was a complete blank. A second and a third trench were cut at intervals until a large area had been investigated without finding any burial, timber, brick or stone.\n\nThe developers then offered to investigate further with the excavator and carefully cleared an area of {{convert|20|yd|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide to a depth of {{convert|4|ft|m}} without finding any sign of disturbance. They then deepened this area by another two feet with no better result. All the accounts of the burial state that it was made in a vault and it is therefore surprising and disappointing that no evidence whatever was found and there does not seem to be any obvious explanation for it. The builders, Messrs Gallaghers Ltd. were commended for their interest in this aspect of the site and their painstaking excavation work under the supervision of Mr. Leslie Black was expertly carried out.\n\nPriory was occupied by the Curran family until 1875 and subsequently by the Taylors until 1923. At the beginning of the century the house and gardens were still in good repair but after the Taylor's time the place was neglected. Twenty years ago the walls were still standing but little now remains but some heaps of rubble.\n\n====St Columba's College====\nSt Columba's College is a privately run, Church of Ireland co-educational boarding school with c. 300 pupils. It was founded in 1843 by the then Primate of Ireland, Rev. William Sewell. In 1849 the college moved from Stackallan House in County Meath to its present site in Whitechurch, Rathfarnham.  The headmaster of the college is addressed as 'warden' and the vice-principal as 'sub-warden'.  The college school day is split up during the winter - school classes end at 13:00 and there are games and other outdoor activities after lunch from 14:00 - 15:30. Classes recommence at 16:15 and continue until 18:00.  The school week consists of five days from Monday to Saturday with Wednesday and Saturday being half-days. The college has a very high academic profile but it also focusses a considerable attention on music, drama and art.  The college caters for a wide range of academic abilities and provides an excellent special-needs service for children with mild learning deficits.  The geographical layout of the college does not accommodate or facilitate wheelchairs.\n\n==Rathfarnham today==\n\n===Amenities===\nRathfarnham has a wide range of shops and businesses, including two bank branches, notably in the ''Nutgrove Shopping Centre''. The area's other shopping centre is the small ''Rathfarnham Shopping Centre''. The area also has a Garda Station and two post offices, and is home to the city's main ''animal shelter''.\n\n[[Marlay Park]] is a large open parkland, with a craft centre near the old \"big house\"; the park hosts [[marlay park concerts|major concerts]] every year. Aside from St Enda's, [[Dodder Park]] and Bushy Park (see above), Loreto park and small green spaces, the area also hosts two golf clubs.\n\nBoth fine buildings of Loreto Abbey and Rathfarnham Castle also provide amenity value.\nThere are a number of schools.\n\nRathfarnham also has a number of pubs on offer including The Orchard and The Blue Haven.\n\n===Organisations and sport===\n[[File:Rathfarnham_5_km_run_2016.png|thumb|Rathfarnham 5&nbsp;km Run (2016)]]\nRathfarnham is home to the [[Dublin Metropolitan Scout Province|13th Dublin]], the 14th Dublin, the 31st Dublin (which was founded in 1917) and the 68th Dublin [[Scouting Ireland|Scout]] troops and the [[Rathfarnham Girl Guides]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.lycos.co.uk/rathfarnhamguides/ |title=Rathfarnham Girl Guides |publisher=Members.lycos.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> The area is also home to the [[Rathfarnham Concert Band]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcbs.ie |title=Rathfarnham Concert Band Society - Homepage |publisher=Rcbs.ie |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref>\n\nFor [[Gaelic games]], there is the [[Ballinteer St John's]] [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] Club, and also [[Ballyboden St. Enda's GAA]] which is one of the largest GAA clubs in Ireland.

The population has gradually decreased over the years from 17,760 in 1996 to 17,717 in 2002.\n\nThe number of people living around the neighbourhoods of Ballyroan and St Endas fell notably by 8% and 7% respectively. On the other hand, there were minimal increases in the Butterfield and Hermitage areas.\n\nOne thing that is clear from the statistics is Rathfarnham is aging, with young couples that moved into the area in the 1960s entering retirement. There is a lack of suitable and affordable homes for young people in Rathfarnham and consequently they are flocking out to neighbouring suburbs such as [[Templeogue]], [[Tallaght]] and [[Firhouse]].\n\nOver the last four years,{{when?|date=January 2020}} there have not been many apartment block developments in the Rathfarnham area. The figures reflect this reality. Due to the fact that there aren't many suitable sites in the area for apartment building, two analysts including the Rathfarnham Community Website,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rathfarnham.com |title=Rathfarnham Community Website |publisher=Rathfarnham.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> predicted that Census 2010 would show further decreases.\n\n===Culture and entertainment===\n\n====Music====\nRathfarnham has become the focal point of the summer music festival scene in Ireland. Between May and August every year, high profile acts put on concerts for thousands of people at [[Marlay Park]]. Acts in 2007 have included [[Damien Rice]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Kaiser Chiefs]], [[Crowded House]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Damien Rice]], [[The Who]] and [[Peter Gabriel]]. [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[The Killers]], [[Lenny Kravitz]]/[[Alanis Morissette]] played in the park during 2008 [[Metallica]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Dizzee Rascal]] and [[Calvin Harris]] played there on August 1 and 2 in 2009. Marley Park has also hosted the Longitude Festival every July since 2013.\n\n====Film location====\nA number of films have shot some of their scenes in Rathfarnham.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1wQ8UO8CPQ |title=YouTube \u2013 Rathfarnham in the Movies |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}</ref> The opening scene in [[Intermission (film)|Intermission]] was recorded at Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. In one scene in the movie [[Ordinary Decent Criminal]], a car is blown up in front of the Pearse Museum in St Enda's Park. The Secret Scripture was filmed in Loreto Abbey, Rathfarnham in 2015.\n\n===Pubs===\n''Buglers'' pub is situated in Ballyboden House on the Ballyboden Road in [[Ballyboden]]. John Blake was the first known publican to be granted the licence in 1799.\n\nSituated on Main Street, ''The Castle Inn'' is, as its name implies, near Rathfarnham Castle. The interior is made of stone and light wood and it is one of the newer pubs in Rathfarnham.\n\n[[File:YellowHouse 4856w.jpg|thumb|225px|right| The Yellow House, Rathfarnham]]\n\n''The Eden House'' pub is situated on Grange Road near [[Marlay Park]] and is one of the highest pubs in Rathfarnham. The building was formerly ''Eden House'', one of the 18th century stately houses on Grange Road, before being converted to its present use.{{fact|date=January 2020}} The pub was then sold in 2006 for \u20ac5.5m and is now run by owners of The Morgue Pub in [[Templeogue]] Village. The pub was completely renovated by the new owners, who awaited the completion of road works on the Grange Road before opening a new beer garden.\n\n''The Old Orchard'' is on Butterfield Avenue near Rathfarnham Shopping Centre. The interior has a contemporary \"European\" styling. The 'island' bar is an unusual feature and provides service around the full 360\u00b0, earning it its local [[nickname]] of the \"\"[[British threepence coin|thripp'ny bit]]\".\n\n''The Tuning Fork'' was an old-style pub situated at the junction of Willbrook Road and Whitechurch Road near the ''Yellow House'' pub. Now demolished.\n\n''The Blue Haven'' is a meeting spot for young people and business people, situated on the junction of Ballyroan Road and Butterfield Avenue.\n\n''The Yellow House'', is at the corner of Willbrook Road and Grange Road, a short distance from Rathfarnham Castle. It is believed that the first pub bearing the name was a thatched cottage standing on the site of the present [[Catholic]] church, and that the licence went back as far as the early eighteenth century. Certainly, it was in business at the time of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. Some say it was used during the rebellion as a meeting room for the rebellion leaders. A new Yellow House was built in [[1825 in Ireland|1825]] by Mary Murphy and opened for business in 1827. The current building dates from 1885 [http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county=SC&regno=11216006 NIAH]. It was extensively refurbished and extended in 1979. According to local folklore, the poet [[Francis Ledwidge]] worked there for two days as an apprentice before homesickness for his home town of [[Slane]], [[County Meath]], caused him to leave.\n\n===Eateries and restaurants===\nPlaces to eat within Rathfarnaham include fish and chip shops, Chinese takeaways and fast food chains such as [[McDonald's]] located in Nutgrove Shopping Centre. In addition most pubs in the area serve food.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Transport===\nRathfarnham is well served by the [[Dublin Bus]] network. The following Dublin Bus routes serve Rathfarnam:\n\n* 16 from [[Ballinteer]] to [[Dublin Airport]] via the city centre\n* 15B from Stocking Avenue to [[Grand Canal Dock]] via the city centre\n* 17 to [[University College Dublin|UCD]]\n* 61 to [[Eden Quay]]\n* 75 to [[Tallaght]] via [[Firhouse]], and to [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]] via [[Stillorgan]] or [[Sandyford]]\n* 161 to [[Rockbrook]] from [[Dundrum, Dublin|Dundrum]] [[Luas]] station\n\nThe 16 route was the first bus route in Dublin to have free [[Internet]] [[Wi-Fi]] onboard.\n\nIn 2007, it was proposed that a [[Luas]] tram line stated in a feasibility study as Line E\nwould be routed through Rathfarnham. However, it was found that the proposal would not be feasible, due to the fact that the road network from Rathfarnham to the city centre is not wide enough to accommodate [[Luas]] trams. The roads would only be capable of accommodating trams if a significant number of front gardens of houses along the route were purchased to allow for road widening. This would have been a highly costly undertaking, so the project was not progressed any further.\n\n==People==\n\n===People born in Rathfarnham===\n*[[Damien Duff]], Irish footballer\n*[[Danielle Galligan]], Irish actress from Rathfarnham\n*[[Stephen Gwynn]] (1864\u20131950), journalist, biographer, author, poet and Nationalist politician.\n*[[Sarah Curran]], fianc\u00e9e of executed Irish patriot [[Robert Emmet]] and subject of several popular ballads including \u201cShe is Far From the Land\u201d.\n*[[Joe McKinney]], Irish stage and screen artist\n*[[John Millington Synge|J.

The idea was to transform the classroom, where the teacher acted as the game show host and the students were contenders using their own mobile devices. The initial prototype was named Lecture Quiz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~alfw/lecturequiz|title=Lecture Quiz|access-date=2019-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228014947/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~alfw/lecturequiz/|archive-date=2013-12-28|url-status=live}}</ref> Lecture Quiz 1.0 was developed in 2006 before real smartphones were available (first iPhone was released June 29, 2007). The server was implemented in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[MySQL]] integrated with an [[Apache Tomcat|Apache]] Web server, the teacher client has implemented as a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] application in combination with [[OpenGL|Open GL]] for graphics, while the student clients were implemented on [[Java Platform, Micro Edition|Java 2 Micro Edition]], which made it possible to run the client on both mobile phones and laptops.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=\u00d8fsdahl|first2=Terje|last3=M\u00f8rch-Storstein|first3=Ole Kristian|year=2007|title=Lecture quiz-a mobile game concept for lectures|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22Lecture+quiz-a+mobile+game+concept+for+lectures%22&btnG=|journal=International Conference on Software Engineering and Application|publisher=IASTED|volume=11|pages=305\u2013310|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> Those students who played the game using their own laptops could use the [[Wi-Fi]] available at the university, while those playing using mobile phones had to use [[3G]] over the cellular network. The latter was a disadvantage, as the students had to pay out of their own pocket to play Lecture Quiz as the telecom providers at that time charged per megabyte transferred. The first experiment with Lecture Quiz was carried out in a classroom with twenty students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology where the focus was on usability and usefulness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=\u00d8fsdahl|first2=Terje|last3=M\u00f8rch-Storstein|first3=Ole Kristian|year=2008|title=An evaluation of a mobile game concept for lectures|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22An+evaluation+of+a+mobile+game+concept+for+lectures%22&btnG=|journal=Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training|publisher=IEEE|volume=21|pages=197\u2013204|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results from the experiment showed that Lecture Quiz was relatively easy to use, contributed to increased learning, that it was entertaining, and increased the motivation for attending more lectures. From 2006 to 2011, four versions of Lecture Quiz were developed, where the main changes were related to improved usability, making it easier to create quizzes, and using newer technology for implementation.\n\nLecture Quiz 2.0 was the first prototype where both teacher and student clients had web-interfaces. An experiment testing the 2.0 prototype showed that the usability had been improved both for the teacher and the student clients, and that the concept increased students' motivation, engagement, concentration and perceived learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Bian|last2=Wang|first2=Alf Inge|last3=B\u00f8rresen|first3=Erling Andreas|last4=Tidemann|first4=Knut Andre|year=2011|title=Improvement of a Lecture Game Concept - Implementing Lecture Quiz 2.0.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221130592|journal=International Conference on Computer Supported Education|volume=3|pages=26\u201335|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> The last version of Lecture Quiz was version 3.0, with significantly improved user-interface implemented using [[HTML5|HTML 5]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS3]], avatars, and multiple game/team modes.

A quasi-experiment conducted at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with 252 students participating investigated the wear-out effect of Kahoot! by comparing students' perception of the system after playing once vs. playing frequently over five months.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|year=2015|title=The wear out effect of a game-based student response system|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+wear+out+effect+of+a+game-based+student+response+system%22&btnG=|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=82|pages=217\u2013227|via=Google Scholar|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.004|hdl=11250/2496267|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The results did not show any statistically significant reductions in students' engagement, motivation, concentration or perceived learning over time, but there was a significant change in classroom dynamics (less communication among players after five months). The conclusion was that Kahoot! manage to boost students' engagement, motivation, concentration and learning after using it repeatedly for five months. The core factor to keep students' attention after heavy repeated usage was found to be the competitive nature of Kahoot!.\n\nThere is also research that investigates how Kahoot! performs compared to other tools and platforms. In a quasi-experiment with 384 students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Kahoot! was compared to using a paper quiz and a simple polling system called Clicker.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Zhu|first2=Meng|last3=S\u00e6tre|first3=Rune|year=2016|title=The effect of digitizing and gratifying quizzing in classrooms|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1,5&q=%22The+Effect+of+Digitizing+and+Gamifying+Quizzing+in+Classrooms%22|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International|volume=10|pages=729\u2013736|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results show statistically significant improvement in motivation, engagement, enjoyment, and concentration for the gamified approach (Kahoot!) compared to the two other. However, the results did not show any significant differences in learning outcomes.\n\nAnother quasi-experiment at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in which 593 students participated, investigated how the use of points and audio in Kahoot! affects concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation and classroom dynamics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Lieberoth|first2=Andreas|year=2016|title=The effect of points and audio on concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation, and classroom dynamics using Kahoot!|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+effect+of+points+and+audio+on+concentration%2C+engagement%2C+enjoyment%2C+learning%2C+motivation%2C+and+classroom+dynamics+using+Kahoot%21%22&btnG=|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences International Limited|volume=10|pages=737\u2013746|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results reveal that there are some significant differences whether audio and points are used in the areas of concentration, engagement, enjoyment and motivation. The worst result was for the case where both audio and points were turned off. The most surprising finding was how classroom dynamics was positively affected by the use of audio.\n\nAccording to research by two students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the [[network latency]] in accessing the website greatly influences the [[quality of experience]] of the platform, in both longitudinal and cross-section studies, with a sample size N=21.<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Underdal|first1=Anlaug G\u00e5rdsrud|last2=Sunde|first2=Marthe Thorine|title=Investigating QoE in a Cloud-Based Classroom Response System|date=5 September 2014|hdl=11250/262998}}</ref> It was found that about 70% of the sample size regard Kahoot! as having positive results on all delay levels, while a varying number of students (between 10-20%) report that the platform is too time-consuming, forming a direct relationship with the duration of the delay.\n\nA [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131520300208 literature review containing 93 studies on the effect of using Kahoot! for learning] was published in the journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-education Computers & Education] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Tahir|first2=Rabail|year=2020|title=The effect of using Kahoot! for learning \u2013 A literature review|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=149|pages=103818|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103818|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is the first literature review that investigates most published studies (experiments, case studies, surveys, etc.) on how to use Kahoot! affects learning in the classroom. The focus of the review is on learning performance, classroom dynamics, students' and teachers' attuites and perceptions, and student anxiety. The main conclusion is that Kahoot! has a positive effect on learning performance, classroom dynamics, attuites, and anxiety, and the main challenges include technical problems, see questions and answers, time stress, afraid of losing, and hard to catch up. Studies included in this review use a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods that reveal among other things that Kahoot! has statistical significant improvement in learning performance compared to traditional teaching and other tools, a statistically significant improvement on students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 perception of lectures, statistically significant improvement in classroom dynamics, and that Kahoot! can reduce students\u2019 anxiety compared to traditional teaching and other tools.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nKahoot!'s growing popularity in schools led to it becoming an [[Internet meme]]. Its interface, as well as catchy music<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnnUD9-hD8A Kahoot Lobby Music - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>, has inspired many memes and social media accounts dedicated to posting such content.

The idea was to transform the classroom, where the teacher acted as the game show host and the students were contenders using their own mobile devices. The initial prototype was named Lecture Quiz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~alfw/lecturequiz|title=Lecture Quiz|access-date=2019-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228014947/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~alfw/lecturequiz/|archive-date=2013-12-28|url-status=live}}</ref> Lecture Quiz 1.0 was developed in 2006 before real smartphones were available (first iPhone was released June 29, 2007).

A quasi-experiment conducted at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with 252 students participating investigated the wear-out effect of Kahoot! by comparing students' perception of the system after playing once vs. playing frequently over five months.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|year=2015|title=The wear out effect of a game-based student response system|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+wear+out+effect+of+a+game-based+student+response+system%22&btnG=|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=82|pages=217\u2013227|via=Google Scholar|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.004|hdl=11250/2496267|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The results did not show any statistically significant reductions in students' engagement, motivation, concentration or perceived learning over time, but there was a significant change in classroom dynamics (less communication among players after five months). The conclusion was that Kahoot! manage to boost students' engagement, motivation, concentration and learning after using it repeatedly for five months. The core factor to keep students' attention after heavy repeated usage was found to be the competitive nature of Kahoot!.\n\nThere is also research that investigates how Kahoot! performs compared to other tools and platforms. In a quasi-experiment with 384 students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Kahoot! was compared to using a paper quiz and a simple polling system called Clicker.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Zhu|first2=Meng|last3=S\u00e6tre|first3=Rune|year=2016|title=The effect of digitizing and gratifying quizzing in classrooms|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1,5&q=%22The+Effect+of+Digitizing+and+Gamifying+Quizzing+in+Classrooms%22|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International|volume=10|pages=729\u2013736|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results show statistically significant improvement in motivation, engagement, enjoyment, and concentration for the gamified approach (Kahoot!) compared to the two other. However, the results did not show any significant differences in learning outcomes.\n\nAnother quasi-experiment at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in which 593 students participated, investigated how the use of points and audio in Kahoot! affects concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation and classroom dynamics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Lieberoth|first2=Andreas|year=2016|title=The effect of points and audio on concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation, and classroom dynamics using Kahoot!|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+effect+of+points+and+audio+on+concentration%2C+engagement%2C+enjoyment%2C+learning%2C+motivation%2C+and+classroom+dynamics+using+Kahoot%21%22&btnG=|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences International Limited|volume=10|pages=737\u2013746|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results reveal that there are some significant differences whether audio and points are used in the areas of concentration, engagement, enjoyment and motivation. The worst result was for the case where both audio and points were turned off. The most surprising finding was how classroom dynamics was positively affected by the use of audio.\n\nAccording to research by two students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the [[network latency]] in accessing the website greatly influences the [[quality of experience]] of the platform, in both longitudinal and cross-section studies, with a sample size N=21.<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Underdal|first1=Anlaug G\u00e5rdsrud|last2=Sunde|first2=Marthe Thorine|title=Investigating QoE in a Cloud-Based Classroom Response System|date=5 September 2014|hdl=11250/262998}}</ref> It was found that about 70% of the sample size regard Kahoot! as having positive results on all delay levels, while a varying number of students (between 10-20%) report that the platform is too time-consuming, forming a direct relationship with the duration of the delay.\n\nA [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131520300208 literature review containing 93 studies on the effect of using Kahoot! for learning] was published in the journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-education Computers & Education] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Tahir|first2=Rabail|year=2020|title=The effect of using Kahoot! for learning \u2013 A literature review|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=149|pages=103818|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103818|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is the first literature review that investigates most published studies (experiments, case studies, surveys, etc.) on how to use Kahoot! affects learning in the classroom.

The main conclusion is that Kahoot! has a positive effect on learning performance, classroom dynamics, attuites, and anxiety, and the main challenges include technical problems, see questions and answers, time stress, afraid of losing, and hard to catch up. Studies included in this review use a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods that reveal among other things that Kahoot! has statistical significant improvement in learning performance compared to traditional teaching and other tools, a statistically significant improvement on students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 perception of lectures, statistically significant improvement in classroom dynamics, and that Kahoot! can reduce students\u2019 anxiety compared to traditional teaching and other tools.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nKahoot!'s growing popularity in schools led to it becoming an [[Internet meme]].

{"title_page": "Portus Cale", "text_new": "'''{{lang|la|Portus Cale}}''' ([[Romanization (cultural)|Latinised version]] for \"Port of Cale\", original [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name ''Callaici'', ''Cale'') was an ancient [[town]] and [[port]] in current-day [[northern Portugal]], in the area of today's [[Grande Porto]]. The name of the town eventually influenced the name of the subsequent country [[Portugal]].\n\n==Early history==\nCale was an early settlement located at the mouth of the [[Douro River]], which flows into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the north of what is now Portugal.\n\nThe mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, a people who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. Cala or [[Cailleach]] was the name of a Celtic god \u2013 in [[Scotland]] she is also known as [[Beira (mythology)|Beira, Queen of Winter]] \u2013 and at the time the land of a specific people was frequently named after its deity. The names ''Callaici'' and ''Cale'' are the origin of today's ''[[Vila Nova de Gaia|Gaia]]'', ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]'', and the -''gal'' in ''Portugal''. The meaning of ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is likely a derivation of the Celtic word for port which would confirm very old links to pre-Roman, Celtic languages. Compare today's Irish ''caladh'' or Scottish ''cala'', both meaning port.\n\nThe medieval Scottish historian [[Hector Boece]] thought the name ''Portugal'' was derived from ''Porto Gatelli'', the name [[Go\u00eddel Glas|Gatelo]] gave to [[Braga]] when he settled there,<ref>{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DesAAAAAYAAJ|quote=Gatelli.|year=1864|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DesAAAAAYAAJ/page/n389 382]}}</ref> while others say he gave it to [[Porto]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Michaud|first1=Joseph Fr.|last2=Michaud|first2=Louis Gabriel|title=Biographie universelle, ancienne et moderne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrIFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA312|year=1832|publisher=Michaud|page=312}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Fuentes|first=Alvaro Galm\u00e9s de|title=Los top\u00f3nimos: sus blasones y trofeos (la toponimia m\u00edtica)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PPFpEh5qJcEC&pg=PA111|year=2000|publisher=Real Academia de la Historia|isbn=978-84-89512-79-5|page=111}}</ref>\n\nOther historians have argued that Greeks were the first to settle Cale and that the name derives from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}} ''{{transl|grc|kallis}}'', 'beautiful', referring to the beauty of the Douro valley. Others have hypothesized that the word ''Cale'' came from the Latin word for 'warm' (''Portus Cale'' thus meaning 'warm port').\n\n==Roman conquest==\nThe Roman general [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus]] conquered the region and founded the Roman city ''Portus Cale'' in around 136 BC.\n\nAt the end of Brutus' campaigns, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] controlled the territory between the Douro and Minho rivers plus probable extensions along the coast and in the interior. It was only under [[Augustus]], however, at the end of the 1st century BC, that present north Portugal and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] were fully pacified and under Roman control.\nDuring the Roman occupation, the city developed as an important commercial port, primarily in the trade between ''[[Olisipo]]'' (the modern [[Lisbon]]) and ''[[Bracara Augusta]]'' (the modern [[Braga]]).<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web |url= https://www.google.com/search?q=history+of+Porto&hl=en&biw=1366&bih=634&prmd=ivns&sa=X&ei=MogTTsj5Ec2i-gbqsrXwDQ&ved=0CEQQpQI&tbm=&tbs=tl:1,tlul:400%20BC,tluh:199AD |title=history of Porto \u2013 Google Search |first= |last=Various |work=google.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs the Roman Empire declined, these regions fell under [[Suebi]] dominion, between 410 and 584. These [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invaders settled mainly in the areas of Braga (''Bracara Augusta''), Porto (''Portus Cale''), [[Lugo]] (''Lucus Augusti'') and [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] (''[[Asturica Augusta]]''). Bracara Augusta, capital of Roman ''[[Gallaecia]]'', became the capital of the Suebi. As trade collapsed, Portus Cale went into decline.\n\nAnother Germanic people, the [[Visigoth]]s, also invaded the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and would eventually conquer the Suebi kingdom in 584. The region around Cale became known by the Visigoths as ''Portucale''. Portus Cale would fall under the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Moorish invasion]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 711.\n\nIn 868, [[V\u00edmara Peres]], a [[Christians|Christian]] [[warlord]] from [[Gallaecia]] and a vassal of the King of [[List of Asturian monarchs|Asturias]], [[List of Leonese monarchs|L\u00e9on]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], [[Alfonso III of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso III]], was sent to [[Reconquista|reconquer]] and secure from the Moors the area from the [[Minho River]] to the [[Douro River]], including the city of Portus Cale, and founded the First County of Portugal or [[Condado de Portucale]]. ''Portus Cale'' is thus the former name of current-day [[Porto]] and [[Vila Nova de Gaia]]'s riverside area, that would be used to name the whole region and, later, the country.\n\n==Origin of Portugal's name==\n{{Main|History of Portugal|Name of Portugal}}\nPortugal's name derives from the Roman name ''Portus Cale''. ''Portucale'' evolved into ''Portugale'' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, ''Portugale'' was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and [[Minho River|Minho]], the Minho flowing along what would become the northern border between Portugal and Galicia.\n\n==Cale and the origin of the name of Galicia==\nThe origin of the name ''Galiza'' (Calecia, Gallaecia) may be found in the root ''cale'', which also appears in words like ''kallaiko\u00ed'' or ''galaicos''.

The name of the town determined the name of the subsequent country '''[[Portugal]]'''.\n\n==Early history==\nThe word '''Portugal''' derives from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]-[[Celts|Celtic]] place name '''''[[Portus Cale]]''''';<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/portugal|title=Portugal \u2013 Origin and meaning of the name Portugal by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=Etymonline.com}}</ref> where is located the city of [[Porto District|'''Porto''']] (''[[Portus Cale|Portus]]'') and its neighbour [[Vila Nova de Gaia|'''Gaia''']] (''[[Portus Cale|Cale]]''), on both sides of where the [[River Douro|'''Douro''']] river reaches the '''Atlantic''' ocean, in the '''north of''' '''Portugal'''. This was one of the oldest civilizational settlements of the '''Iberian peninsula''', and of the whole '''Europe'''. \u00a0\n\nThe mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, a people who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. Cala or [[Cailleach]] was the name of a Celtic god \u2013 in [[Scotland]] she is also known as [[Beira (mythology)|Beira, Queen of Winter]] \u2013 and at the time the land of a specific people was frequently named after its deity. The names ''Callaici'' and ''Cale'' are the origin of today's ''[[Vila Nova de Gaia|Gaia]]'', ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]'', and the -''gal'' in ''Portugal''. The meaning of ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is likely a derivation of the Celtic word for port which would confirm very old links to pre-Roman, Celtic languages. Compare today's Irish ''caladh'' or Scottish ''cala'', both meaning port.\n\nThe medieval Scottish historian [[Hector Boece]] thought the name ''Portugal'' was derived from ''Porto Gatelli'', the name [[Go\u00eddel Glas|Gatelo]] gave to [[Braga]] when he settled there,<ref>{{cite book|title=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DesAAAAAYAAJ|quote=Gatelli.|year=1864|publisher=Royal Irish Academy|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_DesAAAAAYAAJ/page/n389 382]}}</ref> while others say he gave it to [[Porto]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Michaud|first1=Joseph Fr.|last2=Michaud|first2=Louis Gabriel|title=Biographie universelle, ancienne et moderne|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrIFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA312|year=1832|publisher=Michaud|page=312}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Fuentes|first=Alvaro Galm\u00e9s de|title=Los top\u00f3nimos: sus blasones y trofeos (la toponimia m\u00edtica)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PPFpEh5qJcEC&pg=PA111|year=2000|publisher=Real Academia de la Historia|isbn=978-84-89512-79-5|page=111}}</ref>\n\nOther historians have argued that Greeks were the first to settle Cale and that the name derives from the Greek word {{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2}} ''{{transl|grc|kallis}}'', 'beautiful', referring to the beauty of the Douro valley. Others have hypothesized that the word ''Cale'' came from the Latin word for 'warm' (''Portus Cale'' thus meaning 'warm port').\n\n==Roman conquest==\nThe Roman general [[Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus]] conquered the region and founded the Roman city ''Portus Cale'' in around 136 BC.\n\nAt the end of Brutus' campaigns, [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] controlled the territory between the Douro and Minho rivers plus probable extensions along the coast and in the interior. It was only under [[Augustus]], however, at the end of the 1st century BC, that present north Portugal and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] were fully pacified and under Roman control.\nDuring the Roman occupation, the city developed as an important commercial port, primarily in the trade between ''[[Olisipo]]'' (the modern [[Lisbon]]) and ''[[Bracara Augusta]]'' (the modern [[Braga]]).<ref name=\"Timeline\">{{cite web |url= https://www.google.com/search?q=history+of+Porto&hl=en&biw=1366&bih=634&prmd=ivns&sa=X&ei=MogTTsj5Ec2i-gbqsrXwDQ&ved=0CEQQpQI&tbm=&tbs=tl:1,tlul:400%20BC,tluh:199AD |title=history of Porto \u2013 Google Search |first= |last=Various |work=google.co.uk |year=2011 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs the Roman Empire declined, these regions fell under [[Suebi]] dominion, between 410 and 584. These [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] invaders settled mainly in the areas of Braga (''Bracara Augusta''), Porto (''Portus Cale''), [[Lugo]] (''Lucus Augusti'') and [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]] (''[[Asturica Augusta]]''). Bracara Augusta, capital of Roman ''[[Gallaecia]]'', became the capital of the Suebi. As trade collapsed, Portus Cale went into decline.\n\nAnother Germanic people, the [[Visigoth]]s, also invaded the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and would eventually conquer the Suebi kingdom in 584. The region around Cale became known by the Visigoths as ''Portucale''. Portus Cale would fall under the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Moorish invasion]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 711.\n\nIn 868, [[V\u00edmara Peres]], a [[Christians|Christian]] [[warlord]] from [[Gallaecia]] and a vassal of the King of [[List of Asturian monarchs|Asturias]], [[List of Leonese monarchs|L\u00e9on]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], [[Alfonso III of Le\u00f3n|Alfonso III]], was sent to [[Reconquista|reconquer]] and secure from the Moors the area from the [[Minho River]] to the [[Douro River]], including the city of Portus Cale, and founded the First County of Portugal or [[Condado de Portucale]]. ''Portus Cale'' is thus the former name of current-day [[Porto]] and [[Vila Nova de Gaia]]'s riverside area, that would be used to name the whole region and, later, the country.\n\n==Origin of Portugal's name==\n{{Main|History of Portugal|Name of Portugal}}\nPortugal's name derives from the Roman name ''Portus Cale''. ''Portucale'' evolved into ''Portugale'' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, ''Portugale'' was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and [[Minho River|Minho]], the Minho flowing along what would become the northern border between Portugal and Galicia.\n\n==Cale and the origin of the name of Galicia==\nThe origin of the name ''Galiza'' (Calecia, Gallaecia) may be found in the root ''cale'', which also appears in words like ''kallaiko\u00ed'' or ''galaicos''. Many scholars believe that the origins of the name ''Galaicos'' was in the area around the mouth of the Douro river and the Romans then used this name to refer to all the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]-speaking Castro people of the Iberian Peninsula's north-west, an area they named [[Gallaecia]]. In today's Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the word for ''port'' is respectively ''caladh'' and ''cala''.\n\n==Related terms==\nSome southeastern Indo-European tongues name the [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] after Portugal, which was formerly the main source of import of sweet oranges.

The only possible exception to GC IV Art 5 is when he is a national of the authority imprisoning him, in which case he would not be a mercenary soldier as defined in APGC77 Art 47.d.\n\nIf, after a regular trial, a captured soldier is found to be a mercenary, then he can expect treatment as a common criminal and may face execution. As mercenary soldiers may not qualify as PoWs, they cannot expect repatriation at war's end. The best known post-World War II example of this was on 28 June 1976 when, at the end of the [[Luanda Trial]], an Angolan court sentenced three Britons and an American to death and nine other mercenaries to prison terms ranging from 16 to 30 years. The four mercenaries sentenced to death were shot by a firing squad on 10 July 1976.<ref name=\"bbc_june28\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/28/newsid_2520000/2520575.stm 1976: Death sentence for mercenaries] [[BBC]] On this day 28 June</ref>\n\nThe legal status of civilian contractors depends upon the nature of their work and their nationalities with respect to that of the combatants. If they have not \"in fact, taken a direct part in the hostilities\" (APGC77 Art 47.b), they are not mercenaries but civilians who have non-combat support roles and are entitled to protection under the Third Geneva Convention (GCIII 4.1.4).\n\nOn 4 December 1989, the United Nations passed resolution 44/34, the ''International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries''.

While the United States governed Iraq, no U.S. citizen working as an armed guard could be classified as a mercenary because he was ''a national of a Party to the conflict'' (APGC77 Art 47.d). With the hand-over of power to the Iraqi government, if one does not consider the coalition forces to be continuing parties to the conflict in Iraq, but that their soldiers are \"sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces\" (APGC77 Art 47.f), then, unless U.S. citizens working as armed guards are lawfully certified residents of Iraq, i.e., \"a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict\" (APGC77 Art 47.d), and they are involved with a fire-fight in the continuing conflict, they are mercenary soldiers. However, those who acknowledge the United States and other coalition forces as continuing parties to the conflict might insist that U.S. armed guards cannot be called mercenaries (APGC77 Art 47.d).\n\n=== National laws ===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\nThe laws of some countries forbid their citizens to fight in foreign wars unless they are under the control of their own national armed forces.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Online|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20060910084637879C193049|title=South Africa|publisher=Iol.co.za|accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bciclr/28_1/07_TXT.htm|title=The laws in some countries|publisher=Bc.edu|date=12 August 1949|accessdate=26 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917043646/http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bciclr/28_1/07_TXT.htm|archivedate=17 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== Austria ====\nIf a person is proven to have worked as a mercenary for any other country while retaining Austrian citizenship, his or her Austrian citizenship will be revoked.\n\n==== France ====\nIn 2003, France criminalized mercenary activities, as defined by the protocol to the Geneva convention for French citizens, permanent residents and legal entities (Penal Code, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CPENALLL.rcv&art=436-1 L436-1], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CPENALLL.rcv&art=436-2 L436-2], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CPENALLL.rcv&art=436-3 L436-3], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CPENALLL.rcv&art=436-4 L436-4], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CPENALLL.rcv&art=436-5 L436-5]).

In 2005, the legislation was reviewed by the government because of South African citizens working as security guards in [[Iraq]] during the [[History of Iraq (2003\u20132011)|American occupation of Iraq]] and the consequences of the mercenary soldier sponsorship case against [[Mark Thatcher]] for the \"possible funding and logistical assistance in relation to an alleged attempted coup in [[Equatorial Guinea]]\" organized by [[Simon Mann]].<ref>[[Reuters]] [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L1143048.htm South Africa to review mercenary law, targets Iraq] February 2005</ref>\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nIn the United Kingdom, the Foreign Enlistment Act 1819 and the [[Foreign Enlistment Act 1870]] make it unlawful for British subjects to join the armed forces of any state warring with another state at peace with Britain. In the [[Greek War of Independence]], British volunteers fought with the Greek rebels, which could have been unlawful per the Foreign Enlistment Act. It was unclear whether or not the Greek rebels were a 'state', but the law was clarified to state that the rebels were a state.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe British government considered using the Act against British subjects fighting for the [[International Brigades|International Brigade]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[National Liberation Front of Angola|FNLA]] in the [[Angolan Civil War]], but in the end, it chose on both occasions not to do so.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== United States ====\nThe [[Anti-Pinkerton Act|Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893]] ({{usc|5|3108}}) forbade the U.S. government from using [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] employees, or similar private police companies. In 1977, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] interpreted this statute as forbidding the U.S. government from employing companies offering \"mercenary, quasi-military forces\" for hire (United States ex rel. ''Weinberger v. Equifax'', 557 F.2d 456, 462 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1035 (1978)). There is a disagreement over whether or not this proscription is limited to the use of such forces as strikebreakers, because it is stated thus:\n\n{{quote|The purpose of the Act and the legislative history reveal that an organization was \"similar\" to the Pinkerton Detective Agency only if it offered for hire mercenary, quasi-military forces as strikebreakers and armed guards. It had the secondary effect of deterring any other organization from providing such services lest it be branded a \"similar organization.\" The legislative history supports this view and no other. | United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit | Weinberger v. Equifax, 1977}}\n\nIn the 7 June 1978 Letter to the Heads of Federal Departments and Agencies, the Comptroller General interpreted this decision in a way that carved out an exemption for \"Guard and Protective Services\".\n\nA U.S. Department of Defense interim rule (effective 16 June 2006) revises DoD Instruction 3020.41 to authorize contractors, other than private security contractors, to use deadly force against enemy armed forces only in self-defense (71 Fed. Reg. 34826). Per that interim rule, private security contractors are authorized to use deadly force when protecting their client's assets and persons, consistent with their contract's [[mission statement]]. One interpretation is that this authorizes contractors to engage in combat on behalf of the U.S. government. It is the combatant commander's responsibility to ensure that private security contract mission statements do not authorize performance of inherently governmental military functions, i.e. preemptive attacks or assaults or raids, etc.\n\nOtherwise, civilians with U.S. Armed Forces lose their law of war protection from direct attack if and for such time as they directly participate in hostilities. On 18 August 2006, the U.S. Comptroller General rejected bid protest arguments that U.S. Army contracts violated the Anti-Pinkerton Act by requiring that contractors provide armed convoy escort vehicles and labor, weapons, and equipment for internal security operations at Victory Base Complex, Iraq. The Comptroller General reasoned the act was unviolated, because the contracts did not require contractors to provide quasi-military forces as strikebreakers.<ref>Brian X.

At this time, a number of mercenaries, arriving from several countries found employment in India. Some of the mercenaries emerged to become independent rulers.\n\n[[Mukkuvar]] clan of [[Malabar Coast]] and Sri Lankan coast did the role of soldiers in [[Kalinga Magha]]'s invasion to [[Sri Lanka]] and in [[Nair]]'s battle with the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] in the [[Battle of Colachel]].\n\n=== East Asia ===\n\n==== Warring States ====\nMercenaries were regularly used by the kingdoms of the [[Warring States]] period of China. Military advisers and generals trained through the works of [[Mozi]] and [[Sun Tzu]] would regularly offer their services to kings and dukes.\n\nAfter the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] conquest of the Warring States, the Qin and later [[Han Dynasty|Han]] Empires would also employ mercenaries \u2013 ranging from nomadic horse archers in the Northern steppes or soldiers from the [[Yue (state)|Yue]] kingdoms of the South. The 7th century [[Tang Dynasty]] was also prominent for its use of mercenaries, when they hired [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] soldiers against invasion from the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]] and other steppe civilizations.<ref>''Ancient Chinese Civilization'' {{ISBN|978-1-404-28035-9}} p. 12</ref>\n\n==== 15th to 18th centuries ====\nThe Saika mercenary group<ref>\u96d1\u8cc0\u8846, ''[[:ja:\u96d1\u8cc0\u8846|saikashuu]]''</ref> of the [[Kii Province]], Japan, played a significant role during the [[Siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji]] that took place between August 1570 to August 1580. The Saikashuu were famed for the support of [[Ikk\u014d-sh\u016b|Ikk\u014d]] Buddhist sect movements and greatly impeded the advance of [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s forces.\n\n[[Ninja]] were peasant farmers who learned the art of war to combat the ''[[daimy\u014d]]''{{'}}s samurai.

So in 1941 the Roosevelt administration authorized the formation of three [[American Volunteer Group]]s, of which the 1st AVG was deployed to Burma and China and became famous as the [[Flying Tigers]]. The pilots earned $600\u2013$750 basic pay per month, plus $500 for each Japanese aircraft confirmed destroyed in the air or on the ground.<ref>Daniel Ford, ''Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941\u20131942'', HarperCollins 2007, pp.44\u201345</ref> The 2nd AVG, a bomber group, was recruited in November 1941 but aborted following the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]].\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== Classical era ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\nMany [[Greeks|Greek]] mercenaries fought for the [[Persian Empire]] during the early classic era. For example:\n* [[Xerxes I]], king of Persia, who invaded [[Greece]] in 484&nbsp;BC employed Greek mercenaries.\n* In [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]], [[Xenophon]] recounts how [[Cyrus the Younger]] hired a large army of Greek mercenaries (the \"[[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]]\") in 401&nbsp;BC to seize the throne of Persia from his brother, [[Artaxerxes II]]. Though Cyrus' army was victorious at the [[Battle of Cunaxa]], Cyrus himself was killed in battle and the expedition rendered moot. Stranded deep in enemy territory, the Spartan general [[Clearchus of Sparta|Clearchus]] and most of the other Greek generals were subsequently killed by treachery. Xenophon played an instrumental role in encouraging \"The Ten Thousand\" Greek army to march north to the [[Black Sea]] in an epic fighting retreat.\n* The [[Sileraioi]] were a group of ancient mercenaries most likely employed by the tyrant [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]].\n* [[Memnon of Rhodes]] (380 \u2013 333&nbsp;BC): was the commander of the Greek mercenaries working for the Persian King [[Darius III]] when [[Alexander the Great]] of [[Macedon]]ia invaded Persia in 334&nbsp;BC and won the [[Battle of the Granicus River]]. Alexander also employed Greek mercenaries during his campaigns. These were men who fought for him directly and not those who fought in city-state units attached to his army.\n* [[Carthage]] contracted [[Balearic Islands]] shepherds as [[Sling (weapon)|slingers]] during the [[Punic Wars]] against Rome. The vast majority of the Carthaginian military \u2013 except the highest officers, the navy, and the [[Sacred Band of Carthage|home guard]] \u2013 were mercenaries.\n* Members of independent [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes such as the [[Bessi]] and [[Dii]] often joined the ranks of large organized armies as mercenaries.\n* The [[Mamertines|Sons of Mars]] were Italian mercenaries used by the Greek kings of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] until after the [[Punic Wars]].\n* A figure in oral legend, [[Milesius]] was given the princess [[Scota]] after conducting a successful campaign for [[Ancient Egypt]].\n* [[Mithridates VI Eupator]] recruited a large number of [[Persian people|Iranians]] along with the Galatians into the [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic]] army during the [[Mithridatic Wars]] against Rome, using the [[Leucosyri]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Scythians]].\n* [[Illyrians]] were hired across the [[Balkans]] and further. They were known for their unreliability.\n\nIn the late [[Roman Empire]], it became increasingly difficult for Emperors and generals to raise military units from the citizenry for various reasons: lack of manpower, lack of time available for training, lack of materials, and, inevitably, political considerations. Therefore, beginning in the late 4th century, the empire often contracted whole bands of [[barbarian]]s either within the [[Roman legion|legions]] or as autonomous [[foederati]]. The barbarians were [[Romanization|Romanized]] and surviving veterans were established in areas requiring population. The [[Varangian Guard]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] is the best known formation made up of barbarian mercenaries (see next section).\n\n==== Medieval warfare ====\n{{see also|Routiers|Bertrand du Guesclin}}\n[[File:Turkic mercenary in Byzantine service - 1436 \u2013 PISANELLO.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Oghuz Turks|Turkish]] mercenary in Byzantine service c. 1436]]\n[[Byzantine Emperors]] followed the Roman practice and contracted foreigners especially for their personal [[corps]] guard called the [[Varangian Guard]]. They were chosen among war-prone peoples, of whom the [[Varangian]]s (Norsemen) were preferred. Their mission was to protect the Emperor and Empire and since they did not have links to the Greeks, they were expected to be ready to suppress rebellions. One of the most famous guards was the future king [[Harald III of Norway]], also known as Harald Hardrada (\"Hard-counsel\"), who arrived in Constantinople in 1035 and was employed as a Varangian Guard. He participated in eighteen battles and was promoted to ''akolythos'', the commander of the Guard, before returning home in 1043. He was killed at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] in 1066 when his army was defeated by an English army commanded by King [[Harold Godwinson]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn England at the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], [[Flemish people|Flemings]] (natives of [[Flanders]]) formed a substantial mercenary element in the forces of [[William the Conqueror]] with many remaining in England as settlers under the [[Normans]]. Contingents of mercenary [[Flemish]] soldiers were to form significant forces in England throughout the time of the Norman and early [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] dynasties (11th and 12th centuries). A prominent example of these were the Flemings who fought during the English civil wars, known as [[the Anarchy]] or [[the Nineteen-Year Winter]] (AD 1135 to 1154), under the command of [[William of Ypres]], who was [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]]'s chief lieutenant from 1139 to 1154 and who was made Earl of Kent by Stephen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nIn Italy, the ''condottiero'' was a military chief offering his troops, the [[condottieri]], to [[city-state]]s. During the ages of the [[Taifa]] kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, Christian knights like [[El Cid]] could fight for some Muslim ruler against his Christian or Muslim enemies. The [[Almogavars]] originally fought for [[Catalonia]] and [[Aragon]], but as the [[Catalan Company]], they followed [[Roger de Flor]] in the service of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Catalan and German mercenaries also had prominent role in the Serbian victory over Bulgarians in the [[Battle of Velbuzd]] in 1330.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDuring the later Middle Ages, [[Free Companies]] (or ''Free Lances'') were formed, consisting of companies of mercenary troops. Nation-states lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire free companies to serve in their armies during wartime. Such companies typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments. The veteran soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia. The [[White Company]]<ref>[[Project Gutenberg]] e-text of ''[http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/903 The White Company]'' by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]</ref> commanded by Sir [[John Hawkwood]] is the best known English Free Company of the 14th century. Between the 13th and 17th Century the [[Gallowglass]] fought within the Islands of Britain and also mainland Europe. A Welshman [[Owain Lawgoch]] (Owain of the Red Hand) formed a free company and fought for the French against the English during [[the Hundred Years' War]], before being assassinated by a Scot by the name of Jon Lamb under the orders of the English Crown in 1378 during the [[siege of Mortagne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.100welshheroes.com/en/biography/owainlawgoch|title=Owain Lawgoch (English:Owain of the Red Hand, French:Yvain de Galles)|publisher=100welshheroes.com|accessdate=26 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124191956/http://www.100welshheroes.com/en/biography/owainlawgoch|archivedate=24 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== 15th and 16th centuries ====\n[[File:Landsknechte.jpg|thumb|230px|Landsknechte, [[etching]] by [[Daniel Hopfer]], ''c.'' 1530.]]\n[[Swiss mercenaries]] were sought during the late 15th and early 16th centuries as being an effective fighting force, until their somewhat rigid battle formations became vulnerable to [[Harquebus|arquebuses]] and [[artillery]] being developed at the same time. ''See [[Swiss Guard]].''\n\nIt was then that the German [[landsknecht]]s, colorful mercenaries with a redoubtable reputation, took over the Swiss forces' legacy and became the most formidable force of the late 15th and throughout the 16th century, being hired by all the powers in Europe and often fighting at opposite sides. Sir [[Thomas More]] in his [[Utopia (Novel)|Utopia]] advocated the use of mercenaries in preference to citizens. The barbarian mercenaries employed by the Utopians are thought to be inspired by the Swiss mercenaries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nA class of mercenaries known as the [[Gallowglass]] dominated warfare in Ireland and Scotland between the 13th and 16th centuries. They were a heavily armed and armored elite force that often doubled as a chieftain's bodyguard.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt approximately the same period, [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] argued against the use of mercenary armies in his book of political advice ''[[The Prince]]''. His rationale was that since the sole motivation of mercenaries is their pay, they will not be inclined to take the kind of risks that can turn the tide of a battle, but may cost them their lives. He also noted that a mercenary who failed was obviously no good, but one who succeeded may be even more dangerous. He astutely pointed out that a successful mercenary army no longer needs its employer if it is more militarily powerful than its supposed superior. This explained the frequent, violent betrayals that characterized mercenary/client relations in Italy, because neither side trusted the other. He believed that citizens with a real attachment to their home country will be more motivated to defend it and thus make much better soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe [[Stratioti]] or Stradioti (Italian: Stradioti or Stradiotti; Greek: \u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, Stratiotes) were mercenary units from the Balkans recruited mainly by states of southern and central Europe from the 15th until the middle of the 18th century. The stradioti were recruited in Albania, Greece, Dalmatia, Serbia and later Cyprus. Most modern historians have indicated that the Stratioti were mostly Albanians. According to a study by a Greek author, around 80% of the listed names attributed to the stradioti were of Albanian origin while most of the remaining ones, especially those of officers, were of Greek origin; a small minority were of South Slavic origin. Among their leaders there were also members of some old Byzantine Greek noble families such as the Palaiologi and Comneni.\nThe stratioti were pioneers of light cavalry tactics during this era. In the early 16th century heavy cavalry in the European armies was principally remodeled after Albanian stradioti of the Venetian army, Hungarian [[hussars]] and German mercenary cavalry units (Schwarzreitern). They employed hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, feigned retreats and other complex maneuvers. In some ways, these tactics echoed those of the Ottoman sipahis and akinci. They had some notable successes also against French heavy cavalry during the Italian Wars.\nThey were known for cutting off the heads of dead or captured enemies, and according to [[Philippe de Commines|Commines]] they were paid by their leaders one [[ducat]] per head.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn Italy, during inter-family conflicts such as the [[Wars of Castro]], mercenaries were widely used to supplement the much smaller forces loyal to particular families.<ref>[http://books..au/books?id=nVWUluw8X8wC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=%22mercenaries%22+%22war+of+castro%22&source=bl&ots=VuzmVa8l53&sig=Hrm8VtOODq8VKLmPw-lgT17nXBU&hl=en&ei=7gU0TKrjOofJccf6hd0D&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22mercenaries%22%20%22war%20of%20castro%22&f=false ''A Companion to Vergil's Aeneid and Its Tradition''] by Joseph Farrell & Michael C.

Historian [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]] notes that 40,000 Scotsmen (about fifteen percent of the adult male population) served as soldiers in Continental Europe from 1618 to 1640.<ref>Geoffrey Parker (2001).

Wiley-Blackwell. p.17. {{ISBN|0-631-22028-3}}</ref>\nAfter the signing of the [[Treaty of Limerick]] (1691) the soldiers of the Irish Army who left Ireland for France took part in what is known as the ''[[Flight of the Wild Geese]]''. Subsequently, many made a living from fighting in continental armies, the most famous of whom was [[Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan|Patrick Sarsfield]], who, having fallen mortally wounded at the [[Battle of Landen]] fighting for the French, said \"If this was only for Ireland\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indigo.ie/~wildgees/sarsfiel.htm|title=Wild Geese Heritage Museum and Library \u2013 Patrick Sarsfield}}</ref>\n\nThe brutality of the Thirty Years' War, in which several parts of Germany were ransacked by the mercenary troops, and left almost unpopulated, led to the formation of standing armies of professional soldiers, recruited locally or abroad. These armies were active also in peacetime. The formation of these armies in the late 18th century led to professionalization and standardization of clothing (uniforms), equipment, drill, weapons, etc. Since smaller states like the Dutch Republic could afford a large standing army, but could not find enough recruits among its own citizens, recruiting foreigners was common. Prussia had developed a form of conscription, but relied in wartime also on foreign recruits, although the regulations state that no more than one third of the recruits were to be foreign. Prussian recruiting methods were often aggressive, and resulted more than once in conflicts with neighbouring states. The term mercenary gained its notoriety during this development, since mercenaries were- and now are- often seen as soldiers who fight for no noble cause, but only for money, and who have no loyalty than to the highest bidder, as opposed to the professional soldiers who takes an oath of loyalty and who is seen as the defender of the nation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe mercenary soldiers thus fell out of favour and was replaced by the professional soldier. To augment the army, major European powers like France, Britain, the Dutch Republic and Spain contracted regiments from Switzerland, the Southern Netherlands (modern day Belgium), and several smaller German states. About a third of the infantry regiments of the French Royal Army prior to the [[French Revolution]] were recruited from outside France. The largest single group were the twelve Swiss regiments (including the [[Swiss Guard]]). Other units were German and one [[Irish Brigade (French)|Irish Brigade]] (the \"[[Flight of the Wild Geese#French service|Wild Geese]]\") had originally been made up of Irish volunteers. By 1789 difficulties in obtaining genuinely Irish recruits had led to German and other foreigners making up the bulk of the rank and file. The officers however continued to be drawn from long established Franco-Irish families. During the reign of Louis XV there were also a Scottish (''[[Garde \u00c9cossaise]]''), a Swedish (''[[Royal-Su\u00e9dois]]''), an Italian (''[[Royal-Italien]]'') and a Walloon (''[[Horion-Liegeois]]'') regiments recruited outside the borders of France. The foreign infantry regiments comprised about 20,000 men in 1733, rising to 48,000 at the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] and being reduced in numbers thereafter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Dutch Republic had contracted several Scots, Swiss and German regiments in the early 18th century, and kept three Scots, one Walloon, and six Swiss regiments (including a Guard regiment raised in 1749) throughout the 18th century. The Scots regiments were contracted from Great Britain, but as relations between Britain and the Republic deteriorated, the regiments could no longer recruit in Scotland, leading to the regiments being Scots in name only until they were nationalized in 1784.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Spanish Army also made use of permanently established foreign regiments. These were three [[Flight of the Wild Geese#Spanish service|Irish regiments]] (Irlanda, Hiberni and Ultonia); one Italian (Naples) and five Swiss (Wimpssen, Reding, Betschart, Traxer and Preux). In addition one regiment of the [[Spanish Royal Guard|Royal Guard]] including Irishmen as ''Patten'', ''McDonnell'' and ''Neiven'', was recruited from [[Walloon Guards|Walloons]]. The last of these foreign regiments was disbanded in 1815, following recruiting difficulties during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. One complication arising from the use of non-national troops occurred at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] in 1808 when the \"red Swiss\" (so-called from their uniforms) of the invading French Army clashed bloodily with \"[[blue Swiss]]\" in the Spanish service.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], the British government hired several regiments of the German principalities to supplement the Army. Although the German troops came from a number of states, the majority came from the German state of Hesse-Kassel.

Article 47 of the protocol provides the most widely accepted international definition of a mercenary, though not endorsed by some countries, including the United States. The ''Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts'', ([[Protocol I]]), 8 June 1977 states:\n\n{{quote|Art 47. Mercenaries\n:1. A mercenary shall not have the right to be a combatant or a prisoner of war.\n:2. A mercenary is any person who:\n::(a)&nbsp;is especially recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict;\n::(b)&nbsp;does, in fact, take a direct part in the hostilities;\n::(c)&nbsp;is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and, in fact, is promised, by or on behalf of a Party to the conflict, material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that Party;\n::(d)&nbsp;is neither a national of a Party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict;\n::(e)&nbsp;is not a member of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict; and\n::(f)&nbsp;has not been sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.}}\n\nAll the criteria (a \u2013 f) must be met, according to the Geneva Convention, for a combatant to be described as a mercenary.\n\nAccording to the [[Third Geneva Convention|GC III]], a captured soldier must be treated as a lawful [[combatant]] and, therefore, as a protected person with prisoner-of-war status until facing a [[competent tribunal]] (GC III Art 5). That tribunal, using criteria in APGC77 or some equivalent domestic law, may decide that the soldier is a mercenary. At that juncture, the mercenary soldier becomes an [[unlawful combatant]] but still must be \"treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial\", being still covered by [[Fourth Geneva Convention|GC IV]] Art 5. The only possible exception to GC IV Art 5 is when he is a national of the authority imprisoning him, in which case he would not be a mercenary soldier as defined in APGC77 Art 47.d.\n\nIf, after a regular trial, a captured soldier is found to be a mercenary, then he can expect treatment as a common criminal and may face execution. As mercenary soldiers may not qualify as PoWs, they cannot expect repatriation at war's end. The best known post-World War II example of this was on 28 June 1976 when, at the end of the [[Luanda Trial]], an Angolan court sentenced three Britons and an American to death and nine other mercenaries to prison terms ranging from 16 to 30 years. The four mercenaries sentenced to death were shot by a firing squad on 10 July 1976.<ref name=\"bbc_june28\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/28/newsid_2520000/2520575.stm 1976: Death sentence for mercenaries] [[BBC]] On this day 28 June</ref>\n\nThe legal status of civilian contractors depends upon the nature of their work and their nationalities with respect to that of the combatants. If they have not \"in fact, taken a direct part in the hostilities\" (APGC77 Art 47.b), they are not mercenaries but civilians who have non-combat support roles and are entitled to protection under the Third Geneva Convention (GCIII 4.1.4).\n\nOn 4 December 1989, the United Nations passed resolution 44/34, the ''International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries''.

Article 1.1 is similar to Article 47 of Protocol I, however Article 1.2 broadens the definition to include a non-national recruited to overthrow a \"Government or otherwise undermining the constitutional order of a State; or Undermin[e] the territorial integrity of a State;\" and \"Is motivated to take part therein essentially by the desire for significant private gain and is prompted by the promise or payment of material compensation...\" \u2013 under Article 1.2 a person does not have to take a direct part in the hostilities in a planned ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' to be a mercenary.\n\nCritics have argued that the convention and ''APGC77 Art. 47'' are designed to cover the activities of mercenaries in post-colonial Africa and do not address adequately the use of [[Private military company|private military companies (PMCs)]] by sovereign states.<ref>Milliard [[#References|References]] Page 5.

While the United States governed Iraq, no U.S. citizen working as an armed guard could be classified as a mercenary because he was ''a national of a Party to the conflict'' (APGC77 Art 47.d). With the hand-over of power to the Iraqi government, if one does not consider the coalition forces to be continuing parties to the conflict in Iraq, but that their soldiers are \"sent by a State which is not a Party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces\" (APGC77 Art 47.f), then, unless U.S. citizens working as armed guards are lawfully certified residents of Iraq, i.e., \"a resident of territory controlled by a Party to the conflict\" (APGC77 Art 47.d), and they are involved with a fire-fight in the continuing conflict, they are mercenary soldiers. However, those who acknowledge the United States and other coalition forces as continuing parties to the conflict might insist that U.S. armed guards cannot be called mercenaries (APGC77 Art 47.d).\n\n=== National laws ===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\nThe laws of some countries forbid their citizens to fight in foreign wars unless they are under the control of their own national armed forces.<ref>{{cite web|author=Independent Online|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=13&art_id=vn20060910084637879C193049|title=South Africa|publisher=Iol.co.za|accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bciclr/28_1/07_TXT.htm|title=The laws in some countries|publisher=Bc.edu|date=12 August 1949|accessdate=26 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917043646/http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bciclr/28_1/07_TXT.htm|archivedate=17 September 2006}}</ref>\n\n==== Austria ====\nIf a person is proven to have worked as a mercenary for any other country while retaining Austrian citizenship, his or her Austrian citizenship will be revoked.\n\n==== France ====\nIn 2003, France criminalized mercenary activities, as defined by the protocol to the Geneva convention for French citizens, permanent residents and legal entities (Penal Code, [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CPENALLL.rcv&art=436-1 L436-1], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CPENALLL.rcv&art=436-2 L436-2], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CPENALLL.rcv&art=436-3 L436-3], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CPENALLL.rcv&art=436-4 L436-4], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CPENALLL.rcv&art=436-5 L436-5]).

In 2005, the legislation was reviewed by the government because of South African citizens working as security guards in [[Iraq]] during the [[History of Iraq (2003\u20132011)|American occupation of Iraq]] and the consequences of the mercenary soldier sponsorship case against [[Mark Thatcher]] for the \"possible funding and logistical assistance in relation to an alleged attempted coup in [[Equatorial Guinea]]\" organized by [[Simon Mann]].<ref>[[Reuters]] [http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L1143048.htm South Africa to review mercenary law, targets Iraq] February 2005</ref>\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nIn the United Kingdom, the Foreign Enlistment Act 1819 and the [[Foreign Enlistment Act 1870]] make it unlawful for British subjects to join the armed forces of any state warring with another state at peace with Britain. In the [[Greek War of Independence]], British volunteers fought with the Greek rebels, which could have been unlawful per the Foreign Enlistment Act. It was unclear whether or not the Greek rebels were a 'state', but the law was clarified to state that the rebels were a state.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe British government considered using the Act against British subjects fighting for the [[International Brigades|International Brigade]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the [[National Liberation Front of Angola|FNLA]] in the [[Angolan Civil War]], but in the end, it chose on both occasions not to do so.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== United States ====\nThe [[Anti-Pinkerton Act|Anti-Pinkerton Act of 1893]] ({{usc|5|3108}}) forbade the U.S. government from using [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] employees, or similar private police companies. In 1977, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] interpreted this statute as forbidding the U.S. government from employing companies offering \"mercenary, quasi-military forces\" for hire (United States ex rel. ''Weinberger v. Equifax'', 557 F.2d 456, 462 (5th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1035 (1978)). There is a disagreement over whether or not this proscription is limited to the use of such forces as strikebreakers, because it is stated thus:\n\n{{quote|The purpose of the Act and the legislative history reveal that an organization was \"similar\" to the Pinkerton Detective Agency only if it offered for hire mercenary, quasi-military forces as strikebreakers and armed guards. It had the secondary effect of deterring any other organization from providing such services lest it be branded a \"similar organization.\" The legislative history supports this view and no other. | United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit | Weinberger v. Equifax, 1977}}\n\nIn the 7 June 1978 Letter to the Heads of Federal Departments and Agencies, the Comptroller General interpreted this decision in a way that carved out an exemption for \"Guard and Protective Services\".\n\nA U.S. Department of Defense interim rule (effective 16 June 2006) revises DoD Instruction 3020.41 to authorize contractors, other than private security contractors, to use deadly force against enemy armed forces only in self-defense (71 Fed. Reg. 34826). Per that interim rule, private security contractors are authorized to use deadly force when protecting their client's assets and persons, consistent with their contract's [[mission statement]]. One interpretation is that this authorizes contractors to engage in combat on behalf of the U.S. government. It is the combatant commander's responsibility to ensure that private security contract mission statements do not authorize performance of inherently governmental military functions, i.e. preemptive attacks or assaults or raids, etc.\n\nOtherwise, civilians with U.S. Armed Forces lose their law of war protection from direct attack if and for such time as they directly participate in hostilities. On 18 August 2006, the U.S. Comptroller General rejected bid protest arguments that U.S. Army contracts violated the Anti-Pinkerton Act by requiring that contractors provide armed convoy escort vehicles and labor, weapons, and equipment for internal security operations at Victory Base Complex, Iraq. The Comptroller General reasoned the act was unviolated, because the contracts did not require contractors to provide quasi-military forces as strikebreakers.<ref>Brian X.

Scott did not submit a bid; however, when the bidders who did submit a bid tried to protest at the GAO, their GAO bid protests were dismissed due to the fact that Scott had filed a case at the court and deprived the GAO of further jurisdiction in the matter.

Military advisers and generals trained through the works of [[Mozi]] and [[Sun Tzu]] would regularly offer their services to kings and dukes.\n\nAfter the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] conquest of the Warring States, the Qin and later [[Han Dynasty|Han]] Empires would also employ mercenaries \u2013 ranging from nomadic horse archers in the Northern steppes or soldiers from the [[Yue (state)|Yue]] kingdoms of the South. The 7th century [[Tang Dynasty]] was also prominent for its use of mercenaries, when they hired [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] soldiers against invasion from the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]] and other steppe civilizations.<ref>''Ancient Chinese Civilization'' {{ISBN|978-1-404-28035-9}} p. 12</ref>\n\n==== 15th to 18th centuries ====\nThe Saika mercenary group<ref>\u96d1\u8cc0\u8846, ''[[:ja:\u96d1\u8cc0\u8846|saikashuu]]''</ref> of the [[Kii Province]], Japan, played a significant role during the [[Siege of Ishiyama Hongan-ji]] that took place between August 1570 to August 1580. The Saikashuu were famed for the support of [[Ikk\u014d-sh\u016b|Ikk\u014d]] Buddhist sect movements and greatly impeded the advance of [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s forces.\n\n[[Ninja]] were peasant farmers who learned the art of war to combat the ''[[daimy\u014d]]''{{'}}s samurai. They were hired out by many as mercenaries to perform capture, infiltration and retrieval, and, most famously, assassinations.

So in 1941 the Roosevelt administration authorized the formation of three [[American Volunteer Group]]s, of which the 1st AVG was deployed to Burma and China and became famous as the [[Flying Tigers]]. The pilots earned $600\u2013$750 basic pay per month, plus $500 for each Japanese aircraft confirmed destroyed in the air or on the ground.<ref>Daniel Ford, ''Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941\u20131942'', HarperCollins 2007, pp.44\u201345</ref> The 2nd AVG, a bomber group, was recruited in November 1941 but aborted following the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]].\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n==== Classical era ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\nMany [[Greeks|Greek]] mercenaries fought for the [[Persian Empire]] during the early classic era. For example:\n* [[Xerxes I]], king of Persia, who invaded [[Greece]] in 484&nbsp;BC employed Greek mercenaries.\n* In [[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]], [[Xenophon]] recounts how [[Cyrus the Younger]] hired a large army of Greek mercenaries (the \"[[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]]\") in 401&nbsp;BC to seize the throne of Persia from his brother, [[Artaxerxes II]]. Though Cyrus' army was victorious at the [[Battle of Cunaxa]], Cyrus himself was killed in battle and the expedition rendered moot. Stranded deep in enemy territory, the Spartan general [[Clearchus of Sparta|Clearchus]] and most of the other Greek generals were subsequently killed by treachery. Xenophon played an instrumental role in encouraging \"The Ten Thousand\" Greek army to march north to the [[Black Sea]] in an epic fighting retreat.\n* The [[Sileraioi]] were a group of ancient mercenaries most likely employed by the tyrant [[Dionysius I of Syracuse]].\n* [[Memnon of Rhodes]] (380 \u2013 333&nbsp;BC): was the commander of the Greek mercenaries working for the Persian King [[Darius III]] when [[Alexander the Great]] of [[Macedon]]ia invaded Persia in 334&nbsp;BC and won the [[Battle of the Granicus River]]. Alexander also employed Greek mercenaries during his campaigns. These were men who fought for him directly and not those who fought in city-state units attached to his army.\n* [[Carthage]] contracted [[Balearic Islands]] shepherds as [[Sling (weapon)|slingers]] during the [[Punic Wars]] against Rome. The vast majority of the Carthaginian military \u2013 except the highest officers, the navy, and the [[Sacred Band of Carthage|home guard]] \u2013 were mercenaries.\n* Members of independent [[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes such as the [[Bessi]] and [[Dii]] often joined the ranks of large organized armies as mercenaries.\n* The [[Mamertines|Sons of Mars]] were Italian mercenaries used by the Greek kings of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] until after the [[Punic Wars]].\n* A figure in oral legend, [[Milesius]] was given the princess [[Scota]] after conducting a successful campaign for [[Ancient Egypt]].\n* [[Mithridates VI Eupator]] recruited a large number of [[Persian people|Iranians]] along with the Galatians into the [[Pontic Greeks|Pontic]] army during the [[Mithridatic Wars]] against Rome, using the [[Leucosyri]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Scythians]].\n* [[Illyrians]] were hired across the [[Balkans]] and further. They were known for their unreliability.\n\nIn the late [[Roman Empire]], it became increasingly difficult for Emperors and generals to raise military units from the citizenry for various reasons: lack of manpower, lack of time available for training, lack of materials, and, inevitably, political considerations. Therefore, beginning in the late 4th century, the empire often contracted whole bands of [[barbarian]]s either within the [[Roman legion|legions]] or as autonomous [[foederati]]. The barbarians were [[Romanization|Romanized]] and surviving veterans were established in areas requiring population. The [[Varangian Guard]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] is the best known formation made up of barbarian mercenaries (see next section).\n\n==== Medieval warfare ====\n{{see also|Routiers|Bertrand du Guesclin}}\n[[File:Turkic mercenary in Byzantine service - 1436 \u2013 PISANELLO.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Oghuz Turks|Turkish]] mercenary in Byzantine service c. 1436]]\n[[Byzantine Emperors]] followed the Roman practice and contracted foreigners especially for their personal [[corps]] guard called the [[Varangian Guard]]. They were chosen among war-prone peoples, of whom the [[Varangian]]s (Norsemen) were preferred. Their mission was to protect the Emperor and Empire and since they did not have links to the Greeks, they were expected to be ready to suppress rebellions. One of the most famous guards was the future king [[Harald III of Norway]], also known as Harald Hardrada (\"Hard-counsel\"), who arrived in Constantinople in 1035 and was employed as a Varangian Guard. He participated in eighteen battles and was promoted to ''akolythos'', the commander of the Guard, before returning home in 1043. He was killed at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] in 1066 when his army was defeated by an English army commanded by King [[Harold Godwinson]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn England at the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], [[Flemish people|Flemings]] (natives of [[Flanders]]) formed a substantial mercenary element in the forces of [[William the Conqueror]] with many remaining in England as settlers under the [[Normans]]. Contingents of mercenary [[Flemish]] soldiers were to form significant forces in England throughout the time of the Norman and early [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] dynasties (11th and 12th centuries). A prominent example of these were the Flemings who fought during the English civil wars, known as [[the Anarchy]] or [[the Nineteen-Year Winter]] (AD 1135 to 1154), under the command of [[William of Ypres]], who was [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]]'s chief lieutenant from 1139 to 1154 and who was made Earl of Kent by Stephen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}\n\nIn Italy, the ''condottiero'' was a military chief offering his troops, the [[condottieri]], to [[city-state]]s. During the ages of the [[Taifa]] kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, Christian knights like [[El Cid]] could fight for some Muslim ruler against his Christian or Muslim enemies. The [[Almogavars]] originally fought for [[Catalonia]] and [[Aragon]], but as the [[Catalan Company]], they followed [[Roger de Flor]] in the service of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Catalan and German mercenaries also had prominent role in the Serbian victory over Bulgarians in the [[Battle of Velbuzd]] in 1330.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDuring the later Middle Ages, [[Free Companies]] (or ''Free Lances'') were formed, consisting of companies of mercenary troops. Nation-states lacked the funds needed to maintain standing forces, so they tended to hire free companies to serve in their armies during wartime. Such companies typically formed at the ends of periods of conflict, when men-at-arms were no longer needed by their respective governments. The veteran soldiers thus looked for other forms of employment, often becoming mercenaries. Free Companies would often specialize in forms of combat that required longer periods of training that was not available in the form of a mobilized militia. The [[White Company]]<ref>[[Project Gutenberg]] e-text of ''[http://www.gutenberg.net/etext/903 The White Company]'' by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]</ref> commanded by Sir [[John Hawkwood]] is the best known English Free Company of the 14th century. Between the 13th and 17th Century the [[Gallowglass]] fought within the Islands of Britain and also mainland Europe. A Welshman [[Owain Lawgoch]] (Owain of the Red Hand) formed a free company and fought for the French against the English during [[the Hundred Years' War]], before being assassinated by a Scot by the name of Jon Lamb under the orders of the English Crown in 1378 during the [[siege of Mortagne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.100welshheroes.com/en/biography/owainlawgoch|title=Owain Lawgoch (English:Owain of the Red Hand, French:Yvain de Galles)|publisher=100welshheroes.com|accessdate=26 May 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124191956/http://www.100welshheroes.com/en/biography/owainlawgoch|archivedate=24 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== 15th and 16th centuries ====\n[[File:Landsknechte.jpg|thumb|230px|Landsknechte, [[etching]] by [[Daniel Hopfer]], ''c.'' 1530.]]\n[[Swiss mercenaries]] were sought during the late 15th and early 16th centuries as being an effective fighting force, until their somewhat rigid battle formations became vulnerable to [[Harquebus|arquebuses]] and [[artillery]] being developed at the same time. ''See [[Swiss Guard]].''\n\nIt was then that the German [[landsknecht]]s, colorful mercenaries with a redoubtable reputation, took over the Swiss forces' legacy and became the most formidable force of the late 15th and throughout the 16th century, being hired by all the powers in Europe and often fighting at opposite sides. Sir [[Thomas More]] in his [[Utopia (Novel)|Utopia]] advocated the use of mercenaries in preference to citizens. The barbarian mercenaries employed by the Utopians are thought to be inspired by the Swiss mercenaries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nA class of mercenaries known as the [[Gallowglass]] dominated warfare in Ireland and Scotland between the 13th and 16th centuries. They were a heavily armed and armored elite force that often doubled as a chieftain's bodyguard.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt approximately the same period, [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] argued against the use of mercenary armies in his book of political advice ''[[The Prince]]''. His rationale was that since the sole motivation of mercenaries is their pay, they will not be inclined to take the kind of risks that can turn the tide of a battle, but may cost them their lives. He also noted that a mercenary who failed was obviously no good, but one who succeeded may be even more dangerous. He astutely pointed out that a successful mercenary army no longer needs its employer if it is more militarily powerful than its supposed superior. This explained the frequent, violent betrayals that characterized mercenary/client relations in Italy, because neither side trusted the other. He believed that citizens with a real attachment to their home country will be more motivated to defend it and thus make much better soldiers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe [[Stratioti]] or Stradioti (Italian: Stradioti or Stradiotti; Greek: \u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, Stratiotes) were mercenary units from the Balkans recruited mainly by states of southern and central Europe from the 15th until the middle of the 18th century. The stradioti were recruited in Albania, Greece, Dalmatia, Serbia and later Cyprus. Most modern historians have indicated that the Stratioti were mostly Albanians. According to a study by a Greek author, around 80% of the listed names attributed to the stradioti were of Albanian origin while most of the remaining ones, especially those of officers, were of Greek origin; a small minority were of South Slavic origin. Among their leaders there were also members of some old Byzantine Greek noble families such as the Palaiologi and Comneni.\nThe stratioti were pioneers of light cavalry tactics during this era. In the early 16th century heavy cavalry in the European armies was principally remodeled after Albanian stradioti of the Venetian army, Hungarian [[hussars]] and German mercenary cavalry units (Schwarzreitern). They employed hit-and-run tactics, ambushes, feigned retreats and other complex maneuvers. In some ways, these tactics echoed those of the Ottoman sipahis and akinci. They had some notable successes also against French heavy cavalry during the Italian Wars.\nThey were known for cutting off the heads of dead or captured enemies, and according to [[Philippe de Commines|Commines]] they were paid by their leaders one [[ducat]] per head.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn Italy, during inter-family conflicts such as the [[Wars of Castro]], mercenaries were widely used to supplement the much smaller forces loyal to particular families.<ref>[http://books..au/books?id=nVWUluw8X8wC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=%22mercenaries%22+%22war+of+castro%22&source=bl&ots=VuzmVa8l53&sig=Hrm8VtOODq8VKLmPw-lgT17nXBU&hl=en&ei=7gU0TKrjOofJccf6hd0D&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22mercenaries%22%20%22war%20of%20castro%22&f=false ''A Companion to Vergil's Aeneid and Its Tradition''] by Joseph Farrell & Michael C. J. Putnam, 2010</ref> Often these were further supplemented by troops loyal to particular ''[[Italian nobility|duchies]]'' which had sided with one or more of the belligerents.\n\n==== 17th and 18th centuries ====\n[[File:Bondi brennandi hus.jpg|thumb|210px|A peasant begs a mercenary for mercy in front of his burning farm during the [[Thirty Years' War]].]]\nDuring the 17th and 18th century extensive use was made of foreign recruits in the now regimented and highly drilled armies of Europe, beginning in a systematized way with the [[Thirty Years' War]]. Historian [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]] notes that 40,000 Scotsmen (about fifteen percent of the adult male population) served as soldiers in Continental Europe from 1618 to 1640.<ref>Geoffrey Parker (2001). ''[http://books./books?id=qy8y8rHgucoC&pg=PA17&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Europe in crisis, 1598\u20131648]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''. Wiley-Blackwell. p.17. {{ISBN|0-631-22028-3}}</ref>\nAfter the signing of the [[Treaty of Limerick]] (1691) the soldiers of the Irish Army who left Ireland for France took part in what is known as the ''[[Flight of the Wild Geese]]''. Subsequently, many made a living from fighting in continental armies, the most famous of whom was [[Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan|Patrick Sarsfield]], who, having fallen mortally wounded at the [[Battle of Landen]] fighting for the French, said \"If this was only for Ireland\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indigo.ie/~wildgees/sarsfiel.htm|title=Wild Geese Heritage Museum and Library \u2013 Patrick Sarsfield}}</ref>\n\nThe brutality of the Thirty Years' War, in which several parts of Germany were ransacked by the mercenary troops, and left almost unpopulated, led to the formation of standing armies of professional soldiers, recruited locally or abroad. These armies were active also in peacetime. The formation of these armies in the late 18th century led to professionalization and standardization of clothing (uniforms), equipment, drill, weapons, etc. Since smaller states like the Dutch Republic could afford a large standing army, but could not find enough recruits among its own citizens, recruiting foreigners was common. Prussia had developed a form of conscription, but relied in wartime also on foreign recruits, although the regulations state that no more than one third of the recruits were to be foreign. Prussian recruiting methods were often aggressive, and resulted more than once in conflicts with neighbouring states. The term mercenary gained its notoriety during this development, since mercenaries were- and now are- often seen as soldiers who fight for no noble cause, but only for money, and who have no loyalty than to the highest bidder, as opposed to the professional soldiers who takes an oath of loyalty and who is seen as the defender of the nation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe mercenary soldiers thus fell out of favour and was replaced by the professional soldier. To augment the army, major European powers like France, Britain, the Dutch Republic and Spain contracted regiments from Switzerland, the Southern Netherlands (modern day Belgium), and several smaller German states. About a third of the infantry regiments of the French Royal Army prior to the [[French Revolution]] were recruited from outside France. The largest single group were the twelve Swiss regiments (including the [[Swiss Guard]]). Other units were German and one [[Irish Brigade (French)|Irish Brigade]] (the \"[[Flight of the Wild Geese#French service|Wild Geese]]\") had originally been made up of Irish volunteers. By 1789 difficulties in obtaining genuinely Irish recruits had led to German and other foreigners making up the bulk of the rank and file. The officers however continued to be drawn from long established Franco-Irish families. During the reign of Louis XV there were also a Scottish (''[[Garde \u00c9cossaise]]''), a Swedish (''[[Royal-Su\u00e9dois]]''), an Italian (''[[Royal-Italien]]'') and a Walloon (''[[Horion-Liegeois]]'') regiments recruited outside the borders of France. The foreign infantry regiments comprised about 20,000 men in 1733, rising to 48,000 at the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] and being reduced in numbers thereafter.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Dutch Republic had contracted several Scots, Swiss and German regiments in the early 18th century, and kept three Scots, one Walloon, and six Swiss regiments (including a Guard regiment raised in 1749) throughout the 18th century. The Scots regiments were contracted from Great Britain, but as relations between Britain and the Republic deteriorated, the regiments could no longer recruit in Scotland, leading to the regiments being Scots in name only until they were nationalized in 1784.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Spanish Army also made use of permanently established foreign regiments. These were three [[Flight of the Wild Geese#Spanish service|Irish regiments]] (Irlanda, Hiberni and Ultonia); one Italian (Naples) and five Swiss (Wimpssen, Reding, Betschart, Traxer and Preux). In addition one regiment of the [[Spanish Royal Guard|Royal Guard]] including Irishmen as ''Patten'', ''McDonnell'' and ''Neiven'', was recruited from [[Walloon Guards|Walloons]]. The last of these foreign regiments was disbanded in 1815, following recruiting difficulties during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. One complication arising from the use of non-national troops occurred at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] in 1808 when the \"red Swiss\" (so-called from their uniforms) of the invading French Army clashed bloodily with \"[[blue Swiss]]\" in the Spanish service.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], the British government hired several regiments of the German principalities to supplement the Army. Although the German troops came from a number of states, the majority came from the German state of Hesse-Kassel. This resulted in their American opponents referring to all of the German troops as \"[[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]]\", whether the Germans were actually from Hesse-Kassel or not. The \"Hessians\" were over time, especially during the 19th and 20th centuries, dubbed 'mercenaries', so as to present the struggle of the Americans, seen as free citizens fighting for their independence, as opposite to the armies of the 'tyrant' King George III, composed of British troops who were mere 'slaves' being whipped into obedience, and ruthless Hessian mercenaries, fighting for money.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n==== 19th\u201321st centuries ====\nThe [[Atholl Highlanders]], a private Scottish infantry regiment of the [[Duke of Atholl]], was formed in 1839 purely for ceremonial purposes. It was granted official regimental status by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1845 and is the only remaining legal private army in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Middle East ===\n\n==== Syrian Civil War ====\n[[File:Mercenary.jpg|thumb|right|A banner on the wall of the office of the [[Mahdi Army]] in [[Al Diwaniyah]], [[Iraq]] announcing the killing of one of the militia members in Syria]]\n\nThe [[Free Syrian Army]] claimed the [[Bashar al-Assad]] regime recruited mercenaries from [[Iran]], [[Hezbollah]] militia and the [[Iraq]]i [[Mahdi Army]] militia during the [[Syrian Civil War]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/syria-rebels-assad-regime-recruiting-iranian-hezbollah-mercenaries-1.398010|title=Syria rebels: Assad regime recruiting Iranian, Hezbollah mercenaries|publisher=Associated Press/Haaretz|date=27 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,15779420,00.html|title=Baghdad funnelling pro-Assad militias to Syria|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=3 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Yemen Civil War====\n{{main|Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)}}\nMultiple mercenary groups, called [[Popular Committees (Yemen)|Popular Committees]], which consists of Yemeni tribes loyal to different factions, were formed by both the [[Cabinet of Yemen|Hadi government]] as well as the Houthi [[Supreme Political Council]] in the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015\u2013present)|Yemeni Civil War]].\n\n====Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen====\n{{main|Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen}}\nDuring operation Decisive Storm, multiple sources reported that [[Latin American]] military contractors from [[Academi]] headed by [[Erik Prince]] were hired by [[UAE Armed Forces]] to assist in the fight against [[Houthis]].<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestiefer/2015/11/26/in-yemen-war-mercenaries-launched-by-blackwater-head-were-spotted-today-not-good-news/ In Yemen War, Mercenaries Launched By Blackwater Head Were Spotted Today \u2013 Not Good News] ''[[Forbes]]''</ref>\n\n==Notable mercenaries==\n{{main|List of mercenaries}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|History|War|}}\n* [[Dutch Blue Guards]]\n* [[Filibuster (military)]]\n* [[Freelancer]]\n* [[Independent contractor]]\n* [[International Stability Operations Association]]\n* [[Law of war]]\n* [[Mercenaries in popular culture]]\n* [[Irish and German Mercenary Soldiers' Revolt|Mercenary Soldiers' Revolt in Brazil]]\n* [[Mercenary War]] ([[Circa|c.]] 240&nbsp;BC) \u2013 also called the ''Libyan War'' and the ''Truceless War'' by [[Polybius]] \u2013 was an uprising of mercenary armies formerly in the employ of [[Carthage]], backed by Libyan settlements revolting against Carthaginian control.\n* [[Montreux Document]]\n* [[Personal Security Detachment]]\n* [[Private defense agency]]\n* [[Private intelligence agency]]\n* [[Private military company]]\n* [[Privateer|Privateer (Naval)]]\n* [[Special forces]]\n* [[Special operations]]\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources==\n* Bernales-Ballesteros, Enrique; ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20081224002931/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/7/b/mercenaries/documents.htm UNHCHR: Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on use of mercenaries]''\n* Bodin J; ''Les Suisses au Service de la France''; Editions Albion Michael, 1988. {{ISBN|2-226-03334-3}}\n* Chartrand, Rene; ''Louis XV's Army \u2013 Foreign Infantry''; Osprey 1997. {{ISBN|1-85532-623-X}}\n* Chartrand, Rene; ''Spanish Army of the Napoleonic Wars 1793\u20131808''; Osprey 1998. {{ISBN|1-85532-763-5}}\n* Milliard, Todd S.; [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&AD=ADA440071 Overcoming post-colonial myopia: A call to recognize and regulate private military companies](PDF), in [[Military Law Review]] Vol 173, June 2003.
