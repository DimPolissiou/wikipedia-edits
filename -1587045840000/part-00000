The park is bounded by [[110th Street (Manhattan)|110th Street]] to the south, [[123rd Street (Manhattan)|123rd Street]] to the north, Morningside Avenue to the east, and [[Morningside Drive (Manhattan)|Morningside Drive]] to the west; it forms the border between the neighborhoods of [[Harlem]] and [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] to the east and west, respectively. Much of the park is adjacent to [[Columbia University]], located on the western border.\n\nMorningside Park is operated by [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]. Its natural geography contains a cliff of [[Manhattan schist]] rock that separates the high terrain of Morningside Heights and the low terrain of Harlem. In addition, several rock outcroppings and a man-made ornamental pond and waterfall are located within the park. The park also contains three sculptures, as well as several athletic fields, playgrounds, and an [[arboretum]].\n\nThe area near Morningside Park was originally known as \"Muscota\" by the [[Lenape]] Native Americans. The park was first proposed by the [[Central Park]] commissioners in 1867, and the city commissioned Central Park's designers [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]] to produce a design for the park in 1873. Though [[Jacob Wrey Mould]] was hired to design new plans in 1880, little progress occurred until Olmsted and Vaux were asked to modify the plans following Mould's 1886 death; construction was completed in 1895. Monuments were installed between 1900 and 1914, followed by [[softball diamond]]s, [[basketball court]]s, and [[playgrounds]] between the 1930s and 1950s. After Columbia proposed building a gym in the park in 1963, [[Columbia University protests of 1968|major student protests arose in 1968]], resulting in the eventual abandonment of the plan. In the late 20th century, Morningside Park gained a reputation for high crime, and various groups made plans to renovate the park. The proposed site of the Columbia gym was turned into a waterfall and pond in 1990, and the arboretum was added to the park in 1998.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Morningside Park Willow Tree.jpg|thumb|Morningside Park's distinctive cliff of Manhattan schist.

The park is bounded by [[110th Street (Manhattan)|110th Street]] to the south, [[123rd Street (Manhattan)|123rd Street]] to the north, Morningside Avenue to the east, and [[Morningside Drive (Manhattan)|Morningside Drive]] to the west; it forms the border between the neighborhoods of [[Harlem]] and [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] to the east and west, respectively. Much of the park is adjacent to [[Columbia University]], located on the western border.\n\nMorningside Park is operated by [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]]. Its natural geography contains a cliff of [[Manhattan schist]] rock that separates the high terrain of Morningside Heights and the low terrain of Harlem. In addition, several rock outcroppings and a man-made ornamental pond and waterfall are located within the park. The park also contains three sculptures, as well as several athletic fields, playgrounds, and an [[arboretum]].\n\nThe area near Morningside Park was originally known as \"Muscota\" by the [[Lenape]] Native Americans. The park was first proposed by the [[Central Park]] commissioners in 1867, and the city commissioned Central Park's designers [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]] to produce a design for the park in 1873. Though [[Jacob Wrey Mould]] was hired to design new plans in 1880, little progress occurred until Olmsted and Vaux were asked to modify the plans following Mould's 1886 death; construction was completed in 1895. Monuments were installed between 1900 and 1914, followed by [[softball diamond]]s, [[basketball court]]s, and [[playgrounds]] between the 1930s and 1950s. After Columbia proposed building a gym in the park in 1963, [[Columbia University protests of 1968|major student protests arose in 1968]], resulting in the eventual abandonment of the plan. In the late 20th century, Morningside Park gained a reputation for high crime, and various groups made plans to renovate the park. The proposed site of the Columbia gym was turned into a waterfall and pond in 1990, and the arboretum was added to the park in 1998.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Morningside Park Willow Tree.jpg|thumb|Morningside Park's distinctive cliff of Manhattan schist.

Today, playgrounds are located on the central and northern meadows, while the southern meadow is home to fields.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 19\" />\n\n=== Paths and plantings ===\nMorningside Park was designed with numerous paths and plantings. The paths usually followed the topography, though there are several locations where stone steps connect paths at different locations.

Benches, lights, railings, fences, and stone walls were added over the years, while the rockwork edging was replaced. In addition, the northern meadow's paths were rebuilt in 1940\u20131941, while the paths around {{Abbr|PS|Public School}} 36 and the unbuilt Columbia gym were reconfigured or removed in the late 1960s. As part of the construction of the waterfall, the paths at the unbuilt gym site were rebuilt from 1989 to 1993. In addition, some of the stairs have also been renovated over the years.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 19\" />\n\nThe plantings in Morningside Park were designed in various stages of the park's.

Kellogg called the area a \"barren piece of ground\",<ref name=\"Hall p. 563\">{{harvnb|Hall|1916|ps=.|p=563}}</ref> Parsons described the site as having \"a considerable amount of native growth\", albeit limited mainly to vines, herbs, and shrubs. Further, Parsons stated that due to the poor soil in the original plan of the park, \"fine trees\" could not grow there.<ref>{{harvnb|ps=.|Parsons|1926|pp=60\u201361}}</ref> By the 1910s, vandalism, erosion, and crowds had caused damage to many of the plantings anyway.

In terms of both design and construction, it is one of the more sea kindly 30 footers available on the used market.

It is interesting to note that when they first started making sailboats out of fiberglass, they tended to build up the hull and other structural areas to the same thickness that would have been found on wooden boats. This extra fiberglass resulted in extremely strong and rugged boats, and this is certainly true of the Alberg 30. In terms of both design and construction, it is one of the more seaworthy 30 footers available on the used market in Canada. Nevertheless, the age of the Alberg 30 design translates into a boat with a narrow beam and limited interior room, and its full keel means it will not have the same pointing ability as a fin keel boat.

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak. Although much more powerful than Firestreak, both missiles remained in service until 1988 when the last of the [[English Electric Lightning]]s retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, Magpie II, while Mk.

Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to arm this aircraft. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became Red Top.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to Blue Vesta, Red Top was a simpler design, more of a rationalised, upgraded version of the earlier Firestreak. Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be abandoned, and these were enlarged to provide more maneuvering power. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer true all-aspect capability, but it offset this loss to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. {{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nThese changes allowed the warhead to be moved to the forward fuselage from its former rear-mounted location. This move also allowed it to be enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb) and added an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type. With the warhead moved forward, room was left at the rear of the fuselage for one of the two rows of the IR [[proximity fuse]], improving its view of targets. The new \"Green Garland\" fuse required only one row of smaller rectangular \"windows\", compared to the Firestreak's two rows of larger triangular windows, further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles.

He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been proposed to replace Sea Vixen for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming the aircraft to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Testing and service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox weapon\n|is_missile=yes\n| image= Red Top missile.png\n| image_size = 250\n|caption= Red Top missile\n|name=Red Top\n|type=[[Air-to-air missile]]\n|origin=United Kingdom\n|era=Cold War\n|platform=aircraft\n|target=aircraft\n|manufacturer=Hawker Siddeley Dynamics\n|design_date=\n|production_date=\n|service=1964 - 1988\n|used_by= United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait\n|wars=\n|spec_type= homing missile\n|diameter= 0.23 m\n|wingspan=0.91 m\n|length=3.32 m\n|weight= 154 kg\n|speed=Mach 3.2\n|vehicle_range=7.5 miles (12 km)\n|ceiling=\n|filling=31 kg (68.3 lb) [[annular blast fragmentation]]\n|engine=''Linnet'' solid fuel motor\n|steering=control surfaces\n|guidance=[[infrared homing]], limited [[all-aspect]]\n|variants=?\n|number=\n|detonation=''Green Garland'' infrared proximity; secondary contact [[fuze]]\n}}\n\nThe '''[[Hawker Siddeley]]''' (later [[British Aerospace]]) '''Red Top''' was the third indigenous British [[air-to-air missile]] to enter service, following the [[de Havilland Firestreak]] and limited-service [[Fireflash]].

The new \"Green Garland\" fuse required only one row of smaller rectangular \"windows\", compared to the Firestreak's two rows of larger triangular windows, further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles. Although not offering the true all-aspect capability planned for Blue Vesta, Violet Banner did allow head-on attacks against supersonic aircraft.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Almost cancelled===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been proposed to replace Sea Vixen for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming the aircraft to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Testing and service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Maury Markowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Top_(missile)"}
