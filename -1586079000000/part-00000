The village is 16&nbsp;km south of [[Mannargudi]] and 19&nbsp;km north-east of [[Pattukkottai]]. It has good communication and is well connected with both towns.  The nearest railway station is 16&nbsp;km away at [[Mannargudi]].\n\n==Geography==\nThirumakkottai has an average elevation of 6&nbsp;metres (19&nbsp;feet). <!--(I'm commenting this out because it appears to be about latitude and longitude, but leaves that part out of the actual sentence. Link doesn't work for me. If you can clarify, please do. Thanks!) It is located at .<ref>[http://in.maps.yahoo.com/#?lat=10.5269695&lon=79.4371605&z=5 Thirumakkottai Map]</ref> -->\n\n== Economy ==\nAs an agricultural village, Thirumakkottai's economy largely depends on the income from agriculture. The crops cultivated include rice, cotton, sugarcane, and pulses like urad and mung bean. The agriculture around this area mainly depends on the rivers Koraiyaru, Mullaiyar, and Pamaniyar. Other sources of irrigation are bore-wells. <!--(Commenting out this sentence because it makes no sense as written, and could use a source. If you can explain further, please do. Thanks!) Almost one from family migrated to Vietnam and Singapore during 1900 onward for earning.  -->\n\nThere is a hydroelectric power plant in this village, which supplies electricity to nearby districts.\n\n== Temples ==\nThe place was once a forest of Paarijatha trees, which are endemic plants having sweet-smelling flowers.\n\nThis village is surrounded with temples and tanks.

The knockout tournament, based on the English [[FA Cup]] format, was one of a weak opponent facing a stronger one. The competition was sponsored by [[Absa Group Limited|ABSA]] until 2007, after which [[Nedbank]] took over sponsorship.\n\n==Format==\nThe 16 [[Premier Soccer League]] clubs, 8 [[National First Division]] teams, as well as 8 teams from the amateur ranks compete for the prize money of [[South African Rand|R]]6 million. The winner also qualifies for the [[CAF Confederation Cup]].\n\nThe teams are not seeded at any stage, and the first 16 sides drawn out of the hat receive a home-ground advantage. There are no longer any replays in the tournament, and any games which end in a draw after 90 minutes are subject to 30 minutes extra time followed by penalties if necessary.\n\n==Teams==\nThe 32 teams competing in the [[Nedbank Cup]] competition are: (listed according to the league that they are playing in).\n\n===[[Premier Soccer League]]===\n{{colbegin}}\n# [[Ajax Cape Town]]\n# [[AmaZulu F.C.

Gen Gurinder Singh, an Indian Arms Lobby representative and the Army Chief Pratap Malik. Gurinder tries to bribe him on behalf of a Czech firm, but threatens to expose the DSD (Data & Systems Diagnostics), a confidential operations unit which Jai is a part of, when the chief doesn't comply. Suspecting a major scam in the army, Jai continues with the surveillance for 2 months before going rogue with his cyber-expert girlfriend Sonia, taking along some information related to his organization. Colonel Abhay Singh, Jai's mentor, learns of this and decides to pursue Jai while he's himself pursued secretly by Officer Brig. Srinivas who reports his movements to Gurinder. After a meeting with the army chief who explains him about the real culprit and a powerful arms dealer named Mukesh Kapoor, Abhay finds his car pursued and manages to escape while the pursuers sent by Srinivas keep following the car. The DSD shift their location to an undisclosed location, and Gurinder enlists the help of a journalist named Kamya and provides her sensitive information that can expose the army's secrets. Abhay flies to London and so does a disguised Jai who is picked up by Sonia upon his arrival.\n\nIn London, Jai manages to frighten Gurinder into transferring all his money into Jai's account while Abhay meets Tariq, a middle man for Intelligence agents, who arranges guns and tries to locate Jai and Sonia, eventually alerting Jai. A desperate Abhay meets Mukesh Kapoor and tells him his agents have captured Gurinder. He makes a deal with him, telling him to kill Jai and Sonia in exchange for the information he possesses as it threatens both the parties. While Jai is en route to meet an MI-6 agent to sell him the information, Mukesh's sniper tries to kill him. A few agents are killed and Jai is wounded, but manages to escape. Abhay picks up Sonia and calls Jai from her phone, telling him to come at a spot. Jai arrives, but is repeatedly punched by Abhay who then holds him on gunpoint while Jai justifies his actions and questions what the elder generation plans to leave for the present one. This makes Abhay agree with him, and Jai tells Mukesh Kapoor to free Tariq in exchange for all the information Jai would personally deliver to him. Abhay heads back to India, disguised, where he follows Jai's instructions and meets Baburao, an old man who reveals about an [[Adarsh Housing Society scam|army housing scam]] in [[Mumbai]], involving Gurinder Singh and the Defence Minister. Abhay records his statement and hands it over to Kamya, his ex-girlfriend, who decides to play it after listening to Baburao's words. Gurinder, rescued by Srinivas after capturing DSD agents, receives the same audio recording and shoots himself after listening to it.\n\nThe housing scam is exposed, due to which Srinivas is forced to free the captured DSD agents. The Indian Army and DSD's reputation is saved, while Jai goes to meet Mukesh. Right before entering the building, as he is being watched by Mukesh's agent, Jai decides not to hand over the information and disappears as a bus passes. Mukesh decides to let go, while Jai reunites with Abhay after 2 months.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sidharth Malhotra]] as Major Jai Bakshi\n* [[Manoj Bajpayee]] as Colonel Abhay Singh\n* [[Rakul Preet Singh]] as Naina Gupta Twins / Sonia Jai Bakshi\n* [[Pooja Chopra]] as Captain Maya Semwal\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Retd.

Gen Gurinder Singh, an Indian Arms Lobby representative and the Army Chief Pratap Malik. Gurinder tries to bribe him on behalf of a Czech firm, but threatens to expose the DSD (Data & Systems Diagnostics), a confidential operations unit which Jai is a part of, when the chief doesn't comply. Suspecting a major scam in the army, Jai continues with the surveillance for 2 months before going rogue with his cyber-expert girlfriend Sonia, taking along some information related to his organization. Colonel Abhay Singh, Jai's mentor, learns of this and decides to pursue Jai while he's himself pursued secretly by Officer Brig. Srinivas who reports his movements to Gurinder. After a meeting with the army chief who explains him about the real culprit and a powerful arms dealer named Mukesh Kapoor, Abhay finds his car pursued and manages to escape while the pursuers sent by Srinivas keep following the car. The DSD shift their location to an undisclosed location, and Gurinder enlists the help of a journalist named Kamya and provides her sensitive information that can expose the army's secrets. Abhay flies to London and so does a disguised Jai who is picked up by Sonia upon his arrival.\n\nIn London, Jai manages to frighten Gurinder into transferring all his money into Jai's account while Abhay meets Tariq, a middle man for Intelligence agents, who arranges guns and tries to locate Jai and Sonia, eventually alerting Jai. A desperate Abhay meets Mukesh Kapoor and tells him his agents have captured Gurinder. He makes a deal with him, telling him to kill Jai and Sonia in exchange for the information he possesses as it threatens both the parties. While Jai is en route to meet an MI-6 agent to sell him the information, Mukesh's sniper tries to kill him. A few agents are killed and Jai is wounded, but manages to escape. Abhay picks up Sonia and calls Jai from her phone, telling him to come at a spot. Jai arrives, but is repeatedly punched by Abhay who then holds him on gunpoint while Jai justifies his actions and questions what the elder generation plans to leave for the present one. This makes Abhay agree with him, and Jai tells Mukesh Kapoor to free Tariq in exchange for all the information Jai would personally deliver to him. Abhay heads back to India, disguised, where he follows Jai's instructions and meets Baburao, an old man who reveals about an [[Adarsh Housing Society scam|army housing scam]] in [[Mumbai]], involving Gurinder Singh and the Defence Minister. Abhay records his statement and hands it over to Kamya, his ex-girlfriend, who decides to play it after listening to Baburao's words. Gurinder, rescued by Srinivas after capturing DSD agents, receives the same audio recording and shoots himself after listening to it.\n\nThe housing scam is exposed, due to which Srinivas is forced to free the captured DSD agents. The Indian Army and DSD's reputation is saved, while Jai goes to meet Mukesh. Right before entering the building, as he is being watched by Mukesh's agent, Jai decides not to hand over the information and disappears as a bus passes. Mukesh decides to let go, while Jai reunites with Abhay after 2 months.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sidharth Malhotra]] as Major Jai Bakshi\n* [[Manoj Bajpayee]] as Colonel Abhay Singh\n* [[Rakul Preet Singh]] as Sonia Gupta/ Sonia Jai Bakshi\n* [[Pooja Chopra]] as Captain Maya Semwal\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Retd.

When the [[Anyanya]] rebellion escalated in Equatoria, Ukel moved to Northern Sudan, where he first worked as a schoolteacher in the [[Al Jazirah (state)|Gezira]] area and then continued his studies at the [[University of Khartoum]].

In 1975 he took up further studies at the [[University of Edinburgh]], receiving a postgraduate diploma in teaching English as a foreign language a year later. From 1976 to 1977 he returned to his home area to teach at Mbili Girls Secondary School, holding the posts of deputy headmaster and headmaster, respectively.\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1978 Ukel joined politics by contesting and winning his home constituency of Wau East in the elections to the Second People\u2019s Regional Assembly in [[Juba]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He was re-elected in 1980 as a political ally of the [[Southern Front (Sudan)|Southern Front]] leader [[Abel Alier]] and appointed regional Minister of Culture and Information as Alier assumed the President of the [[High Executive Council of Southern Sudan|High Executive Council]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Southern Sudan \u2013 Too Many Agreements Dishonoured|last=Alier|first=Abel|publisher=Ithaka|year=1992|location=Reading|pages=2o1}}</ref> When Alier lost this office in October 1981, Ukel became the secretary for the publicity committee of the \u201cCouncil for the Unity of the Southern Sudan\u201d (CUSS) which advocated against the redivision of the South.\n\nAfter the fall of [[Gaafar Nimeiry|Gaafar Nimeyri]]\u2019s regime in April 1985, Ukel was a founding member of the \u201cSouthern Sudan Political Association\u2019s\u201d (SSPA) political party and in 1986 became its Parliamentary group leader in the national Constituent Assembly of [[Omdurman]].<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1988, the SSPA joined other Southern and [[Nuba peoples|Nuba]] parties in a coalition called the United Sudan African Parties (USAP) that took the lead in organising dialogues with the rebel [[Sudan People's Liberation Movement|Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement]] (SPLM).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Root Causes of Sudan\u2019s Civil Wars \u2013 Peace or Truce|last=Johnson|first=Douglas|publisher=James Currey|year=2011|location=Woodbridge|pages=84, 86}}</ref> Ukel became a minister of local government in the final coalition government of prime-minister [[Sadiq al-Mahdi|Sadiq al Mahdi]] (25 April \u2013 30 June 1989).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Summer 1989|title=Chronology January 16, 1989 - April 15, 1989|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4327963|journal=Middle East Journal|volume=43, No. 3|pages=455-505|via=JSTOR}}</ref>\n\nAfter the June 1989 coup, USAP was banned like all other parties and went underground.

Originally, [[Royal tours of Canada by the Canadian Royal Family|royal tours of Canada]] were events predominantly for Canadians to see and possibly meet members of their Royal Family, with the associated patriotic pomp and spectacle.
