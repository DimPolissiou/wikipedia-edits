On 18 March 1950, [[Pope Pious XII]] named the Basilica of San Magno a [[minor basilica]].\n\nThe interior of the basilica church is adorned with numerous first-class examples of {{ill|Lombard Renaissance|it|Rinascimento lombardo}} artwork.{{sfn|Turri|1974|pp=14, 18}} Examples are [[Gian Giacomo Lampugnani]]'s [[frescoes]] of the main [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], the remains of 16th century paintings by Evangelista Luini, the frescoes of the main chapel by [[Bernardino Lanini]], and the [[altarpiece]] by [[Giampietrino]].{{sfn|Raimondi|1913|p=78}} The item of greatest significance, however, is a [[polyptych]] by [[Bernardino Luini]] that is widely considered by art historians to be his masterpiece.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=252}}{{sfn|Ferrarini|Stadiotti|2001|p=116}}\n\n==History==\n=== The origins: the ancient church of San Salvatore ===\n[[File:Resti del campanile della chiesa di San Salvatore (Legnano).JPG|right|thumb|Remains of the Romanesque bell tower of the church of San Salvatore]]\n\nUpon the site of the Basilica of San Magno once stood the [[Lombard Romanesque]] parish {{ill|Church of San Salvatore, Legnano|it|Chiesa di San Salvatore (Legnano)|lt=church of San Salvatore}}, whose construction has been traced to the 10th or 11th centuries AD. By the 15th century, the stability of the parish church's foundation had been drastically weakened by its age and water leaking in from the nearby {{ill|Olonella|it}}. To make matters worse, the [[Olona]] was prone to frequent and destructive flooding. Finally, in the very late 15th century, the parish church partially collapsed. The people of Legnano obtained permission from [[Duke of Milan]], [[Ludovico Sforza]], to demolish its remains and to build a new church on the same site. Because the parish church had had a rather dour appearance, Legnano's populace decided to erect a much more sumptuous place of worship.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=206, 208, 210}}\n\nThere are a few reasons that the people chose, in spite of the danger of continued water damage, to reuse the site of the parish church. One is a confidence displayed by the people of Legnano in the technical skills of the builders of the basilica church.{{sfn|Turri|1974|p=21}} Another is that what is now the Piazza San Magno was the town's primary [[cemetery]] until a fiat of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic government]] forced the municipal government to move the cemetery out of the town in 1808.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|pp=256, 279}}{{sfn|Raimondi|1913|p=115}} The nobility were laid to rest inside the church until their bones were removed from the Basilica of San Magno in the 18th century.{{sfn|Parish of San Magno: Storia della parrocchia}}\n\n===Construction===\nThe greatest monetary contributions to the construction of the basilica church were made by the {{ill|House of Lampugnani|it|Lampugnani (famiglia)|lt=Lampugnani}} and Vismara families, two of the oldest families in Legnano.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=245}}{{sfn|Raimondi|1913|p=76}} The [[cornerstone]] was laid on 4 May 1504 and construction was finished on 6 June 1513. The decoration of the basilica church's interior began shortly thereafter with the frescoes of [[Gian Giacomo Lampugnani]] on the main [[dome]]. The church received its first two bells in 1510. The next year, however, on 11 December 1511, Legnano was razed and sacked [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] soldiers, then fighting for the {{ill|Holy League of 1511|it|Lega Santa (1511)}} during the [[War of the League of Cambrai]]. The church was also damaged; the [[scaffolding]] on its exterior was incinerated.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|pp=248\u20139}}{{sfn|Turri|1974|pp=13, 16, 28}} Writing about the construction of the basilica church, Agostino Pozzi, the [[Provost (religion)#Archdiocese of Milan|provost]] of Legnano, reported in the ''Storia delle chiese di Legnano'':{{sfn|Raimondi|1913|p=76}}\n[[File:Acquaforte del 1676 rappresentante la basilica di San Magno (Legnano).JPG|thumb|left|1716 [[etching]] of the basilica of San Magno, here called the \"[[Collegiate church]] of Legnano\"]]\n\n{{quote|text=[...] The church of S.

The second was that funding for the church had ceased; the primary donors, the local nobility, were made destitute after the French drove the [[Sforzas]] from the [[Duchy of Milan]] in 1499 and [[Italian Wars|subsequent fighting]]. That poverty among the nobility was also the author of much administrative disruption in Legnano, as they fought to hold onto their possessions within the Duchy. Compounding all these difficulties was a disinterest in Legnano by the Archbishop of Milan, who began withdrawing holy orders from the area. This had been provoked by the loss of the rebellious tendencies {{ill|Seprio|it}}'s {{ill|Contado|it|lt=inhabitants}}, and thus the need for ducal troops in Legnano.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=249}}\n\nThe original plans of the basilica have been lost and therefore no documents bearing the signature of its architect.

The main chapel, however, was built facing east in traditional Christian practice. This resulted later in those entering the basilica from its new main entrance finding the high altar to their left, so the entrances were rotated 90\u00b0 to the east and west. Another possibility is that, in the first half of the basilica's history, the high altar was aligned to the main entrance.{{sfn|Turri|1974|p=28}}\n[[File:Palazzo Leone da Perego Pirovano (Legnano).JPG|thumb|In the foreground the ancient [[Palazzo Leone da Perego]], founded in the Middle Ages, in a watercolor by Giuseppe Pirovano.

The new bell tower was built with a [[brick]] structure that replaced the one in [[stone]]s of the previous bell tower. The height exceeds 40 meters.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=256}} Along the walls were provided with pilaster [[lesene]].{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=256}}\n\n=== The parsonage ===\n[[File:Resti dell'antica canonica della basilica di San Magno (Legnano).JPG|thumb|The remains of the ancient 16th century parsonage]]\nOn the right side of the basilica there was, until 1967, an ancient 16th century [[clergy house]].{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|pp=256-257}} This building was enlarged in the seventeenth century by order of Federico Borromeo, and again in the eighteenth century when the new bell tower was built.

''Basilica di San Magno'') is the principal church of the Italian town of [[Legnano]], in the [[Province of Milan]]. It is dedicated to the [[Magnus (bishop of Milan)|Saint Magnus]], who was [[Archbishop of Milan]] from 518 to 530. The church was built from 1504 to 1513 in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance-style]] designed by [[Donato Bramante]]. The [[bell tower]] was added between the years 1752 and 1791. On 18 March 1950, [[Pope Pious XII]] named the Basilica of San Magno a [[minor basilica]].\n\nThe interior of the basilica church is adorned with numerous first-class examples of {{ill|Lombard Renaissance|it|Rinascimento lombardo}} artwork.{{sfn|Turri|1974|pp=14, 18}} Examples are [[Gian Giacomo Lampugnani]]'s [[frescoes]] of the main [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], the remains of 16th century paintings by Evangelista Luini, the frescoes of the main chapel by [[Bernardino Lanini]], and the [[altarpiece]] by [[Giampietrino]].{{sfn|Raimondi|1913|p=78}} The item of greatest significance, however, is a [[polyptych]] by [[Bernardino Luini]] that is widely considered by art historians to be his masterpiece.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=252}}{{sfn|Ferrarini|Stadiotti|2001|p=116}}\n\n==History==\n=== The origins: the ancient church of San Salvatore ===\n[[File:Resti del campanile della chiesa di San Salvatore (Legnano).JPG|right|thumb|Remains of the Romanesque bell tower of the church of San Salvatore]]\n\nUpon the site of the Basilica of San Magno once stood the [[Lombard Romanesque]] parish {{ill|Church of San Salvatore, Legnano|it|Chiesa di San Salvatore (Legnano)|lt=church of San Salvatore}}, whose construction has been traced to the 10th or 11th centuries AD. By the 15th century, the stability of the parish church's foundation had been drastically weakened by its age and water leaking in from the nearby {{ill|Olonella|it}}. To make matters worse, the [[Olona]] was prone to frequent and destructive flooding. Finally, in the very late 15th century, the parish church partially collapsed. The people of Legnano obtained permission from [[Duke of Milan]], [[Ludovico Sforza]], to demolish its remains and to build a new church on the same site. Because the parish church had had a rather dour appearance, Legnano's populace decided to erect a much more sumptuous place of worship.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=206, 208, 210}}\n\nThere are a few reasons that the people chose, in spite of the danger of continued water damage, to reuse the site of the parish church. One is a confidence displayed by the people of Legnano in the technical skills of the builders of the basilica church.{{sfn|Turri|1974|p=21}} Another is that what is now the Piazza San Magno was the town's primary [[cemetery]] until a fiat of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic government]] forced the municipal government to move the cemetery out of the town in 1808.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|pp=256, 279}}{{sfn|Raimondi|1913|p=115}} The nobility were laid to rest inside the church until their bones were removed from the Basilica of San Magno in the 18th century.{{sfn|Parish of San Magno: Storia della parrocchia}}\n\n===Construction===\nThe greatest monetary contributions to the construction of the basilica church were made by the {{ill|House of Lampugnani|it|Lampugnani (famiglia)|lt=Lampugnani}} and Vismara families, two of the oldest families in Legnano.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=245}}{{sfn|Raimondi|1913|p=76}} The [[cornerstone]] was laid on 4 May 1504 and construction was finished on 6 June 1513. The decoration of the basilica church's interior began shortly thereafter with the frescoes of [[Gian Giacomo Lampugnani]] on the main [[dome]]. The church received its first two bells in 1510. The next year, however, on 11 December 1511, Legnano was razed and sacked [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] soldiers, then fighting for the {{ill|Holy League of 1511|it|Lega Santa (1511)}} during the [[War of the League of Cambrai]].

The second was that funding for the church had ceased; the primary donors, the local nobility, were made destitute after the French drove the [[Sforzas]] from the [[Duchy of Milan]] in 1499 and [[Italian Wars|subsequent fighting]]. That poverty among the nobility was also the author of much administrative disruption in Legnano, as they fought to hold onto their possessions within the Duchy. Compounding all these difficulties was a disinterest in Legnano by the Archbishop of Milan, who began withdrawing holy orders from the area. This had been provoked by the loss of the rebellious tendencies {{ill|Seprio|it}}'s {{ill|Contado|it|lt=inhabitants}}, and thus the need for ducal troops in Legnano.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=249}}\n\nThe original plans of the basilica have been lost and therefore no documents bearing the signature of its architect.

The main chapel, however, was built facing east in traditional Christian practice. This resulted later in those entering the basilica from its new main entrance finding the high altar to their left, so the entrances were rotated 90\u00b0 to the east and west.

The new bell tower was built with a [[brick]] structure that replaced the one in [[stone]]s of the previous bell tower. The height exceeds 40 meters.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=256}} Along the walls were provided with pilaster [[lesene]].{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=256}}\n\n=== The parsonage ===\n[[File:Resti dell'antica canonica della basilica di San Magno (Legnano).JPG|thumb|The remains of the ancient 16th century parsonage]]\nOn the right side of the basilica there was, until 1967, an ancient 16th century [[clergy house]].{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|pp=256-257}} This building was enlarged in the seventeenth century by order of Federico Borromeo, and again in the eighteenth century when the new bell tower was built.

Accompanied by the wise internal natural lighting originating from the side openings of the [[Vault (architecture)|vault]], which allow a calibrated [[luminosity]] at any time of day, the overall effect is of absolute importance,{{sfn|Turri|1974|p=15}} so much so that even the art historian [[Eug\u00e8ne M\u00fcntz]], who defined this decoration \"the most beautiful [[grotesque]] in [[Lombardy]]\".{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=248}}\n\nThe vault is divided into eight segments within which the large [[candelabra]] are [[fresco]]ed from which branches, starting from the bottom, are unwound.{{sfn|Turri|1974|p=21}} Inside this drawing the windows of the [[dome]] open.{{sfn|Turri|1974|p=21}} The painting is then completed with the representation of [[centaur]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[satyr]]s, [[sea horses]], [[harpies]], winged [[Putto|putti]] and [[dragon]]s, whose dominant colors are white and gray in [[chiaroscuro]].{{sfn|Turri|1974|p=21}} The blue of the background was made using a [[lapis lazuli]] powder dye.{{sfn|D'Ilario|Gianazza|Marinoni|Turri|1984|p=249}}\n[[File:Volta principale - Basilica di San Magno.JPG|thumb|left|Another image of the main vault]]\n\nJust below the dome there is an octagonal [[tholobate]] which is frescoed with a softer shade than that of the vault: this is the opposite of what is generally done in the decorations of contemporary churches in the basilica, which are instead characterized by stronger colors in the lower parts and more tenuous in the upper architectural sections.{{sfn|Turri|1974|p=22}} The tholobate is characterized by the presence of twenty-four [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] which are internally painted with a gray shade and with a rather dark blue color, which brings out the penumbra originating from the recesses: on the pillars of the drum are represented candelabras, which take up the decoration of the vault.{{sfn|Turri|1974|p=22}}\n\nIn 1923 Gersam Turri painted in the [[spandrel]]s, in the spaces between the major [[arche]]s and in the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]], twelve roundels, one in each architectural element, containing the faces as many biblical prophets (from left and right, starting from the arch located at the chapel of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] and of the outward, [[Joel (prophet)|Joel]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]], [[Jonah]], [[Obadiah]], [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], [[Haggai]], [[Habakkuk]], [[Zephaniah]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], and [[Malachi]]), which were added to the four prophets previously painted: [[Jeremiah]] and [[Isaiah]], which are above the major chapel and which were presumably made by [[Bernardino Lanino]];
