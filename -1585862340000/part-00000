They are not exactly robots by the current definition of the term: they are living creatures of artificial flesh and blood rather than machinery and are closer to the modern idea of [[replicant]]s. They may be mistaken for humans and can think for themselves. They seem happy to work for humans at first, but a robot [[rebellion]] leads to the extinction of the human race.  \u010capek later took a different approach to the same theme in ''[[War with the Newts]]'', in which non-humans become a servant class in human society.<ref name=\"ar\">[[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Roberts, Adam]] \"Introduction\", to ''RUR & War with the Newts''.

She meets Domin, the General Manager of R.U.R., who tells her the history of the company:\n\nIn 1920, a man named Rossum came to the island to study marine biology, and in 1932 he accidentally discovered a chemical that behaved exactly like [[protoplasm]], except that it did not mind being knocked around. Rossum attempted to make a dog and a man, but failed. His nephew came to see him, and the two argued non-stop, largely because Old Rossum only wanted to create animals to prove that not only was God unnecessary but that there was no God at all, and Young Rossum only wanted to make himself rich. Eventually, Young Rossum locked his uncle in a laboratory to play with his monsters and mutants, while Young Rossum built factories and cranked out Robots by the thousands. By the time the play takes place &ndash; around the year 2000<ref>According to the poster for the play's opening in 1921; see Klima, Ivan (2004) \"Introduction\" to ''R.U.R.'', Penguin Classics</ref> &ndash; Robots are cheap and available all over the world. They have become absolutely necessary because they allow products to be made at a fifth the previous cost.\n\nHelena meets Fabry, Dr. Gall, Alquist, Busman, and Hallemeier, and reveals she is a representative of the League of Humanity, a human rights organization that wishes to \"free\" the Robots. The managers of the factory find this a ridiculous proposition, since they see Robots as appliances. Helena requests that the Robots be paid so that they can buy things they like, but the Robots do not ''like'' anything. Helena is eventually convinced that the League of Humanity is a waste of money, but continues to argue on the fact that robots should still have a \"soul\". Later, Domin confesses that he loves Helena and forces her into an engagement.\n\n===Act II===\nTen years later, Helena and her nurse Nana are talking about current events\u2014particularly the decline in human births.  Helena and Domin reminisce about the day they met and summarize the last ten years of world history, which has been shaped by the new worldwide Robot-based economy.  Helena meets Dr. Gall's new Robot experiment, Radius, and Dr. Gall describes his experimental Robotess, Robot Helena. Both are more advanced, fully featured versions. In secret, Helena burns the formula required to create Robots.  The revolt of the Robots reaches Rossum's island as the act ends.\n\n===Act III===\n[[File:Theatre Guild, R U R, Act 3.jpg|thumb|Final scene of the Act&nbsp;III.]]\nThe characters sense that the very universality of the Robots presents a danger. Reminiscent of the [[Tower of Babel]], the characters discuss whether creating national Robots who were unable to communicate beyond their language group would have been a good idea. As Robot forces lay siege to the factory, Helena reveals she has burned the formula necessary to make new robots.  The characters lament the end of humanity and defend their actions, despite the fact that their imminent deaths are a direct result of those actions.  Busman is killed attempting to negotiate a peace with the Robots, who then storm the factory and kill all the humans except for Alquist, the company's chief engineer, whom the Robots spare because they recognize that \"he works with his hands like the Robots.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=\u010capek | first=Karel | title=''R.U.R.'' | others=translated by Paul Selver and Nigel Playfair | publisher=Dover Publications | year=2001 | page=49}}</ref>\n\n===Epilogue===\nYears have passed and almost all humans had been killed by the robot revolution except for Alquist. He has been attempting to recreate the formula that Helena destroyed, although as he is a mechanical engineer with insufficient knowledge of biological chemistry he has made little progress. The robot government has attempted to search for surviving humans to help Alquist but they have not been able to find any. Officials from the robot government approach Alquist and first order and then beg him to complete the formula, even if it means he will have to kill and dissect other Robots to do so.  Alquist yields, agreeing to kill and dissect, which completes the circle of violence begun in Act Two.  Alquist is disgusted by it.  Robots Primus and Helena develop human feelings and fall in love. Playing a hunch, Alquist threatens to dissect Primus and then Helena; each begs him to take him- or herself and spare the other. Alquist realizes that they are the new [[Adam and Eve]], and gives charge of the world to them.\n\n==Robots==\n\n[[File:Wpa-marionette-theater-presents-rur.jpg|thumb|U.S. WPA Federal Theatre Project poster for the production by the Marionette Theatre, New York, 1939.]]\nThe Robots described in \u010capek's play are not robots in the popularly understood sense of an automaton. They are not mechanical devices, but rather artificial \nbiological organisms that may be mistaken for humans. A comic scene at the beginning of the play shows Helena arguing with her future husband, Harry Domin, because she cannot believe his secretary is a robotess:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nDOMIN: Sulla, let Miss Glory have a look at you.\nHELENA: (stands and offers her hand) Pleased to meet you.  It must be very hard for you out here, cut off from the rest of the world.\nSULLA: I do not know the rest of the world Miss Glory. Please sit down.\nHELENA: (sits) Where are you from?\nSULLA: From here, the factory.\nHELENA: Oh, you were born here.\nSULLA: Yes I was made here.\nHELENA: (startled) What?\nDOMIN: (laughing) Sulla isn't a person, Miss Glory, she's a robot.\nHELENA: Oh, please forgive me...\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn a limited sense, they resemble more modern conceptions of man-made life forms, such as the [[Replicants]] in ''[[Blade Runner]]'', the \"hosts\" in the [[Westworld (TV series)|''Westworld'' TV series]] and the humanoid [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] in the re-imagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', but in \u010capek's time there was no conception of modern [[genetic engineering]] ([[DNA]]'s role in [[heredity]] was not confirmed until 1952). There are descriptions of kneading-troughs for robot skin, great vats for liver and brains, and a factory for producing bones. Nerve fibers, arteries, and intestines are spun on factory bobbins, while the Robots themselves are assembled like automobiles.<ref name=\"jr\">Rieder, John \"Karl \u010capek\" in Mark Bould (ed.)

They are not exactly robots by the current definition of the term: they are living creatures of artificial flesh and blood rather than machinery and are closer to the modern idea of [[replicant]]s. They may be mistaken for humans and can think for themselves.

She meets Domin, the General Manager of R.U.R., who tells her the history of the company:\n\nIn 1920, a man named Rossum came to the island to study marine biology, and in 1932 he accidentally discovered a chemical that behaved exactly like [[protoplasm]], except that it did not mind being knocked around. Rossum attempted to make a dog and a man, but failed. His nephew came to see him, and the two argued non-stop, largely because Old Rossum only wanted to create animals to prove that not only was God unnecessary but that there was no God at all, and Young Rossum only wanted to make himself rich. Eventually, Young Rossum locked his uncle in a laboratory to play with his monsters and mutants, while Young Rossum built factories and cranked out Robots by the thousands. By the time the play takes place &ndash; around the year 2000<ref>According to the poster for the play's opening in 1921; see Klima, Ivan (2004) \"Introduction\" to ''R.U.R.'', Penguin Classics</ref> &ndash; Robots are cheap and available all over the world. They have become absolutely necessary because they allow products to be made at a fifth the previous cost.\n\nHelena meets Fabry, Dr. Gall, Alquist, Busman, and Hallemeier, and reveals she is a representative of the League of Humanity, a human rights organization that wishes to \"free\" the Robots. The managers of the factory find this a ridiculous proposition, since they see Robots as appliances. Helena requests that the Robots be paid so that they can buy things they like, but the Robots do not ''like'' anything. Helena is eventually convinced that the League of Humanity is a waste of money, but continues to argue on the fact that robots should still have a \"soul\". Later, Domin confesses that he loves Helena and forces her into an engagement.\n\n===Act II===\nTen years later, Helena and her nurse Nana are talking about current events\u2014particularly the decline in human births.  Helena and Domin reminisce about the day they met and summarize the last ten years of world history, which has been shaped by the new worldwide Robot-based economy.  Helena meets Dr. Gall's new Robot experiment, Radius, and Dr. Gall describes his experimental Robotess, Robot Helena. Both are more advanced, fully featured versions. In secret, Helena burns the formula required to create Robots.  The revolt of the Robots reaches Rossum's island as the act ends.\n[[File:Theatre Guild, R U R, Act 3.jpg|thumb|Final scene of the Act&nbsp;III.]]\n\n===Act III===\nThe characters sense that the very universality of the Robots presents a danger. Reminiscent of the [[Tower of Babel]], the characters discuss whether creating national Robots who were unable to communicate beyond their language group would have been a good idea. As Robot forces lay siege to the factory, Helena reveals she has burned the formula necessary to make new robots.  The characters lament the end of humanity and defend their actions, despite the fact that their imminent deaths are a direct result of those actions.  Busman is killed attempting to negotiate a peace with the Robots, who then storm the factory and kill all the humans except for Alquist, the company's chief engineer, whom the Robots spare because they recognize that \"he works with his hands like the Robots.\"<ref>{{cite book | last=\u010capek | first=Karel | title=''R.U.R.'' | others=translated by Paul Selver and Nigel Playfair | publisher=Dover Publications | year=2001 | page=49}}</ref>\n\n===Epilogue===\nYears have passed and almost all humans had been killed by the robot revolution except for Alquist. He has been attempting to recreate the formula that Helena destroyed, although as he is a mechanical engineer with insufficient knowledge of biological chemistry he has made little progress. The robot government has attempted to search for surviving humans to help Alquist but they have not been able to find any. Officials from the robot government approach Alquist and first order and then beg him to complete the formula, even if it means he will have to kill and dissect other Robots to do so.  Alquist yields, agreeing to kill and dissect, which completes the circle of violence begun in Act Two.  Alquist is disgusted by it.  Robots Primus and Helena develop human feelings and fall in love. Playing a hunch, Alquist threatens to dissect Primus and then Helena; each begs him to take him- or herself and spare the other. Alquist realizes that they are the new [[Adam and Eve]], and gives charge of the world to them.\n\n==Robots==\n\n[[File:Wpa-marionette-theater-presents-rur.jpg|thumb|U.S. WPA Federal Theatre Project poster for the production by the Marionette Theatre, New York, 1939.]]\nThe Robots described in \u010capek's play are not robots in the popularly understood sense of an automaton. They are not mechanical devices, but rather artificial \nbiological organisms that may be mistaken for humans. A comic scene at the beginning of the play shows Helena arguing with her future husband, Harry Domin, because she cannot believe his secretary is a robotess:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nDOMIN: Sulla, let Miss Glory have a look at you.\nHELENA: (stands and offers her hand) Pleased to meet you.
