Various scholarly theories link the Xiongnu to Turkic peoples and/or the [[Huns]]. [[Hyacinth (Bichurin)|Bichurin]] alleged that the first usage of the word ''Oghuz'' appears to have been the title of ''O\u011fuz Ka\u011fan'', whose biography shares similarities with the biography, recorded by Han Chinese, of Xiongnu leader [[Modu Shanyu]] (or Mau-Tun),<ref>Bichurin, N.

In general they were a herding society which possessed certain military advantages that sedentary societies did not have, particularly mobility. Alliances by marriage and kinship, and systems of \"social distance\" based on family relationships were the connective tissues of their society.\n\nIn Oghuz traditions, \"society was simply the result of the growth of individual families\". But such a society also grew by alliances and the expansion of different groups, normally through marriages. The shelter of the Oghuz tribes was a tent-like dwelling, erected on wooden poles and covered with skin, felt, or hand-woven textiles, which is called a ''[[yurt]]''.\n\nTheir cuisine included yahni (stew), kebabs, [[Toyga soup]] (meaning \"wedding soup\"), [[K\u0131m\u0131z]] (a traditional drink of the Turks, made from fermented horse milk), [[Pekmez]] (a syrup made of boiled grape juice) and helva made with wheat starch or rice flour, tutmac (noodle soup), yufka (flattened bread), katmer (layered pastry), chorek (ring-shaped buns), bread, clotted cream, cheese, milk and ayran (diluted yogurt beverage), as well as wine.\n\nSocial order was maintained by emphasizing \"correctness in conduct as well as ritual and ceremony\". Ceremonies brought together the scattered members of the society to celebrate birth, puberty, marriage, and death. Such ceremonies had the effect of minimizing social dangers and also of adjusting persons to each other under controlled emotional conditions.\n\n[[Patrilineal]]ly related men and their families were regarded as a group with rights over a particular territory and were distinguished from neighbours on a territorial basis. Marriages were often arranged among territorial groups so that neighbouring groups could become related, but this was the only organizing principle that extended territorial unity. Each community of the Oghuz Turks was thought of as part of a larger society composed of distant as well as close relatives. This signified \"tribal allegiance\". Wealth and materialistic objects were not commonly emphasized in Oghuz society and most remained herders, and when settled they would be active in agriculture.\n\nStatus within the family was based on age, gender, relationships by blood, or marriageability. Males as well as females were active in society, yet men were the backbones of leadership and organization. According to the ''Book of Dede Korkut'', which demonstrates the culture of the Oghuz Turks, women were \"expert horse riders, archers, and athletes\". The elders were respected as repositories of both \"secular and spiritual wisdom\".\n\n==Homeland in Transoxiana==\n[[File:Central Asia Physical.jpg|thumb|[[Map|Physical map]] of Central Asia from the Caucasus in the northwest, to Mongolia in the northeast.]]\n\nIn the 700s, the Oghuz Turks made a new home and domain for themselves in the area between the Caspian and Aral seas, a region that is often referred to as [[Transoxiana]], the western portion of Turkestan. They had moved westward from the Altay mountains passing through the [[Siberian]] steppes and settled in this region, and also penetrated into southern [[Russia]] and the [[Volga]] from their bases in west China. In the 11th century, the Oghuz Turks adopted [[Arabic]] script, replacing the [[Old Turkic alphabet]].<ref>C. E. Bosworth, ''The Ghaznavids:994\u20131040'', (Edinburgh University Press, 1963), 216.</ref>\n\nIn his accredited work titled ''Diwan Lughat al-Turk'', [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Mahmud of Kashgar]], a Turkic scholar of the 11th century, described the [[Tian Shan|Karachuk Mountains]] which are located just east of the Aral Sea as the original homeland of the Oghuz Turks. The Karachuk mountains are now known as the Tengri Tagh ([[Tian Shan]] in Chinese) Mountains, and they are adjacent to Syr Darya.\n\nThe extension from the Karachuk Mountains towards the Caspian Sea (Transoxiana) was called the \"Oghuz Steppe Lands\" from where the Oghuz Turks established trading, religious and cultural contacts with the Abbasid Arab caliphate who ruled to the south. This is around the same time that they first converted to Islam and renounced their [[Tengriism]] belief system. The Arab historians mentioned that the Oghuz Turks in their domain in Transoxiana were ruled by a number of kings and chieftains.\n\nIt was in this area that they later founded the Seljuk Empire, and it was from this area that they spread west into western Asia and eastern Europe during Turkic migrations from the 9th until the 12th century. The founders of the [[Ottoman Empire]] were also Oghuz Turks.\n\n==Poetry and Literature==\n{{expand section|date=March 2020}}\n{{see also|Oghuz languages#Literary works|Dadalo\u011flu|Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee|Pir Sultan Abdal|Imadaddin Nasimi|Magtymguly Pyragy}}\nOghuz Turkish literature includes the famous ''[[Book of Dede Korkut]]'' which was [[UNESCO]]'s 2000 literary work of the year, as well as the ''[[Oghuz Khagan#Legend|Oghuzname]]'', [[Battal Gazi|Battalname]], [[Danishmend Gazi#Legend|Danishmendname]], ''[[Epic of K\u00f6ro\u011flu|K\u00f6ro\u011flu]]'' epics which are part of the literary history of Azerbaijanis, Turks of Turkey and Turkmens.

Various scholarly theories link the Xiongnu to Turkic peoples and/or the [[Huns]]. [[Hyacinth (Bichurin)|Bichurin]] alleged that the first usage of the word ''Oghuz'' appears to have been the title of ''O\u011fuz Ka\u011fan'', whose biography shares similarities with the biography, recorded by Han Chinese, of Xiongnu leader [[Modu Shanyu]] (or Mau-Tun),<ref>Bichurin, N.

In general they were a herding society which possessed certain military advantages that sedentary societies did not have, particularly mobility. Alliances by marriage and kinship, and systems of \"social distance\" based on family relationships were the connective tissues of their society.\n\nIn Oghuz traditions, \"society was simply the result of the growth of individual families\". But such a society also grew by alliances and the expansion of different groups, normally through marriages. The shelter of the Oghuz tribes was a tent-like dwelling, erected on wooden poles and covered with skin, felt, or hand-woven textiles, which is called a ''[[yurt]]''.\n\nTheir cuisine included yahni (stew), kebabs, [[Toyga soup]] (meaning \"wedding soup\"), [[K\u0131m\u0131z]] (a traditional drink of the Turks, made from fermented horse milk), [[Pekmez]] (a syrup made of boiled grape juice) and helva made with wheat starch or rice flour, tutmac (noodle soup), yufka (flattened bread), katmer (layered pastry), chorek (ring-shaped buns), bread, clotted cream, cheese, milk and ayran (diluted yogurt beverage), as well as wine.\n\nSocial order was maintained by emphasizing \"correctness in conduct as well as ritual and ceremony\". Ceremonies brought together the scattered members of the society to celebrate birth, puberty, marriage, and death. Such ceremonies had the effect of minimizing social dangers and also of adjusting persons to each other under controlled emotional conditions.\n\n[[Patrilineal]]ly related men and their families were regarded as a group with rights over a particular territory and were distinguished from neighbours on a territorial basis. Marriages were often arranged among territorial groups so that neighbouring groups could become related, but this was the only organizing principle that extended territorial unity. Each community of the Oghuz Turks was thought of as part of a larger society composed of distant as well as close relatives. This signified \"tribal allegiance\". Wealth and materialistic objects were not commonly emphasized in Oghuz society and most remained herders, and when settled they would be active in agriculture.\n\nStatus within the family was based on age, gender, relationships by blood, or marriageability. Males as well as females were active in society, yet men were the backbones of leadership and organization. According to the ''Book of Dede Korkut'', which demonstrates the culture of the Oghuz Turks, women were \"expert horse riders, archers, and athletes\". The elders were respected as repositories of both \"secular and spiritual wisdom\".\n\n==Homeland in Transoxiana==\n[[File:Central Asia Physical.jpg|thumb|[[Map|Physical map]] of Central Asia from the Caucasus in the northwest, to Mongolia in the northeast.]]\n\nIn the 700s, the Oghuz Turks made a new home and domain for themselves in the area between the Caspian and Aral seas, a region that is often referred to as [[Transoxiana]], the western portion of Turkestan. They had moved westward from the Altay mountains passing through the [[Siberian]] steppes and settled in this region, and also penetrated into southern [[Russia]] and the [[Volga]] from their bases in west China. In the 11th century, the Oghuz Turks adopted [[Arabic]] script, replacing the [[Old Turkic alphabet]].<ref>C. E. Bosworth, ''The Ghaznavids:994\u20131040'', (Edinburgh University Press, 1963), 216.</ref>\n\nIn his accredited work titled ''Diwan Lughat al-Turk'', [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Mahmud of Kashgar]], a Turkic scholar of the 11th century, described the [[Tian Shan|Karachuk Mountains]] which are located just east of the Aral Sea as the original homeland of the Oghuz Turks. The Karachuk mountains are now known as the Tengri Tagh ([[Tian Shan]] in Chinese) Mountains, and they are adjacent to Syr Darya.\n\nThe extension from the Karachuk Mountains towards the Caspian Sea (Transoxiana) was called the \"Oghuz Steppe Lands\" from where the Oghuz Turks established trading, religious and cultural contacts with the Abbasid Arab caliphate who ruled to the south. This is around the same time that they first converted to Islam and renounced their [[Tengriism]] belief system. The Arab historians mentioned that the Oghuz Turks in their domain in Transoxiana were ruled by a number of kings and chieftains.\n\nIt was in this area that they later founded the Seljuk Empire, and it was from this area that they spread west into western Asia and eastern Europe during Turkic migrations from the 9th until the 12th century. The founders of the [[Ottoman Empire]] were also Oghuz Turks.\n\n==Poetry and Literature==\n{{expand section|date=March 2020}}\n{{see also|Oghuz languages#Literary works|Dadalo\u011flu|Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee|Pir Sultan Abdal|Imadaddin Nasimi|Magtymguly Pyragy}}\nOghuz Turkish literature includes the famous ''[[Book of Dede Korkut]]'' which was [[UNESCO]]'s 2000 literary work of the year, as well as the ''[[Oghuz Khagan#Legend|Oghuzname]]'', [[Battal Gazi|Battalname]], [[Danishmend Gazi#Legend|Danishmendname]], ''[[Epic of K\u00f6ro\u011flu|K\u00f6ro\u011flu]]'' epics which are part of the literary history of Azerbaijanis, Turks of Turkey and Turkmens.

The concept of self-replicating machines has been advanced and examined by [[Homer Jacobson]], [[Edward F. Moore]], [[Freeman Dyson]], [[John von Neumann]] and in more recent times by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his book on [[nanotechnology]], ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' (coining the term '''clanking replicator ''' for such machines) and by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] in their review ''Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines''<ref name=\"Freitas 2004\">{{cite book| last=Freitas| first=Robert A.|author2=Ralph C.

The future development of such technology is an integral part of several plans involving the mining of [[moon]]s and [[asteroid]] belts for ore and other materials, the creation of lunar factories, and even the construction of [[solar power satellite]]s in space. The possibly misnamed [[von Neumann probe]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.11.htm#p3 |title=3.11 Freitas Interstellar Probe Replicator (1979-1980) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}</ref> is one theoretical example of such a machine. Von Neumann also worked on what he called the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]], a self-replicating machine that would operate in a [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] environment.\n\nA self-replicating machine is an artificial [[self-replication|self-replicating]] system that relies on conventional large-scale technology and automation. Although suggested more than 70 years ago no self-replicating machine has been seen until today{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}.

Replicators have also been called \"von Neumann machines\" after John von Neumann, who first rigorously studied the idea. However, the term \"von Neumann machine\" is less specific and also refers to a completely unrelated [[Von Neumann architecture|computer architecture]] that von Neumann proposed and so its use is discouraged where accuracy is important.<ref name=\"Freitas 2004\"/> Von Neumann himself used the term [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] to describe such self-replicating machines.\n\nHistorians of [[machine tool]]s, even before the [[numerical control]] era, sometimes figuratively said that machine tools were a unique class of machines because they have the ability to \"reproduce themselves\"<ref name=\"Colvin1947pp6-7\">{{Harvnb|Colvin|1947|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> by copying all of their parts. Implicit in these discussions is that a human would direct the cutting processes (later planning and programming the machines), and would then be assembling the parts. The same is true for [[RepRap Project|RepRaps]], which are another class of machines sometimes mentioned in reference to such non-autonomous \"self-replication\". In contrast, machines that are ''truly autonomously'' self-replicating (like [[Molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]]) are the main subject discussed here.\n\n==History==\n\nThe general concept of artificial machines capable of producing copies of themselves dates back at least several hundred years. An early reference is an anecdote regarding the philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], who suggested to Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] that the human body could be regarded as a machine; she responded by pointing to a clock and ordering \"see to it that it reproduces offspring.\"<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Scientific American| title=Build Your Own Replicator| volume=285|date=August 2001| pages=38\u201339| first=Moshe| last= Sipper|author2=James A.

The machine had a program stored on a memory tape that directed it to retrieve parts from this \"sea\" using a manipulator, assemble them into a duplicate of itself, and then copy the contents of its memory tape into the empty duplicate's. The machine was envisioned as consisting of as few as eight different types of components; four logic elements that send and receive stimuli and four mechanical elements used to provide a structural skeleton and mobility. While qualitatively sound, von Neumann was evidently dissatisfied with this model of a self-replicating machine due to the difficulty of analyzing it with mathematical rigor. He went on to instead develop an even more abstract model self-replicator based on [[cellular automata]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/2.1.3.htm |title=2.1.3 The Cellular Automaton (CA) Model of Machine Replication |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}</ref> His original kinematic concept remained obscure until it was popularized in a 1955 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]''.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Kemeny| first=John G.| title=Man Viewed as a Machine| journal=Scientific American| volume=192|date=April 1955| issue=4| pages=58\u201367| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0455-58| bibcode=1955SciAm.192d..58K}}</ref>\n\n===Moore's artificial living plants===\n\nIn 1956 mathematician [[Edward F. Moore]] proposed the first known suggestion for a practical real-world self-replicating machine, also published in ''Scientific American''.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Scientific American| first=Edward F.| last=Moore|date=October 1956| volume=195| title=Artificial Living Plants| issue=4| pages=118\u2013126| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1056-118| bibcode=1956SciAm.195d.118M}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.1.htm |title=3.1 Moore Artificial Living Plants (1956) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |accessdate=2009-09-16}}</ref> Moore's \"artificial living plants\" were proposed as machines able to use air, water and soil as sources of raw materials and to draw its energy from sunlight via a [[solar cell|solar battery]] or a [[steam engine]]. He chose the seashore as an initial habitat for such machines, giving them easy access to the chemicals in seawater, and suggested that later generations of the machine could be designed to float freely on the ocean's surface as self-replicating factory barges or to be placed in barren desert terrain that was otherwise useless for industrial purposes. The self-replicators would be \"harvested\" for their component parts, to be used by humanity in other non-replicating machines.\n\n===Dyson's replicating systems===\n\nThe next major development of the concept of self-replicating machines was a series of thought experiments proposed by physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] in his 1970 Vanuxem Lecture.<ref>{{cite speech |author=Freeman J. Dyson |title=The twenty-first century |event=Vanuxem Lecture |location=Princeton University |date=26 February 1970}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.6.htm |title=3.6 Dyson Terraforming Replicators (1970, 1979) |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2009-09-16}}</ref> He proposed three large-scale applications of machine replicators. First was to send a self-replicating system to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], which in addition to producing copies of itself would also be programmed to manufacture and launch [[solar sail]]-propelled cargo spacecraft. These spacecraft would carry blocks of Enceladean ice to [[Mars]], where they would be used to [[Terraforming of Mars|terraform the planet]]. His second proposal was a solar-powered factory system designed for a terrestrial desert environment, and his third was an \"industrial development kit\" based on this replicator that could be sold to developing countries to provide them with as much industrial capacity as desired. When Dyson revised and reprinted his lecture in 1979 he added proposals for a modified version of Moore's seagoing artificial living plants that was designed to distill and store fresh water for human use<ref>{{cite book| title=Chapter 18: Thought Experiments| work=Disturbing the Universe| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| year=1979| publisher=Harper and Row| location=New York| pages=194\u2013204}}</ref> and the \"[[Astrochicken]].\"\n\n===''Advanced Automation for Space Missions''===\n[[File:Advanced Automation for Space Missions figure 5-19.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's conception of a \"self-growing\" robotic lunar factory]]\n\nIn 1980, inspired by a 1979 \"New Directions Workshop\" held at Wood's Hole, [[NASA]] conducted a joint summer study with [[ASEE]] entitled [[s:Advanced Automation for Space Missions|Advanced Automation for Space Missions]] to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicating factories to develop [[Moon|lunar]] resources without requiring additional launches or human workers on-site.

Raw lunar regolith would be refined by a variety of techniques, primarily [[hydrofluoric acid]] [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]]. Large transports with a variety of manipulator arms and tools were proposed as the constructors that would put together new factories from parts and assemblies produced by its parent.\n\nPower would be provided by a \"canopy\" of solar cells supported on pillars. The other machinery would be placed under the canopy.\n\nA \"[[casting]] [[robot]]\" would use sculpting tools and templates to make [[plaster]] [[molding (process)|molds]]. Plaster was selected because the molds are easy to make, can make precise parts with good surface finishes, and the plaster can be easily recycled afterward using an oven to bake the water back out. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from nonconductive molten rock ([[basalt]]) or purified metals. A carbon dioxide [[laser cutting]] and welding system was also included.\n\nA more speculative, more complex microchip fabricator was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were \"vitamins.\"\n\nA 2004 study supported by NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts took this idea further.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/883Toth-Fejel.html|title=Modeling Kinematic Cellular Automata: An Approach to Self-Replication|last=Toth-Fejel|first=Tihamer|year=2004|website=|publisher=NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|access-date=}}</ref> Some experts are beginning to consider self-replicating machines for [[asteroid mining]].\n\nMuch of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing the ores, and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in lunar [[regolith]]. The element that most limited the growth rate was [[chlorine]], needed to process regolith for [[aluminium]].

Replicators have also been called \"von Neumann machines\" after John von Neumann, who first rigorously studied the idea. However, the term \"von Neumann machine\" is less specific and also refers to a completely unrelated [[Von Neumann architecture|computer architecture]] that von Neumann proposed and so its use is discouraged where accuracy is important.<ref name=\"Freitas 2004\"/> Von Neumann himself used the term [[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]] to describe such self-replicating machines.\n\nHistorians of [[machine tool]]s, even before the [[numerical control]] era, sometimes figuratively said that machine tools were a unique class of machines because they have the ability to \"reproduce themselves\"<ref name=\"Colvin1947pp6-7\">{{Harvnb|Colvin|1947|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> by copying all of their parts.

The machine had a program stored on a memory tape that directed it to retrieve parts from this \"sea\" using a manipulator, assemble them into a duplicate of itself, and then copy the contents of its memory tape into the empty duplicate's. The machine was envisioned as consisting of as few as eight different types of components; four logic elements that send and receive stimuli and four mechanical elements used to provide a structural skeleton and mobility. While qualitatively sound, von Neumann was evidently dissatisfied with this model of a self-replicating machine due to the difficulty of analyzing it with mathematical rigor.

The self-replicators would be \"harvested\" for their component parts, to be used by humanity in other non-replicating machines.\n\n===Dyson's replicating systems===\n\nThe next major development of the concept of self-replicating machines was a series of thought experiments proposed by physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] in his 1970 Vanuxem Lecture.<ref>{{cite speech |author=Freeman J.

First was to send a self-replicating system to [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], which in addition to producing copies of itself would also be programmed to manufacture and launch [[solar sail]]-propelled cargo spacecraft. These spacecraft would carry blocks of Enceladean ice to [[Mars]], where they would be used to [[Terraforming of Mars|terraform the planet]]. His second proposal was a solar-powered factory system designed for a terrestrial desert environment, and his third was an \"industrial development kit\" based on this replicator that could be sold to developing countries to provide them with as much industrial capacity as desired. When Dyson revised and reprinted his lecture in 1979 he added proposals for a modified version of Moore's seagoing artificial living plants that was designed to distill and store fresh water for human use<ref>{{cite book| title=Chapter 18: Thought Experiments| work=Disturbing the Universe| first=Freeman J.| last=Dyson| year=1979| publisher=Harper and Row| location=New York| pages=194\u2013204}}</ref> and the \"[[Astrochicken]].\"\n\n===''Advanced Automation for Space Missions''===\n[[File:Advanced Automation for Space Missions figure 5-19.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's conception of a \"self-growing\" robotic lunar factory]]\n\nIn 1980, inspired by a 1979 \"New Directions Workshop\" held at Wood's Hole, [[NASA]] conducted a joint summer study with [[ASEE]] entitled [[s:Advanced Automation for Space Missions|Advanced Automation for Space Missions]] to produce a detailed proposal for self-replicating factories to develop [[Moon|lunar]] resources without requiring additional launches or human workers on-site.

Raw lunar regolith would be refined by a variety of techniques, primarily [[hydrofluoric acid]] [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]]. Large transports with a variety of manipulator arms and tools were proposed as the constructors that would put together new factories from parts and assemblies produced by its parent.\n\nPower would be provided by a \"canopy\" of solar cells supported on pillars. The other machinery would be placed under the canopy.\n\nA \"[[casting]] [[robot]]\" would use sculpting tools and templates to make [[plaster]] [[molding (process)|molds]]. Plaster was selected because the molds are easy to make, can make precise parts with good surface finishes, and the plaster can be easily recycled afterward using an oven to bake the water back out. The robot would then cast most of the parts either from nonconductive molten rock ([[basalt]]) or purified metals. A carbon dioxide [[laser cutting]] and welding system was also included.\n\nA more speculative, more complex microchip fabricator was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were \"vitamins.\"\n\nA 2004 study supported by NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts took this idea further.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/studies/883Toth-Fejel.html|title=Modeling Kinematic Cellular Automata: An Approach to Self-Replication|last=Toth-Fejel|first=Tihamer|year=2004|website=|publisher=NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|access-date=}}</ref> Some experts are beginning to consider self-replicating machines for [[asteroid mining]].\n\nMuch of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing the ores, and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in lunar [[regolith]]. The element that most limited the growth rate was [[chlorine]], needed to process regolith for [[aluminium]]. Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith.\n\n===Lackner-Wendt Auxon replicators===\n\nIn 1995, inspired by Dyson's 1970 suggestion of seeding uninhabited deserts on Earth with self-replicating machines for industrial development, [[Klaus Lackner]] and Christopher Wendt developed a more detailed outline for such a system.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Lackner| first=Klaus S.|author2=Christopher H.

The '''error''' (or '''disturbance''') of an observed value is the deviation of the observed value from the (unobservable) ''true'' value of a quantity of interest (for example, a population mean), and the '''residual''' of an observed value is the difference between the observed value and the ''estimated'' value of the quantity of interest (for example, a sample mean). The distinction is most important in regression analysis, where the concepts are sometimes called the '''regression errors''' and '''regression residuals''' and where they lead to the concept of studentized residuals.\n\n==Introduction==\nSuppose there is a series of observations from a [[univariate distribution]] and we want to estimate the [[mean]] of that distribution (the so-called [[location model (statistics)|location model]]). In this case, the errors are the deviations of the observations from the population mean, while the residuals are the deviations of the observations from the sample mean.\n\nA '''statistical error''' (or '''disturbance''') is the amount by which an observation differs from its [[expected value]], the latter being based on the whole [[statistical population|population]] from which the statistical unit was chosen randomly. For example, if the mean height in a population of 21-year-old men is 1.75 meters, and one randomly chosen man is 1.80 meters tall, then the \"error\" is 0.05 meters; if the randomly chosen man is 1.70 meters tall, then the \"error\" is \u22120.05 meters. The expected value, being the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the entire population, is typically unobservable, and hence the statistical error cannot be observed either.\n\nA '''residual''' (or fitting deviation), on the other hand, is an observable ''estimate'' of the unobservable statistical error. Consider the previous example with men's heights and suppose we have a random sample of ''n'' people. The ''[[sample mean]]'' could serve as a good estimator of the ''population'' mean. Then we have:\n* The difference between the height of each man in the sample and the unobservable ''population'' mean is a ''statistical error'', whereas\n* The difference between the height of each man in the sample and the observable ''sample'' mean is a ''residual''.\n\nNote that, because of the definition of the sample mean, the sum of the residuals within a random sample is necessarily zero, and thus the residuals are necessarily ''not [[statistical independence|independent]]''. The statistical errors, on the other hand, are independent, and their sum within the random sample is [[almost surely]] not zero.\n\nOne can standardize statistical errors (especially of a [[normal distribution]]) in a [[z-score]] (or \"standard score\"), and standardize residuals in a [[t-statistic|''t''-statistic]], or more generally [[studentized residuals]].\n\n==In univariate distributions==\n\nIf we assume a [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] population with mean \u03bc and [[standard deviation]] \u03c3, and choose individuals independently, then we have\n\n:<math>X_1, \\dots, X_n\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\,</math>\n\nand the [[arithmetic mean|sample mean]]\n\n:<math>\\overline{X}={X_1 + \\cdots + X_n \\over n}</math>\n\nis a random variable distributed such that:\n\n:<math>\\overline{X} \\sim N \\left( \\mu, \\frac {\\sigma^2} n \\right).</math>\n\nThe ''statistical errors'' are then\n\n:<math>e_i=X_i-\\mu,\\,</math>\n\nwith [[Expected Value|expected]] values of zero,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Intermediate statistical methods|last=Wetherill, G.

No correction is necessary if the population mean is known.\n\n===Remark===\n\nIt is remarkable that the [[Squared deviations|sum of squares of the residuals]] and the sample mean can be shown to be independent of each other, using, e.g. [[Basu's theorem]]. That fact, and the normal and chi-squared distributions given above form the basis of calculations involving the  [[t-statistic]]:\n\n:<math> T = \\frac{\\overline{X}_n - \\mu_0}{S_n/\\sqrt{n}}, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\overline{X}_n - \\mu_0</math> represents the errors, <math>S_n</math> represents the sample standard deviation for a sample of size ''n'', and unknown ''\u03c3'', and the denominator term <math>S_n/\\sqrt n</math> accounts for the standard deviation of the errors according to:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n: <math display=\"block\">\\operatorname{Var}(\\overline{X}_n) = \\frac{\\sigma^2} n</math>\n\nThe probability distributions of the numerator and the denominator separately depend on the value of the unobservable population standard deviation ''\u03c3'', but ''\u03c3'' appears in both the numerator and the denominator and cancels.  That is fortunate because it means that even though we do not know&nbsp;''\u03c3'', we know the probability distribution of this quotient: it has a [[Student's t-distribution]] with ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 degrees of freedom.  We can therefore use this quotient to find a [[confidence interval]] for&nbsp;''\u03bc''.

If they are random, or have no trend, but \"fan out\" - they exhibit a phenomenon called [[heteroscedasticity]]. If all of the residuals are equal, or do not fan out, they exhibit [[homoscedasticity]].\n\nHowever, a terminological difference arises in the expression [[mean squared error]] (MSE). The mean squared error of a regression is a number computed from the sum of squares of the computed ''residuals'', and not of the unobservable ''errors''. If that sum of squares is divided by ''n'', the number of observations, the result is the mean of the squared residuals. Since this is a [[bias (statistics)|biased]]  estimate of the variance of the unobserved errors, the bias is removed by dividing the sum of the squared residuals by ''df'' = ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, instead of ''n'', where ''df'' is the number of [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] (''n'' minus the number of parameters p being estimated - 1).

This is also called a least squares estimate, where the regression coefficients are chosen such that the sum of the squares is minimal (i.e. its derivative is zero).\n\nLikewise, the '''sum of absolute errors (SAE)''' is the sum of the absolute values of the residuals, which is minimized in the [[least absolute deviations]] approach to regression.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Absolute deviation]]\n* [[Consensus forecasts]]\n* [[Error detection and correction]]\n* [[Explained sum of squares]]\n* [[Innovation (signal processing)]]\n* [[Lack-of-fit sum of squares]]\n* [[Margin of error]]\n* [[Mean absolute error]]\n* [[Observational error]]\n* [[Propagation of error]]\n* [[Probable error]]\n* [[Random and systematic errors]]\n* [[Regression dilution]]\n* [[Root mean square deviation]]\n* [[Sampling error]]\n* [[Standard error]]\n* [[Studentized residual]]\n* [[Type I and type II errors]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=R.

This is also called a least squares estimate, where the regression coefficients are chosen such that the sum of the squares is minimal (i.e. its derivative is zero).\n\nLikewise, the '''sum of absolute errors (SAE)''' is the sum of the absolute values of the residuals, which is minimized in the [[least absolute deviations]] approach to regression.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Absolute deviation]]\n* [[Consensus forecasts]]\n* [[Error detection and correction]]\n* [[Explained sum of squares]]\n* [[Innovation (signal processing)]]\n* [[Lack-of-fit sum of squares]]\n* [[Margin of error]]\n* [[Mean absolute error]]\n* [[Observational error]]\n* [[Propagation of error]]\n* [[Probable error]]\n* [[Random and systematic errors]]\n* [[Regression dilution]]\n* [[Root mean square deviation]]\n* [[Sampling error]]\n* [[Standard error]]\n* [[Studentized residual]]\n* [[Type I and type II errors]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=R.

A leading figure of the [[Independent Radicals]], he played a central role in the politics of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].\n\nClemenceau was Prime Minister of [[France]] from 1906 to 1909 and from 1917 to 1920. Demanding a total victory over Germany, he wanted reparations, colonies, Alsace-Lorraine, and strict rules to prevent Germany from rearming.  He achieved these goals in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] imposed on Germany at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. Nicknamed \"P\u00e8re la Victoire\" (''Father Victory'') or \"Le Tigre\" (''The Tiger''), in the 1920s he continued his harsh position against Germany, though not quite as much as the President [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]].  He obtained mutual defense treaties with Britain and the United States, to unite against German aggression, but these never took effect.\n\n==Early years==\nClemenceau was a native of the [[Vend\u00e9e]], born at [[Mouilleron-en-Pareds]]. During the period of the [[French Revolution of 1848|French Revolution]], the Vend\u00e9e had been a [[Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e|hotbed of monarchist sympathies]].  The region was remote from Paris, rural and poor.  His mother, Sophie Eucharie Gautreau (1817\u20131903), was of [[Huguenot]] descent. His father, Benjamin Clemenceau (1810\u20131897), came from a long line of physicians, but he lived off his lands and investments and did not practice medicine. Benjamin was a political activist; he was arrested and briefly held in 1851 and again in 1858.  He instilled in his son a love of learning, devotion to [[Radical politics|radical]] politics, and a hatred of [[Catholicism]].<ref>David Watson, ''Georges Clemenceau: A Political Biography'' (1976) pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The lawyer [[Albert Clemenceau]] (1861\u20131955) was his brother.  His mother was devoutly Protestant; his father was an atheist, and insisted that his children should have no religious education. Georges was interested in religious issues. He was a lifelong [[Atheism|atheist]] with a sound knowledge of the [[Bible]]{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}.  He became a leader of anti-clerical or \"Radical\" forces that battled against the Catholic Church in France and the Catholics in politics.  He stopped short of the more extreme attacks. His position was that if church and state were kept rigidly separated, he would not support oppressive measures designed to further weaken the Church.<ref>David Watson, ''Georges Clemenceau: A Political Biography'' (1978) p 17, 152.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=David S.

He went to Paris to study medicine, eventually graduating with the completion of his thesis \"De la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration des \u00e9l\u00e9ments anatomiques\" in 1865.<ref>Clemenceau (1865), pp. 7\u201311</ref>\n\n==Political activism and American experience==\nIn Paris, the young Clemenceau became a political activist and writer. In December 1861, he co-founded a weekly newsletter, ''Le Travail,'' along with some friends. On 23 February 1862, he was arrested by the police for having placed posters summoning a demonstration. He spent 77 days in the [[Mazas Prison]]. Around the same time, Clemenceau also visited the old French revolutionary [[Auguste Blanqui]] and another Republican activist, [[Auguste Scheurer-Kestner]], in jail, further deepening his hatred of Napoleon III's regime and his fervent republicanism.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Winock|first=Michel|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3917/perri.wino.2013.01|title=Clemenceau|date=2013|publisher=\u00c9ditions Perrin|year=|isbn=978-2-262-03878-6|location=|pages=73-90}}</ref>\n\nHe finally graduated as a doctor of medicine on 13 May 1865, founded several literary magazines, and wrote many articles, most of which attacked the imperial regime of [[Napoleon III]]. After a failed love affair, Clemenceau left France for the [[United States]] as the imperial agents began cracking down on dissidents, sending most of them to the ''bagne de Cayennes'' ([[Devil's Island]] Penal System) in [[French Guiana]].\n\nClemenceau worked in [[New York City]] in the years 1865\u201369, following the [[American Civil War]]. He maintained a medical practice, but spent much of his time on political journalism for a Parisian newspaper, ''Le Temps''. He taught French at the home of Calvin Rood in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], and also taught and rode horseback at a private girls' school in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], where he would meet his future wife. During this time, he joined French exile clubs in New York opposing the imperial regime.\n\nClemenceau covered the country's recovery following the Civil War, the workings of American democracy and the racial questions related to the end of slavery, as part of his journalistic activity. From his time in America, he retained a strong faith in American democratic ideals as opposed to France's imperial regime, as well as a sense of political compromise that would later become a hallmark of his political career<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Mary Cl\u00e9menceau, by Ferdinand Victor L\u00e9on Roybet.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Plummer|Mary Cl\u00e9menceau]] in period costume. (portrait by [[Ferdinand Roybet]])]]\n\nOn 23 June 1869, he married one of his horse riding students, [[Mary Plummer|Mary Eliza Plummer]] (1849\u20131922), in New York City. She was the daughter of William Kelly Plummer and wife Harriet A. Taylor. The Clemenceaus moved to France and had three children together, Madeleine (born in 1870), Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (1872) and Michel (1873)<ref name=\":0\" />. The marriage ended in a contentious divorce.<ref>Watson (1976), pp. 23\u201332.</ref>\n\n==The beginning of the Third Republic==\nClemenceau returned to Paris after the French defeat at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] in 1870 during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the fall of the [[Second French Empire]]. After returning to medical practice as a physician in Vend\u00e9e, he was appointed mayor of the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]], including [[Montmartre]], and was also elected to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] for the 18th arrondissement. When the [[Paris Commune]] seized power in March 1871, he tried unsuccessfully to find a compromise between the more radical leaders of the commune and the more conservative French government.  The Commune declared that he had no legal authority to be mayor and seized the city hall of the 18th arrondissement.  He ran for election to the Paris Commune council, but received less than eight hundred votes and took no part in its governance.  He was in [[Bordeaux]] when the Commune was suppressed by the French Army in May 1871.<ref>Milza, Pierre, ''L'ann\u00e9e terrible \u2013 La Commune (mars-juin 1871)''</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of the Commune, he was elected to the Paris municipal council on 23 July 1871 for the Clignancourt quarter, and retained his seat till 1876. He first held the offices of secretary and vice-president, then became president in 1875.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopaedia britannica : a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information.|last=Chisolm|first=Hugh|publisher=The Encyclopaedia Britannica Company|year=1910|isbn=|edition=11th|location=New York|pages=482|oclc=962864074}}</ref>\n\n===Chamber of Deputies===\n[[File:1887 Bettannier Der Schwarze Fleck anagoria.jpg|thumb|A painting from 1887 depicting a French child being taught about the \"lost\" province of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Regaining those provinces was the main goal of Clemenceau and the French in general]]\n\nIn 1876, Clemenceau stood for the [[Chamber of Deputies (France)|Chamber of Deputies]] (which replaced the National Assembly in 1875) and was elected for the 18th arrondissement. He joined the far left, and his energy and mordant eloquence speedily made him the leader of the radical section. In 1877, after the [[16 May 1877 crisis|Crisis of 16 May 1877]], he was one of the republican majority who denounced the ministry of the [[Albert, 4th duc de Broglie|Duc de Broglie]]. He led resistance to the anti-republican policy of which the incident of 16 May was a manifestation. In 1879 his demand for the indictment of the Broglie ministry brought him prominence.<ref name=\"Watson, 1976\">Watson, ''Georges Clemenceau: A Political Biography'' (1976).</ref>\n\nFrom 1876 to 1880, Clemenceau was one of the main defenders of the general amnesty of thousands of Communards, members of the revolutionary government of the 1871 Paris Commune, who had been deported to [[New Caledonia]]. Along with other radicals and figures such as poet and then-senator [[Victor Hugo]], as well as a growing number of republicans, he supported several unsuccessful proposals. A general amnesty was finally adopted on July 11, 1880. The \"reconciliation\" envisaged by Clemenceau could begin, as the remaining deported Communards such as his friend [[Louise Michel]] returned to France<ref name=\":0\" />.\n[[File:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli - Georges Clemenceau pronon\u00e7ant un discours dans une r\u00e9union \u00e9lectorale.jpg|left|thumb|283x283px|Clemenceau giving a speech in the Parisian Fernando Circus (painting by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli]], 1883).]]\n[[File:\u00c9douard Manet - Portrait of George Clemeceau.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of Georges Clemenceau'' by [[\u00c9douard Manet]], c. 1879\u201380]]\n\nIn 1880, Clemenceau started his newspaper ''La Justice'', which became the principal organ of [[Parisian Radicalism]]. From this time, throughout the presidency of [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]] (1879\u20131887), he became widely known as a political critic and destroyer of ministries (''le Tombeur de minist\u00e8res'') who avoided taking office himself. Leading the far left in the Chamber of Deputies, he was an active opponent of the [[French Colonial Empire|colonial policy]] of Prime Minister [[Jules Ferry]], which he opposed on moral grounds and also as a form of diversion from the more important goal of \"[[Revanchism|Revenge against Germany]]\" for the annexation of [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine]] after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. In 1885, his criticism of the conduct of the [[Sino-French War]] contributed strongly to the fall of the Ferry cabinet that year.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nDuring the [[1885 French legislative election|French legislative elections of 1885]], he advocated a strong radical programme and was returned both for his old seat in Paris and for the [[Var (d\u00e9partement)|Var]], district of [[Draguignan]]. He chose to represent the latter in the Chamber of Deputies. Refusing to form a ministry to replace the one he had overthrown, he supported the right in keeping Prime Minister [[Charles de Freycinet]] in power in 1886 and was responsible for the inclusion of [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]] in the Freycinet cabinet as War Minister. When General Boulanger revealed himself as an ambitious pretender, Clemenceau withdrew his support and became a vigorous opponent of the heterogeneous Boulangist movement, though the radical press continued to patronize the general.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[File:Duel Deroul\u00e8de-Cl\u00e9menceau.jpg|thumb|Duel between Georges Clemenceau and [[Paul D\u00e9roul\u00e8de]]]]\nBy his exposure of the [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy#Resignation|Wilson scandal]], and by his personal plain speaking, Clemenceau contributed largely to [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]]'s resignation of the presidency of France in 1887. He had declined Gr\u00e9vy's request to form a cabinet upon the downfall of the cabinet of [[Maurice Rouvier]] by advising his followers to vote for neither [[Charles Floquet]], Jules Ferry, nor Charles de Freycinet, he was primarily responsible for the election of an \"outsider,\" [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot]], as president.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe split in the Radical Party over [[Boulangism]] weakened his hand, and its collapse meant that moderate republicans did not need his help. A further misfortune occurred in the [[Panama scandals|Panama affair]], as Clemenceau's relations with the businessman and politician [[Cornelius Herz]] led to his being included in the general suspicion. In response to accusations of corruption leveled by the nationalist politician [[Paul D\u00e9roul\u00e8de]], Clemenceau fought a duel with him on 23 December 1892.  Six shots were discharged, but neither participant was injured.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nClemenceau remained the leading spokesman for French radicalism, but his hostility to the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] so increased his unpopularity that in the [[1893 French legislative election|French legislative elections of 1893]], he was defeated for his seat in the Chamber of Deputies, after having held it continuously since 1876.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Dreyfus Affair===\nAfter his 1893 defeat, Clemenceau confined his political activities to journalism for nearly a decade. His career was further clouded by the long-drawn-out [[Dreyfus case]], in which he took an active part as a supporter of [[\u00c9mile Zola]] and an opponent of the anti-Semitic and nationalist campaigns. In all, Clemenceau published 665 articles defending Dreyfus during the affair.<ref name=\"Mus\u00e9e Clemenceau\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-clemenceau.fr/en/|title=G.Clemenceau Museum \u2013 Paris|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 January 1898, Clemenceau published \u00c9mile Zola's ''[[J'Accuse...!]]'' on the front page of the Paris daily newspaper ''[[L'Aurore]]'', of which he was owner and editor. He decided to run the controversial article, which would become a famous part of the [[Dreyfus Affair]], in the form of an open letter to [[F\u00e9lix Faure]], the president of France.\n\nIn 1900, he withdrew from ''La Justice'' to found a weekly review, ''Le Bloc'', to which he was practically the sole contributor. The publication of ''Le Bloc'' lasted until 15 March 1902. On 6 April 1902, he was elected senator for the Var district of [[Draguignan]], although he had previously called for the suppression of the French [[Senate (France)|Senate]], as he considered it a strong-house of conservatism. He served as the senator for Draguignan until 1920.\n\nClemenceau sat with the [[Independent Radicals]] in the Senate and moderated his positions, although he still vigorously supported the [[Radical-Socialist]] ministry of Prime Minister [[\u00c9mile Combes]], who spearheaded the [[anti-clericalist]] republican struggle. In June 1903, he undertook the direction of the journal ''L'Aurore'', which he had founded. In it, he led the campaign to revisit the Dreyfus affair, and to create a [[Freedom of religion in France|separation of Church and State in France]]. The latter was implemented by the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].<ref>See the [http://www.ville-larochesuryon.fr/IMG/pdf/discours_clemenceau.pdf 30 September 1906 discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928125610/http://www.ville-larochesuryon.fr/IMG/pdf/discours_clemenceau.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, [[La Roche-sur-Yon]] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===In cabinet===\nIn March 1906 the ministry of [[Maurice Rouvier]] fell as a result of civil disturbances provoked by the implementation of the law on the separation of church and state and the victory of radicals in the [[1906 French legislative election|French legislative elections of 1906]]. The new government of [[Ferdinand Sarrien]] appointed Clemenceau as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet. On a domestic level, Clemenceau reformed the [[French police]] forces and ordered repressive policies towards the workers' movement. He supported the formation of scientific police by [[Alphonse Bertillon]], and founded the ''Brigades mobiles'' (French for \"mobile squads\") led by [[C\u00e9lestin Hennion]]. These squads were nicknamed ''Brigades du Tigre'' (\"The Tiger's Brigades\") after Clemenceau himself.<ref name=\"Watson, 1976\"/>\n\nThe miners' strike in the [[Pas de Calais]] after the [[Courri\u00e8res mine disaster]], which resulted in the death of more than one thousand persons, threatened widespread disorder on 1 May 1906. Clemenceau ordered the military against the strikers and repressed the wine-growers' strike in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]]. His actions alienated the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) socialist party, from which he definitively broke in his notable reply in the Chamber of Deputies to [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]], leader of the SFIO, in June 1906.\nClemenceau's speech positioned him as the strong man of the day in French politics; when the Sarrien ministry resigned in October, Clemenceau became premier.\n\nAfter a proposal by the deputy [[Paul Dussaussoy]] for limited women's suffrage in local elections, Clemenceau published a pamphlet in 1907 in which he declared that if women were given the vote France would return to the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Gazdar|2016|loc=PT56}}\nAs the [[revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers]] developed Clemenceau at first dismissed the complaints, then sent in troops to keep the peace in June 1907.{{sfn|Castillon|2007}}\nDuring 1907 and 1908, he led the development of a new ''[[Entente cordiale]]'' with Britain, which gave France a successful role in European politics.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Difficulties with Germany and criticism by the Socialist party in connection with the handling of the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] in 1905\u201306 were settled at the [[Algeciras Conference]].\n\nClemenceau was defeated on 20 July 1909 in a discussion in the Chamber of Deputies on the state of the navy, in which bitter words were exchanged between him and [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], the former president of the Council whose downfall Clemenceau had aided.  Refusing to respond to Delcass\u00e9's technical questions, Clemenceau resigned after his proposal for the order of the day vote was rejected. He was succeeded as premier by [[Aristide Briand]], with a reconstructed cabinet.\n\nBetween 1909 and 1912, Clemenceau dedicated his time to travel, conferences and the treatment of his illness. He went to South America in 1910, traveling to Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina (where he went as far as Santa Ana de Tucuman in northwest Argentina). There, he was amazed by the influence of French culture and of the [[French Revolution]] on local elites.<ref>G. Clemenceau, ''Notes de voyage dans l'Am\u00e9rique du Sud'', Hachette, 1911</ref>\n\nHe published the first issue of the ''Journal du Var'' on 10 April 1910.  Three years later, on 6 May 1913, he founded ''L'Homme libre'' (\"The Free Man\") newspaper in Paris, for which he wrote a daily editorial. In these media, Clemenceau focused increasingly on foreign policy and condemned the Socialists' [[anti-militarism]].\n\n===First World War===\n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]] in France in August 1914, Clemenceau's newspaper was one of the first to be [[censorship in France|censored]] by the government; it was suspended from 29 September 1914 to 7 October. In response, Clemenceau changed the newspaper's name to ''L'Homme encha\u00een\u00e9'' (\"The Chained Man\"). He criticized the government for its lack of transparency and its ineffectiveness, while defending the patriotic ''[[union sacr\u00e9e]]'' against the German Empire.\n\nIn spite of the censorship imposed by the French government on Clemenceau's journalism at the beginning of World War I, he still wielded considerable political influence. As soon as the war started, Clemenceau advised Interior Minister [[Louis Malvy|Malvy]] to invoke Carnet B, a list of known and suspected subversives who were supposed to be arrested on mobilisation. The [[Paris Police Prefecture|Prefect of Police]] gave the same advice, but the government did not follow it, with the result that 80% of the 2,501 people listed on Carnet B volunteered for service.<ref>Tuchman 1962, p93</ref> Clemenceau declined to join the [[Union sacr\u00e9e|government of national unity]] as Justice Minister in autumn 1914.<ref>Tuchman 1962, p342</ref>\n\nHe suggested transportation of [[T. G. Masaryk]] legions from Russia to France s. c. \"North trip\" (by North sea) as first (the first realization 15 October 1917 from Archangelsk).<ref>Precl\u00edk, Vratislav.

His stance was driven by a will to regain the province of Alsace-Lorraine, a view shared by public opinion. The autumn of 1917 saw the disastrous Italian defeat at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia]], and rumours that former Prime Minister [[Joseph Caillaux]] and Interior Minister [[Louis Malvy]] might have engaged in treason. Prime Minister [[Paul Painlev\u00e9]] was inclined to open negotiations with Germany. Clemenceau argued that even German restitution of Alsace-Lorraine and the liberation of Belgium would not be enough to justify France abandoning her Allies. This forced [[Alexandre Ribot]] and Aristide Briand (both the previous two Prime Ministers, of whom the latter was by the far more powerful politician and had been approached by a German diplomat) to agree in public that there would be no separate peace. For many years, Clemenceau was blamed for having blocked a possible compromise peace, but it is now clear from examination of German documents that Germany had no serious intention of handing over Alsace-Lorraine.<ref>Watson 1974, pp265-8</ref> The prominence of his opposition made him the best known critic and the last man standing when the others had failed.<ref>Watson, ''Georges Clemenceau'' (1974) pp 249\u201372</ref> ''\"Messieurs, les Allemands sont toujours \u00e0 [[Noyon]]\"'' (Gentlemen, the Germans are still at Noyon) wrote Clemenceau's paper endlessly.<ref>Tuchman 1962, p425</ref>\n\n===Prime Minister again===\nIn November 1917, at one of the darkest hours for the French war effort in World War I, Clemenceau was appointed prime minister. Unlike his predecessors, he discouraged internal disagreement and called for peace among the senior politicians.<ref name=\"Watson, 1976\"/>\n\n====1917====\nClemenceau governed from the Ministry of War in the [[Rue Saint-Dominique]]. Almost his first act as prime minister was to relieve General [[Maurice Sarrail]] from his command of the [[Salonika Front]]. This was the main topic of discussion at the first meeting of the War Committee on 6 December, at which Clemenceau stated, \"Sarrail cannot remain there\".<ref>Doughty 2005, p403</ref><ref>Palmer 1998, p157</ref> The reason for Sarrail's dismissal was his links with the socialist politicians Joseph Caillaux and Louis Malvy (at that time suspected of treasonable contacts with the Germans)\n\n[[File:Georges Clemenceau.jpg|thumb|left|Clemenceau as Prime Minister of France]]\n\nChurchill later wrote that Clemenceau \"looked like a wild animal pacing to and fro behind bars\" in front of \"an assembly which would have done anything to avoid putting him there, but, having put him there, felt they must obey\".<ref>Terraine 1978, p25</ref>\n\nWhen Clemenceau became prime minister in 1917 victory seemed to be elusive. There was little activity on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] because it was believed that there should be limited attacks until the American support arrived. At this time, Italy was on the defensive, Russia had virtually stopped fighting  \u2013 and it was believed (correctly \u2013 see the [[Treaty of Brest Litovsk]]) that they would be making a separate peace with Germany. At home, the government had to deal with increasing demonstrations against the war, a scarcity of resources and air raids that were causing huge physical damage to Paris as well as undermining the morale of its citizens. It was also believed that many politicians secretly wanted peace. It was a challenging situation for Clemenceau; after years of criticizing other men during the war, he suddenly found himself in a position of supreme power. He was also isolated politically. He did not have close links with any parliamentary leaders (especially after he had antagonized them so relentlessly during the course of the war) and so had to rely on himself and his own circle of friends.\n\nClemenceau's assumption of power meant little to the men in the trenches at first. They thought of him as \"just another politician\", and the monthly assessment of troop morale found that only a minority found comfort in his appointment. Slowly, however, as time passed, the confidence he inspired in a few began to grow throughout all the fighting men. They were encouraged by his many visits to the trenches. This confidence began to spread from the trenches to the home front and it was said,{{by whom|date=November 2017}} \"We believed in Clemenceau rather in the way that our ancestors believed in Joan of Arc.\"  After years of criticism against the French army for its conservatism and Catholicism, Clemenceau would need help to get along with the military leaders to achieve a sound strategic plan. He nominated General [[Jean Jules Henri Mordacq|Henri Mordacq]] to be his military chief of staff. Mordacq helped to inspire trust and mutual respect from the army to the government which proved essential to the final victory.\n\nClemenceau was also well received by the media, because they felt that France was in need for strong leadership. It was widely recognized that throughout the war he was never discouraged and never stopped believing that France could achieve total victory. There were skeptics, however, that believed that Clemenceau, like other war time leaders, would have a short time in office. It was said,{{by whom|date=November 2017}} \"Like everyone else ... Clemenceau will not last long\u2014only long enough to clean up [the war].\"\n\n====1918: Clemenceau's crackdown====\nAs the military situation worsened in early 1918, Clemenceau continued to support the policy of total war \u2013 \"We present ourselves before you with the single thought of total war\" \u2013 and the policy of \"la guerre jusqu'au bout\" (war until the end). His speech of 8 March advocating this policy was so effective that it left a vivid impression on [[Winston Churchill]], who would make similar speeches on becoming British prime minister in 1940. Clemenceau's war policy encompassed the promise of victory with justice, loyalty to the fighting men, and immediate and severe punishment of crimes against France.<ref name=\"Watson, 1976\"/>\n\nJoseph Caillaux, a former French prime minister, disagreed with Clemenceau's policies. He wanted to surrender to Germany and negotiate a peace, thus Clemenceau viewed Caillaux as a threat to national security. Unlike previous ministers, Clemenceau moved against Caillaux publicly. As a result, a parliamentary committee decided that Caillaux would be arrested and imprisoned for three years. Clemenceau believed, in the words of Jean Ybarn\u00e9garay, that Caillaux's crime \"was not to have believed in victory [and] to have gambled on his nation's defeat\".<ref>Edgard Holt, ''The Tiger: the life of Georges Clemenceau, 1841\u20131929'' (1976) p 192.</ref>\n\nThe arrest of Caillaux and others raised the issue of Clemenceau's harshness but the only powers that Clemenceau assumed were those that he thought necessary to win the war. The many trials and arrests aroused great public excitement.  These trials, far from making the public fear the government, inspired confidence, as they felt that for the first time in the war, action was being taken and they were being firmly governed.  The claims that Clemenceau's \"firm government\" was a dictatorship found little support. Clemenceau was still held accountable to the people and media. He relaxed censorship on political views as he believed that newspapers had the right to criticize political figures: \"The right to insult members of the government is inviolable.\"<ref>Holt, p 192-93.</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Clemenceau thought that France should adopt [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], mainly because of its point that called for the return of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to France. This meant that victory would fulfill the war aim that was crucial for the French public. Clemenceau was sceptical about some other points, however, including those concerning the [[League of Nations]], as he believed that the latter could succeed only in a utopian society.<ref>{{cite book|author=L. Ambrosius|title=Wilsonianism: Woodrow Wilson and His Legacy in American Foreign Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9tlCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA69|year=2002|page=69|isbn=9781403970046}}</ref>\n\nAs war minister, Clemenceau was also in close contact with his generals, but he did not always make the most effective decisions concerning military issues (though he did heed the advice of the more experienced generals). As well as talking strategy with the generals, he also went to the trenches to see the [[poilus]], the French infantrymen. He would speak to them and assure them that their government was actually looking after them. The poilus had great respect for Clemenceau and his disregard for danger, as he often visited soldiers only yards away from German frontlines. The government was worried about the visits of Clemenceau to the front lines, as he was most of the time risking his own life by insulting and threatening the German soldiers in person directly from the trenches. These visits, his speech, and his verbal threats directly to the enemy impressed the soldiers and contributed to Clemenceau's title  \"P\u00e8re la Victoire\" (Father of Victory).\n\n====1918: the German spring offensive====\nOn 21 March 1918, the Germans began their great [[Spring Offensive]]. The Allies were caught off guard and a gap was created in the British/French lines that risked handing over access to Paris to the Germans. This defeat cemented Clemenceau's belief, and that of the other allies, that a coordinated, unified command was the best option. It was decided that [[Ferdinand Foch]] would be appointed as [[Generalissimo]].\n\nThe German line continued to advance, and Clemenceau believed that they could not rule out the fall of Paris. It was believed{{by whom|date=November 2017}} that if \"the tiger\" as well as Foch and [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] stayed in power, for even another week, France would be lost. It was thought{{by whom|date=November 2017}} that a government headed by [[Aristide Briand]] would be beneficial to France, because he would make peace with Germany on advantageous terms. Clemenceau adamantly opposed these opinions and he gave an inspirational speech in the Chamber of Deputies; the Chamber subsequently voted their confidence in him by 377 votes to 110.\n\n====1918: the Allied counter-offensive and the Armistice====\nAs the [[Hundred Days Offensive|Allied counter-offensives]] began to push the Germans back, it became clear that the Germans could no longer win the war. Although they still occupied vast amounts of French territory, they did not have sufficient resources and manpower to continue their attack. As countries allied to Germany began to ask for an armistice, it was obvious that Germany would soon follow. On 11 November 1918, an armistice with Germany was signed. Clemenceau was embraced in the streets and attracted admiring crowds. He was a strong, energetic, positive leader who was key to the allied victory of 1918.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Paris Peace Conference==\nTo settle the international political issues left over from the conclusion of World War I, it was decided that a peace conference would be held in Paris, France. Famously, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] between Germany and the Allied Powers to conclude the conflict was signed in the [[Palace of Versailles]], but the deliberations on which it was based were conducted in Paris, hence the name given to the meeting of the victorious heads of state that produced the treaties signed with the defeated powers: the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919. On 13 December 1918, United States president [[Woodrow Wilson]] received an enthusiastic welcome in France. His [[Fourteen Points]] and the concept of a [[League of Nations]] had made a big impact on the war-weary French. Clemenceau realized at their first meeting that he was a man of principle and conscience.\n\nIt was decided that since the conference was being held in France, Clemenceau would be the most appropriate president. He also spoke both English and French, the official languages of the conference.\n\nThe progress at the conference was much slower than anticipated, and decisions were constantly being tabled. It was this slow pace that induced Clemenceau to give an interview showing his irritation to an American journalist. He said he believed that Germany had won the war industrially and commercially as its factories were intact and its debts would soon be overcome through \"manipulation\". In a short time, he believed, the German economy would be much stronger than the French.\n\nFrance's diplomatic position at the Paris Peace Conference was repeatedly jeopardized by Clemenceau's mistrust of [[David Lloyd George]] and Woodrow Wilson, and his intense dislike of French President [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]]. When negotiations reached a stalemate, Clemenceau had a habit of shouting at the other heads of state and storming out of the room rather than participating in further discussion.\n\n===Attempted assassination===\nOn 19 February 1919, during the Paris Peace Conference, as Clemenceau was leaving his apartment in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rue Benjamin-Franklin|fr}} to drive to a meeting with Woodrow Wilson's aide [[Edward M. House]] and British Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Balfour]] at the [[H\u00f4tel de Crillon]], a man jumped out and fired several shots at the car. One bullet hit Clemenceau between the ribs, just missing his vital organs. Too dangerous to remove, the bullet remained with him for the rest of his life. Clemenceau's assailant, anarchist [[\u00c9mile Cottin]], was seized by the crowd following the leader's procession and nearly lynched. Taken back to his house, Clemenceau's faithful assistant found him pale, but conscious. \"They shot me in the back,\" Clemenceau told him. \"They didn't even dare to attack me from the front.\"<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''Paris 1919: Six Months that Changed the World'', Random House: New York, (2003) 150</ref>\n\nClemenceau often joked about the \"assassin's\" bad marksmanship \u2013 \"We have just won the most terrible war in history, yet here is a Frenchman who misses his target 6 out of 7 times at point-blank range. Of course this fellow must be punished for the careless use of a dangerous weapon and for poor marksmanship. I suggest that he be locked up for eight years, with intensive training in a shooting gallery.\"\n\n===Rhineland and the Saar===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1110-502, Georges Clemenceau.jpg|thumb|Clemenceau in his office]]\nWhen Clemenceau returned to the Council of Ten on 1 March he found that little had changed. One issue that had not changed at all was a dispute over France's long-running eastern frontier and control of the German [[Rhineland]]. Clemenceau believed that Germany's possession of this territory left France without a natural frontier in the East and thus simplified invasion into France for an attacking army. The British ambassador reported in December 1918 on Clemenceau's views on the future of the Rhineland: \"He said that the Rhine was a natural boundary of Gaul and Germany and that it ought to be made the German boundary now, the territory between the Rhine and the French frontier being made into an Independent State whose neutrality should be guaranteed by the great powers\".<ref>Watson, p. 337.</ref>\n\nThe issue was finally resolved when Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson guaranteed immediate military assistance if Germany attacked without provocation.<ref>Watson, p. 347.</ref> It was also decided that the Allies would occupy the territory for fifteen years, and that Germany could never rearm the area.<ref>Watson, p. 350.</ref> Lloyd George insisted on a clause allowing for the early withdrawal of Allied troops if the Germans fulfilled the treaty; Clemenceau inserted Article 429 into the treaty that permitted the Allied occupation beyond the fifteen years if adequate guarantees for Allied security against unprovoked aggression were not met. This was in case the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the treaty of guarantee, thereby making null and void the British guarantee as well, since that was dependent on the Americans being part of it. This is, in fact, what did occur. Article 429 ensured that a refusal of the U.S. Senate to ratify the treaties of guarantee would not weaken them.<ref>Watson, p. 351.</ref>\n\nPresident Poincar\u00e9 and Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] both repeatedly pressed for an autonomous Rhineland state. At a Cabinet meeting on 25 April Foch spoke against the deal Clemenceau had brokered and pushed for a separate Rhineland. On 28 April Poincar\u00e9 sent Clemenceau a long letter detailing why he thought Allied occupation should continue until Germany had paid all her reparations. Clemenceau replied that the alliance with America and Britain was of more value than an isolated France which held onto the Rhineland: \"In fifteen years I will be dead, but if you do me the honour of visiting my tomb, you will be able to say that the Germans have not fulfilled all the clauses of the treaty, and that we are still on the Rhine\".<ref>Watson, pp. 351\u2013352.</ref> Clemenceau said to Lloyd George in June: \"We need a barrier behind which, in the years to come, our people can work in security to rebuild its ruins. The barrier is the Rhine. I must take national feelings into account. That does not mean that I am afraid of losing office. I am quite indifferent on that point. But I will not, by giving up the occupation, do something which will break the willpower of our people\".<ref>Watson, p. 352.</ref> He said later to Jean Martel: \"The policy of Foch and Poincar\u00e9 was bad in principle. It was a policy no Frenchman, no republican Frenchman could accept for a moment, except in the hope of obtaining other guarantees, other advantages. We leave that sort of thing to [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]\".<ref>Watson, p. 353.</ref>\n\nThere was increasing discontent among Clemenceau, Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson about slow progress and information leaks surrounding the Council of Ten. They began to meet in a smaller group, called the Council of Four, [[Vittorio Orlando]] of Italy being the fourth, though less weighty, member. This offered greater privacy and security and increased the efficiency of the decision-making process. Another major issue that the Council of Four discussed was the future of the German [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] region. Clemenceau believed that France was entitled to the region and its coal mines after Germany deliberately damaged the coal mines in northern France. Wilson, however, resisted the French claim so firmly that Clemenceau accused him of being \"pro-German\". Lloyd George came to a compromise; the coal mines were given to France and the territory placed under French administration for 15 years, after which a vote would determine whether the region would rejoin Germany.<ref>Watson, pp. 349\u2013350.</ref>\n\nAlthough Clemenceau had little knowledge of the Austrian-Hungarian empire, he supported the causes of its smaller ethnic groups and his adamant stance lead to the stringent terms in the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that dismantled Hungary. Rather than recognizing territories of the Austrian-Hungarian empire solely within the principles of self-determination, Clemenceau sought to weaken Hungary, just as Germany was, and remove the threat of such a large power within Central Europe. The entire Czechoslovakian state was seen a potential buffer from Communism and this encompassed majority Hungarian territories.\n\n===Reparations===\nClemenceau was not experienced in the fields of economics or finance, and as [[John Maynard Keynes]] pointed out  \"he did not trouble his head to understand either the Indemnity or [France's] overwhelming financial difficulties\",<ref>Keynes, John, Maynard, The Economic Consequences of Peace, Cosimo, Inc., 2005, {{ISBN|9781596052222}}, p.150</ref> but he was under strong public and parliamentary pressure to make Germany's [[World War I reparations|reparations]] bill as large as possible. It was generally agreed that Germany should not pay more than it could afford, but the estimates of what it could afford varied greatly. Figures ranged between \u00a32,000&nbsp;million and \u00a320,000&nbsp;million. Clemenceau realised that any compromise would anger both the French and British citizens and that the only option was to establish a reparations commission which would examine Germany's capacity for reparations. This meant that the French government was not directly involved in the issue of reparations.\n\n===Defence of the Treaty===\nThe Treaty of Versailles was signed on 28 June 1919. Clemenceau now had to defend the treaty against critics who viewed the compromises Clemenceau had negotiated as inadequate for French national interests. The French Parliament debated the treaty and [[Louis Barthou]] on 24 September claimed that the U.S. Senate would not vote for the treaty of guarantee or the Treaty of Versailles and therefore it would have been wiser to have the Rhine as a frontier. Clemenceau replied that he was sure the Senate would ratify both and that he had inserted Article 429 into the treaty, providing for \"new arrangements concerning the Rhine\". This interpretation of Article 429 was disputed by Barthou.<ref>Watson, p. 360.</ref>\n\nClemenceau's main speech on the treaty was delivered on 25 September. He said that he knew the treaty was not perfect, but that the war had been fought by a coalition and therefore the treaty would express the lowest common denominator of those involved. He claimed criticisms of the details of the treaty were misleading; they should look at the treaty as a whole and see how they could benefit from it:\n\n<blockquote>The treaty, with all its complex clauses, will only be worth what you are worth; it will be what you make it...What you are going to vote to-day is not even a beginning, it is a beginning of a beginning. The ideas it contains will grow and bear fruit. You have won the power to impose them on a defeated Germany. We are told that she will revive. All the more reason not to show her that we fear her...M. Marin went to the heart of the question, when he turned to us and said in despairing tones, 'You have reduced us to a policy of vigilance.' Yes, M. Marin, do you think that one could make a treaty which would do away with the need for vigilance among the nations of Europe who only yesterday were pouring out their blood in battle? Life is a perpetual struggle in war, as in peace...That struggle cannot be avoided. Yes, we must have vigilance, we must have a great deal of vigilance. I cannot say for how many years, perhaps I should say for how many centuries, the crisis which has begun will continue. Yes, this treaty will bring us burdens, troubles, miseries, difficulties, and that will continue for long years.<ref>Watson, p. 361.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies ratified the treaty by 372 votes to 53, with the Senate voting unanimously for its ratification. On 11 October he gave his last parliamentary speech, to the Senate. He said that any attempt to partition Germany would be self-defeating and that France must find a way of living with sixty million Germans. He also said that the bourgeoisie, like the aristocracy before them in the ''ancien r\u00e9gime'', had failed as a ruling class. It was now the turn of the working class to rule.  He advocated national unity and a demographic revolution: \"The treaty does not state that France will have many children, but it is the first thing that should have been written there. For if France does not have large families, it will be in vain that you put all the finest clauses in the treaty, that you take away all the Germans guns, France will be lost because there will be no more French\".<ref>Watson, p. 362.</ref>\n\n==Domestic policies==\nClemenceau's final tenure as prime minister witnessed the implementation of various reforms aimed at regulating the hours of labour. A general 8-hour-day law passed in April 1919 amended the French Labour Code, and in June that year, existing legislation concerning the duration of the working day in the mining industry was amended by extending the eight-hour day to all classes of workpeople, \"whether employed underground or on the surface.\" Under a previous law of December 1913, the eight-hour limit had only applied to workpeople employed underground. In August 1919, a similar limit was introduced for all those employed in French vessels. Another law passed in 1919 (which came into operation in October 1920) prohibited employment in bakeries between the hours of 10 P.M. and 4 A.M. A decree of May 1919 introduced the 8-hour day for workers on trams, railways, and in inland waterways, and a second of June 1919 extended this provision to the State railways.<ref>The ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'': a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 31 by Hugh Chisholm</ref> In April 1919, an enabling Act was approved for an eight-hour day and a six-day week, although farmworkers were excluded from the Act.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/questfortimeredu0000cros|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/questfortimeredu0000cros/page/131 131]|quote=france The Eight-hour Act of April 23 1919.|title=A Quest for Time|publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=24 May 2016|isbn=9780520065321|last1=Cross|first1=Gary S.|last2=Cross|first2=Distinguished Professor of Modern History Gary|date=1 January 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Presidential bid==\n[[File:Clemenceau Beaux 1920.jpg|thumb|left|Georges Clemenceau by [[Cecilia Beaux]] (1920).]]\n\nIn 1919 France adopted a new electoral system and the [[1919 French legislative election|legislative election]] gave the [[National Bloc (France)|National Bloc]] (a coalition of right-wing parties) a majority. Clemenceau only intervened once in the election campaign, delivering a speech on 4 November at Strasbourg, praising the manifesto and men of the National Bloc and urging that the victory in the war needed to be safeguarded by vigilance. In private he was concerned at this huge swing to the right.<ref>Watson, p. 385.</ref>\n\nHis friend [[Georges Mandel]] urged Clemenceau to stand for the presidency in the upcoming election and on 15 January 1920 he let Mandel announce that he would be prepared to serve if elected. However Clemenceau did not intend to campaign for the post, instead he wished to be chosen by acclaim as a national symbol. The preliminary meeting of the republican caucus (a forerunner to the vote in the National Assembly) chose [[Paul Deschanel]] instead of Clemenceau by a vote of 408 to 389. In response, Clemenceau refused to be put forward for the vote in the National Assembly because he did not want to win by a small majority, but by a near-unanimous vote. Only then, he claimed, could he negotiate with confidence with the Allies.<ref>Watson, p. 386.</ref>\n\nIn his last speech to the Cabinet on 18 January he said, \"We must show the world the extent of our victory, and we must take up the mentality and habits of a victorious people, which once more takes its place at the head of Europe. But all that will now be placed in jeopardy...It will take less time and less thought to destroy the edifice so patiently and painfully erected than it took to complete it. Poor France. The mistakes have begun already\".<ref name=\"Watson387\">Watson, p. 387.</ref>\n\n==Last years==\nClemenceau resigned as prime minister as soon as the presidential election was held (17 January 1920) and took no further part in politics. In private, he condemned the unilateral occupation by French troops of the German city of [[Frankfurt]] in 1920 and said if he had been in power, he would have persuaded the British to join it.<ref name=\"Watson387\"/>\n\nHe took a holiday in Egypt and the Sudan from February to April 1920, then embarked for the Far East in September, returning to France in March 1921. In June, he visited England and received an honorary degree from the [[University of Oxford]]. He met Lloyd George and said to him that after the Armistice he had become the enemy of France. Lloyd George replied, \"Well, was not that always our traditional policy?\" He was joking, but after reflection, Clemenceau took it seriously. After Lloyd George's fall from power in 1922 Clemenceau remarked, \"As for France, it is a real enemy who disappears. Lloyd George did not hide it: at my last visit to London he cynically admitted it\".<ref>Watson, p. 388.</ref>\n\nIn late 1922, Clemenceau gave a lecture tour in the major cities of the American northeast. He defended the policy of France, including war debts and reparations, and condemned [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]]. He was well received and attracted large audiences, but America's policy remained unchanged. On 9 August 1926, he wrote an open letter to the American President [[Calvin Coolidge]] that argued against France paying all its war debts: \"France is not for sale, even to her friends\". This appeal went unheard.<ref>Watson, p. 389.</ref>\n\nHe condemned Poincar\u00e9's [[occupation of the Ruhr]] in 1923 as an undoing of the entente between France and Britain.<ref name=\"Watson387\"/>\n\nHe wrote two short biographies, one of the Greek orator [[Demosthenes]] and one of the French painter [[Claude Monet]]. He also penned a huge two-volume tome, covering philosophy, history and science, titled ''Au Soir de la Pens\u00e9e''. Writing this occupied most of his time between 1923 and 1927.<ref>Watson, pp. 390\u2013391.</ref>\n\nDuring his last months, he wrote his memoirs, despite declaring previously that he would not write them. He was spurred into doing so by the appearance of Marshal Foch's memoirs, which were highly critical of Clemenceau, mainly for his policy at the Paris Peace Conference. He only had time to finish the first draft and it was published posthumously as ''Grandeurs et Mis\u00e8res d'une Victoire'' (''The Grandeur and Misery of Victory''). He was critical of Foch and also of his successors who had allowed the Versailles Treaty to be undermined in the face of Germany's revival.  He burned all of his private letters.\n\nClemenceau died on 24 November 1929 and was buried at [[Mouchamps]].\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1919''': Member of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]].<ref>Index biographique des membres et associ\u00e9s de l'Acad\u00e9mie royale de Belgique (1769\u20132005). p 56</ref>\n\n==Clemenceau's First Ministry, 25 October 1906 \u2013 24 July 1909==\n*Georges Clemenceau \u2013 President of the Council and Minister of the Interior\n*[[St\u00e9phen Pichon]] \u2013 Minister of Foreign Affairs\n*[[Georges Picquart]] \u2013 Minister of War\n*[[Joseph Caillaux]] \u2013 Minister of Finance\n*[[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] \u2013 Minister of Labour and Social Security Provisions\n*[[Edmond Guyot-Dessaigne]] \u2013 Minister of Justice\n*[[Gaston Thomson]] \u2013 Minister of Marine\n*[[Aristide Briand]] \u2013 Minister of Public Instruction, Fine Arts, and Worship\n*[[Joseph Ruau]] \u2013 Minister of Agriculture\n*[[Rapha\u00ebl Milli\u00e8s-Lacroix]] \u2013 Minister of Colonies\n*[[Louis Barthou]] \u2013 Minister of Public Works, Posts, and Telegraphs\n*[[Gaston Doumergue]] \u2013 Minister of Commerce and Industry.\n\n'''Changes'''\n*4 January 1908 \u2013 [[Aristide Briand]] succeeds Guyot-Dessaigne as Minister of Justice.

A leading figure of the [[Independent Radicals]], he played a central role in the politics of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].\n\nClemenceau was Prime Minister of [[France]] from 1906 to 1909 and from 1917 to 1920. Demanding a total victory over Germany, he wanted reparations, colonies, Alsace-Lorraine, and strict rules to prevent Germany from rearming.  He achieved these goals in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] imposed on Germany at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. Nicknamed \"P\u00e8re la Victoire\" (''Father Victory'') or \"Le Tigre\" (''The Tiger''), in the 1920s he continued his harsh position against Germany, though not quite as much as the President [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]].  He obtained mutual defense treaties with Britain and the United States, to unite against German aggression, but these never took effect.\n\n==Early years==\nClemenceau was a native of the [[Vend\u00e9e]], born at [[Mouilleron-en-Pareds]]. During the period of the [[French Revolution]], the Vend\u00e9e had been a [[Revolt in the Vend\u00e9e|hotbed of monarchist sympathies]].  The region was remote from Paris, rural and poor.  His mother, Sophie Eucharie Gautreau (1817\u20131903), was of [[Huguenot]] descent. His father, Benjamin Clemenceau (1810\u20131897), came from a long line of physicians, but he lived off his lands and investments and did not practice medicine. Benjamin was a political activist; he was arrested and briefly held in 1851 and again in 1858.  He instilled in his son a love of learning, devotion to [[Radical politics|radical]] politics, and a hatred of [[Catholicism]].<ref>David Watson, ''Georges Clemenceau: A Political Biography'' (1976) pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The lawyer [[Albert Clemenceau]] (1861\u20131955) was his brother.  His mother was devoutly Protestant; his father was an atheist, and insisted that his children should have no religious education. Georges was interested in religious issues. He was a lifelong [[Atheism|atheist]] with a sound knowledge of the [[Bible]]{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}.  He became a leader of anti-clerical or \"Radical\" forces that battled against the Catholic Church in France and the Catholics in politics.  He stopped short of the more extreme attacks. His position was that if church and state were kept rigidly separated, he would not support oppressive measures designed to further weaken the Church.<ref>David Watson, ''Georges Clemenceau: A Political Biography'' (1978) p 17, 152.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=David S.

He went to Paris to study medicine, eventually graduating with the completion of his thesis \"De la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration des \u00e9l\u00e9ments anatomiques\" in 1865.<ref>Clemenceau (1865), pp. 7\u201311</ref>\n\n==Political activism and American experience==\nIn Paris, the young Clemenceau became a political activist and writer. In December 1861, he co-founded a weekly newsletter, ''Le Travail,'' along with some friends. On 23 February 1862, he was arrested by the police for having placed posters summoning a demonstration. He spent 77 days in the [[Mazas Prison]]. Around the same time, Clemenceau also visited the old French revolutionary [[Auguste Blanqui]] and another Republican activist, [[Auguste Scheurer-Kestner]], in jail, further deepening his hatred of Napoleon III's regime and his fervent republicanism.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Winock|first=Michel|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3917/perri.wino.2013.01|title=Clemenceau|date=2013|publisher=\u00c9ditions Perrin|year=|isbn=978-2-262-03878-6|location=|pages=73-90}}</ref>\n\nHe finally graduated as a doctor of medicine on 13 May 1865, founded several literary magazines, and wrote many articles, most of which attacked the imperial regime of [[Napoleon III]]. After a failed love affair, Clemenceau left France for the [[United States]] as the imperial agents began cracking down on dissidents, sending most of them to the ''bagne de Cayennes'' ([[Devil's Island]] Penal System) in [[French Guiana]].\n\nClemenceau worked in [[New York City]] in the years 1865\u201369, following the [[American Civil War]]. He maintained a medical practice, but spent much of his time on political journalism for a Parisian newspaper, ''Le Temps''. He taught French at the home of Calvin Rood in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]], and also taught and rode horseback at a private girls' school in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], where he would meet his future wife. During this time, he joined French exile clubs in New York opposing the imperial regime.\n\nClemenceau covered the country's recovery following the Civil War, the workings of American democracy and the racial questions related to the end of slavery, as part of his journalistic activity. From his time in America, he retained a strong faith in American democratic ideals as opposed to France's imperial regime, as well as a sense of political compromise that would later become a hallmark of his political career<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n==Marriage and family==\n[[File:Mary Cl\u00e9menceau, by Ferdinand Victor L\u00e9on Roybet.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Plummer|Mary Cl\u00e9menceau]] in period costume.

She was the daughter of William Kelly Plummer and wife Harriet A. Taylor. The Clemenceaus moved to France and had three children together, Madeleine (born in 1870), Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (1872) and Michel (1873)<ref name=\":0\" />. The marriage ended in a contentious divorce.<ref>Watson (1976), pp. 23\u201332.</ref>\n\n==The beginning of the Third Republic==\nClemenceau returned to Paris after the French defeat at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] in 1870 during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the fall of the [[Second French Empire]]. After returning to medical practice as a physician in Vend\u00e9e, he was appointed mayor of the [[18th arrondissement of Paris]], including [[Montmartre]], and was also elected to the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] for the 18th arrondissement. When the [[Paris Commune]] seized power in March 1871, he tried unsuccessfully to find a compromise between the more radical leaders of the commune and the more conservative French government.  The Commune declared that he had no legal authority to be mayor and seized the city hall of the 18th arrondissement.  He ran for election to the Paris Commune council, but received less than eight hundred votes and took no part in its governance.  He was in [[Bordeaux]] when the Commune was suppressed by the French Army in May 1871.<ref>Milza, Pierre, ''L'ann\u00e9e terrible \u2013 La Commune (mars-juin 1871)''</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of the Commune, he was elected to the Paris municipal council on 23 July 1871 for the Clignancourt quarter, and retained his seat till 1876. He first held the offices of secretary and vice-president, then became president in 1875.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopaedia britannica : a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information.|last=Chisolm|first=Hugh|publisher=The Encyclopaedia Britannica Company|year=1910|isbn=|edition=11th|location=New York|pages=482|oclc=962864074}}</ref>\n\n===Chamber of Deputies===\n[[File:1887 Bettannier Der Schwarze Fleck anagoria.jpg|thumb|A painting from 1887 depicting a French child being taught about the \"lost\" province of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] in the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].

He joined the far left, and his energy and mordant eloquence speedily made him the leader of the radical section. In 1877, after the [[16 May 1877 crisis|Crisis of 16 May 1877]], he was one of the republican majority who denounced the ministry of the [[Albert, 4th duc de Broglie|Duc de Broglie]]. He led resistance to the anti-republican policy of which the incident of 16 May was a manifestation. In 1879 his demand for the indictment of the Broglie ministry brought him prominence.<ref name=\"Watson, 1976\">Watson, ''Georges Clemenceau: A Political Biography'' (1976).</ref>\n\nFrom 1876 to 1880, Clemenceau was one of the main defenders of the general amnesty of thousands of Communards, members of the revolutionary government of the 1871 Paris Commune, who had been deported to [[New Caledonia]]. Along with other radicals and figures such as poet and then-senator [[Victor Hugo]], as well as a growing number of republicans, he supported several unsuccessful proposals. A general amnesty was finally adopted on July 11, 1880. The \"reconciliation\" envisaged by Clemenceau could begin, as the remaining deported Communards such as his friend [[Louise Michel]] returned to France<ref name=\":0\" />.\n[[File:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli - Georges Clemenceau pronon\u00e7ant un discours dans une r\u00e9union \u00e9lectorale.jpg|left|thumb|283x283px|Clemenceau giving a speech in the Parisian Fernando Circus (painting by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli]], 1883).]]\n[[File:\u00c9douard Manet - Portrait of George Clemeceau.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of Georges Clemenceau'' by [[\u00c9douard Manet]], c. 1879\u201380]]\n\nIn 1880, Clemenceau started his newspaper ''La Justice'', which became the principal organ of [[Parisian Radicalism]]. From this time, throughout the presidency of [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]] (1879\u20131887), he became widely known as a political critic and destroyer of ministries (''le Tombeur de minist\u00e8res'') who avoided taking office himself. Leading the far left in the Chamber of Deputies, he was an active opponent of the [[French Colonial Empire|colonial policy]] of Prime Minister [[Jules Ferry]], which he opposed on moral grounds and also as a form of diversion from the more important goal of \"[[Revanchism|Revenge against Germany]]\" for the annexation of [[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine]] after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. In 1885, his criticism of the conduct of the [[Sino-French War]] contributed strongly to the fall of the Ferry cabinet that year.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nDuring the [[1885 French legislative election|French legislative elections of 1885]], he advocated a strong radical programme and was returned both for his old seat in Paris and for the [[Var (d\u00e9partement)|Var]], district of [[Draguignan]]. He chose to represent the latter in the Chamber of Deputies. Refusing to form a ministry to replace the one he had overthrown, he supported the right in keeping Prime Minister [[Charles de Freycinet]] in power in 1886 and was responsible for the inclusion of [[Georges Ernest Boulanger]] in the Freycinet cabinet as War Minister. When General Boulanger revealed himself as an ambitious pretender, Clemenceau withdrew his support and became a vigorous opponent of the heterogeneous Boulangist movement, though the radical press continued to patronize the general.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[File:Duel Deroul\u00e8de-Cl\u00e9menceau.jpg|thumb|Duel between Georges Clemenceau and [[Paul D\u00e9roul\u00e8de]]]]\nBy his exposure of the [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy#Resignation|Wilson scandal]], and by his personal plain speaking, Clemenceau contributed largely to [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]]'s resignation of the presidency of France in 1887. He had declined Gr\u00e9vy's request to form a cabinet upon the downfall of the cabinet of [[Maurice Rouvier]] by advising his followers to vote for neither [[Charles Floquet]], Jules Ferry, nor Charles de Freycinet, he was primarily responsible for the election of an \"outsider,\" [[Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot]], as president.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe split in the Radical Party over [[Boulangism]] weakened his hand, and its collapse meant that moderate republicans did not need his help. A further misfortune occurred in the [[Panama scandals|Panama affair]], as Clemenceau's relations with the businessman and politician [[Cornelius Herz]] led to his being included in the general suspicion. In response to accusations of corruption leveled by the nationalist politician [[Paul D\u00e9roul\u00e8de]], Clemenceau fought a duel with him on 23 December 1892.  Six shots were discharged, but neither participant was injured.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nClemenceau remained the leading spokesman for French radicalism, but his hostility to the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] so increased his unpopularity that in the [[1893 French legislative election|French legislative elections of 1893]], he was defeated for his seat in the Chamber of Deputies, after having held it continuously since 1876.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Dreyfus Affair===\nAfter his 1893 defeat, Clemenceau confined his political activities to journalism for nearly a decade. His career was further clouded by the long-drawn-out [[Dreyfus case]], in which he took an active part as a supporter of [[\u00c9mile Zola]] and an opponent of the anti-Semitic and nationalist campaigns. In all, Clemenceau published 665 articles defending Dreyfus during the affair.<ref name=\"Mus\u00e9e Clemenceau\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-clemenceau.fr/en/|title=G.Clemenceau Museum \u2013 Paris|accessdate=24 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 January 1898, Clemenceau published \u00c9mile Zola's ''[[J'Accuse...!]]'' on the front page of the Paris daily newspaper ''[[L'Aurore]]'', of which he was owner and editor. He decided to run the controversial article, which would become a famous part of the [[Dreyfus Affair]], in the form of an open letter to [[F\u00e9lix Faure]], the president of France.\n\nIn 1900, he withdrew from ''La Justice'' to found a weekly review, ''Le Bloc'', to which he was practically the sole contributor. The publication of ''Le Bloc'' lasted until 15 March 1902. On 6 April 1902, he was elected senator for the Var district of [[Draguignan]], although he had previously called for the suppression of the French [[Senate (France)|Senate]], as he considered it a strong-house of conservatism. He served as the senator for Draguignan until 1920.\n\nClemenceau sat with the [[Independent Radicals]] in the Senate and moderated his positions, although he still vigorously supported the [[Radical-Socialist]] ministry of Prime Minister [[\u00c9mile Combes]], who spearheaded the [[anti-clericalist]] republican struggle. In June 1903, he undertook the direction of the journal ''L'Aurore'', which he had founded. In it, he led the campaign to revisit the Dreyfus affair, and to create a [[Freedom of religion in France|separation of Church and State in France]]. The latter was implemented by the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].<ref>See the [http://www.ville-larochesuryon.fr/IMG/pdf/discours_clemenceau.pdf 30 September 1906 discourse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928125610/http://www.ville-larochesuryon.fr/IMG/pdf/discours_clemenceau.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }}, [[La Roche-sur-Yon]] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===In cabinet===\nIn March 1906 the ministry of [[Maurice Rouvier]] fell as a result of civil disturbances provoked by the implementation of the law on the separation of church and state and the victory of radicals in the [[1906 French legislative election|French legislative elections of 1906]]. The new government of [[Ferdinand Sarrien]] appointed Clemenceau as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet. On a domestic level, Clemenceau reformed the [[French police]] forces and ordered repressive policies towards the workers' movement. He supported the formation of scientific police by [[Alphonse Bertillon]], and founded the ''Brigades mobiles'' (French for \"mobile squads\") led by [[C\u00e9lestin Hennion]]. These squads were nicknamed ''Brigades du Tigre'' (\"The Tiger's Brigades\") after Clemenceau himself.<ref name=\"Watson, 1976\"/>\n\nThe miners' strike in the [[Pas de Calais]] after the [[Courri\u00e8res mine disaster]], which resulted in the death of more than one thousand persons, threatened widespread disorder on 1 May 1906. Clemenceau ordered the military against the strikers and repressed the wine-growers' strike in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]]. His actions alienated the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) socialist party, from which he definitively broke in his notable reply in the Chamber of Deputies to [[Jean Jaur\u00e8s]], leader of the SFIO, in June 1906.\nClemenceau's speech positioned him as the strong man of the day in French politics; when the Sarrien ministry resigned in October, Clemenceau became premier.\n\nAfter a proposal by the deputy [[Paul Dussaussoy]] for limited women's suffrage in local elections, Clemenceau published a pamphlet in 1907 in which he declared that if women were given the vote France would return to the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Gazdar|2016|loc=PT56}}\nAs the [[revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers]] developed Clemenceau at first dismissed the complaints, then sent in troops to keep the peace in June 1907.{{sfn|Castillon|2007}}\nDuring 1907 and 1908, he led the development of a new ''[[Entente cordiale]]'' with Britain, which gave France a successful role in European politics.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Difficulties with Germany and criticism by the Socialist party in connection with the handling of the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] in 1905\u201306 were settled at the [[Algeciras Conference]].\n\nClemenceau was defeated on 20 July 1909 in a discussion in the Chamber of Deputies on the state of the navy, in which bitter words were exchanged between him and [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]], the former president of the Council whose downfall Clemenceau had aided.  Refusing to respond to Delcass\u00e9's technical questions, Clemenceau resigned after his proposal for the order of the day vote was rejected. He was succeeded as premier by [[Aristide Briand]], with a reconstructed cabinet.\n\nBetween 1909 and 1912, Clemenceau dedicated his time to travel, conferences and the treatment of his illness. He went to South America in 1910, traveling to Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina (where he went as far as Santa Ana de Tucuman in northwest Argentina). There, he was amazed by the influence of French culture and of the [[French Revolution]] on local elites.<ref>G. Clemenceau, ''Notes de voyage dans l'Am\u00e9rique du Sud'', Hachette, 1911</ref>\n\nHe published the first issue of the ''Journal du Var'' on 10 April 1910.  Three years later, on 6 May 1913, he founded ''L'Homme libre'' (\"The Free Man\") newspaper in Paris, for which he wrote a daily editorial. In these media, Clemenceau focused increasingly on foreign policy and condemned the Socialists' [[anti-militarism]].\n\n===First World War===\n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]] in France in August 1914, Clemenceau's newspaper was one of the first to be [[censorship in France|censored]] by the government; it was suspended from 29 September 1914 to 7 October. In response, Clemenceau changed the newspaper's name to ''L'Homme encha\u00een\u00e9'' (\"The Chained Man\"). He criticized the government for its lack of transparency and its ineffectiveness, while defending the patriotic ''[[union sacr\u00e9e]]'' against the German Empire.\n\nIn spite of the censorship imposed by the French government on Clemenceau's journalism at the beginning of World War I, he still wielded considerable political influence. As soon as the war started, Clemenceau advised Interior Minister [[Louis Malvy|Malvy]] to invoke Carnet B, a list of known and suspected subversives who were supposed to be arrested on mobilisation. The [[Paris Police Prefecture|Prefect of Police]] gave the same advice, but the government did not follow it, with the result that 80% of the 2,501 people listed on Carnet B volunteered for service.<ref>Tuchman 1962, p93</ref> Clemenceau declined to join the [[Union sacr\u00e9e|government of national unity]] as Justice Minister in autumn 1914.<ref>Tuchman 1962, p342</ref>\n\nHe suggested transportation of [[T.

His stance was driven by a will to regain the province of Alsace-Lorraine, a view shared by public opinion. The autumn of 1917 saw the disastrous Italian defeat at the [[Battle of Caporetto]], the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia]], and rumours that former Prime Minister [[Joseph Caillaux]] and Interior Minister [[Louis Malvy]] might have engaged in treason. Prime Minister [[Paul Painlev\u00e9]] was inclined to open negotiations with Germany. Clemenceau argued that even German restitution of Alsace-Lorraine and the liberation of Belgium would not be enough to justify France abandoning her Allies. This forced [[Alexandre Ribot]] and Aristide Briand (both the previous two Prime Ministers, of whom the latter was by the far more powerful politician and had been approached by a German diplomat) to agree in public that there would be no separate peace. For many years, Clemenceau was blamed for having blocked a possible compromise peace, but it is now clear from examination of German documents that Germany had no serious intention of handing over Alsace-Lorraine.<ref>Watson 1974, pp265-8</ref> The prominence of his opposition made him the best known critic and the last man standing when the others had failed.<ref>Watson, ''Georges Clemenceau'' (1974) pp 249\u201372</ref> ''\"Messieurs, les Allemands sont toujours \u00e0 [[Noyon]]\"'' (Gentlemen, the Germans are still at Noyon) wrote Clemenceau's paper endlessly.<ref>Tuchman 1962, p425</ref>\n\n===Prime Minister again===\nIn November 1917, at one of the darkest hours for the French war effort in World War I, Clemenceau was appointed prime minister. Unlike his predecessors, he discouraged internal disagreement and called for peace among the senior politicians.<ref name=\"Watson, 1976\"/>\n\n====1917====\nClemenceau governed from the Ministry of War in the [[Rue Saint-Dominique]]. Almost his first act as prime minister was to relieve General [[Maurice Sarrail]] from his command of the [[Salonika Front]]. This was the main topic of discussion at the first meeting of the War Committee on 6 December, at which Clemenceau stated, \"Sarrail cannot remain there\".<ref>Doughty 2005, p403</ref><ref>Palmer 1998, p157</ref> The reason for Sarrail's dismissal was his links with the socialist politicians Joseph Caillaux and Louis Malvy (at that time suspected of treasonable contacts with the Germans)\n\n[[File:Georges Clemenceau.jpg|thumb|left|Clemenceau as Prime Minister of France]]\n\nChurchill later wrote that Clemenceau \"looked like a wild animal pacing to and fro behind bars\" in front of \"an assembly which would have done anything to avoid putting him there, but, having put him there, felt they must obey\".<ref>Terraine 1978, p25</ref>\n\nWhen Clemenceau became prime minister in 1917 victory seemed to be elusive. There was little activity on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] because it was believed that there should be limited attacks until the American support arrived. At this time, Italy was on the defensive, Russia had virtually stopped fighting  \u2013 and it was believed (correctly \u2013 see the [[Treaty of Brest Litovsk]]) that they would be making a separate peace with Germany. At home, the government had to deal with increasing demonstrations against the war, a scarcity of resources and air raids that were causing huge physical damage to Paris as well as undermining the morale of its citizens. It was also believed that many politicians secretly wanted peace. It was a challenging situation for Clemenceau; after years of criticizing other men during the war, he suddenly found himself in a position of supreme power. He was also isolated politically. He did not have close links with any parliamentary leaders (especially after he had antagonized them so relentlessly during the course of the war) and so had to rely on himself and his own circle of friends.\n\nClemenceau's assumption of power meant little to the men in the trenches at first. They thought of him as \"just another politician\", and the monthly assessment of troop morale found that only a minority found comfort in his appointment. Slowly, however, as time passed, the confidence he inspired in a few began to grow throughout all the fighting men. They were encouraged by his many visits to the trenches. This confidence began to spread from the trenches to the home front and it was said,{{by whom|date=November 2017}} \"We believed in Clemenceau rather in the way that our ancestors believed in Joan of Arc.\"  After years of criticism against the French army for its conservatism and Catholicism, Clemenceau would need help to get along with the military leaders to achieve a sound strategic plan. He nominated General [[Jean Jules Henri Mordacq|Henri Mordacq]] to be his military chief of staff. Mordacq helped to inspire trust and mutual respect from the army to the government which proved essential to the final victory.\n\nClemenceau was also well received by the media, because they felt that France was in need for strong leadership. It was widely recognized that throughout the war he was never discouraged and never stopped believing that France could achieve total victory. There were skeptics, however, that believed that Clemenceau, like other war time leaders, would have a short time in office. It was said,{{by whom|date=November 2017}} \"Like everyone else ... Clemenceau will not last long\u2014only long enough to clean up [the war].\"\n\n====1918: Clemenceau's crackdown====\nAs the military situation worsened in early 1918, Clemenceau continued to support the policy of total war \u2013 \"We present ourselves before you with the single thought of total war\" \u2013 and the policy of \"la guerre jusqu'au bout\" (war until the end). His speech of 8 March advocating this policy was so effective that it left a vivid impression on [[Winston Churchill]], who would make similar speeches on becoming British prime minister in 1940. Clemenceau's war policy encompassed the promise of victory with justice, loyalty to the fighting men, and immediate and severe punishment of crimes against France.<ref name=\"Watson, 1976\"/>\n\nJoseph Caillaux, a former French prime minister, disagreed with Clemenceau's policies. He wanted to surrender to Germany and negotiate a peace, thus Clemenceau viewed Caillaux as a threat to national security. Unlike previous ministers, Clemenceau moved against Caillaux publicly. As a result, a parliamentary committee decided that Caillaux would be arrested and imprisoned for three years. Clemenceau believed, in the words of Jean Ybarn\u00e9garay, that Caillaux's crime \"was not to have believed in victory [and] to have gambled on his nation's defeat\".<ref>Edgard Holt, ''The Tiger: the life of Georges Clemenceau, 1841\u20131929'' (1976) p 192.</ref>\n\nThe arrest of Caillaux and others raised the issue of Clemenceau's harshness but the only powers that Clemenceau assumed were those that he thought necessary to win the war. The many trials and arrests aroused great public excitement.  These trials, far from making the public fear the government, inspired confidence, as they felt that for the first time in the war, action was being taken and they were being firmly governed.  The claims that Clemenceau's \"firm government\" was a dictatorship found little support. Clemenceau was still held accountable to the people and media. He relaxed censorship on political views as he believed that newspapers had the right to criticize political figures: \"The right to insult members of the government is inviolable.\"<ref>Holt, p 192-93.</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Clemenceau thought that France should adopt [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], mainly because of its point that called for the return of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to France. This meant that victory would fulfill the war aim that was crucial for the French public. Clemenceau was sceptical about some other points, however, including those concerning the [[League of Nations]], as he believed that the latter could succeed only in a utopian society.<ref>{{cite book|author=L. Ambrosius|title=Wilsonianism: Woodrow Wilson and His Legacy in American Foreign Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9tlCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA69|year=2002|page=69|isbn=9781403970046}}</ref>\n\nAs war minister, Clemenceau was also in close contact with his generals, but he did not always make the most effective decisions concerning military issues (though he did heed the advice of the more experienced generals). As well as talking strategy with the generals, he also went to the trenches to see the [[poilus]], the French infantrymen. He would speak to them and assure them that their government was actually looking after them. The poilus had great respect for Clemenceau and his disregard for danger, as he often visited soldiers only yards away from German frontlines. The government was worried about the visits of Clemenceau to the front lines, as he was most of the time risking his own life by insulting and threatening the German soldiers in person directly from the trenches. These visits, his speech, and his verbal threats directly to the enemy impressed the soldiers and contributed to Clemenceau's title  \"P\u00e8re la Victoire\" (Father of Victory).\n\n====1918: the German spring offensive====\nOn 21 March 1918, the Germans began their great [[Spring Offensive]]. The Allies were caught off guard and a gap was created in the British/French lines that risked handing over access to Paris to the Germans. This defeat cemented Clemenceau's belief, and that of the other allies, that a coordinated, unified command was the best option. It was decided that [[Ferdinand Foch]] would be appointed as [[Generalissimo]].\n\nThe German line continued to advance, and Clemenceau believed that they could not rule out the fall of Paris. It was believed{{by whom|date=November 2017}} that if \"the tiger\" as well as Foch and [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] stayed in power, for even another week, France would be lost. It was thought{{by whom|date=November 2017}} that a government headed by [[Aristide Briand]] would be beneficial to France, because he would make peace with Germany on advantageous terms. Clemenceau adamantly opposed these opinions and he gave an inspirational speech in the Chamber of Deputies; the Chamber subsequently voted their confidence in him by 377 votes to 110.\n\n====1918: the Allied counter-offensive and the Armistice====\nAs the [[Hundred Days Offensive|Allied counter-offensives]] began to push the Germans back, it became clear that the Germans could no longer win the war. Although they still occupied vast amounts of French territory, they did not have sufficient resources and manpower to continue their attack. As countries allied to Germany began to ask for an armistice, it was obvious that Germany would soon follow. On 11 November 1918, an armistice with Germany was signed. Clemenceau was embraced in the streets and attracted admiring crowds. He was a strong, energetic, positive leader who was key to the allied victory of 1918.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Paris Peace Conference==\nTo settle the international political issues left over from the conclusion of World War I, it was decided that a peace conference would be held in Paris, France. Famously, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] between Germany and the Allied Powers to conclude the conflict was signed in the [[Palace of Versailles]], but the deliberations on which it was based were conducted in Paris, hence the name given to the meeting of the victorious heads of state that produced the treaties signed with the defeated powers: the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919. On 13 December 1918, United States president [[Woodrow Wilson]] received an enthusiastic welcome in France. His [[Fourteen Points]] and the concept of a [[League of Nations]] had made a big impact on the war-weary French. Clemenceau realized at their first meeting that he was a man of principle and conscience.\n\nIt was decided that since the conference was being held in France, Clemenceau would be the most appropriate president. He also spoke both English and French, the official languages of the conference.\n\nThe progress at the conference was much slower than anticipated, and decisions were constantly being tabled. It was this slow pace that induced Clemenceau to give an interview showing his irritation to an American journalist. He said he believed that Germany had won the war industrially and commercially as its factories were intact and its debts would soon be overcome through \"manipulation\". In a short time, he believed, the German economy would be much stronger than the French.\n\nFrance's diplomatic position at the Paris Peace Conference was repeatedly jeopardized by Clemenceau's mistrust of [[David Lloyd George]] and Woodrow Wilson, and his intense dislike of French President [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]]. When negotiations reached a stalemate, Clemenceau had a habit of shouting at the other heads of state and storming out of the room rather than participating in further discussion.\n\n===Attempted assassination===\nOn 19 February 1919, during the Paris Peace Conference, as Clemenceau was leaving his apartment in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Rue Benjamin-Franklin|fr}} to drive to a meeting with Woodrow Wilson's aide [[Edward M. House]] and British Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Balfour]] at the [[H\u00f4tel de Crillon]], a man jumped out and fired several shots at the car. One bullet hit Clemenceau between the ribs, just missing his vital organs. Too dangerous to remove, the bullet remained with him for the rest of his life. Clemenceau's assailant, anarchist [[\u00c9mile Cottin]], was seized by the crowd following the leader's procession and nearly lynched. Taken back to his house, Clemenceau's faithful assistant found him pale, but conscious. \"They shot me in the back,\" Clemenceau told him. \"They didn't even dare to attack me from the front.\"<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''Paris 1919: Six Months that Changed the World'', Random House: New York, (2003) 150</ref>\n\nClemenceau often joked about the \"assassin's\" bad marksmanship \u2013 \"We have just won the most terrible war in history, yet here is a Frenchman who misses his target 6 out of 7 times at point-blank range. Of course this fellow must be punished for the careless use of a dangerous weapon and for poor marksmanship. I suggest that he be locked up for eight years, with intensive training in a shooting gallery.\"\n\n===Rhineland and the Saar===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1110-502, Georges Clemenceau.jpg|thumb|Clemenceau in his office]]\nWhen Clemenceau returned to the Council of Ten on 1 March he found that little had changed. One issue that had not changed at all was a dispute over France's long-running eastern frontier and control of the German [[Rhineland]]. Clemenceau believed that Germany's possession of this territory left France without a natural frontier in the East and thus simplified invasion into France for an attacking army. The British ambassador reported in December 1918 on Clemenceau's views on the future of the Rhineland: \"He said that the Rhine was a natural boundary of Gaul and Germany and that it ought to be made the German boundary now, the territory between the Rhine and the French frontier being made into an Independent State whose neutrality should be guaranteed by the great powers\".<ref>Watson, p. 337.</ref>\n\nThe issue was finally resolved when Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson guaranteed immediate military assistance if Germany attacked without provocation.<ref>Watson, p. 347.</ref> It was also decided that the Allies would occupy the territory for fifteen years, and that Germany could never rearm the area.<ref>Watson, p. 350.</ref> Lloyd George insisted on a clause allowing for the early withdrawal of Allied troops if the Germans fulfilled the treaty; Clemenceau inserted Article 429 into the treaty that permitted the Allied occupation beyond the fifteen years if adequate guarantees for Allied security against unprovoked aggression were not met. This was in case the U.S. Senate refused to ratify the treaty of guarantee, thereby making null and void the British guarantee as well, since that was dependent on the Americans being part of it. This is, in fact, what did occur. Article 429 ensured that a refusal of the U.S. Senate to ratify the treaties of guarantee would not weaken them.<ref>Watson, p. 351.</ref>\n\nPresident Poincar\u00e9 and Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] both repeatedly pressed for an autonomous Rhineland state. At a Cabinet meeting on 25 April Foch spoke against the deal Clemenceau had brokered and pushed for a separate Rhineland. On 28 April Poincar\u00e9 sent Clemenceau a long letter detailing why he thought Allied occupation should continue until Germany had paid all her reparations. Clemenceau replied that the alliance with America and Britain was of more value than an isolated France which held onto the Rhineland: \"In fifteen years I will be dead, but if you do me the honour of visiting my tomb, you will be able to say that the Germans have not fulfilled all the clauses of the treaty, and that we are still on the Rhine\".<ref>Watson, pp. 351\u2013352.</ref> Clemenceau said to Lloyd George in June: \"We need a barrier behind which, in the years to come, our people can work in security to rebuild its ruins. The barrier is the Rhine. I must take national feelings into account. That does not mean that I am afraid of losing office. I am quite indifferent on that point. But I will not, by giving up the occupation, do something which will break the willpower of our people\".<ref>Watson, p. 352.</ref> He said later to Jean Martel: \"The policy of Foch and Poincar\u00e9 was bad in principle. It was a policy no Frenchman, no republican Frenchman could accept for a moment, except in the hope of obtaining other guarantees, other advantages. We leave that sort of thing to [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]\".<ref>Watson, p. 353.</ref>\n\nThere was increasing discontent among Clemenceau, Lloyd George and Woodrow Wilson about slow progress and information leaks surrounding the Council of Ten. They began to meet in a smaller group, called the Council of Four, [[Vittorio Orlando]] of Italy being the fourth, though less weighty, member. This offered greater privacy and security and increased the efficiency of the decision-making process. Another major issue that the Council of Four discussed was the future of the German [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar]] region. Clemenceau believed that France was entitled to the region and its coal mines after Germany deliberately damaged the coal mines in northern France. Wilson, however, resisted the French claim so firmly that Clemenceau accused him of being \"pro-German\". Lloyd George came to a compromise; the coal mines were given to France and the territory placed under French administration for 15 years, after which a vote would determine whether the region would rejoin Germany.<ref>Watson, pp. 349\u2013350.</ref>\n\nAlthough Clemenceau had little knowledge of the Austrian-Hungarian empire, he supported the causes of its smaller ethnic groups and his adamant stance lead to the stringent terms in the [[Treaty of Trianon]] that dismantled Hungary. Rather than recognizing territories of the Austrian-Hungarian empire solely within the principles of self-determination, Clemenceau sought to weaken Hungary, just as Germany was, and remove the threat of such a large power within Central Europe. The entire Czechoslovakian state was seen a potential buffer from Communism and this encompassed majority Hungarian territories.\n\n===Reparations===\nClemenceau was not experienced in the fields of economics or finance, and as [[John Maynard Keynes]] pointed out  \"he did not trouble his head to understand either the Indemnity or [France's] overwhelming financial difficulties\",<ref>Keynes, John, Maynard, The Economic Consequences of Peace, Cosimo, Inc., 2005, {{ISBN|9781596052222}}, p.150</ref> but he was under strong public and parliamentary pressure to make Germany's [[World War I reparations|reparations]] bill as large as possible. It was generally agreed that Germany should not pay more than it could afford, but the estimates of what it could afford varied greatly. Figures ranged between \u00a32,000&nbsp;million and \u00a320,000&nbsp;million. Clemenceau realised that any compromise would anger both the French and British citizens and that the only option was to establish a reparations commission which would examine Germany's capacity for reparations. This meant that the French government was not directly involved in the issue of reparations.\n\n===Defence of the Treaty===\nThe Treaty of Versailles was signed on 28 June 1919. Clemenceau now had to defend the treaty against critics who viewed the compromises Clemenceau had negotiated as inadequate for French national interests. The French Parliament debated the treaty and [[Louis Barthou]] on 24 September claimed that the U.S. Senate would not vote for the treaty of guarantee or the Treaty of Versailles and therefore it would have been wiser to have the Rhine as a frontier. Clemenceau replied that he was sure the Senate would ratify both and that he had inserted Article 429 into the treaty, providing for \"new arrangements concerning the Rhine\". This interpretation of Article 429 was disputed by Barthou.<ref>Watson, p. 360.</ref>\n\nClemenceau's main speech on the treaty was delivered on 25 September. He said that he knew the treaty was not perfect, but that the war had been fought by a coalition and therefore the treaty would express the lowest common denominator of those involved. He claimed criticisms of the details of the treaty were misleading; they should look at the treaty as a whole and see how they could benefit from it:\n\n<blockquote>The treaty, with all its complex clauses, will only be worth what you are worth; it will be what you make it...What you are going to vote to-day is not even a beginning, it is a beginning of a beginning. The ideas it contains will grow and bear fruit. You have won the power to impose them on a defeated Germany. We are told that she will revive. All the more reason not to show her that we fear her...M. Marin went to the heart of the question, when he turned to us and said in despairing tones, 'You have reduced us to a policy of vigilance.' Yes, M. Marin, do you think that one could make a treaty which would do away with the need for vigilance among the nations of Europe who only yesterday were pouring out their blood in battle? Life is a perpetual struggle in war, as in peace...That struggle cannot be avoided. Yes, we must have vigilance, we must have a great deal of vigilance. I cannot say for how many years, perhaps I should say for how many centuries, the crisis which has begun will continue. Yes, this treaty will bring us burdens, troubles, miseries, difficulties, and that will continue for long years.<ref>Watson, p. 361.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Chamber of Deputies ratified the treaty by 372 votes to 53, with the Senate voting unanimously for its ratification. On 11 October he gave his last parliamentary speech, to the Senate. He said that any attempt to partition Germany would be self-defeating and that France must find a way of living with sixty million Germans. He also said that the bourgeoisie, like the aristocracy before them in the ''ancien r\u00e9gime'', had failed as a ruling class. It was now the turn of the working class to rule.  He advocated national unity and a demographic revolution: \"The treaty does not state that France will have many children, but it is the first thing that should have been written there. For if France does not have large families, it will be in vain that you put all the finest clauses in the treaty, that you take away all the Germans guns, France will be lost because there will be no more French\".<ref>Watson, p. 362.</ref>\n\n==Domestic policies==\nClemenceau's final tenure as prime minister witnessed the implementation of various reforms aimed at regulating the hours of labour. A general 8-hour-day law passed in April 1919 amended the French Labour Code, and in June that year, existing legislation concerning the duration of the working day in the mining industry was amended by extending the eight-hour day to all classes of workpeople, \"whether employed underground or on the surface.\" Under a previous law of December 1913, the eight-hour limit had only applied to workpeople employed underground. In August 1919, a similar limit was introduced for all those employed in French vessels. Another law passed in 1919 (which came into operation in October 1920) prohibited employment in bakeries between the hours of 10 P.M. and 4 A.M. A decree of May 1919 introduced the 8-hour day for workers on trams, railways, and in inland waterways, and a second of June 1919 extended this provision to the State railways.<ref>The ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'': a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 31 by Hugh Chisholm</ref> In April 1919, an enabling Act was approved for an eight-hour day and a six-day week, although farmworkers were excluded from the Act.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/questfortimeredu0000cros|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/questfortimeredu0000cros/page/131 131]|quote=france The Eight-hour Act of April 23 1919.|title=A Quest for Time|publisher=University of California Press|accessdate=24 May 2016|isbn=9780520065321|last1=Cross|first1=Gary S.|last2=Cross|first2=Distinguished Professor of Modern History Gary|date=1 January 1989}}</ref>\n\n==Presidential bid==\n[[File:Clemenceau Beaux 1920.jpg|thumb|left|Georges Clemenceau by [[Cecilia Beaux]] (1920).]]\n\nIn 1919 France adopted a new electoral system and the [[1919 French legislative election|legislative election]] gave the [[National Bloc (France)|National Bloc]] (a coalition of right-wing parties) a majority. Clemenceau only intervened once in the election campaign, delivering a speech on 4 November at Strasbourg, praising the manifesto and men of the National Bloc and urging that the victory in the war needed to be safeguarded by vigilance. In private he was concerned at this huge swing to the right.<ref>Watson, p. 385.</ref>\n\nHis friend [[Georges Mandel]] urged Clemenceau to stand for the presidency in the upcoming election and on 15 January 1920 he let Mandel announce that he would be prepared to serve if elected. However Clemenceau did not intend to campaign for the post, instead he wished to be chosen by acclaim as a national symbol. The preliminary meeting of the republican caucus (a forerunner to the vote in the National Assembly) chose [[Paul Deschanel]] instead of Clemenceau by a vote of 408 to 389. In response, Clemenceau refused to be put forward for the vote in the National Assembly because he did not want to win by a small majority, but by a near-unanimous vote. Only then, he claimed, could he negotiate with confidence with the Allies.<ref>Watson, p. 386.</ref>\n\nIn his last speech to the Cabinet on 18 January he said, \"We must show the world the extent of our victory, and we must take up the mentality and habits of a victorious people, which once more takes its place at the head of Europe. But all that will now be placed in jeopardy...It will take less time and less thought to destroy the edifice so patiently and painfully erected than it took to complete it. Poor France. The mistakes have begun already\".<ref name=\"Watson387\">Watson, p. 387.</ref>\n\n==Last years==\nClemenceau resigned as prime minister as soon as the presidential election was held (17 January 1920) and took no further part in politics. In private, he condemned the unilateral occupation by French troops of the German city of [[Frankfurt]] in 1920 and said if he had been in power, he would have persuaded the British to join it.<ref name=\"Watson387\"/>\n\nHe took a holiday in Egypt and the Sudan from February to April 1920, then embarked for the Far East in September, returning to France in March 1921. In June, he visited England and received an honorary degree from the [[University of Oxford]]. He met Lloyd George and said to him that after the Armistice he had become the enemy of France. Lloyd George replied, \"Well, was not that always our traditional policy?\" He was joking, but after reflection, Clemenceau took it seriously. After Lloyd George's fall from power in 1922 Clemenceau remarked, \"As for France, it is a real enemy who disappears. Lloyd George did not hide it: at my last visit to London he cynically admitted it\".<ref>Watson, p. 388.</ref>\n\nIn late 1922, Clemenceau gave a lecture tour in the major cities of the American northeast. He defended the policy of France, including war debts and reparations, and condemned [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationism]]. He was well received and attracted large audiences, but America's policy remained unchanged. On 9 August 1926, he wrote an open letter to the American President [[Calvin Coolidge]] that argued against France paying all its war debts: \"France is not for sale, even to her friends\". This appeal went unheard.<ref>Watson, p. 389.</ref>\n\nHe condemned Poincar\u00e9's [[occupation of the Ruhr]] in 1923 as an undoing of the entente between France and Britain.<ref name=\"Watson387\"/>\n\nHe wrote two short biographies, one of the Greek orator [[Demosthenes]] and one of the French painter [[Claude Monet]]. He also penned a huge two-volume tome, covering philosophy, history and science, titled ''Au Soir de la Pens\u00e9e''. Writing this occupied most of his time between 1923 and 1927.<ref>Watson, pp. 390\u2013391.</ref>\n\nDuring his last months, he wrote his memoirs, despite declaring previously that he would not write them. He was spurred into doing so by the appearance of Marshal Foch's memoirs, which were highly critical of Clemenceau, mainly for his policy at the Paris Peace Conference. He only had time to finish the first draft and it was published posthumously as ''Grandeurs et Mis\u00e8res d'une Victoire'' (''The Grandeur and Misery of Victory''). He was critical of Foch and also of his successors who had allowed the Versailles Treaty to be undermined in the face of Germany's revival.  He burned all of his private letters.\n\nClemenceau died on 24 November 1929 and was buried at [[Mouchamps]].\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1919''': Member of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]].<ref>Index biographique des membres et associ\u00e9s de l'Acad\u00e9mie royale de Belgique (1769\u20132005). p 56</ref>\n\n==Clemenceau's First Ministry, 25 October 1906 \u2013 24 July 1909==\n*Georges Clemenceau \u2013 President of the Council and Minister of the Interior\n*[[St\u00e9phen Pichon]] \u2013 Minister of Foreign Affairs\n*[[Georges Picquart]] \u2013 Minister of War\n*[[Joseph Caillaux]] \u2013 Minister of Finance\n*[[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] \u2013 Minister of Labour and Social Security Provisions\n*[[Edmond Guyot-Dessaigne]] \u2013 Minister of Justice\n*[[Gaston Thomson]] \u2013 Minister of Marine\n*[[Aristide Briand]] \u2013 Minister of Public Instruction, Fine Arts, and Worship\n*[[Joseph Ruau]] \u2013 Minister of Agriculture\n*[[Rapha\u00ebl Milli\u00e8s-Lacroix]] \u2013 Minister of Colonies\n*[[Louis Barthou]] \u2013 Minister of Public Works, Posts, and Telegraphs\n*[[Gaston Doumergue]] \u2013 Minister of Commerce and Industry.\n\n'''Changes'''\n*4 January 1908 \u2013 [[Aristide Briand]] succeeds Guyot-Dessaigne as Minister of Justice.

During the [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps]] about 600 a settlement was founded, based on onomastic evidence ([[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''porecah'' = 'at the people who live by the brook'). In 1150 P\u00f6rtschach in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] was first attested in written sources. In those days a lake castle was set up, of which little else than some scant remains of a wall can be seen to this day. A parish church was first mentioned in 1328, initially a [[filial church]] of [[Maria W\u00f6rth]], the present-day building was erected in 1787 and restored in a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style in 1904/06.\n[[File:P\u00f6rtschach Pfarrkirche hl.

Famous tourists from Vienna included Emperor [[Franz Josef I of Austria]], [[Gustav Mahler]], and [[Johannes Brahms]], who worked on his [[Symphony No. 2 (Brahms)|Second Symphony]] and his [[Violin Concerto (Brahms)|Violin Concerto]] here. After the tourism boom years in Carinthia of the 1960s and 1970s, a revival in P\u00f6rtschach as an events centre is under way.
