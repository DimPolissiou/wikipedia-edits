With the opening up of Bhutan in the early 1960s, a formal postal system was introduced. The American entrepreneur Burt Todd assisted in establishing a postage stamp program in the country<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com/history.htm |title=Bhutan Stamps - History |publisher=Bhutanpostagestamps.com |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref> and Bhutan became known for the unusual designs and materials of its stamps which were chosen by Todd specifically to attract attention. With the assistance of the Indian postal advisor Dr. K. Ramamurti, who was in Bhutan from 1964 to 1968, a proper postal organization and infrastructure was set up under the leadership of a young Bhutanese officer Mr. Lam Penjor, who became the Director of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.<ref>P&T Department, Royal Government of Bhutan, ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', 'issued on the eve of inauguration of Thimphu GPO Building' (11 May 1969); see also the write-up 'a farewell dinner was given in honour of Dr. Ramamurti' in ''[[Kuensel]]'', vol. 2, no. 15, p 5.</ref>\n\n==History of mail delivery==\n\n===Mail before 1955===\nPrior to 1955 no systematic procedure appeared to have existed for the transmission of mail. In the absence of motorable roads, official mail was sent from one [[Dzong]] to another or to one of the royal palaces through special mail runners or casual travelers depending on the urgency. The ''Thrimpon'' (chief district court official) of each Dzong was responsible for the transmission of official mail.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff; K H Michel, a.k.a \"Kmilu\", based his information on an extensive exchange of letters he had with the P&T Department</ref>\n\n===''Dzong Dak'' system and the use of fiscals as postage===\n[[File:Bhutan Postal Runner.jpg|thumb|Bhutan Postal Runner as displayed in the Bhutan Postal Museum in Thimphu, Bhutan| left]]\nIn 1955 the Royal Government of Bhutan regularized the dispatch of mail from various government offices at intervals of five days, and placed it on a monetary footing because the system was being stretched thin through growing private use for personal mail. The [[postal fiscal stamp | fiscal revenue stamps]], which had been introduced the year before, had to be used as proof of pre-payment for the services, except that mail <i>that pertained</i> to the King, was permitted to be carried without these stamps affixed.  This mail runner system is colloquially referred to as the \"unstoppable wheel\" and philatelically as the ''Dzong Dak'' system (''dak'' means 'post' or 'mail' in Hindi).<ref>cf. Allied Chambers [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kWROaer5UsC&pg=PA162 Transliterated Hindi-Hindi-English Dictionary], p.161, ''[[Allied Publishers]]'', New Delhi/Mumbai 1993:</ref> The system existed mostly for Bhutan domestic purposes (including mail to Bhutanese [[list of enclaves and exclaves | exclaves]] near [[Mount Kailash]] (Tibet), to [[Bhutan House]] at Kalimpong, India as well as to the Bhutan Trade Agent at Lhasa). To foreign destinations, mail matter prepaid in Bhutan with fiscal stamps was carried by Dzong runners, at first (until 1958) to the Indian post office in [[Yatung]], Tibet and later to the Chinese post office (which succeeded the Indian post office there, which closed). Additional postage of the country operating the post office was affixed for onward carriage.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff</ref> Most of the known covers sent via this route were destined for the Bhutanese representation in [[Kalimpong]], India, known as ''[[Bhutan House]]''. However, covers to private people and people c/o the post office in Kalimpong are known, as are covers to more far flung locations in India, Nepal, the UK and the USA. A few covers without additional stamps of other countries are known to have made it to their destinations in the USA.  Generally, on items going abroad, the fiscal stamps appear affixed at the upper left of the dual franked covers, with space left at the upper right where eventually the Indian or Chinese stamps purchased at Yatung were placed, resulting in [[mixed franking]]. Some covers have the added postage on the backsides. <ref>G.J. Raymond, 'Bhutan New Postal Services Poses Several Questions', reprinted in ''The Great Wall'' (Quarterly of the China Stamp Collectors Club of Australasia), vol IV, no.1, October 1959</ref> Although disputed, the Finnish philatelist Iiro Kakko opines that the majority of the known covers sent to Kalimpong appear not to be genuine letters routed through the postal system, but especially produced for the philatelic market.<ref>Tshering Tashi, 'When revenue stamps served for postage', Kuensel Online 20 March 2011 (former link 'http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=18776'), also reprinted in Phila Mirror 15 April 2011 http://philamirror.info/2011/04/15/when-revenue-stamps-served-for-postage/ ; see also: Iiro Kakko, 'Bhutan - Dzong Dak Covers', in: Postal Himal no.85, 1st Quarter 1996, p. 17: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1996_002.pdf</ref>\n\n===Start of the modern era===\nWith the start of development programs in Bhutan and the end of its self-imposed isolation in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was a sizeable increase of correspondence in English and the number of mail items, now also including Indian newspapers and periodicals for the staff managing schools and development projects. The Dzong mail service was not able to cope with the significant increase of mail items and its staff could in general not read English. In the first [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|Five Year Plan]] launched in 1961 the set-up of a postal service was among the proposed development activities. A Posts & Telegraphs Department was established under the Ministry of Communications and the first regular post office was opened in the border town of [[Phuentsholing]] on 10 October 1962, when also the first postage stamps were issued.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan, chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> The decision of the Kingdom to issue postage stamps has been described also as its first assertion of its international personality<ref>Thierry Mathou, 'The Growth of Diplomacy in Bhutan 1961-1991: Opportunities and Challenges', p.80, in: Michael Aris & Michael Hutt (eds), 'Bhutan: Aspects of Culture and Development', 1994, Paul Strachan-Kiskadale Ltd., Gartsmore, Stirlingshire, Scotland; http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/rarebooks/downloads/Aris&Hutt_Bhutan.pdf</ref>\n\n==Postage stamps and modern postal history==\n\n===1962\u201374: Burt Todd and the Bhutan Stamp Agency===\nA postal system was created with the gradual opening of more post offices and postal agencies. Gradually the postal runners who were plying the off-road routes, would come under the control of the Posts & Telegraphs Department, and no longer be part of the Dzong administration.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan (1966-1971), chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> Foreign mail was routed through India by a bilateral agreement, as only in 1969 did Bhutan became a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The postage stamps were initially designed and printed under an arrangement with Burt Kerr Todd, who also handled their sale to the international market. Burt Todd (1924\u20132006), an American businessman from Pittsburgh, was instrumental in the start of Bhutan's stamp issuing program. He learned of Bhutan while studying at Oxford University, visited the country in 1951, and became an adviser to the Bhutan government and royal family. He has been credited with being the first American to visit Bhutan although that claim cannot be proven for certain. The Bhutan stamp program was set up specifically to raise money for the improvement of Bhutan's infrastructure after the country was refused a loan from the World Bank. Todd set up the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' in Nassau, Bahamas. He had little grasp of how stamps were marketed through the philatelic trade and therefore relied on unusual designs such as 3D printing to attract publicity.<ref>Margalit Fox.

He produced the world's first 3D stamps using [[lenticular printing]], relief and sculptural stamps, as well as stamps printed on silk or even steel foil, a set of scented rose stamps, and the famous ''Talking Stamps'', miniature records which could be played on a normal record player.<ref>Charles Snee, \"From 3-D to CD: innovative firsts found among Bhutanese stamps\", in: Scott Stamp Monthly, June 2009, pp-15 & p.32</ref>\n\nThe focus of Burt Todd on the international market left the P&T Department with too few lower-value stamps for the local mail. On advice of the Indian postal advisor to Bhutan, Dr. K. Ramamurti, P&T issued a series of surcharged stamps released in 1965, which were overprinted at the [[India Security Press]] in Nashik. The same printer was used by P&T next year 1966 for the first regular, low value, non-agency definitives with the local theme of Bhutanese dzongs. Another complaint by P&T was that often the Bhutan Stamp Agency designed and printed postage stamps without any or enough discussion or approval.<ref>Len A. Nadybal, Bhutan Stamp Agency Problems Revealed, in: Postal Himal no.72, 4th Quarter 1992, pp 64-65: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1992_004.pdf</ref> After the death in 1972 of the 3rd [[Druk Gyalpo]], His Majesty [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]], a good friend of Todd, one of the changes which took place was the cancellation of the contract of the Bhutan Stamp Agency end March 1974.<ref>Nildo Harper, Bhutan - A (continued) Brief Postal History, in: Postal Himal no.52, 4th Quarter 1987, p44: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1987_004.pdf</ref><ref>Brian Kuehl,'The Demise of the Bhutan Stamp Agency', in: 'The Kaleidoscope' (Bimonthly Publication of the Bhutan Philatelic Society) vol.1, no.2, July\u2013August 1976, pp 2-4</ref>\n\nIn recent years, Bhutanese stamps have tended to be more conventional with just the occasional unusual format. Miniature sheets and highly [[Topical stamp collecting|topical subjects]] remain the staple of the program.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===1974\u201396: Department of Posts & Telegraphs and the IGPC===\n[[File:Bhutan GPO Thimphu Jan 2013.JPG|thumb|left|General Post Office in the Bhutanese capital Thimphu]]\nWith the departure of Todd, the Department of Posts & Telegraphs appointed the [[Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation]] (IGPC), based in New York, as its sole, worldwide agent that permitted IGPC to design and print stamps against a royalty. During the IGPC time, at least two issues would bear the legacy of Burt Todd: the gold coins of 1975 and the 3D traditional masks series of 1976. Otherwise their issues would show the typical IGPC staple of thematic and commemorative sets and souvenir sheets, in general hardly related to the country of issue and with the use of high face-value stamps with no local postal usage.<ref>Vijay Bhusban, 'Bhutan - Strengthening Philatelic Activities', Project RAS/86/112, UPU Berne 1989</ref> Furthermore, the sales income from IGPC decreased dramatically since mid 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">G.N. Zahid Malik,'Report of the Bhutan Evaluation Mission 4\u201318 August 1988', UPU, International Bureau, Berne 1988</ref>\n\nTherefore, in 1992 the P&T Department introduced a system of philatelic agents for worldwide marketing and sales. The P&T started to issue topical and commemorative stamp series independently. International agents or organizations can make proposals to issue postage stamps, which upon agreement may be issued against a royalty. IGPC would be one of them and keep a contract for the production of postal stamps until at least the year 2004.<ref>Royal Audit Authority, Annual Audit Report 2004, section V, point D</ref>\n\nOne particular initiative of the P&T Department after the introduction of this new policy was the release in May 1993 of the ''Famous Paintings - Reading & Writing'' issue, originally designed and printed by the Bhutan Stamp Agency to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the UPU (1874\u20131974) and prepared by the agency to be issued in late 1974. However, the termination of their contract intervened, while the stamps had been already shipped to Bhutan. Since their arrival in the country, the stamps were kept in customs storage and reportedly forgotten by the P&T Department until the early 1990s.<ref>Len Nadybal, Reading and Writing Issue: http://www.bhutanstamps.info/delayed-reading--writing-issue---1974-to-1993.html</ref>\n\nOn 14 February 1982 Bhutan joined the [[Asian-Pacific Postal Union]] (APPU).<ref>APPU Bureau website, Address and contact person of member postal organizations - Bhutan http://www.appu-bureau.org/Contact%20persons.htm#Bhutan_</ref> With the introduction of [[Druk Air]] services between Bhutan, India and Thailand in 1991, mail no longer needed to be routed only overland via Phuentsholing to India, but could also directly be exchanged with the postal exchange offices of New Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok.\n\n===1996\u2013present: Bhutan Postal Corporation===\nIn the 7th Five Year Plan (1992\u201397) privatization of businesses directly ran by the government was one of the major objectives. Some, however would, because of strategic or practical reasons,  remain under government control. These enterprises would, however, be provided with a management structure and operating framework that encourages efficiency whilst ensuring that they operate in the national interest. As a result, the postal and telegraph activities of the P & T Department were incorporated in an autonomous corporation, the Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd., with its trade name ''Bhutan Post'', as of 1 October 1996.\n\n==Postage stamps review==\n\n===Stamp subjects===\nFrom the start onwards, the issue of postage stamps balanced between two goals, to introduce Bhutan to the world community and to provide revenue, in particular foreign exchange. We will find this reflected in the faces on the stamps: at one side Bhutanese themes and at the other side typical international thematic and commemorative subjects appealing to the philatelic market. The first stamp manager, Burt Todd, added to the latter goal with great success, and often as world\u2019s first,  special materials (steel foil, silk, gold color metal foil, molded plastic), special shapes (round, triangular), special printing (3D) and special effects (perfumed ink, real playable gramophone recordings)<ref> \"Little Ambassadors of the Country\", by Peter Bil'ak https://worksthatwork.com/8/history-of-bhutan-postage-stamps</ref>. Was during Todd\u2019s period the balance between Bhutanese and general themed stamp subjects still quite even, this would change during the IGPC period drastically in favor of world thematic and commemorative themes.\n\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan Punakha Dzong bridge 2009 FDC.jpg|thumb|Stamp issued in 2009 on the occasion of the new Punakha Dzong bridge]]\nBhutanese themes on postage stamps are the nation's royalty, [[Dzong architecture]], Buddhist heritage, the Bhutanese mail service (the postal runner in particular), traditional crafts, antiques, Bhutanese scenes, hydro- power, and the nation\u2019s wildlife and sport. Bhutanese themed sport stamps have been issued on the occasion of the Olympics and soccer World Cups. A sample of the theme on Bhutanese architecture is the [[Expo 2000]] issue depicting 6 different dzongs in Bhutan, [[Trashigang]], [[Lhuentse]], [[Gasa, Bhutan|Gasa]], [[Punakha]], [[Tashichhodzong]] and [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Stamps of the World|publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]]|year=2004|page=371}}</ref>\n\nEmbossed gold foil coin stamps showing different Kings of Bhutan were issued in 1966 and 1968 and, square-shaped, in 1975.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scott Catalogue of Postage Stamps|publisher=[[Scott catalogue|Scott Publishing Company]]|year=2009|pages=920,921&924}}</ref> Perfume-infused rose stamps were issued in 1973.

The sheet carries the text ''Coronation and Centenary Celebrations 2008''. The total face value is Nu. 120, three rows of four stamps each, respectively with the face value of Nu. 5, Nu. 10 and Nu 15. Each stamp is framed, which provides a blank space for the printing of a personalized picture, drawing or logo. Bhutan Post used these 2008 Coronation and Centenary Celebrations personalized stamp sheets to issue 3 different sheets with pictures of the 4th and 5th (present) King and a stylized illustration of the Raven Crown. These stamps are listed in the Michel catalogue under nos. 2517 - 2528.\nAs personalized stamps were apparently a big success, the issue was followed by further personalized stamp issues, the first two with the same values totaling Nu.120, but different designs. The second sheetlet issued in 2009 carries the text ''Greetings from the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan'', while the third issue of early 2011 states ''From the Land of the Thunder Dragon''.\nOn the occasion of the Royal Wedding in October 2011 a set of two personalized stamp sheetlets were issued, both with exactly the same design and stamp values, but for one the main color is orange, while for the second this is dark blue. The sheetlet bears the text ''Celebrating Royal Wedding 2011'', while there is a picture of the newlywed couple as well. The face value of each of the four stamps in the three rows are from top to bottom, Nu.10, Nu.15 and Nu.20, so a total value of Nu.180.

Furthermore, that year a set of 10 postcards was released, each postcard showing on the front a drawing of a different dzong or lhakhang, each in a different, single color, drawn in a light, modern style. The set was stapled together with a single metal staple and an off-white paper cover on top with the words \"Dzong Series\", \"10 Post Cards\" and \"His Majesty\u2019s Govt. of Bhutan\" printed on it in capital letters. These postcards are in principle an overprint on the single postal card, carrying the same imprint of a purple, crossed dorjis 10 Chhetrum stamp.\n\nThese picture cards were the first true picture cards of Bhutan, in the sense that the front side was completely used for the drawing, leaving the left side of the divided back open for a message and the right side with the imprinted stamp and address lines, as we are used to in a typical standard picture card lay-out. This would be the last postcard with pre-printed postage for 21 years until 2008 when the \"color-your-own-stamp\" set of postcards with a 20 Ngultrum imprinted stamp was published.\n\n====The ''Free Post'' picture cards of February 2008====\nAt the occasion of the 28th birthday of the Fifth King, the Bhutanese newspaper [[Kuensel]] published as a supplement in their paper on 20 February 2008 a set of 7 carton pages with each 4 post cards on them, so 28 different postcards in all, which in partnership with Bhutan Post could be posted for free the next three days (21, 22 and 23 February 2008) to destinations within Bhutan. The postcards had to be cut out of the pages. The pictures show the 5th King in different poses and occasions, and each one was sponsored by a ministry, a para-statal or a private company. All are in color, except for the one sponsored by Bhutan Post, which is in black and white.\n\n====The ''Color-Your-Own'' picture postal cards of June 2008<ref>Leo van der Velden, The Color-Your-Own Picture Postal Cards of June 2008 of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #158, 2nd Quarter 2014, pp 11-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_002.pdf </ref>====\n[[File:Bhutan postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot]]\nOn the occasion of the participation of Bhutan to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival (25 June - 6 July 2008) in Washington DC,<ref>News release Smithsonian of 28 May 2008 on the Smithsonian Folklife Festival http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-folklife-festival-features-hands-activities-families-and-children</ref> Bhutan Post issued a set of four postcards with imprinted \"Color Your Own\" postage stamps in partnership with Frances Todd Stewart, daughter of the legendary Burt Todd, and Stewart's Creative Products International, creator of the Color-Your-Own program, as distributor.<ref>Press information on the website of Creative Products International on the 2008  Smithsonian Folklife Festival and the Color Your Own postcard http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com/prm_color_your_own.htm</ref> There are four different postcards with each a different picture and imprinted post stamp, all under the theme \"From gratitude springs happiness\".  Each postcard consists of the actual picture card with an attached small strip, which can be torn off at the perforated line.<ref>the size of the card is 100 x 180 mm with strip, and has the modern picture postcard size of 100 x 150 mm without</ref> The back side is divided, with the message part also divided into two. The idea was that American children would color the stamps (20 Nu each \u2013 the Bhutanese postal rate for international postcards), which are drawings of four 'Lucky Signs' in black and white, and put a few words on gratitude (\"What are we grateful for\") on the upper part of the message area for a school child in Bhutan, but address the postcard to themselves. They had then to stick a US stamp on that small strip which has the pre-printed address of the Philatelic Bureau, Bhutan Postal Corp., GPO Building, Thimphu, Bhutan. Alternatively, the postcards could be left with the Bhutan Post stand at the festival, which staff would then take them back to Bhutan. Bhutan Post would there divide these postcards to schools, where school kids would add their few words on gratitude on the lower message area and then the post card would be sent back to the addressee in the States or elsewhere. The strip with the address of the Philatelic Bureau would be torn off by the personnel of Bhutan Post, which was also organizing the whole process.\n\n===Aerogrammes===\nThe P&T Department issued three aerogrammes over the years. Around 1970 the first one was issued with an imprinted stamp of 85 Chetrum, picturing a dancing demon, and in 1979 a second aerogramme was issued, with the same design but the imprinted stamp had a new face value of Nu 1.25. The third and final aerogramme was issued around 1989 with a different lay-out and the imprinted stamp of Nu. 3.50 depicts birds and flowers.<ref>cf. Len Nadybal, 2005, ''Catalog of Bhutan Postal Stationery'',  http://www.japhila.cz/hof/0070/BPS_Catalog.htm</ref> The 1970 aerogramme has been available in later years surcharged to Nu. 1.50  with a ''postage pre-paid'' seal. The Nu. 3.50 aerogramme is still on sale at GPO Thimphu, but has to be uprated to the current airmail rate by adding the necessary postage stamps.\n\n===Inland letter sheets===\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan 1998 inland lettersheet.jpg|thumb|1998 Inland [[letter sheet]]]]\nBhutan Post issued the country\u2019s first inland [[letter sheet]]s in December 1998.

The imprinted stamp is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the April 1998 WHO stamp set issued on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO). Another inland letter has been published around the same time. It carries an imprinted Nu.3 stamp of a postal runner approaching a village, and is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the October 1992 set issued on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Bhutan Post postal service. All remaining issues of the inland letters are based on this issue. One issue was released with the overprint ''FREE POST CAMPAIGN, 11 \u2013 17 December 1998'' in the middle at the top of the front.  The last inland sheet issue was a set of two, released early June 1999 on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck with the over print ''SILVER JUBILEE, FREE POST CAMPAIGN,  2 \u2013 12th June \u201899'' in the upper middle of the front of the inland letter.

The envelope furthermore is stamped with a black, round rubber seal with the words 'FREE POST DAY 13-15 OCTOBER 2011' in an outer ring, while in the inner circle the words \"IN COMMEMORATION OF THE ROYAL WEDDING\" are printed below a modified version of the official Royal Wedding symbol <ref>Royal Wedding News 15 September 2011 Bhutan+Partners http://www.barnism.com/bhutan/2011/09/koninklijke-symbolen-bhutan/</ref> of two rings entwined in front of a [[khorlo]] ([[dharma]] wheel), and a scarf running through the rings (but without the lotus seat (padmasana), while the khorlo is less elaborate than in the official full version).\n\n==Postal covers and other postal items==\n\n===First Day Covers<ref>Iiro Kakko & Leo van der Velden, The complex start of First Day Covers in Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #162, 2nd Quarter 2015, pp 9-12, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2015_002.pdf</ref>===\n[[First day of issue]] covers or First Day Covers (FDCs) have been issued starting with the first postage stamp issue of 10 October 1962. In the Burt Todd's Bhutan Stamp Agency (BSA) period, both the BSA as well as the P&T Department issued FDCs, often for the same stamp issue. In recent years, Bhutan Post has missed several times to produce an FDC for a particular stamp issue, although sometimes private First Day of Issue covers are known to have filled the void, for instance on the occasion of the Punakha Dzong Cantilever Bridge stamp issue of 20 March 2009.\n\n===Event covers===\nAn [[event cover]] was issued on 20 October 1967 on the occasion of the postal exhibition held at the [[Tashichho Dzong]] in Thimphu.\n\n===Maxi cards===\n[[Maximum card]]s have been issued for the first time in Bhutan in July 1968, and later issues have been especially in partnership with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).\n\n===Picture postcards issued by the P&T Dept. and Bhutan Post<ref>Leo van der Velden, Introduction to the First Listing of Picture Postcards of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #159, 3rd Quarter 2014, pp10-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_003.pdf</ref>===\n[[File:1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang]]\nThe P&T Department issued also picture postcards without any imprinted stamps, starting in 1968 with a set of 9 multi-colored postcards which had a modern standard format (100 x 150mm) and were printed on art board paper by the ''Reliable Calendar Company'' of Calcutta (nowadays spelled as Kolkata).<ref>'Release of Colour Scenic View Cards', in: ''Kuensel'', 1968, vol.2, no.15, p.5</ref> The pictures show dzongs, lhakhangs, a folk dance, a yak, a mother and child, in general topics which will return again and again on Bhutanese postcards, emphasizing \u2018exotic or typical Bhutan\u2019. In the mid 1970s P&T published the set \"Views/Dances of Bhutan\" in four carton-board covers colored respectively blue, brown, orange and yellow, with some 8 post cards in each cover. The postcards were true color glossy chrome pictures in the old, smaller format (90 x 140mm). Three sets were printed by well-known security printers,'' the House of Questa'' (blue and orange covers) and ''Format International Security Printers Ltd'' (brown cover), while the fourth yellow set was printed by the Reliable Calendar Company, which printed in the past the more modern 1968 set. A set of 63 supersized (120 x 180&nbsp;mm) color postcards was issued around 1992 showing among others dzongs, lhakhangs, valleys, landscape views, dances, people, and, last but not least, the newly opened (in 1988) GPO in Thimphu. Although this set is published by P&T, there is no reference on the postcards to this, but only to the printers: in small letters and light ink it states at the left corner of the back side ''D&F Co. Ltd. Tel (662)3742974 Thailand''. This was followed around 1993 by the Environmental Trust Fund set, 17 different postcards in full color in a carton cover, showing landscapes, local flowers, animals and the Rinpung Dzong in Paro, printed by ''Secura Ltd'' of Singapore. After the incorporation in 1996 of Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd, using \u2018Bhutan Post\u2019 as trade name, a steady number of sets of postcards have been issued, although at that time the private market had taken already a firm footing as well. Some of these postcards of Bhutan Post are still available from their \u2018\u2019Philatelic eShop\u2019\u2019.<ref>Philatelic eShop on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/philatelic/index.php?option=com_virtuemart</ref> The latest issue of 2010 is a set of 17 different picture post cards, all of the 5th King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck in beautiful metallic-like colors.\n\n===Telegrams with postage stamps===\nIn the 1960s the P&T Department also used to attach postage stamps to telegrams as token of payment of the telegraph costs.\n\n==Post offices and postal marks==\n[[File:PO Wamrong July 2008 460.jpg|thumb|Postmistress in front of Wamrong Post Office in east Bhutan]]\nAfter the opening of the first post office in Phuentsholing on 10 October 1962, the second post office opened less than a month later in Paro (with post mark ''Rinpung Dzong''). It would take a little over a half year for Thimphu PO to open as third, with ''Tashichho Dzong'' as post mark. In the following years, aside from POs staffed by P&T Department staff members, also smaller ''extra-departmental''  post offices would be opened, mostly in remote locations, ran by postal agents, who were working on an agreement basis against a modest monthly stipend. These were first called BPO, branch post office, then APO, agency post office, and since a few years CMO, community mail office. Budgeted in the Bhutan Five Year Plans, the number would steadily increase, from 3 POs in 1964 to 28 POs and 5 extra-departmental POs in 1971, via 45 POs and 27 BPOs in 1978, to a high 56 POs and 27 BPOs in 1988,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> after which we see a decrease in the full-fledged POs to 47 in 2006, but with an increase of the APOs to 43.<ref>Bhutanese newspaper ''[[Kuensel]]'' 1 July 2006 'Rural postal services must be  improved'</ref> The latest figure for 2010 is 43 POs (including the two GPOs in Phuentsholing and Thimphu) and 33 CMOs.\n\nFor mail sent in the early 1960s, postmarks of the Indian post offices handling the international mail to and from Bhutan can be found on covers mailed during that period, while postmarks of Indian post offices assisting Bhutan P&T with domestic mail routed via road or train in India were also attached to covers handled through that system. <ref> Leo van der Velden and Aranya Dutta Choudhury, 'Note on the use of Indian post offices in WestBengal and Assam in the 1960s as part of the Bhutan postal services', pp 4-5  in Postal Himal, No. 173, 1st Quarter 2018</ref>\n\n==Collecting Bhutanese stamps==\nThe Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd. has a Philatelic Bureau to offer services to stamp collectors, who can open up a subscription to receive future issues or buy some of the older issues which are still for sale.<ref>info Philatelic Services on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/index.php?id=61</ref> A group of collectors organized themselves as ''The Bhutan Philatelic Society'' in the USA in 1976 and publicized a quarterly ''The Kaleidoscope'' for a few years.

However, information on stamp issues can be found in the [[Scott catalogue | Scott]], [[Stanley Gibbons catalogue | Stanley Gibbons]] and [[Michel catalog | Michel]] stamp catalogues.\n\nThe P&T Department of the Royal Government of Bhutan has issued a few publications with information on the history of the postal services.  Early May 1969 on the occasion of the inauguration of the first Thimphu GPO building on 11 May 1969, the Department issued a booklet ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', providing an overview of the gradual expansion of the postal services in Bhutan since 1962. In 1970 a nice 90-page booklet ''Bhutan Through Postage Stamps'' was produced, with detailed information about all stamps issued between 1962 and end 1969.<ref> see Bhutan Stamp Collectors page of 1 May 2018 ff. on Facebook </ref> Early 1976 the Philatelic Bureau of the Department published a small brochure ''Bhutan Stamp History'' with a complete listing of all stamps issued from the first postage stamps of 10 October 1962 to December 1975. No other significant publication has been issued by the P&T Department or Bhutan Post since then. The intention to publish a book on the postal history of Bhutan at the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of postal services in Bhutan (1962 - 2012) had to be abandoned by Bhutan Post, reportedly because of lack of funds.\n\nMost stamps issued during the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' era came with an informative and often beautifully designed presentation folder, brochure and/or flyer.  After 1974 only flyers and sometimes brochures were issued and for the last 15 years only intermittently. In a few cases the international agent instigating the issue of a particular set of stamps issued a presentation folder and brochure, for instance the CD-ROM stamps of 2007 <ref>issued in partnership with Creative Products International, a company headed by Frances Todd Stewart, the daughter of the legendary Burt Todd. See their website http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com</ref> and the [[World Food Programme]] set of 2009.\n\n==Bhutan Postal Museum==\nOn 7 November 2015 the [[Bhutan Postal Museum]] was opened at the General Post Office building in Thimphu<ref> Bhutan Broadcasting Service 7 Nov. 2015 http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=54259 </ref>.

With the opening up of Bhutan in the early 1960s, a formal postal system was introduced. The American entrepreneur Burt Todd assisted in establishing a postage stamp program in the country<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com/history.htm |title=Bhutan Stamps - History |publisher=Bhutanpostagestamps.com |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref> and Bhutan became known for the unusual designs and materials of its stamps which were chosen by Todd specifically to attract attention. With the assistance of the Indian postal advisor Dr. K. Ramamurti, who was in Bhutan from 1964 to 1968, a proper postal organization and infrastructure was set up under the leadership of a young Bhutanese officer Mr. Lam Penjor, who became the Director of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.<ref>P&T Department, Royal Government of Bhutan, ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', 'issued on the eve of inauguration of Thimphu GPO Building' (11 May 1969); see also the write-up 'a farewell dinner was given in honour of Dr. Ramamurti' in ''[[Kuensel]]'', vol. 2, no. 15, p 5.</ref>\n\n==History of mail delivery==\n\n===Mail before 1955===\nPrior to 1955 no systematic procedure appeared to have existed for the transmission of mail. In the absence of motorable roads, official mail was sent from one [[Dzong]] to another or to one of the royal palaces through special mail runners or casual travelers depending on the urgency. The ''Thrimpon'' (chief district court official) of each Dzong was responsible for the transmission of official mail.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff; K H Michel, a.k.a \"Kmilu\", based his information on an extensive exchange of letters he had with the P&T Department</ref>\n\n===''Dzong Dak'' system and the use of fiscals as postage===\n[[File:Bhutan Postal Runner.jpg|thumb|Bhutan Postal Runner as displayed in the Bhutan Postal Museum in Thimphu, Bhutan| left]]\nIn 1955 the Royal Government of Bhutan regularized the dispatch of mail from various government offices at intervals of five days, and placed it on a monetary footing because the system was being stretched thin through growing private use for personal mail. The [[postal fiscal stamp | fiscal revenue stamps]], which had been introduced the year before, had to be used as proof of pre-payment for the services, except that mail <i>that pertained</i> to the King, was permitted to be carried without these stamps affixed.  This mail runner system is colloquially referred to as the \"unstoppable wheel\" and philatelically as the ''Dzong Dak'' system (''dak'' means 'post' or 'mail' in Hindi).<ref>cf. Allied Chambers [https://books.google.com/books?id=_kWROaer5UsC&pg=PA162 Transliterated Hindi-Hindi-English Dictionary], p.161, ''[[Allied Publishers]]'', New Delhi/Mumbai 1993:</ref> The system existed mostly for Bhutan domestic purposes (including mail to Bhutanese [[list of enclaves and exclaves | exclaves]] near [[Mount Kailash]] (Tibet), to [[Bhutan House]] at Kalimpong, India as well as to the Bhutan Trade Agent at Lhasa). To foreign destinations, mail matter prepaid in Bhutan with fiscal stamps was carried by Dzong runners, at first (until 1958) to the Indian post office in [[Yatung]], Tibet and later to the Chinese post office (which succeeded the Indian post office there, which closed). Additional postage of the country operating the post office was affixed for onward carriage.<ref>Karl Heinz Michel, Bhutan's Postal System, in: Scott's Monthly Stamp Journal, June 1967 pp 111ff</ref> Most of the known covers sent via this route were destined for the Bhutanese representation in [[Kalimpong]], India, known as ''[[Bhutan House]]''. However, covers to private people and people c/o the post office in Kalimpong are known, as are covers to more far flung locations in India, Nepal, the UK and the USA. A few covers without additional stamps of other countries are known to have made it to their destinations in the USA.  Generally, on items going abroad, the fiscal stamps appear affixed at the upper left of the dual franked covers, with space left at the upper right where eventually the Indian or Chinese stamps purchased at Yatung were placed, resulting in [[mixed franking]]. Some covers have the added postage on the backsides. <ref>G.J. Raymond, 'Bhutan New Postal Services Poses Several Questions', reprinted in ''The Great Wall'' (Quarterly of the China Stamp Collectors Club of Australasia), vol IV, no.1, October 1959</ref> Although disputed, the Finnish philatelist Iiro Kakko opines that the majority of the known covers sent to Kalimpong appear not to be genuine letters routed through the postal system, but especially produced for the philatelic market.<ref>Tshering Tashi, 'When revenue stamps served for postage', Kuensel Online 20 March 2011 (former link 'http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=18776'), also reprinted in Phila Mirror 15 April 2011 http://philamirror.info/2011/04/15/when-revenue-stamps-served-for-postage/ ; see also: Iiro Kakko, 'Bhutan - Dzong Dak Covers', in: Postal Himal no.85, 1st Quarter 1996, p. 17: http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_1996_002.pdf</ref>\n\n===Start of the modern era===\nWith the start of development programs in Bhutan and the end of its self-imposed isolation in the late 1950s and early 1960s, there was a sizeable increase of correspondence in English and the number of mail items, now also including Indian newspapers and periodicals for the staff managing schools and development projects. The Dzong mail service was not able to cope with the significant increase of mail items and its staff could in general not read English. In the first [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|Five Year Plan]] launched in 1961 the set-up of a postal service was among the proposed development activities. A Posts & Telegraphs Department was established under the Ministry of Communications and the first regular post office was opened in the border town of [[Phuentsholing]] on 10 October 1962, when also the first postage stamps were issued.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan, chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> The decision of the Kingdom to issue postage stamps has been described also as its first assertion of its international personality<ref>Thierry Mathou, 'The Growth of Diplomacy in Bhutan 1961-1991: Opportunities and Challenges', p.80, in: Michael Aris & Michael Hutt (eds), 'Bhutan: Aspects of Culture and Development', 1994, Paul Strachan-Kiskadale Ltd., Gartsmore, Stirlingshire, Scotland; http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/rarebooks/downloads/Aris&Hutt_Bhutan.pdf</ref>\n\n==Postage stamps and modern postal history==\n\n===1962\u201374: Burt Todd and the Bhutan Stamp Agency===\nA postal system was created with the gradual opening of more post offices and postal agencies. Gradually the postal runners who were plying the off-road routes, would come under the control of the Posts & Telegraphs Department, and no longer be part of the Dzong administration.<ref>Royal Government of Bhutan, 2nd Five Year Plan (1966-1971), chapter VIII: Postal Department</ref> Foreign mail was routed through India by a bilateral agreement, as only in 1969 did Bhutan became a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The postage stamps were initially designed and printed under an arrangement with Burt Kerr Todd, who also handled their sale to the international market. Burt Todd (1924\u20132006), an American businessman from Pittsburgh, was instrumental in the start of Bhutan's stamp issuing program. He learned of Bhutan while studying at Oxford University, visited the country in 1951, and became an adviser to the Bhutan government and royal family. He has been credited with being the first American to visit Bhutan although that claim cannot be proven for certain. The Bhutan stamp program was set up specifically to raise money for the improvement of Bhutan's infrastructure after the country was refused a loan from the World Bank. Todd set up the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' in Nassau, Bahamas. He had little grasp of how stamps were marketed through the philatelic trade and therefore relied on unusual designs such as 3D printing to attract publicity.<ref>Margalit Fox.

He produced the world's first 3D stamps using [[lenticular printing]], relief and sculptural stamps, as well as stamps printed on silk or even steel foil, a set of scented rose stamps, and the famous ''Talking Stamps'', miniature records which could be played on a normal record player.<ref>Charles Snee, \"From 3-D to CD: innovative firsts found among Bhutanese stamps\", in: Scott Stamp Monthly, June 2009, pp-15 & p.32</ref>\n\nThe focus of Burt Todd on the international market left the P&T Department with too few lower-value stamps for the local mail. On advice of the Indian postal advisor to Bhutan, Dr. K. Ramamurti, P&T issued a series of surcharged stamps released in 1965, which were overprinted at the [[India Security Press]] in Nashik. The same printer was used by P&T next year 1966 for the first regular, low value, non-agency definitives with the local theme of Bhutanese dzongs. Another complaint by P&T was that often the Bhutan Stamp Agency designed and printed postage stamps without any or enough discussion or approval.<ref>Len A.

Miniature sheets and highly [[Topical stamp collecting|topical subjects]] remain the staple of the program.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n===1974\u201396: Department of Posts & Telegraphs and the IGPC===\n[[File:Bhutan GPO Thimphu Jan 2013.JPG|thumb|left|General Post Office in the Bhutanese capital Thimphu]]\nWith the departure of Todd, the Department of Posts & Telegraphs appointed the [[Inter-Governmental Philatelic Corporation]] (IGPC), based in New York, as its sole, worldwide agent that permitted IGPC to design and print stamps against a royalty. During the IGPC time, at least two issues would bear the legacy of Burt Todd: the gold coins of 1975 and the 3D traditional masks series of 1976. Otherwise their issues would show the typical IGPC staple of thematic and commemorative sets and souvenir sheets, in general hardly related to the country of issue and with the use of high face-value stamps with no local postal usage.<ref>Vijay Bhusban, 'Bhutan - Strengthening Philatelic Activities', Project RAS/86/112, UPU Berne 1989</ref> Furthermore, the sales income from IGPC decreased dramatically since mid 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">G.N. Zahid Malik,'Report of the Bhutan Evaluation Mission 4\u201318 August 1988', UPU, International Bureau, Berne 1988</ref>\n\nTherefore, in 1992 the P&T Department introduced a system of philatelic agents for worldwide marketing and sales. The P&T started to issue topical and commemorative stamp series independently. International agents or organizations can make proposals to issue postage stamps, which upon agreement may be issued against a royalty. IGPC would be one of them and keep a contract for the production of postal stamps until at least the year 2004.<ref>Royal Audit Authority, Annual Audit Report 2004, section V, point D</ref>\n\nOne particular initiative of the P&T Department after the introduction of this new policy was the release in May 1993 of the ''Famous Paintings - Reading & Writing'' issue, originally designed and printed by the Bhutan Stamp Agency to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the UPU (1874\u20131974) and prepared by the agency to be issued in late 1974. However, the termination of their contract intervened, while the stamps had been already shipped to Bhutan. Since their arrival in the country, the stamps were kept in customs storage and reportedly forgotten by the P&T Department until the early 1990s.<ref>Len Nadybal, Reading and Writing Issue: http://www.bhutanstamps.info/delayed-reading--writing-issue---1974-to-1993.html</ref>\n\nOn 14 February 1982 Bhutan joined the [[Asian-Pacific Postal Union]] (APPU).<ref>APPU Bureau website, Address and contact person of member postal organizations - Bhutan http://www.appu-bureau.org/Contact%20persons.htm#Bhutan_</ref> With the introduction of [[Druk Air]] services between Bhutan, India and Thailand in 1991, mail no longer needed to be routed only overland via Phuentsholing to India, but could also directly be exchanged with the postal exchange offices of New Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok.\n\n===1996\u2013present: Bhutan Postal Corporation===\nIn the 7th Five Year Plan (1992\u201397) privatization of businesses directly ran by the government was one of the major objectives. Some, however would, because of strategic or practical reasons,  remain under government control. These enterprises would, however, be provided with a management structure and operating framework that encourages efficiency whilst ensuring that they operate in the national interest. As a result, the postal and telegraph activities of the P & T Department were incorporated in an autonomous corporation, the Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd., with its trade name ''Bhutan Post'', as of 1 October 1996.\n\n==Postage stamps review==\n\n===Stamp subjects===\nFrom the start onwards, the issue of postage stamps balanced between two goals, to introduce Bhutan to the world community and to provide revenue, in particular foreign exchange. We will find this reflected in the faces on the stamps: at one side Bhutanese themes and at the other side typical international thematic and commemorative subjects appealing to the philatelic market. The first stamp manager, Burt Todd, added to the latter goal with great success, and often as world\u2019s first,  special materials (steel foil, silk, gold color metal foil, molded plastic), special shapes (round, triangular), special printing (3D) and special effects (perfumed ink, real playable gramophone recordings)<ref> \"Little Ambassadors of the Country\", by Peter Bil'ak https://worksthatwork.com/8/history-of-bhutan-postage-stamps</ref>. Was during Todd\u2019s period the balance between Bhutanese and general themed stamp subjects still quite even, this would change during the IGPC period drastically in favor of world thematic and commemorative themes.\n\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan Punakha Dzong bridge 2009 FDC.jpg|thumb|Stamp issued in 2009 on the occasion of the new Punakha Dzong bridge]]\nBhutanese themes on postage stamps are the nation's royalty, [[Dzong architecture]], Buddhist heritage, the Bhutanese mail service (the postal runner in particular), traditional crafts, antiques, Bhutanese scenes, hydro- power, and the nation\u2019s wildlife and sport. Bhutanese themed sport stamps have been issued on the occasion of the Olympics and soccer World Cups. A sample of the theme on Bhutanese architecture is the [[Expo 2000]] issue depicting 6 different dzongs in Bhutan, [[Trashigang]], [[Lhuentse]], [[Gasa, Bhutan|Gasa]], [[Punakha]], [[Tashichhodzong]] and [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Stamps of the World|publisher=[[Stanley Gibbons]]|year=2004|page=371}}</ref>\n\nEmbossed gold foil coin stamps showing different Kings of Bhutan were issued in 1966 and 1968 and, square-shaped, in 1975.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scott Catalogue of Postage Stamps|publisher=[[Scott catalogue|Scott Publishing Company]]|year=2009|pages=920,921&924}}</ref> Perfume-infused rose stamps were issued in 1973.

The sheet carries the text ''Coronation and Centenary Celebrations 2008''. The total face value is Nu. 120, three rows of four stamps each, respectively with the face value of Nu. 5, Nu. 10 and Nu 15. Each stamp is framed, which provides a blank space for the printing of a personalized picture, drawing or logo. Bhutan Post used these 2008 Coronation and Centenary Celebrations personalized stamp sheets to issue 3 different sheets with pictures of the 4th and 5th (present)King and a stylized illustration of the Raven Crown. These stamps are listed in the Michel catalogue under nos. 2517 - 2528.\nAs personalized stamps were apparently a big success, the issue was followed by further personalized stamp issues, the first two with the same values totaling Nu.120, but different designs. The second sheetlet issued in 2009 carries the text ''Greetings from the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan'', while the third issue of late 2010 / early 2011 states ''From the Land of the Thunder Dragon''.\nOn the occasion of the Royal Wedding in October 2011 a set of two personalized stamp sheetlets were issued, both with exactly the same design and stamp values, but for one the main color is orange, while for the second this is dark blue. The sheetlet bears the text ''Celebrating Royal Wedding 2011'', while there is a picture of the newlywed couple as well. The face value of each of the four stamps in the three rows are from top to bottom, Nu.10, Nu.15 and Nu.20, so a total value of Nu.180.

All postage labels will indicate date and time, the sending post office, place of addressee, weight of envelope, and costs of postage. EMS and registered letters also indicate name of receiver, EMS or registration tracking number and the registration fee. Registered letters and domestic EMS letters using a postal label, will also have a separate registration or EMS label with a 13-digit reference number and corresponding bar-code, while for international EMS covers this is part of the main label.

The first release consisted of four revenue stamps issued in 1954 in Tibetan currency: 1 trangka, blue; 2 trangka, red, 4 trangka, green and 8 trangka, orange. These stamps were also made valid for postage as of 1 January 1955 (see above \u2018Dzong Dak system and the use of fiscals as postage\u2019) until the introduction of the postage stamps in 1962, although they appear to have been postally used until at least 1964.<ref>Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue, section Bhutan 'Postal-Fiscal Stamps'</ref> The set has been reprinted in the 1950s on paper that varies from the first printing in 1954, while also the colour ink may differ. A surcharged issue on the blue 1 trangka revenue stamp had been reportedly released in 1961 or 1962, diagonally surcharged respectively with \"10NP\" and \"25NP\" (NP standing for New Paisa, so using the Indian currency), but identified as fakes originating from Kathmandu, Nepal.<ref>Gobi Times , June 1970, pp 5-6, \u2018Further information on fiscal overprints\u2019</ref>\nOnly in 1966 was a new set of two revenue stamps  ready for release, now in Bhutanese currency, of 10 Chetrum (red colour) and 25 Chetrum (jade colour).

This left the front side free for writing of a message.\n\nThe next year P&T issued a simple, single postal card with a purple 10 Chhetrum imprinted stamp showing crossed dorjis or [[vajra]]s. At the same time a reply post card pair was released as well with the same crossed dorjis imprinted stamps. This reply pair had the size and dimensions of two combined single postcards. Furthermore, that year a set of 10 postcards was released, each postcard showing on the front a drawing of a different dzong or lhakhang, each in a different, single color, drawn in a light, modern style. The set was stapled together with a single metal staple and an off-white paper cover on top with the words \"Dzong Series\", \"10 Post Cards\" and \"His Majesty\u2019s Govt. of Bhutan\" printed on it in capital letters. These postcards are in principle an overprint on the single postal card, carrying the same imprint of a purple, crossed dorjis 10 Chhetrum stamp.\n\nThese picture cards were the first true picture cards of Bhutan, in the sense that the front side was completely used for the drawing, leaving the left side of the divided back open for a message and the right side with the imprinted stamp and address lines, as we are used to in a typical standard picture card lay-out. This would be the last postcard with pre-printed postage for 21 years until 2008 when the \"color-your-own-stamp\" set of postcards with a 20 Ngultrum imprinted stamp was published.\n\n====The ''Free Post'' picture cards of February 2008====\nAt the occasion of the 28th birthday of the Fifth King, the Bhutanese newspaper [[Kuensel]] published as a supplement in their paper on 20 February 2008 a set of 7 carton pages with each 4 post cards on them, so 28 different postcards in all, which in partnership with Bhutan Post could be posted for free the next three days (21, 22 and 23 February 2008) to destinations within Bhutan. The postcards had to be cut out of the pages. The pictures show the 5th King in different poses and occasions, and each one was sponsored by a ministry, a para-statal or a private company. All are in color, except for the one sponsored by Bhutan Post, which is in black and white.\n\n====The ''Color-Your-Own'' picture postal cards of June 2008<ref>Leo van der Velden, The Color-Your-Own Picture Postal Cards of June 2008 of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #158, 2nd Quarter 2014, pp 11-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_002.pdf </ref>====\n[[File:Bhutan postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot.jpg|thumb|left|Postcard with imprinted Color Your Own Postage Stamp showing a stylized Endless Knot]]\nOn the occasion of the participation of Bhutan to the Smithsonian Folklife Festival (25 June - 6 July 2008) in Washington DC,<ref>News release Smithsonian of 28 May 2008 on the Smithsonian Folklife Festival http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/smithsonian-folklife-festival-features-hands-activities-families-and-children</ref> Bhutan Post issued a set of four postcards with imprinted \"Color Your Own\" postage stamps in partnership with Frances Todd Stewart, daughter of the legendary Burt Todd, and Stewart's Creative Products International, creator of the Color-Your-Own program, as distributor.<ref>Press information on the website of Creative Products International on the 2008  Smithsonian Folklife Festival and the Color Your Own postcard http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com/prm_color_your_own.htm</ref> There are four different postcards with each a different picture and imprinted post stamp, all under the theme \"From gratitude springs happiness\".  Each postcard consists of the actual picture card with an attached small strip, which can be torn off at the perforated line.<ref>the size of the card is 100 x 180 mm with strip, and has the modern picture postcard size of 100 x 150 mm without</ref> The back side is divided, with the message part also divided into two. The idea was that American children would color the stamps (20 Nu each \u2013 the Bhutanese postal rate for international postcards), which are drawings of four 'Lucky Signs' in black and white, and put a few words on gratitude (\"What are we grateful for\") on the upper part of the message area for a school child in Bhutan, but address the postcard to themselves. They had then to stick a US stamp on that small strip which has the pre-printed address of the Philatelic Bureau, Bhutan Postal Corp., GPO Building, Thimphu, Bhutan. Alternatively, the postcards could be left with the Bhutan Post stand at the festival, which staff would then take them back to Bhutan. Bhutan Post would there divide these postcards to schools, where school kids would add their few words on gratitude on the lower message area and then the post card would be sent back to the addressee in the States or elsewhere. The strip with the address of the Philatelic Bureau would be torn off by the personnel of Bhutan Post, which was also organizing the whole process.\n\n===Aerogrammes===\nThe P&T Department issued three aerogrammes over the years. Around 1970 the first one was issued with an imprinted stamp of 85 Chetrum, picturing a dancing demon, and in 1979 a second aerogramme was issued, with the same design but the imprinted stamp had a new face value of Nu 1.25. The third and final aerogramme was issued around 1989 with a different lay-out and the imprinted stamp of Nu. 3.50 depicts birds and flowers.<ref>cf. Len Nadybal, 2005, ''Catalog of Bhutan Postal Stationery'',  http://www.japhila.cz/hof/0070/BPS_Catalog.htm</ref> The 1970 aerogramme has been available in later years surcharged to Nu. 1.50  with a ''postage pre-paid'' seal. The Nu. 3.50 aerogramme is still on sale at GPO Thimphu, but has to be uprated to the current airmail rate by adding the necessary postage stamps.\n\n===Inland letter sheets===\n[[File:Stamp Bhutan 1998 inland lettersheet.jpg|thumb|1998 Inland [[letter sheet]]]]\nBhutan Post issued the country\u2019s first inland [[letter sheet]]s in December 1998.

The imprinted stamp is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the April 1998 WHO stamp set issued on the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the World Health Organization (WHO). Another inland letter has been published around the same time. It carries an imprinted Nu.3 stamp of a postal runner approaching a village, and is a copy of the Nu. 3 stamp of the October 1992 set issued on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Bhutan Post postal service. All remaining issues of the inland letters are based on this issue. One issue was released with the overprint ''FREE POST CAMPAIGN, 11 \u2013 17 December 1998'' in the middle at the top of the front.  The last inland sheet issue was a set of two, released early June 1999 on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck with the over print ''SILVER JUBILEE, FREE POST CAMPAIGN,  2 \u2013 12th June \u201899'' in the upper middle of the front of the inland letter.

The envelope furthermore is stamped with a black, round rubber seal with the words 'FREE POST DAY 13-15 OCTOBER 2011' in an outer ring, while in the inner circle the words \"IN COMMEMORATION OF THE ROYAL WEDDING\" are printed below a modified version of the official Royal Wedding symbol <ref>Royal Wedding News 15 September 2011 Bhutan+Partners http://www.barnism.com/bhutan/2011/09/koninklijke-symbolen-bhutan/</ref> of two rings entwined in front of a [[khorlo]] ([[dharma]] wheel), and a scarf running through the rings (but without the lotus seat (padmasana), while the khorlo is less elaborate than in the official full version).\n\n==Postal covers and other postal items==\n\n===First Day Covers<ref>Iiro Kakko & Leo van der Velden, The complex start of First Day Covers in Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #162, 2nd Quarter 2015, pp 9-12, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2015_002.pdf</ref>===\n[[First day of issue]] covers or First Day Covers (FDCs) have been issued starting with the first postage stamp issue of 10 October 1962. In the Burt Todd's Bhutan Stamp Agency (BSA) period, both the BSA as well as the P&T Department issued FDCs, often for the same stamp issue. In recent years, Bhutan Post has missed several times to produce an FDC for a particular stamp issue, although sometimes private First Day of Issue covers are known to have filled the void, for instance on the occasion of the Punakha Dzong Cantilever Bridge stamp issue of 20 March 2009.\n\n===Event covers===\nAn [[event cover]] was issued on 20 October 1967 on the occasion of the postal exhibition held at the [[Tashichho Dzong]] in Thimphu.\n\n===Maxi cards===\n[[Maximum card]]s have been issued for the first time in Bhutan in July 1968, and later issues have been especially in partnership with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF).\n\n===Picture postcards issued by the P&T Dept. and Bhutan Post<ref>Leo van der Velden, Introduction to the First Listing of Picture Postcards of Bhutan, in: Postal Himal #159, 3rd Quarter 2014, pp10-13, http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/postalhimal/pdf/PH_2014_003.pdf</ref>===\n[[File:1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Bhutan P&T first multi-color postcard showing the Dungchi Lhakhang]]\nThe P&T Department issued also picture postcards without any imprinted stamps, starting in 1968 with a set of 9 multi-colored postcards which had a modern standard format (100 x 150mm) and were printed on art board paper by the ''Reliable Calendar Company'' of Calcutta (nowadays spelled as Kolkata).<ref>'Release of Colour Scenic View Cards', in: ''Kuensel'', 1968, vol.2, no.15, p.5</ref> The pictures show dzongs, lhakhangs, a folk dance, a yak, a mother and child, in general topics which will return again and again on Bhutanese postcards, emphasizing \u2018exotic or typical Bhutan\u2019. In the mid 1970s P&T published the set \"Views/Dances of Bhutan\" in four carton-board covers colored respectively blue, brown, orange and yellow, with some 8 post cards in each cover. The postcards were true color glossy chrome pictures in the old, smaller format (90 x 140mm). Three sets were printed by well-known security printers,'' the House of Questa'' (blue and orange covers) and ''Format International Security Printers Ltd'' (brown cover), while the fourth yellow set was printed by the Reliable Calendar Company, which printed in the past the more modern 1968 set. A set of 63 supersized (120 x 180&nbsp;mm) color postcards was issued around 1992 showing among others dzongs, lhakhangs, valleys, landscape views, dances, people, and, last but not least, the newly opened (in 1988) GPO in Thimphu. Although this set is published by P&T, there is no reference on the postcards to this, but only to the printers: in small letters and light ink it states at the left corner of the back side ''D&F Co. Ltd. Tel (662)3742974 Thailand''. This was followed around 1993 by the Environmental Trust Fund set, 17 different postcards in full color in a carton cover, showing landscapes, local flowers, animals and the Rinpung Dzong in Paro, printed by ''Secura Ltd'' of Singapore. After the incorporation in 1996 of Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd, using \u2018Bhutan Post\u2019 as trade name, a steady number of sets of postcards have been issued, although at that time the private market had taken already a firm footing as well. Some of these postcards of Bhutan Post are still available from their \u2018\u2019Philatelic eShop\u2019\u2019.<ref>Philatelic eShop on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/philatelic/index.php?option=com_virtuemart</ref> The latest issue of 2010 is a set of 17 different picture post cards, all of the 5th King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck in beautiful metallic-like colors.\n\n===Telegrams with postage stamps===\nIn the 1960s the P&T Department also used to attach postage stamps to telegrams as token of payment of the telegraph costs.\n\n==Post offices and postal marks==\n[[File:PO Wamrong July 2008 460.jpg|thumb|Postmistress in front of Wamrong Post Office in east Bhutan]]\nAfter the opening of the first post office in Phuentsholing on 10 October 1962, the second post office opened less than a month later in Paro (with post mark ''Rinpung Dzong''). It would take a little over a half year for Thimphu PO to open as third, with ''Tashichho Dzong'' as post mark. In the following years, aside from POs staffed by P&T Department staff members, also smaller ''extra-departmental''  post offices would be opened, mostly in remote locations, ran by postal agents, who were working on an agreement basis against a modest monthly stipend. These were first called BPO, branch post office, then APO, agency post office, and since a few years CMO, community mail office. Budgeted in the Bhutan Five Year Plans, the number would steadily increase, from 3 POs in 1964 to 28 POs and 5 extra-departmental POs in 1971, via 45 POs and 27 BPOs in 1978, to a high 56 POs and 27 BPOs in 1988,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> after which we see a decrease in the full-fledged POs to 47 in 2006, but with an increase of the APOs to 43.<ref>Bhutanese newspaper ''[[Kuensel]]'' 1 July 2006 'Rural postal services must be  improved'</ref> The latest figure for 2010 is 43 POs (including the two GPOs in Phuentsholing and Thimphu) and 33 CMOs.\n\nFor mail sent in the early 1960s, postmarks of the Indian post offices handling the international mail to and from Bhutan can be found on covers mailed during that period, while postmarks of Indian post offices assisting Bhutan P&T with domestic mail routed via road or train in India were also attached to covers handled through that system. <ref> Leo van der Velden and Aranya Dutta Choudhury, 'Note on the use of Indian post offices in WestBengal and Assam in the 1960s as part of the Bhutan postal services', pp 4-5  in Postal Himal, No. 173, 1st Quarter 2018</ref>\n\n==Collecting Bhutanese stamps==\nThe Bhutan Postal Corporation Ltd. has a Philatelic Bureau to offer services to stamp collectors, who can open up a subscription to receive future issues or buy some of the older issues which are still for sale.<ref>info Philatelic Services on the Bhutan Postal Corporation website http://www.bhutanpost.com.bt/index.php?id=61</ref> A group of collectors organized themselves as ''The Bhutan Philatelic Society'' in the USA in 1976 and publicized a quarterly ''The Kaleidoscope'' for a few years. Recently they resurfaced on Facebook as ''Bhutan Stamp Collectors''.<ref>see the Facebook page of ''Bhutan Stamp Collectors'' at https://www.facebook.com/groups/129173790434880/</ref> The [[Nepal and Tibet Philatelic Study Circle]] provides also a haven for collectors of Bhutanese stamps and Bhutan philately receives regular attention in their publication ''Postal Himal''.<ref>the NTPSC website is hosted by Rainer's Stamp Corner http://fuchs-online.com/ntpsc , while digital copies of their publication Postal Himal can be found on the website of the Digital Himalaya Project co-located at the Cambridge and Yale universities http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/journals/postalhimal</ref>\n\n==Catalogues and publications==\nA specific stamp catalogue for Bhutan does not exist at the moment. However, information on stamp issues can be found in the [[Scott catalogue | Scott]], [[Stanley Gibbons catalogue | Stanley Gibbons]] and [[Michel catalog | Michel]] stamp catalogues.\n\nThe P&T Department of the Royal Government of Bhutan has issued a few publications with information on the history of the postal services.  Early May 1969 on the occasion of the inauguration of the first Thimphu GPO building on 11 May 1969, the Department issued a booklet ''Postal Services in Bhutan'', providing an overview of the gradual expansion of the postal services in Bhutan since 1962. In 1970 a nice 90-page booklet ''Bhutan Through Postage Stamps'' was produced, with detailed information about all stamps issued between 1962 and end 1969.<ref> see Bhutan Stamp Collectors page of 1 May 2018 ff. on Facebook </ref> Early 1976 the Philatelic Bureau of the Department published a small brochure ''Bhutan Stamp History'' with a complete listing of all stamps issued from the first postage stamps of 10 October 1962 to December 1975. No other significant publication has been issued by the P&T Department or Bhutan Post since then. The intention to publish a book on the postal history of Bhutan at the occasion of the 50th Anniversary of postal services in Bhutan (1962 - 2012) had to be abandoned by Bhutan Post, reportedly because of lack of funds.\n\nMost stamps issued during the ''Bhutan Stamp Agency'' era came with an informative and often beautifully designed presentation folder, brochure and/or flyer.  After 1974 only flyers and sometimes brochures were issued and for the last 15 years only intermittently. In a few cases the international agent instigating the issue of a particular set of stamps issued a presentation folder and brochure, for instance the CD-ROM stamps of 2007 <ref>issued in partnership with Creative Products International, a company headed by Frances Todd Stewart, the daughter of the legendary Burt Todd. See their website http://www.bhutanpostagestamps.com</ref> and the [[World Food Programme]] set of 2009.\n\n==Bhutan Postal Museum==\nOn 7 November 2015 the [[Bhutan Postal Museum]] was opened at the General Post Office building in Thimphu<ref> Bhutan Broadcasting Service 7 Nov. 2015 http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=54259 </ref>. The postal museum narrates the story of the evolution of communication, transportation and postal services in Bhutan's history. The story is told through the collection of various anecdotes, artifacts and the rich assortment of stamps Bhutan has produced over the years<ref> Bhutan Postal Museum website http://www.bhutanpostalmuseum.bt/ </ref>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of people on stamps of Bhutan]]\n*[[Bhutan Postal Corporation]]\n*[[Nepal and Tibet Philatelic Study Circle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Bhutan through postage stamps''.

It was released in August 1999.<ref name=\"MILLER2\">{{Citation |last=Miller |first=John Jackson |title=Scrye Collectible Card Game Checklist & Price Guide, Second Edition | year=2003 |pages=492\u2013504 |postscript=.}}</ref> It is based on the ''Swashbuckling Adventures'' (formerly ''[[7th Sea (role-playing game)|7th Sea]]'') [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting.\n\n==Setting==\nIn the ''7th Sea CCG'', players take the role of naval captains in the [[fantasy]]-[[English Restoration|Restoration]] world of [[Th\u00e9ah]]. The game attempted to capture the feeling of a [[Hollywood]] pirate battle, complete with huge galleys, cannon-shot exchanges, and daring sea [[boarding (attack)|boardings]]. The game also has aspects of adventuring, treasure seeking, and the [[occult]].\n\nAs with most of the games of AEG, ''7th Sea'' had a complex storyline that affected and was influenced by the RPG setting. The results of tournaments would function to guide the storyline, and the storyline in turn would be used to create new cards.\n\n==Basics==\nThe game had many interesting concepts, including multiple winning conditions and a unique [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]]-themed combat system. The most important aspects were deck building, rules, and storyline.\n\n===Terms===\nThe game used a number of terms to describe elements of game play:\n\n* Faction: The many factions in the game corresponded either to the navies of Th\u00e9ah's different nations, pirates, or other independent fleets. Almost every crew character belonged to a faction, though some were unaligned and thus available to be used by any player.\n* [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]]: The leading character on a ship and most important crewmember. Captains followed special rules and were often central to the faction's storyline.\n* Ship: There were many ships with various abilities. Each player would use one ship for the entire game, as well as one captain and crew. Faction ships could only be used with a captain of the corresponding faction, while unaligned ships were available to anyone.\n* Crew: The rest of a ship's characters. A player could build a crew from all factions but the starting crew could not consist of a faction distinct from the ship.\n* Seas: The environment of the ship. Five pre-constructed cards delineated the game space.\n* Tack: When a card's ability was used for the turn, it was turned sideways and could not be used again. This was called 'tacking.' Tacking also resulted from damage.\n\n===Cards===\nThe six types of cards in ''7th Sea'' were: Actions, Crew, Adventures, Attachments, Chanteys and Ships. Each card is played differently as explained below.\n\n====Crew====\nThe most important card type in ''7th Sea'' is Crew.  This card type combines the traditional CCG concepts of both a resource type and a creature type.  Most CCGs use some kind of card type to produce resources that they subsequently use to gain other items. Usually those resources do not contribute to anything else. Examples of this are ''lands'' from ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' and ''holdings'' from ''[[Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game|Legend of the Five Rings]]''. Most games also have some kind of creature card that provides offence and defense, like M:TG's creatures and ''[[Doomtown]]'''s Dudes. The game combined both while also providing multiple resource types and multiple combat procedures.\n\nCrew are the sailors you have hired to man the ship. Your Captain is a special and important kind of crew but he still performs in much the same way any other crew.\n\nCrew cards have the following statistics:\n\n** '''Cost:''' This is the amount of Influence (a type of resource, much like 'mana' in ''Magic: the Gathering'', or 'gold' in ''Legend of the Five Rings'') that you must provide to hire that crew and a measure of the card's overall power.\n** '''Faction:''' This symbol denoted the faction this crew belongs to. Crews without a symbol were unaligned.\n** '''Cannon:''' This statistic represented the crew's skill with a cannon. Its primary function was to perform cannon attacks upon other ships, simply by ''tacking'' a crew with more than 0 cannon ability.\n** '''Sailing:''' This statistic represented the crew's skill at sailing. A crew with sufficient sailing ability could ''tack'' to move the ship by one sea.\n** '''Adventuring:''' This statistic represented the crew's abilities in exploration and adventuring. This skill was mostly used to complete the requirements for ''Adventure'' cards, which would then bestow benefits upon that crewmember, the ship, or upon the player in other ways.\n** '''Influence:''' A measure of a crew's wealth, charisma, and diplomatic skills. Influence is required to hire more crew, and as a result, it is the most important ability in the first few turns of the game.\n** '''Swashbuckling:''' This measures the ability of the crew to repair the ship, in effect providing \"damage soak\" and how effective the crew is at [[M\u00eal\u00e9e]]. This translates as damage (hits) inflicted from a successful boarding attack.\n\nCrews also had various '''traits''' that allowed them to use certain cards. Some of the most common traits were:\n** '''Swordsman:''' The crew's skill in m\u00eal\u00e9e measured with a number (+1, +3 etc.). It translates as extra damage in boardings, and it allowed the crew to attach ''swordsman school'' attachment cards. All captains had some level of Swordsmanship.\n** '''Heroic/Villainous:''' These mutually exclusive traits revealed a crew's \"way of life\". There were various cards that were compatible with one of these two traits. For most of the history of the game, Villainous was considered a better trait to have on your Captain, since it gave access to easy card draw.\n** '''Sorcery:''' There were various types of sorcery in the world of Th\u00e9ah, and various crew could use them as attachments. However those attachments had a specific sorcery requirement of a certain level (0\u20132) that the crew had to have to attach them.\n\nEach ship had a limited amount of space for crew and that meant that smaller ships usually had lower resource and offensive capabilities. Usually this was balanced out with different benefits, like stronger special abilities and lower sailing costs.\nPlayers usually chose crew for their deck depending on their style and their faction's strengths, usually focusing on one or two statistics and maybe a trait (like sorcery). Crew with sailing or swashbuckling were always useful due to their innate use on movement and damage soak, however players also focused on more than one or two of the other three skills, Cannon, Adventuring, and Influence so as to be able to use specific cards more easily. Decks which focused on many skills together were the most difficult to build, however a good player then had a much greater versatility.\n\nCrew cards had a '''Punch''' as their boarding attack.\n\n====Actions====\nAction cards are the surprises you can spring on an unsuspecting opponent. They are one-use cards that have some immediate effect.\nIn ''7th Sea'', action cards had two costs. One was for the player and the other for his target (the canceling cost) and it was in the form of '''Skill: number'''. Costs are paid by tacking one or more crew with the appropriate skill, until the number is fulfilled.\nThe canceling cost was there for the target of the action, and it allowed him to cancel the action by paying it. Thus some pretty powerful cards could be balanced by having a lower canceling cost. Cost and cancel need not use the same skill.\n\nAction cards came in two types, Acts and Reacts.\n'''Acts''' are cards a player used in his turn. They usually worked to provide some unexpected effect, such as a combined cannon attack or an unstoppable boarding.\n'''Reacts''' are the much more common form of action cards. They can only be played on specific triggers such as an augment to a cannon attack, or suffering hits instead of a boarding attack.\n\nAll decks employed action cards, and usually the more aggressive decks employed a greater number.\n\nAction cards' boarding attack could either be a '''Dagger''' or a '''Slash'''.\n\n====Attachments====\nAttachment cards are default enhancing cards for your other cards (the other being adventures). After the player pays the cost, he chooses an appropriate card to attach it to. Usual targets for attachments were:\n** Crew: Attachments ranged from pistols and earrings, to parrots and spells.\n** Ship: Ship attachments usually modified the ship in some way, such as a treasure hold, better sails, figureheads (usually specific to factions) etc. Some ship attachments had the drawback that they took up ''crew space''.\n** Sea: Sea attachments usually were ports, monsters, and allies you could employ. These often required a specific sea.\n\nUsually attachments had some kind of '''trait''' that classified it, such as ''Item'', ''Henchman'', ''Pet'', ''Swordsman School'', etc. For example, a ''pistol'' would be an '''Item''' while ''Rum Runners'' would be an '''Ally'''. These traits were used to specify targets for other cards.\n\nIn later sets requirements for attachments became more frequent. Those requirements ranged from a skill level (Cannon 4), to the alliance to a faction (e.g. Crimson Rogers), to the existence of a trait (Villainous), or a trait at a specific level (e.g. Porte 2).\nDue to the speed of attachments, they usually had a much lower reward/cost ratio than '''adventures'''.\n\nAttachment cards' boarding attack was a '''Club'''.\n\n====Adventures====\nThis is the second type of card a crew could attach. Adventures are the usual stuff of [[Hollywood]] pirate or naval adventure films: ancient relics, captured damsels, sea monsters, etc.\nThese cards were almost exclusively completed by the use of the '''adventuring''' skill and were defined by the following:\n** '''Seas away:''' Adventures did not automatically attach to a crew, but rather to a sea. When played, an adventure was placed a number of seas away from your ship (usually 1 to 3). To complete an adventure, your ship had to be on the same sea as the Adventure. This served as a balance factor for the more powerful or cheap adventures by forcing you to sail to the target sea to get it (something not always easy when opponents were waiting in the middle)\n** '''Native sea:''' Most adventures had one specific sea in which it was much easier to complete them. This could range from a single point of adventuring lower for low-end adventures, to several points lower for the more costly ones. Then other adventures were easier to attach to specific crew, such a ''Villainous'', ''Skeletal'' or ''Rose and Cross'' crew member.\n** '''Reward:''' Adventure rewards usually increased a skill by a number of points with a high reward/cost ratio. However, in later expansions, Adventures started giving various effects, such as traits or special abilities.\n\nAlthough Adventures were attached to a Sea, they were only available to the player that attached them (barring other card effects). This was a nice way to \"archive\" uncompleted adventures without cluttering your hand. However, some cards punished rampant adventure archiving.\n\nAdventure Cards' boarding attack was a '''Thrust'''.\n\n====Chanteys====\nChanteys were introduced later in the life of the game. They signified various global changes in the world of Th\u00e9ah in the form of popular songs used by the populace.\nChanteys were similar to actions. However their effects, contrary to action cards, were permanent. They could either affect only the player or an opponent, or it could affect all players.\nChanteys worked in a way similar to terrains in ''Legend of the Five Rings'' or Omens in ''[[Legend of the Burning Sands]]''. That is, only one Chantey could be in effect at any one time. At any time that a Chantey came into play, the former Chantey was discarded. More powerful Chanteys had, instead of a cancel cost, a discard cost that any player could use to get rid of the Chantey.\n\n====Ships====\nThese cards are special in that they are not in the deck but rather start in play, along with your captain.\nMost ships belonged to a specific faction and could only be used by matching captains.\nEach ship was defined by its faction, ''crew maximum,'' and ''sailing cost''.\n\nCrew maximum was used to determine the maximum number of crew you could have on your ship. Ships with a large crew maximum tended to be more powerful in the late game, but more vulnerable at the start.\n\nSailing cost shows how easy a ship is to maneuver. Some action cards didn't use a fixed cost, but relied instead upon a ship's sailing cost (sometimes modified up or down). The advantage of a small ship was the fact that it could fill fast and press the offensive quickly.\n\n====Seas====\nThe five Seas were always the same. They came with each starter box and were placed in a specific order. Seas had no specific abilities other than forming a game space for ships to move and for being the target of cards. Each captain has a specific ''starting sea'' which was usually chosen as a result of the storylines. New players often wondered where the other two seas which are not represented with cards were. The answer lies in the setting of the world of Th\u00e9ah. The 6th sea is protected by a wall of flame and thus difficult to access, and the 7th sea is a mythical place and very hard to find. Neither of these two 'extra' seas played any major role in the card game.\n\n===Deck construction===\nPlayers make many choices when designing a deck. They must keep in mind both the captain's and ship's abilities, the faction's strengths and weaknesses, and the strategy they want to use. Even with the same Captain and Ship, it is possible to make completely different deck types.\n\n*Restrictions\n** A player must first choose a captain. The captain determines the faction.\n** A player must choose a ship of the same faction as the captain, or an unaligned ship.\n** The deck may not be less than 60 cards including captain and ship.\n** A deck may not have more than 3 copies of a single card.\n\n==Strategies==\nThere are many different concepts for a deck and many different ways to achieve them, depending mainly on the faction and secondarily on the ship.\n\nFor example, the Castillians were mainly a boarding faction (which means they liked to attack in m\u00eal\u00e9e) but with the right construction it was possible to attack without boarding (by making ramming attacks and limited cannon). The original Castillian ship was a hulking galley but in later expansions they got a small fast ship that allowed them to perform a tactic which some called 'speed boarding'.\n\nSome sample deck foci are:\n* 'Atomic Cannon': These decks focused on sinking the opponent's ship with one big cannon attack. They usually had many adventures and actions to evade boardings.\n* 'Plinging': These decks focused on producing many small attacks, slowly forcing the opponent to tack all their cards, rendering them unable to take action against you. This was mainly achieved with cannon, but there were variations with spells.\n* Boarding: These decks focused on catching the opponent and entering boarding. They usually used big ships with lots of crew and had a nice spread of cards.\n* 'Speed Boarding': These decks focused on catching the opponent in a boarding during the first or early second turn. If they couldn't, they usually lost. The ships these decks used were small and had small sailing requirements.\n* 'Control': These rare decks tried to complete the secondary control victory condition. They were the harder decks to construct competitively.\n\nEven within these broad categories, there were many ways to carry out any given strategy. For example, a boarding deck might use only the captain to deal damage while the rest of the crew absorbed hits, or it might use small attacks with pistols and weak characters or it could just have a nice spread. One could use boarding action cards to enhance the attacks or to just absorb damage. One could also use attachments to win the attacks more easily, or adventures to inflict more damage etc.\n\nCombining various strategies was not uncommon, such as a boarding deck that used a big cannon attack before the boarding to soften the enemy.\n\n==Game play==\n===Start===\nAt the start of each game, players used their captain's starting Wealth statistic to recruit their starting crew. Since the starting crew could be anyone from the deck, it was a nice tactic to have some backup crew in the deck for specific situations (much like a [[sideboard]], only built-in). A captain's starting Wealth usually ranged from 7 to 10. Players typically chose a crew with high Influence statistics to start a game, although speed decks often preferred Sailing, Swashbuckling, and Cannon.\n\n===Phases===\nEach turn has 3 phases. The first phase is used to determine which player goes first; the second phase, the most important one, is where the game is actually played and the final phase is the end of turn were all resources are replenished (by untacking and drawing cards). Unlike in many games where a player performs as many actions as he wishes before passing to the next player, in ''7th Sea'' each player performs only one action, and players pass to one another until none choose to take further actions.\n\nIn the main phase, starting with the first player, each player performs an action or passes and then play proceeded clockwise to the next player. Actions can be playing an Action card from one's hand, using a printed ability on a card in play, or performing an action innate to the game like hiring crew, or performing a cannon attack.\n\nOnce all players pass consecutively, the turn ends.\n\nThe innate actions all players can perform in ''7th Sea'' are:\n*'''Moving:''' By ''tacking'' Crew to produce Sailing points to equal or exceed the ship's sailing cost, a player can move his ship to an adjacent sea.\n*'''Cannon Attack:''' By producing any number of cannon with a single Crew, a player can inflict that number of hits on a ship in the same sea.\n*'''Hire Crew:''' If the ship has not reached its crew maximum, a player can reveal a crew from his hand and then produce equal or more influence than that crew's cost to recruit it.\n*'''Begin a boarding:''' By producing sailing equal to the ship's sailing cost, a player can attempt to begin a boarding against a ship in the same sea.\n*'''Complete an adventure:''' While in the same sea as one of his own adventures, a player can play all costs and attach the adventure to an appropriate target.\n\n===Boardings===\n''Boarding'' is considered the most interesting phase of the game. Once begun, the involved ships lock together with their crews engaged in \"cinematic m\u00eal\u00e9e battle\". While a player can escape a ship's cannons by running away, the only ways to disengage from boarding are with both players' consent or with a card effect. Accordingly, boarding decks are rewarded for the difficulty of engagement.\n\nBoarding occurs within the main phase of the game. During boarding, the rest of the game stops, so players can no longer play acts. Boarding consists of alternating ''boarding attacks'' between the two players involved. In turn, each boarding attack includes choosing a crew and sending it forward to attack (i.e. jumping to the other ship and causing some trouble). The defender can choose either to stand and take the hits (equal to the other crew's damage plus swordsman level) or to send someone forward to defend.\n\nEach card in the deck has three boarding boxes.  The large ''attack box'' is first, with two smaller ''defend boxes'' below it. Each boarding box has one of the following actions: [C] ''(Club)'', [P] ''(Punch)'', [D] ''(Dagger)'', [S] ''(Slash)'', or [T] ''(Thrust)''. The attacker starts by playing a card from his hand to initiate his attack.  If possible, the defender resists by playing a matching defence card from his hand (i.e. the defender's card must have a ''defend box'' matching the attacker's ''attack box''). The defender immediately counter-attacks with the action in the ''attack box'' of that defending card.  The original attacker then defends himself against the counter-attack. In effect, the exchange is reminiscent of a continuous cinematic ''\"Thrust-Slash-Parry-Riposte\"'' m\u00eal\u00e9e. The m\u00eal\u00e9e ends when either player cannot defend against an attack (i.e. the player's hand is empty, he chose the order of his attacks wrongly, or he has a bad boarding hand). The last attacking player wins the boarding attack, and the loser suffers ''hits''.\n\nBoardings are interesting both because defenders can inflict hits and because the crews locked in m\u00eal\u00e9e suffer hits first.  Such early hits risk loss of either crews' captain (and thus the game) while the crew may still be in otherwise prime condition.  Because of this, a player may choose to avoid starting a boarding attack by passing or by playing a ''react'' (e.g. firing a musket or getting drunk). When both players perform a boarding attack, they draw 3 cards each and the attacks continue.\n\nSince boarding boxes are spread in different card types, boarding decks usually have a wide variety of card types, unlike cannon and victory decks with few (two or three) card types. Thus, dedicated cannon decks can be caught helplessly in a boarding.\n\n===Death and destruction===\nShips are fragile things. When a ship suffers hits, the crew is responsible for fixing it by tacking or sinking (getting killed). Hits cannot be ignored. When a captain sinks to absorb hits you lose the game. Players sometimes employed action cards to help them absorb hits.\n\n===Victory===\nIn ''7th Sea'', there were two roads to victory. You could either sink all enemy ships, or perform a control victory (play several expensive cards, one in each sea).\n\n==Storyline==\nThe game was a heavily story influenced game. Its factions had ties to specific RPG elements and rivalries and alliances occurred between them as the story progressed. The first story arc saw many serious conflicts, not necessarily all tied together. Storyline deaths were not uncommon (they didn't have some specific effect in the game), and the game even saw the death of an entire faction.\n\n===Factions===\n*'''Crimson Rogers:''' Bloodthirsty pirates led by the cruel and ruthless Captain Reis, the Crimson Rogers flew red sails and were feared more than any other faction, save perhaps the Black Freighter. Their motto was '''''No Banter, No Barter, No Quarter'''''. ''The Crimson Rogers have excellent cannon, adequate boarding and adventuring capabilities, but low influence. They are mostly '''Villainous'''''.\n*'''Sea Dogs:''' More [[privateer]]s than pirates, the Sea Dogs were sponsored by Avalon (a nation inspired by mythic England). They angered the Crimson Rogers, leading to the destruction of their ship and the near-death of their first captain Berek, the luckiest man alive. Bloody Bonnie McGee took the helm and sacrificed her life for a chance to take down Reis. ''The Sea Dogs have high influence and jack of all trades crew, without any particular specialisation. They dabble in '''Glamour''' sorcery and are primarily '''Heroic''', being the only faction in the game with no villainous crew.''\n*'''Castillians:''' Sailors from the nation of Castille (based on renaissance Spain), this faction was originally the enemy of the Montaigne, with whose nation they were at war. They later allied with the Montaigne faction to save their captain, Orduno. They were also allied with the Inquisition (the punitive, warlike arm of the church). ''Castillians are mainly a boarding faction with some cannon capabilities.''\n*'''Montaigne:''' Montaigne (based on renaissance France) is the wealthiest nation and as a result they excel at many things. They usually employ Musketeers for sword fights and their fighting style employs the most tricks. Their original captain, the General, was a mercenary soldier from Eisen who was promoted as a pirate hunter. Their secondary captain was mainly preoccupied with bringing Montaigne's rivals, the Castillians, back in line. ''Montaigne have many good swordsmen and fighting tricks while also being very fast on the offensive due to their high influence.''\n*'''The Brotherhood:''' The Brotherhood are escaped convicts from a Castillian prison who formed their own pirate nation. Their original captain, Allende, was recaptured, but later freed by Berek, who became the Brotherhood's new captain following his escape from Reis. ''The Brotherhood has high adventuring, giving them flexibility, but also making them weak to start, needing time to complete adventures. Later ships and captains with powerful abilities grant them greater playability.''\n*'''The Explorers:''' The explorers were neither pirates nor allied with any nation. Their captain, Guy McCormic was obsessed with finding ancient Syrneth artifacts (the remnants of a lost high-tech civilization). At some point, after he sacrificed a crewmember to his passion, the rest of the crew mutinied and overcame him. ''Explorers have very high adventuring and sailing and are very good at escaping trouble.''\n*'''The Corsairs:''' The only faction hailing from the Crescent Empire (inspired by the [[Ottoman Empire]]), the Corsairs are led by Kheired Din, a ruthless slavemaster who sacrificed his own crew to get results. The corsairs were hit hard story wise when their slaves rebelled and their leader, Espero, turned out to be a descendant of the lost Castillian royal bloodline. The second corsair ship was led by Ernesto Castillus (AKA Espero) whose actions were critical to the end of the storyline. ''Corsairs are very good at boarding, and have a very high damage absorption''.\n*'''The Gosse's Gentlemen:''' A former legend once again picks up the sword and sails the seven seas along with his band of heroic gentlemen-pirates. Gosse had sworn to bring down the Black Freighter captained by the man who killed his wife. He achieved this aim, with the help of Ernesto Castillus, the sacrifice of his ship, and his own life. ''The Gosse had very high swashbuckling, and as a result they were very good at boardings, and to some extent, damage absorption''.\n*'''The Vesten:''' The Vestenmannavnjar or Vesten (based on [[Viking]]s of the late [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]]) are raiders and warriors of an old tradition. Bitter over the betrayal by their greedy kinsmen, they hunt and loot any Vendel Trading ship they caught. Eventually betrayed from within, their captain Yngvild survived and hunted for revenge. The next captain was led by their betrayer and rival, Jorund. ''In keeping with their Viking inspiration, the Vesten specialise in boarding. Their cannon abilities are non-existent, but they make up for this with large amounts of damage-absorption''.\n*'''The Black Freighter:''' The undead of ''7th Sea'' sail on a massive ghost ship, the Black Freighter that gives them their name. Their original Captain, Necros was brought back to avenge his death at the hands of Gosse. The original crew consisted of undead versions of normal crew (the faction can't recruit non Black Freighter crew) and resurrected crew from the other factions. The first story arc ended with the death of Necros and his ship. ''The Black Freighter was an interesting faction since it relied on skeletal crew and fear cards. They could go for either boarding or cannon and usually mixed both''.\n\nThere were also a number of \"unaligned\" crew who belonged to no faction and so were usable by any Captain. Usually these were generic pirates, but some were given quite a bit of character and even included a handful of captains.\n\n===Story arc===\nThe first story arc began with minor events and conflicts between the various factions and gradually progressed with events of greater importance which ended up changing the state of the world. Notable events include the rivalry between the Sea Dogs and the Crimson Rogers, which climaxed with the apparent death of Captain Reis at the hands of the Sea Dogs second captain; Bloody Bonnie McGee. There was also the appearance of the Black Freighter and its later defeat at the hands of Phillip Gosse by the sacrifice of his whole faction. And finally the Corsair's search for the final Syrneth switch which revealed the hidden island, Cabora, and their destiny.\n\nThe second story arc didn't have enough time to be fully fleshed out but it started with the Montaigne Revolution and the capture of their former emperor.\n\n===Experience===\nAs with most other AEG games, experience was a major factor in the game's progression. Experienced crew usually got stronger and costlier. Since ''7th Sea'' had a lax uniqueness rule, usually experienced crew ended up becoming unique. Experienced crew sometimes ended up changing factions (''Such as the experienced versions of killed crew becoming Black Freighter members'') or gained some secret society allegiance.\n\n*Note that experienced crew could simply be hired without requiring their original version to already be in play, unlike evolved [[Pok\u00e9mon]] for example.\n\n==History of ''7th Sea''==\nDuring the lifetime of ''7th Sea'', both the RPG and the CCG had a very loyal following. Players would often ask for a specific result in a storyline tournament while offering bounty to anyone who achieved it.\nThe game may be cancelled, but a following of the game still exists with tournaments in major events and custom cards{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.\n\n===Expansions===\nThe first base set of ''7th Sea'' offered 6 factions for player to choose from, but later expansions revealed more factions. The game saw two more base sets and a final online-only set at its closing.\n\n*''No Quarter'' (Original base set, featuring factions: Crimson Rogers, Explorers, Sea Dogs, Brotherhood, Montaigne, Castillian. 1999, 323 cards. Set icon: white cannon in profile on a black background.

Set icon: white sail on a pale blue background. Winner of the 1999 Origins Award for ''Best Card Game Expansion or Supplement''.<ref name=\"1999Origins\"/>)\n*''Broadsides'' (Identical reprint of ''No Quarter'', except for six faction-specific cards. 1999, 323 cards. Set icon: white crossbones on green background.)\n*''Shifting Tides'' (Second expansion, featuring factions: Vesten, Montaigne. 1999, 161 cards. Set icon: white crown on pale red background.)\n*''Scarlet Seas'' (Third expansion, featuring factions: Crimson Rogers, Sea Dogs. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white crossed cutlasses on purple background.)\n*''Black Sails'' (Fourth expansion, featuring faction: Black Freighter. 2000, 54 cards. Set icon: black sail on white background. Instead of randomized boosters, this expansion was sold in 50-card fixed distribution boosters.)\n*''Fate's Debt'' (Fifth expansion, featuring factions: the Brotherhood, Corsairs. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white cannon in profile on a blue background.)\n*''Reaper's Fee'' (Sixth expansion, featuring factions: Castillians, Vesten. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white crossbones on black background. Probably the hardest set to currently locate.)\n*''Horizon's Edge'' (Seventh expansion, featuring factions: the Explorers, the Gosse's Gentlemen. 115 cards. Set icon: white crossed cutlasses on red background.)\n*''Iron Shadow'' (623 cards. The second revision of the base set was arguably the biggest release of the game since it contained all the ships and captains while also having new versions of older cards to make them more playable and a new card layout. From this set forward, the use of set icons was discontinued in favor of printing the set's name at the bottom edge of each of its cards.)\n*''Syrneth Secret'' (Eighth expansion, featuring factions: the Brotherhood, Montaigne. 2001, 169 cards.)\n*''Parting Shot'' (54 cards. The final set of ''7th Sea'' was released only in an online form and mainly to close the storyline and balance the factions. A Final gift from AEG to its loyal customers.)\n\n===Ghost Ship: The Death of a Game===\nAlthough ''7th Sea'' seemed to be going very well sales-wise, there were some things that began to spell the end of the game. They were either easily avoidable or common blunders that have been known to end the life of many [[collectible card game]]s.\n*The third release of the base set saw the reprint of many older cards with new abilities to increase their playability. While many players saw this as a good move (because it effectively increased their card base), others had a hard time keeping track of the changes while others didn't want to waste money on new versions of cards they already had.\n*A series of storyline tournaments in which the players themselves would mark a faction for death, The Gosse Faction was selected. Many players incorrectly believed this meant that no more Gosse crew and Gosse specific cards would appear in the game. \n*Late in its lifespan, 7th Sea also opted for \"facelift\", meaning, cards were reprinted, keeping 99% of the format, but with whole art design and background across. Conceptually this was a good move, but in practice it seemed to tire players to: adjusting to the new art, getting new copies of older cards to match new cards, etc.\n*A minor complaint arose in the last set being printed in the wrong size.\n*''7th Sea''''s demise came with the success of AEG's new ''[[Warlord: Saga of the Storm]] CCG''. AEG lacked the resources to support ''L5R'', ''Warlord'' and ''7th Sea'', and as ''7th Sea'' was the least successful of the three, it was retired to free up resources.\n\n===Present===\nThe popularity of ''7th Sea''&nbsp;\u2013 like that of related games such as ''[[Doomtown]]'' or ''[[Rage (collectible card game)|Rage]]''&nbsp;\u2013 has waned, and new cards are no longer produced. However, many players continue to play in tournaments and even design new cards and sets.\n\nBecause the RPG is maintained, there is still interest in the setting and a number of websites continue to support the CCG as well as the RPG.\n\nThe game has also been ported to [[OCTGN]] for online play.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.7thSea.info 7th Sea CCG fan site] at [http://www.7thSea.info 7thSea.info]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:7th Sea (Collectible Card Game)}}\n[[Category:Card games introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Collectible card games]]\n[[Category:Alderac Entertainment Group games]]\n[[Category:Origins Award winners]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1999 collectible card game}}\n{{Infobox Game |  subject_name= 7th Sea\n|  image_link= \n|  image_caption=\n|  designer=[[Dan Verssen]], David Williams, Erik Yaple\n|  publisher= [[Alderac Entertainment Group]]\n|  players= 2\n|  setup_time= \n|  playing_time= Approx 45 min\n|  complexity= \n|  strategy= \n|  random_chance= Some\n|  skills= [[Collectible card game|Card playing]]<br>[[Mathematics|Arithmetic]]<br>Basic Reading Ability\n|  footnotes=\n}}\n\n'''''7th Sea''''' is an out-of-print [[collectible card game]] (CCG) produced by [[Alderac Entertainment Group]] (AEG). It was released in August 1999.<ref name=\"MILLER2\">{{Citation |last=Miller |first=John Jackson |title=Scrye Collectible Card Game Checklist & Price Guide, Second Edition | year=2003 |pages=492\u2013504 |postscript=.}}</ref> It is based on the ''Swashbuckling Adventures'' (formerly ''[[7th Sea (role-playing game)|7th Sea]]'') [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting.\n\n==Setting==\nIn the ''7th Sea CCG'', players take the role of naval captains in the [[fantasy]]-[[English Restoration|Restoration]] world of [[Th\u00e9ah]]. The game attempted to capture the feeling of a [[Hollywood]] pirate battle, complete with huge galleys, cannon-shot exchanges, and daring sea [[boarding (attack)|boardings]]. The game also has aspects of adventuring, treasure seeking, and the [[occult]].\n\nAs with most of the games of AEG, ''7th Sea'' had a complex storyline that affected and was influenced by the RPG setting. The results of tournaments would function to guide the storyline, and the storyline in turn would be used to create new cards.\n\n==Basics==\nThe game had many interesting concepts, including multiple winning conditions and a unique [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]]-themed combat system. The most important aspects were deck building, rules, and storyline.\n\n===Terms===\nThe game used a number of terms to describe elements of game play:\n\n* Faction: The many factions in the game corresponded either to the navies of Th\u00e9ah's different nations, pirates, or other independent fleets. Almost every crew character belonged to a faction, though some were unaligned and thus available to be used by any player.\n* [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]]: The leading character on a ship and most important crewmember. Captains followed special rules and were often central to the faction's storyline.\n* Ship: There were many ships with various abilities. Each player would use one ship for the entire game, as well as one captain and crew. Faction ships could only be used with a captain of the corresponding faction, while unaligned ships were available to anyone.\n* Crew: The rest of a ship's characters. A player could build a crew from all factions but the starting crew could not consist of a faction distinct from the ship.\n* Seas: The environment of the ship. Five pre-constructed cards delineated the game space.\n* Tack: When a card's ability was used for the turn, it was turned sideways and could not be used again. This was called 'tacking.' Tacking also resulted from damage.\n\n===Cards===\nThe six types of cards in ''7th Sea'' were: Actions, Crew, Adventures, Attachments, Chanteys and Ships. Each card is played differently as explained below.\n\n====Crew====\nThe most important card type in ''7th Sea'' is Crew.  This card type combines the traditional CCG concepts of both a resource type and a creature type.  Most CCGs use some kind of card type to produce resources that they subsequently use to gain other items. Usually those resources do not contribute to anything else. Examples of this are ''lands'' from ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' and ''holdings'' from ''[[Legend of the Five Rings Collectible Card Game|Legend of the Five Rings]]''. Most games also have some kind of creature card that provides offence and defense, like M:TG's creatures and ''[[Doomtown]]'''s Dudes. The game combined both while also providing multiple resource types and multiple combat procedures.\n\nCrew are the sailors you have hired to man the ship. Your Captain is a special and important kind of crew but he still performs in much the same way any other crew.\n\nCrew cards have the following statistics:\n\n** '''Cost:''' This is the amount of Influence (a type of resource, much like 'mana' in ''Magic: the Gathering'', or 'gold' in ''Legend of the Five Rings'') that you must provide to hire that crew and a measure of the card's overall power.\n** '''Faction:''' This symbol denoted the faction this crew belongs to. Crews without a symbol were unaligned.\n** '''Cannon:''' This statistic represented the crew's skill with a cannon. Its primary function was to perform cannon attacks upon other ships, simply by ''tacking'' a crew with more than 0 cannon ability.\n** '''Sailing:''' This statistic represented the crew's skill at sailing. A crew with sufficient sailing ability could ''tack'' to move the ship by one sea.\n** '''Adventuring:''' This statistic represented the crew's abilities in exploration and adventuring. This skill was mostly used to complete the requirements for ''Adventure'' cards, which would then bestow benefits upon that crewmember, the ship, or upon the player in other ways.\n** '''Influence:''' A measure of a crew's wealth, charisma, and diplomatic skills. Influence is required to hire more crew, and as a result, it is the most important ability in the first few turns of the game.\n** '''Swashbuckling:''' This measures the ability of the crew to repair the ship, in effect providing \"damage soak\" and how effective the crew is at [[M\u00eal\u00e9e]]. This translates as damage (hits) inflicted from a successful boarding attack.\n\nCrews also had various '''traits''' that allowed them to use certain cards. Some of the most common traits were:\n** '''Swordsman:''' The crew's skill in m\u00eal\u00e9e measured with a number (+1, +3 etc.). It translates as extra damage in boardings, and it allowed the crew to attach ''swordsman school'' attachment cards. All captains had some level of Swordsmanship.\n** '''Heroic/Villainous:''' These mutually exclusive traits revealed a crew's \"way of life\". There were various cards that were compatible with one of these two traits. For most of the history of the game, Villainous was considered a better trait to have on your Captain, since it gave access to easy card draw.\n** '''Sorcery:''' There were various types of sorcery in the world of Th\u00e9ah, and various crew could use them as attachments. However those attachments had a specific sorcery requirement of a certain level (0\u20132) that the crew had to have to attach them.\n\nEach ship had a limited amount of space for crew and that meant that smaller ships usually had lower resource and offensive capabilities. Usually this was balanced out with different benefits, like stronger special abilities and lower sailing costs.\nPlayers usually chose crew for their deck depending on their style and their faction's strengths, usually focusing on one or two statistics and maybe a trait (like sorcery). Crew with sailing or swashbuckling were always useful due to their innate use on movement and damage soak, however players also focused on more than one or two of the other three skills, Cannon, Adventuring, and Influence so as to be able to use specific cards more easily. Decks which focused on many skills together were the most difficult to build, however a good player then had a much greater versatility.\n\nCrew cards had a '''Punch''' as their boarding attack.\n\n====Actions====\nAction cards are the surprises you can spring on an unsuspecting opponent. They are one-use cards that have some immediate effect.\nIn ''7th Sea'', action cards had two costs. One was for the player and the other for his target (the canceling cost) and it was in the form of '''Skill: number'''. Costs are paid by tacking one or more crew with the appropriate skill, until the number is fulfilled.\nThe canceling cost was there for the target of the action, and it allowed him to cancel the action by paying it. Thus some pretty powerful cards could be balanced by having a lower canceling cost. Cost and cancel need not use the same skill.\n\nAction cards came in two types, Acts and Reacts.\n'''Acts''' are cards a player used in his turn. They usually worked to provide some unexpected effect, such as a combined cannon attack or an unstoppable boarding.\n'''Reacts''' are the much more common form of action cards. They can only be played on specific triggers such as an augment to a cannon attack, or suffering hits instead of a boarding attack.\n\nAll decks employed action cards, and usually the more aggressive decks employed a greater number.\n\nAction cards' boarding attack could either be a '''Dagger''' or a '''Slash'''.\n\n====Attachments====\nAttachment cards are default enhancing cards for your other cards (the other being adventures). After the player pays the cost, he chooses an appropriate card to attach it to. Usual targets for attachments were:\n** Crew: Attachments ranged from pistols and earrings, to parrots and spells.\n** Ship: Ship attachments usually modified the ship in some way, such as a treasure hold, better sails, figureheads (usually specific to factions) etc. Some ship attachments had the drawback that they took up ''crew space''.\n** Sea: Sea attachments usually were ports, monsters, and allies you could employ. These often required a specific sea.\n\nUsually attachments had some kind of '''trait''' that classified it, such as ''Item'', ''Henchman'', ''Pet'', ''Swordsman School'', etc. For example, a ''pistol'' would be an '''Item''' while ''Rum Runners'' would be an '''Ally'''. These traits were used to specify targets for other cards.\n\nIn later sets requirements for attachments became more frequent. Those requirements ranged from a skill level (Cannon 4), to the alliance to a faction (e.g. Crimson Rogers), to the existence of a trait (Villainous), or a trait at a specific level (e.g. Porte 2).\nDue to the speed of attachments, they usually had a much lower reward/cost ratio than '''adventures'''.\n\nAttachment cards' boarding attack was a '''Club'''.\n\n====Adventures====\nThis is the second type of card a crew could attach. Adventures are the usual stuff of [[Hollywood]] pirate or naval adventure films: ancient relics, captured damsels, sea monsters, etc.\nThese cards were almost exclusively completed by the use of the '''adventuring''' skill and were defined by the following:\n** '''Seas away:''' Adventures did not automatically attach to a crew, but rather to a sea. When played, an adventure was placed a number of seas away from your ship (usually 1 to 3). To complete an adventure, your ship had to be on the same sea as the Adventure. This served as a balance factor for the more powerful or cheap adventures by forcing you to sail to the target sea to get it (something not always easy when opponents were waiting in the middle)\n** '''Native sea:''' Most adventures had one specific sea in which it was much easier to complete them. This could range from a single point of adventuring lower for low-end adventures, to several points lower for the more costly ones. Then other adventures were easier to attach to specific crew, such a ''Villainous'', ''Skeletal'' or ''Rose and Cross'' crew member.\n** '''Reward:''' Adventure rewards usually increased a skill by a number of points with a high reward/cost ratio. However, in later expansions, Adventures started giving various effects, such as traits or special abilities.\n\nAlthough Adventures were attached to a Sea, they were only available to the player that attached them (barring other card effects). This was a nice way to \"archive\" uncompleted adventures without cluttering your hand. However, some cards punished rampant adventure archiving.\n\nAdventure Cards' boarding attack was a '''Thrust'''.\n\n====Chanteys====\nChanteys were introduced later in the life of the game. They signified various global changes in the world of Th\u00e9ah in the form of popular songs used by the populace.\nChanteys were similar to actions. However their effects, contrary to action cards, were permanent. They could either affect only the player or an opponent, or it could affect all players.\nChanteys worked in a way similar to terrains in ''Legend of the Five Rings'' or Omens in ''[[Legend of the Burning Sands]]''. That is, only one Chantey could be in effect at any one time. At any time that a Chantey came into play, the former Chantey was discarded. More powerful Chanteys had, instead of a cancel cost, a discard cost that any player could use to get rid of the Chantey.\n\n====Ships====\nThese cards are special in that they are not in the deck but rather start in play, along with your captain.\nMost ships belonged to a specific faction and could only be used by matching captains.\nEach ship was defined by its faction, ''crew maximum,'' and ''sailing cost''.\n\nCrew maximum was used to determine the maximum number of crew you could have on your ship. Ships with a large crew maximum tended to be more powerful in the late game, but more vulnerable at the start.\n\nSailing cost shows how easy a ship is to maneuver. Some action cards didn't use a fixed cost, but relied instead upon a ship's sailing cost (sometimes modified up or down). The advantage of a small ship was the fact that it could fill fast and press the offensive quickly.\n\n====Seas====\nThe five Seas were always the same. They came with each starter box and were placed in a specific order. Seas had no specific abilities other than forming a game space for ships to move and for being the target of cards. Each captain has a specific ''starting sea'' which was usually chosen as a result of the storylines. New players often wondered where the other two seas which are not represented with cards were. The answer lies in the setting of the world of Th\u00e9ah. The 6th sea is protected by a wall of flame and thus difficult to access, and the 7th sea is a mythical place and very hard to find. Neither of these two 'extra' seas played any major role in the card game.\n\n===Deck construction===\nPlayers make many choices when designing a deck. They must keep in mind both the captain's and ship's abilities, the faction's strengths and weaknesses, and the strategy they want to use. Even with the same Captain and Ship, it is possible to make completely different deck types.\n\n*Restrictions\n** A player must first choose a captain. The captain determines the faction.\n** A player must choose a ship of the same faction as the captain, or an unaligned ship.\n** The deck may not be less than 60 cards including captain and ship.\n** A deck may not have more than 3 copies of a single card.\n\n==Strategies==\nThere are many different concepts for a deck and many different ways to achieve them, depending mainly on the faction and secondarily on the ship.\n\nFor example, the Castillians were mainly a boarding faction (which means they liked to attack in m\u00eal\u00e9e) but with the right construction it was possible to attack without boarding (by making ramming attacks and limited cannon). The original Castillian ship was a hulking galley but in later expansions they got a small fast ship that allowed them to perform a tactic which some called 'speed boarding'.\n\nSome sample deck foci are:\n* 'Atomic Cannon': These decks focused on sinking the opponent's ship with one big cannon attack. They usually had many adventures and actions to evade boardings.\n* 'Plinging': These decks focused on producing many small attacks, slowly forcing the opponent to tack all their cards, rendering them unable to take action against you. This was mainly achieved with cannon, but there were variations with spells.\n* Boarding: These decks focused on catching the opponent and entering boarding. They usually used big ships with lots of crew and had a nice spread of cards.\n* 'Speed Boarding': These decks focused on catching the opponent in a boarding during the first or early second turn. If they couldn't, they usually lost. The ships these decks used were small and had small sailing requirements.\n* 'Control': These rare decks tried to complete the secondary control victory condition. They were the harder decks to construct competitively.\n\nEven within these broad categories, there were many ways to carry out any given strategy. For example, a boarding deck might use only the captain to deal damage while the rest of the crew absorbed hits, or it might use small attacks with pistols and weak characters or it could just have a nice spread. One could use boarding action cards to enhance the attacks or to just absorb damage. One could also use attachments to win the attacks more easily, or adventures to inflict more damage etc.\n\nCombining various strategies was not uncommon, such as a boarding deck that used a big cannon attack before the boarding to soften the enemy.\n\n==Game play==\n===Start===\nAt the start of each game, players used their captain's starting Wealth statistic to recruit their starting crew. Since the starting crew could be anyone from the deck, it was a nice tactic to have some backup crew in the deck for specific situations (much like a [[sideboard]], only built-in). A captain's starting Wealth usually ranged from 7 to 10. Players typically chose a crew with high Influence statistics to start a game, although speed decks often preferred Sailing, Swashbuckling, and Cannon.\n\n===Phases===\nEach turn has 3 phases. The first phase is used to determine which player goes first; the second phase, the most important one, is where the game is actually played and the final phase is the end of turn were all resources are replenished (by untacking and drawing cards). Unlike in many games where a player performs as many actions as he wishes before passing to the next player, in ''7th Sea'' each player performs only one action, and players pass to one another until none choose to take further actions.\n\nIn the main phase, starting with the first player, each player performs an action or passes and then play proceeded clockwise to the next player. Actions can be playing an Action card from one's hand, using a printed ability on a card in play, or performing an action innate to the game like hiring crew, or performing a cannon attack.\n\nOnce all players pass consecutively, the turn ends.\n\nThe innate actions all players can perform in ''7th Sea'' are:\n*'''Moving:''' By ''tacking'' Crew to produce Sailing points to equal or exceed the ship's sailing cost, a player can move his ship to an adjacent sea.\n*'''Cannon Attack:''' By producing any number of cannon with a single Crew, a player can inflict that number of hits on a ship in the same sea.\n*'''Hire Crew:''' If the ship has not reached its crew maximum, a player can reveal a crew from his hand and then produce equal or more influence than that crew's cost to recruit it.\n*'''Begin a boarding:''' By producing sailing equal to the ship's sailing cost, a player can attempt to begin a boarding against a ship in the same sea.\n*'''Complete an adventure:''' While in the same sea as one of his own adventures, a player can play all costs and attach the adventure to an appropriate target.\n\n===Boardings===\n''Boarding'' is considered the most interesting phase of the game. Once begun, the involved ships lock together with their crews engaged in \"cinematic m\u00eal\u00e9e battle\". While a player can escape a ship's cannons by running away, the only ways to disengage from boarding are with both players' consent or with a card effect. Accordingly, boarding decks are rewarded for the difficulty of engagement.\n\nBoarding occurs within the main phase of the game. During boarding, the rest of the game stops, so players can no longer play acts. Boarding consists of alternating ''boarding attacks'' between the two players involved. In turn, each boarding attack includes choosing a crew and sending it forward to attack (i.e. jumping to the other ship and causing some trouble). The defender can choose either to stand and take the hits (equal to the other crew's damage plus swordsman level) or to send someone forward to defend.\n\nEach card in the deck has three boarding boxes.  The large ''attack box'' is first, with two smaller ''defend boxes'' below it. Each boarding box has one of the following actions: [C] ''(Club)'', [P] ''(Punch)'', [D] ''(Dagger)'', [S] ''(Slash)'', or [T] ''(Thrust)''. The attacker starts by playing a card from his hand to initiate his attack.  If possible, the defender resists by playing a matching defence card from his hand (i.e. the defender's card must have a ''defend box'' matching the attacker's ''attack box''). The defender immediately counter-attacks with the action in the ''attack box'' of that defending card.  The original attacker then defends himself against the counter-attack. In effect, the exchange is reminiscent of a continuous cinematic ''\"Thrust-Slash-Parry-Riposte\"'' m\u00eal\u00e9e. The m\u00eal\u00e9e ends when either player cannot defend against an attack (i.e. the player's hand is empty, he chose the order of his attacks wrongly, or he has a bad boarding hand). The last attacking player wins the boarding attack, and the loser suffers ''hits''.\n\nBoardings are interesting both because defenders can inflict hits and because the crews locked in m\u00eal\u00e9e suffer hits first.  Such early hits risk loss of either crews' captain (and thus the game) while the crew may still be in otherwise prime condition.  Because of this, a player may choose to avoid starting a boarding attack by passing or by playing a ''react'' (e.g. firing a musket or getting drunk). When both players perform a boarding attack, they draw 3 cards each and the attacks continue.\n\nSince boarding boxes are spread in different card types, boarding decks usually have a wide variety of card types, unlike cannon and victory decks with few (two or three) card types. Thus, dedicated cannon decks can be caught helplessly in a boarding.\n\n===Death and destruction===\nShips are fragile things. When a ship suffers hits, the crew is responsible for fixing it by tacking or sinking (getting killed). Hits cannot be ignored. When a captain sinks to absorb hits you lose the game. Players sometimes employed action cards to help them absorb hits.\n\n===Victory===\nIn ''7th Sea'', there were two roads to victory. You could either sink all enemy ships, or perform a control victory (play several expensive cards, one in each sea).\n\n==Storyline==\nThe game was a heavily story influenced game. Its factions had ties to specific RPG elements and rivalries and alliances occurred between them as the story progressed. The first story arc saw many serious conflicts, not necessarily all tied together. Storyline deaths were not uncommon (they didn't have some specific effect in the game), and the game even saw the death of an entire faction.\n\n===Factions===\n*'''Crimson Rogers:''' Bloodthirsty pirates led by the cruel and ruthless Captain Reis, the Crimson Rogers flew red sails and were feared more than any other faction, save perhaps the Black Freighter. Their motto was '''''No Banter, No Barter, No Quarter'''''. ''The Crimson Rogers have excellent cannon, adequate boarding and adventuring capabilities, but low influence. They are mostly '''Villainous'''''.\n*'''Sea Dogs:''' More [[privateer]]s than pirates, the Sea Dogs were sponsored by Avalon (a nation inspired by mythic England). They angered the Crimson Rogers, leading to the destruction of their ship and the near-death of their first captain Berek, the luckiest man alive. Bloody Bonnie McGee took the helm and sacrificed her life for a chance to take down Reis. ''The Sea Dogs have high influence and jack of all trades crew, without any particular specialisation. They dabble in '''Glamour''' sorcery and are primarily '''Heroic''', being the only faction in the game with no villainous crew.''\n*'''Castillians:''' Sailors from the nation of Castille (based on renaissance Spain), this faction was originally the enemy of the Montaigne, with whose nation they were at war. They later allied with the Montaigne faction to save their captain, Orduno. They were also allied with the Inquisition (the punitive, warlike arm of the church). ''Castillians are mainly a boarding faction with some cannon capabilities.''\n*'''Montaigne:''' Montaigne (based on renaissance France) is the wealthiest nation and as a result they excel at many things. They usually employ Musketeers for sword fights and their fighting style employs the most tricks. Their original captain, the General, was a mercenary soldier from Eisen who was promoted as a pirate hunter. Their secondary captain was mainly preoccupied with bringing Montaigne's rivals, the Castillians, back in line. ''Montaigne have many good swordsmen and fighting tricks while also being very fast on the offensive due to their high influence.''\n*'''The Brotherhood:''' The Brotherhood are escaped convicts from a Castillian prison who formed their own pirate nation. Their original captain, Allende, was recaptured, but later freed by Berek, who became the Brotherhood's new captain following his escape from Reis. ''The Brotherhood has high adventuring, giving them flexibility, but also making them weak to start, needing time to complete adventures. Later ships and captains with powerful abilities grant them greater playability.''\n*'''The Explorers:''' The explorers were neither pirates nor allied with any nation. Their captain, Guy McCormic was obsessed with finding ancient Syrneth artifacts (the remnants of a lost high-tech civilization). At some point, after he sacrificed a crewmember to his passion, the rest of the crew mutinied and overcame him. ''Explorers have very high adventuring and sailing and are very good at escaping trouble.''\n*'''The Corsairs:''' The only faction hailing from the Crescent Empire (inspired by the [[Ottoman Empire]]), the Corsairs are led by Kheired Din, a ruthless slavemaster who sacrificed his own crew to get results. The corsairs were hit hard story wise when their slaves rebelled and their leader, Espero, turned out to be a descendant of the lost Castillian royal bloodline. The second corsair ship was led by Ernesto Castillus (AKA Espero) whose actions were critical to the end of the storyline. ''Corsairs are very good at boarding, and have a very high damage absorption''.\n*'''The Gosse's Gentlemen:''' A former legend once again picks up the sword and sails the seven seas along with his band of heroic gentlemen-pirates. Gosse had sworn to bring down the Black Freighter captained by the man who killed his wife. He achieved this aim, with the help of Ernesto Castillus, the sacrifice of his ship, and his own life. ''The Gosse had very high swashbuckling, and as a result they were very good at boardings, and to some extent, damage absorption''.\n*'''The Vesten:''' The Vestenmannavnjar or Vesten (based on [[Viking]]s of the late [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]]) are raiders and warriors of an old tradition. Bitter over the betrayal by their greedy kinsmen, they hunt and loot any Vendel Trading ship they caught. Eventually betrayed from within, their captain Yngvild survived and hunted for revenge. The next captain was led by their betrayer and rival, Jorund. ''In keeping with their Viking inspiration, the Vesten specialise in boarding. Their cannon abilities are non-existent, but they make up for this with large amounts of damage-absorption''.\n*'''The Black Freighter:''' The undead of ''7th Sea'' sail on a massive ghost ship, the Black Freighter that gives them their name. Their original Captain, Necros was brought back to avenge his death at the hands of Gosse. The original crew consisted of undead versions of normal crew (the faction can't recruit non Black Freighter crew) and resurrected crew from the other factions. The first story arc ended with the death of Necros and his ship. ''The Black Freighter was an interesting faction since it relied on skeletal crew and fear cards. They could go for either boarding or cannon and usually mixed both''.\n\nThere were also a number of \"unaligned\" crew who belonged to no faction and so were usable by any Captain. Usually these were generic pirates, but some were given quite a bit of character and even included a handful of captains.\n\n===Story arc===\nThe first story arc began with minor events and conflicts between the various factions and gradually progressed with events of greater importance which ended up changing the state of the world. Notable events include the rivalry between the Sea Dogs and the Crimson Rogers, which climaxed with the apparent death of Captain Reis at the hands of the Sea Dogs second captain; Bloody Bonnie McGee. There was also the appearance of the Black Freighter and its later defeat at the hands of Phillip Gosse by the sacrifice of his whole faction. And finally the Corsair's search for the final Syrneth switch which revealed the hidden island, Cabora, and their destiny.\n\nThe second story arc didn't have enough time to be fully fleshed out but it started with the Montaigne Revolution and the capture of their former emperor.\n\n===Experience===\nAs with most other AEG games, experience was a major factor in the game's progression. Experienced crew usually got stronger and costlier. Since ''7th Sea'' had a lax uniqueness rule, usually experienced crew ended up becoming unique. Experienced crew sometimes ended up changing factions (''Such as the experienced versions of killed crew becoming Black Freighter members'') or gained some secret society allegiance.\n\n*Note that experienced crew could simply be hired without requiring their original version to already be in play, unlike evolved [[Pok\u00e9mon]] for example.\n\n==History of ''7th Sea''==\nDuring the lifetime of ''7th Sea'', both the RPG and the CCG had a very loyal following. Players would often ask for a specific result in a storyline tournament while offering bounty to anyone who achieved it.\nThe game may be cancelled, but a following of the game still exists with tournaments in major events and custom cards{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.\n\n===Expansions===\nThe first base set of ''7th Sea'' offered 6 factions for player to choose from, but later expansions revealed more factions. The game saw two more base sets and a final online-only set at its closing.\n\n*''No Quarter'' (Original base set, featuring factions: Crimson Rogers, Explorers, Sea Dogs, Brotherhood, Montaigne, Castillian. 1999, 323 cards. Set icon: white cannon in profile on a black background. Winner of the 1999 [[Origins Award]]s for  ''Best Trading Card Game'' and ''Best Graphic Presentation of a Card Game or Supplement''.<ref name=\"1999Origins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1999/list-of-winners |title=Origins Award Winners (1999) |publisher=Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505171407/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1999/list-of-winners |archivedate=2009-05-05 }}</ref>)\n*''Strange Vistas'' (First expansion, featuring factions: the Corsairs, Gosse's Gentlemen. 1999, 161 cards. Set icon: white sail on a pale blue background. Winner of the 1999 Origins Award for ''Best Card Game Expansion or Supplement''.<ref name=\"1999Origins\"/>)\n*''Broadsides'' (Identical reprint of ''No Quarter'', except for six faction-specific cards. 1999, 323 cards. Set icon: white crossbones on green background.)\n*''Shifting Tides'' (Second expansion, featuring factions: Vesten, Montaigne. 1999, 161 cards. Set icon: white crown on pale red background.)\n*''Scarlet Seas'' (Third expansion, featuring factions: Crimson Rogers, Sea Dogs. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white crossed cutlasses on purple background.)\n*''Black Sails'' (Fourth expansion, featuring faction: Black Freighter. 2000, 54 cards. Set icon: black sail on white background. Instead of randomized boosters, this expansion was sold in 50-card fixed distribution boosters.)\n*''Fate's Debt'' (Fifth expansion, featuring factions: the Brotherhood, Corsairs. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white cannon in profile on a blue background.)\n*''Reaper's Fee'' (Sixth expansion, featuring factions: Castillians, Vesten. 2000, 161 cards. Set icon: white crossbones on black background. Probably the hardest set to currently locate.)\n*''Horizon's Edge'' (Seventh expansion, featuring factions: the Explorers, the Gosse's Gentlemen. 115 cards. Set icon: white crossed cutlasses on red background.)\n*''Iron Shadow'' (623 cards. The second revision of the base set was arguably the biggest release of the game since it contained all the ships and captains while also having new versions of older cards to make them more playable and a new card layout. From this set forward, the use of set icons was discontinued in favor of printing the set's name at the bottom edge of each of its cards.)\n*''Syrneth Secret'' (Eighth expansion, featuring factions: the Brotherhood, Montaigne. 2001, 169 cards.)\n*''Parting Shot'' (54 cards. The final set of ''7th Sea'' was released only in an online form and mainly to close the storyline and balance the factions. A Final gift from AEG to its loyal customers.)\n\n===Ghost Ship: The Death of a Game===\nAlthough ''7th Sea'' seemed to be going very well sales-wise, there were some things that began to spell the end of the game. They were either easily avoidable or common blunders that have been known to end the life of many [[collectible card game]]s.\n*The third release of the base set saw the reprint of many older cards with new abilities to increase their playability. While many players saw this as a good move (because it effectively increased their card base), others had a hard time keeping track of the changes while others didn't want to waste money on new versions of cards they already had.\n*A series of storyline tournaments in which the players themselves would mark a faction for death, The Gosse Faction was selected. Many players incorrectly believed this meant that no more Gosse crew and Gosse specific cards would appear in the game. \n*Late in its lifespan, 7th Sea also opted for \"facelift\", meaning, cards were reprinted, keeping 99% of the format, but with whole art design and background across. Conceptually this was a good move, but in practice it seemed to tire players to: adjusting to the new art, getting new copies of older cards to match new cards, etc\n*A minor complaint arose in the last set being printed in the wrong size.\n*''7th Sea''''s demise came with the success of AEG's new ''[[Warlord: Saga of the Storm]] CCG''. AEG lacked the resources to support ''L5R'', ''Warlord'' and ''7th Sea'', and as ''7th Sea'' was the least successful of the three, it was retired to free up resources.\n\n===Present===\nThe popularity of ''7th Sea''&nbsp;\u2013 like that of related games such as ''[[Doomtown]]'' or ''[[Rage (collectible card game)|Rage]]''&nbsp;\u2013 has waned, and new cards are no longer produced. However, many players continue to play in tournaments and even design new cards and sets.\n\nBecause the RPG is maintained, there is still interest in the setting and a number of websites continue to support the CCG as well as the RPG.\n\nThe game has also been ported to [[OCTGN]] for online play.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[http://www.7thSea.info 7th Sea CCG fan site] at [http://www.7thSea.info 7thSea.info]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:7th Sea (Collectible Card Game)}}\n[[Category:Card games introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Collectible card games]]\n[[Category:Alderac Entertainment Group games]]\n[[Category:Origins Award winners]]\n", "name_user": "Nealbo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: etc  \u2192 etc.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7th_Sea_(collectible_card_game)"}

Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings: seven from Alick's previous marriage, seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage and three full sisters, though one, Jemima, died at birth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra Station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family later settled in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> When the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the [[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist [[Diane Barwick]] met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna. She was buried in Mooroopna local cemetery.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|white-1993|\u03b1}} White 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p179\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 179</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{ref|mollison-1978|\u03b3}} Mollison 1978</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p180\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 180</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p181\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 181</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p182\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 182</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goodall-p126\">{{ref|goodall-1996|\u03b4}} Goodall 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\">{{cite news|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/our_aim/v14s11_a_0.pdf|department=The Harvest Field|title=Barham|last=Crebbin|first=M.

Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings: seven from Alick's previous marriage, seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage and three full sisters, though one, Jemima, died at birth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra Station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family later settled in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> When the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the ''[[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist [[Diane Barwick]] met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna. She was buried in Mooroopna local cemetery.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|white-1993|\u03b1}} White 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p179\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 179</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{ref|mollison-1978|\u03b3}} Mollison 1978</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p180\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 180</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p181\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 181</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p182\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 182</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goodall-p126\">{{ref|goodall-1996|\u03b4}} Goodall 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\">{{cite news|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/our_aim/v14s11_a_0.pdf|department=The Harvest Field|title=Barham|last=Crebbin|first=M.

The whole column, commanded by captain Richard Passaportis,{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}} contained 20 Unimogs, protected by [[Eland armoured car|Eland-90]] armoured cars of the [[Rhodesian Armoured Corps]].{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=116}} A detachment of [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|QF 25-pounder]] guns was also part of the column.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}} The Selous Scouts were supported by 100 men of the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (2 Commando, 3 Commando and ''Support Commando''{{sfn|Wessels|Scheepers|2018|p=160}}), air-dropped 10-kilometers away from the camp.{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=116}}\n\n== First day ==\nBefore attacking the base, the RSF ground forces had to cross a river. The artillery was bogged down and the guerilla was alerted of the size of the column.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}} The column was further delayed by ZANLA fire.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=111}}{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}} The first wave of the Selous Scouts began clearing the trenches but the rest of the column only arrive late in the afternoon.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}} Meanwhile, the airdropped Rhodesian Light Infantry joined the battle and Mpunzarima, a key ZANLA military leader, was killed.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=111}} At dawn, Nhongo distributed [[marijuana]] to some of his troops, to reduce their stress.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=112}} The Rhodesian troops were harassed during the night by [[RPG-7]]s, [[recoilless-rifle]]s and [[mortars]].{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=132}}\n\n== Second day ==\nRSF renewed its assault. Nhongo personally went to the front to increase the moral of his troops, using a big stick to hit the reluctants.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=112}} Guided by a [[Westland Lynx]] helicopter, [[Hawker Hunter]] attack jets neutralized ZANLA fortifications in Hill 774. The position was taken at 3 pm by a troop of the Selous Scouts.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=133}} [[English Electric Canberra]] bombers also bombed the anti-aircraft positions.{{sfn|Moorcraft|McLaughlin|2008|p=116}}\n\n== Third day ==\nDuring the night, RSF artillery fired at ZANLA positions, not to make damages but to prevent the partisans to rest.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=112}} At 10 am, two troops of Selous Scouts and a RLI section (around 100 men) led an assault to Monte Cassino. The summit was taken after the partisans had retreated, as was Hill 761.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=136}} At the end of that day, Nhongo ordered his fighters to retreat{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=113}} During the late night, FRELIMO sent three or more [[T-34]] or [[T-54]] tanks{{sfn|Wessels|Scheepers|2018|p=160}}{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=112}}{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=136}} and a squad of infantry to support the Rhodesian rebels but RSF 25-pounders quickly reacted, guided by [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Rhodesian SAS]], and the tanks retreated after the lead tank was put out of action.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=112}}{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=136}}\n\n== Consequences ==\nThe Rhodesian force withdrew on the next morning,{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=136}} taking captured equipment with them.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=135}} To avoid retaliation attacks from Mozambique, the Rhodesian Air Force bombed FRELIMO facilities but one Camberra and one Hunter were shut down.{{sfn|Baxter|2011|p=136}} The battle had no consequences on the Lancaster House discussions.{{sfn|Tendi|2020|p=110}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===External links===\n* {{cite web|first=Peter|last=Baxter|url=http://peterbaxterafrica.com/index.php/2012/10/20/selous-scouts-operation-miracle-26-september-1979/ |title=Selous Scouts Operation Miracle}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book |title=Rhodesian Air Force Operations with Air Strike Log |last=Geldenhuys |first=Preller |authorlink1=Preller Geldenhuys |location=Durban, South Africa |publisher=Just Done Productions Publishing  |isbn=978-1-920169-61-9 |date=13 July 2007 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Tendi|first= Blessing-Miles|date=2020|title= The Longest Time.
