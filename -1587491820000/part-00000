{"title_page": "Software verification and validation", "text_new": "{{IEEE software documents}}\nIn [[software project management]], [[software testing]], and [[software engineering]], '''[[verification and validation]]''' ('''V&V''') is the process of checking that a software system meets specifications and that it fulfills its intended purpose. It may also be referred to as [[software quality control]].  It is normally the responsibility of [[software testing|software testers]] as part of the [[software development process|software development lifecycle]]. In simple terms, software verification is: \"Assuming we should build X, does our software achieve its goals without any bugs or gaps?\" On the other hand, software validation is: \"Was X what we should have built? Does X meet the high level requirements?\"\n\n==Definitions==\nVerification and validation are not the same things, although they are often confused. [[Barry Boehm|Boehm]] succinctly expressed the difference as<ref name=\"PhamSoft99\">{{cite book |title=Software Reliability |author=Pham, H. |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc |page=567 |year=1999 |isbn=9813083840 |quote=\"Software Validation. The process of ensuring that the software is performing the right process. Software Verification. The process of ensuring that the software is performing the process right.\" Likewise and also there: \"In short, Boehm (3) expressed the difference between the software verification and software validation as follows: Verification: \u2018\u2018Are we building the product right?\u2019\u2019 Validation: \u2018\u2018Are we building the right product?\u2019\u2019.\"}}</ref>\n* Verification: Are we building the product right?<!--This definition is correct and sourced to Boehm. Do not change to the competing definition-->\n* Validation: Are we building the right product?<!--This definition is correct and sourced to Boehm. Do not change to the competing definition-->\n\n\"Building the product right\" checks that the ''specifications'' are correctly implemented by the system while \"building the right product\" refers back to the ''user's needs''. In some contexts, it is required to have written requirements for both as well as formal procedures or protocols for determining compliance.\n\nBuilding the product right implies the use of the Requirements Specification as input for the next phase of the development process, the design process, the output of which is the Design Specification. Then, it also implies the use of the Design Specification to feed the construction process. Every time the output of a process correctly implements its input specification, the software product is one step closer to final verification. If the output of a process is incorrect, the developers are not building the product the stakeholders want correctly. This kind of verification is called \"artifact or specification verification\".\n\nBuilding the right product implies creating a Requirements Specification that contains the needs and goals of the stakeholders of the software product. If such artifact is incomplete or wrong, the developers will not be able to build the product the stakeholders want. This is a form of \"artifact or specification validation\".\n\nNote:  Verification begins before Validation and then they run in parallel until the software product is released.{{Clarify|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Software verification ===\nIt would imply to verify if the specifications are met by running the software but this is not possible (e. g., how can anyone know if the architecture/design/etc. are correctly implemented by running the software?). Only by reviewing its associated artifacts, someone can conclude if the specifications are met .reas\n\n=== Artifact or specification verification===\nThe output of each software development process stage can also be subject to verification when checked against its input specification (see the definition by CMMI below).\n\nExamples of artifact verification:\n* Of the design specification against the requirement specification: Do the architectural design, detailed design and database logical model specifications correctly implement the functional and non-functional requirement specifications?\n* Of the construction artifacts against the design specification: Do the source code, user interfaces and database physical model correctly implement the design specification?\n\n=== Software validation===\nSoftware validation checks that the software product satisfies or fits the intended use (high-level checking), i.e., the software meets the user requirements, not as specification artifacts or as needs of those who will operate the software only; but, as the needs of all the stakeholders (such as users, operators, administrators, managers, investors, etc.). There are two ways to perform software validation: internal and external. During internal software validation, it is assumed that the goals of the stakeholders were correctly understood and that they were expressed in the requirement artifacts precisely and comprehensively. If the software meets the requirement specification, it has been internally validated. External validation happens when it is performed by asking the stakeholders if the software meets their needs. Different software development methodologies call for different levels of user and stakeholder involvement and feedback; so, external validation can be a discrete or a continuous event. Successful final external validation occurs when all the stakeholders accept the software product and express that it satisfies their needs. Such final external validation requires the use of an [[acceptance testing|acceptance test]] which is a [[dynamic testing|dynamic test]].\n\nHowever, it is also possible to perform internal static tests to find out if it meets the requirements specification but that falls into the scope of static verification because the software is not running.\n\n=== Artifact or specification validation ===\nRequirements should be validated before the software product as a whole is ready (the waterfall development process requires them to be perfectly defined before design starts; but, iterative development processes do not require this to be so and allow their continual improvement).\n\nExamples of artifact validation:\n\n* User Requirements Specification validation: User requirements as stated in a document called User Requirements Specification are validated by checking if they indeed represent the will and goals of the stakeholders. This can be done by interviewing them and asking them directly (static testing) or even by releasing prototypes and having the users and stakeholders to assess them (dynamic testing).\n* User input validation: User input (gathered by any peripheral such as keyboard, bio-metric sensor, etc.) is [[data validation|validated]] by checking if the input provided by the software operators or users meet the domain rules and constraints (such as data type, range, and format).\n\n=== Validation vs. verification===\nAccording to the [[Capability Maturity Model]] (CMMI-SW v1.1),\n* Software Validation: The process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements. [IEEE-STD-610]\n* Software Verification: The process of evaluating software to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase. [IEEE-STD-610]\n\nValidation during the software development process can be seen as a form of User Requirements Specification validation; and, that at the end of the development process is equivalent to Internal and/or External Software validation. Verification, from CMMI's point of view, is evidently of the artifact kind.\n\nIn other words, software verification ensures that the output of each phase of the software development process effectively carry out what its corresponding input artifact specifies (requirement -> design -> software product), while software validation ensures that the software product meets the needs of all the stakeholders (therefore, the requirement specification was correctly and accurately expressed in the first place). Software verification ensures that \"you built it right\" and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the plans of the developers. Software validation ensures that \"you built the right thing\" and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the intended use and goals of the stakeholders.\n\nThis article has used the strict or [[Software verification#Narrow scope|narrow]] definition of verification.\n\nFrom a testing perspective:\n* Fault \u2013 wrong or missing function in the code.\n* Failure \u2013 the manifestation of a fault during execution. The software was not effective. It does not do \"what\" it is supposed to do.\n* Malfunction \u2013 according to its specification the system does not meet its specified functionality. The software was not efficient (it took too many resources such as CPU cycles, it used too much memory, performed too many I/O operations, etc.), it was not usable, it was not reliable, etc. It does not do something \"how\" it is supposed to do it.\n\n==Related concepts==\nBoth verification and validation are related to the concepts of [[Quality (business)|quality]] and of [[software quality assurance]]. By themselves, verification and validation do not guarantee software quality; planning, [[traceability]], configuration management and other aspects of software engineering are required.\n\nWithin the [[modeling and simulation]] (M&S) community, the definitions of verification, validation and accreditation are similar:\n\n* M&S Verification is the process of determining that a [[computer model]], simulation, or federation of models and simulations implementations and their associated data accurately represent the developer's conceptual description and specifications.<ref name=\"Missile Defense Agency\"/>\n* M&S Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model, simulation, or federation of models and simulations, and their associated data are accurate representations of the real world from the perspective of the intended use(s).<ref name=\"Missile Defense Agency\">{{Cite document\n  | year = 2008\n  | title = Department of Defense Documentation of Verification, Validation & Accreditation (VV&A) for Models and Simulations\n  | publisher = Missile Defense Agency\n  | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n* [[Accreditation]] is the formal certification that a model or simulation is acceptable to be used for a specific purpose.<ref name=\"Missile Defense Agency\"/>\nThe definition of M&S validation focuses on the accuracy with which the M&S represents the real-world intended use(s).  Determining the degree of M&S accuracy is required because all M&S are approximations of reality, and it is usually critical to determine if the degree of approximation is acceptable for the intended use(s).  This stands in contrast to software validation.\n\n==Classification of methods==\nIn [[mission-critical]] software systems, where flawless performance is absolutely necessary, [[formal methods]] may be used to ensure the correct operation of a system.<ref name=\"WangPrecise14\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Bi5BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA262 |chapter=Precise Documentation and Validation of Requirements |title=Formal Techniques for Safety-Critical Systems |author=Wang, C.-W. |author2=Ostroff, J.S. |author3=Hudon, S. |editor=Artho, C. |editor2=\u00d6lveczky, P.C. |publisher=Springer |pages=262\u2013279 |year=2014 |isbn=9783319054162 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> These formal methods can prove costly, however, representing as much as 80 percent of total software design cost.<ref name=\"KoopmanReli07\">{{cite book |chapter=Reliability, Safety, and Security in Everyday Embedded Systems |title=Dependable Computing |author=Koopman, P. |editor=Bondavelli, A. |editor2=Brasileiro, F. |editor3=Rajsbaum, S. |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75294-3_1 |isbn=978-3-540-75294-3}}</ref>\n\n===Test cases===\n{{main|Test case}}\nA test case is a tool used in the process. Test cases may be prepared for software verification and software validation to determine if the product was built according to the requirements of the user. Other methods, such as reviews, may be used early in the life cycle to provide for software validation.\n\n==Independent Verification and Validation==\nISVV stands for '''Independent Software Verification and Validation'''. ISVV is targeted at safety-critical [[software]] systems and aims to increase the quality of software products, thereby reducing risks and costs through the operational life of the software. ISVV provides assurance that software performs to the specified level of confidence and within its designed parameters and defined requirements.\n\nISVV activities are performed by independent engineering teams, not involved in the software development process, to assess the processes and the resulting products. The ISVV team independency is performed at three different levels: financial, managerial and technical.\n\nISVV goes far beyond \u201ctraditional\u201d verification and validation techniques, applied by development teams. While the latter aim to ensure that the software performs well against the nominal requirements, ISVV is focused on non-functional requirements such as robustness and reliability, and on conditions that can lead the software to fail. ISVV results and findings are fed back to the development teams for correction and improvement.\n\n===ISVV History===\nISVV derives from the application of IV&V (Independent Verification and Validation) to the software. Early ISVV application (as known today) dates back to the early 1970s when the [[U.S. Army]] sponsored the first significant program related to IV&V for the Safeguard [[Anti-Ballistic Missile]] System.\n\nBy the end of the 1970s IV&V was rapidly becoming popular. The constant increase in complexity, size and importance of the software lead to an increasing demand on IV&V applied to software (ISVV).\n\nMeanwhile, IV&V (and ISVV for software systems) gets consolidated and is now widely used by organisations such as the DoD, FAA, NASA<ref>[http://www.ivv.nasa.gov NASA IV&V Facility]</ref> and ESA.<ref>[http://www.esa.int ESA Web site]</ref> IV&V is mentioned in [DO-178B], [ISO/IEC 12207] and formalised in [IEEE 1012].\n\nInitially in 2004-2005, a European consortium led by the [[European Space Agency]], and composed by DNV(N),<ref>[http://www.dnv.com DNV Web site]</ref> Critical Software SA(P),<ref>[http://www.criticalsoftware.com Critical Software SA Web site]</ref> Terma(DK)<ref>[http://www.terma.com Terma Web site]</ref> and CODA Scisys(UK)<ref>[http://www.scisys.co.uk Scisys Web site]</ref> created the first version of a guide devoted to ISVV, called \"ESA Guide for Independent Verification and Validation\" with support from other organizations, e.g. SoftWcare SL (E) (<ref>[http://www.softwcare.com SoftWcare SL Web site]</ref>), etc.\n\nIn 2008 the European Space Agency released a second version, being SoftWcare SL was the supporting editor having received inputs from many different European Space ISVV stakeholders. This guide covers the methodologies applicable to all the software engineering phases in what concerns ISVV.\n\n===ISVV Methodology===\nISVV is usually composed by five principal phases, these phases can be executed sequentially or as results of a tailoring process.\n\n<blockquote>ISVV Planning\n* Planning of ISVV Activities\n* System Criticality Analysis: Identification of Critical Components through a set of RAMS activities (Value for Money)\n* Selection of the appropriate Methods and Tools</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Requirements Verification\n* Verification for: Completeness, Correctness, Testability</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Design Verification\n* Design adequacy and conformance to Software Requirements and Interfaces\n* Internal and External Consistency\n* Verification of Feasibility and Maintenance</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Code Verification\n* Verification for: Completeness, Correctness, Consistency\n* Code Metrics Analysis\n* Coding Standards Compliance Verification</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Validation\n* Identification of unstable components/functionalities\n* Validation focused on Error-Handling: complementary (not concurrent!) validation regarding the one performed by the Development team (More for the Money, More for the Time)\n* Compliance with Software and System Requirements\n* [[Black box testing]] and [[White box testing]] techniques\n* Experience based techniques</blockquote>\n\n==Regulatory environment==\nVerification and validation must meet the compliance requirements of law regulated industries, which is often guided by government agencies<ref name=gpsv>{{cite web\n  | title = General Principles of Software validation; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff\n  | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]]\n  | date = 11 January 2002\n  | url = https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm085371.pdf\n  | format = PDF\n  | accessdate = 12 July 2009\n  }}</ref><ref name=dgi21>{{cite web\n  | title = Guidance for Industry: Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures \u2014 Scope and Application\n  | publisher = [[Food and Drug Administration]]\n  | date = August 2003\n  | url = https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM072322.pdf\n  | format = PDF\n  | accessdate = 12 July 2009\n  }}</ref> or industrial administrative authorities.

It may also be referred to as [[software quality control]].  It is normally the responsibility of [[software testing|software testers]] as part of the [[software development process|software development lifecycle]]. In simple terms, software verification is: \"Assuming we should build X, does our software achieve its goals without any bugs or gaps?\" On the other hand, software validation is: \"Was X what we should have built? Does X meet the high level requirements?\"\n\n==Definitions==\nVerification and validation are not the same things, although they are often confused. [[Barry Boehm|Boehm]] succinctly expressed the difference as<ref name=\"PhamSoft99\">{{cite book |title=Software Reliability |author=Pham, H. |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc |page=567 |year=1999 |isbn=9813083840 |quote=\"Software Validation. The process of ensuring that the software is performing the right process. Software Verification. The process of ensuring that the software is performing the process right.\" Likewise and also there: \"In short, Boehm (3) expressed the difference between the software verification and software validation as follows: Verification: \u2018\u2018Are we building the product right?\u2019\u2019 Validation: \u2018\u2018Are we building the right product?\u2019\u2019.\"}}</ref>\n* Verification: Are we building the product right?<!--This definition is correct and sourced to Boehm. Do not change to the competing definition-->\n* Validation: Are we building the right product?<!--This definition is correct and sourced to Boehm. Do not change to the competing definition-->\n\n\"Building the product right\" checks that the ''specifications'' are correctly implemented by the system while \"building the right product\" refers back to the ''user's needs''. In some contexts, it is required to have written requirements for both as well as formal procedures or protocols for determining compliance.\n\nBuilding the product right implies the use of the Requirements Specification as input for the next phase of the development process, the design process, the output of which is the Design Specification. Then, it also implies the use of the Design Specification to feed the construction process. Every time the output of a process correctly implements its input specification, the software product is one step closer to final verification. If the output of a process is incorrect, the developers are not building the product the stakeholders want correctly. This kind of verification is called \"artifact or specification verification\".\n\nBuilding the right product implies creating a Requirements Specification that contains the needs and goals of the stakeholders of the software product. If such artifact is incomplete or wrong, the developers will not be able to build the product the stakeholders want. This is a form of \"artifact or specification validation\".\n\nNote:  Verification begins before Validation and then they run in parallel until the software product is released.{{Clarify|date=March 2019}}\n\n=== Software verification ===\nIt would imply to verify if the specifications are met by running the software but this is not possible (e. g., how can anyone know if the architecture/design/etc. are correctly implemented by running the software?). Only by reviewing its associated artifacts, someone can conclude if the specifications are met.\n\n=== Artifact or specification verification===\nThe output of each software development process stage can also be subject to verification when checked against its input specification (see the definition by CMMI below).\n\nExamples of artifact verification:\n* Of the design specification against the requirement specification: Do the architectural design, detailed design and database logical model specifications correctly implement the functional and non-functional requirement specifications?\n* Of the construction artifacts against the design specification: Do the source code, user interfaces and database physical model correctly implement the design specification?\n\n=== Software validation===\nSoftware validation checks that the software product satisfies or fits the intended use (high-level checking), i.e., the software meets the user requirements, not as specification artifacts or as needs of those who will operate the software only; but, as the needs of all the stakeholders (such as users, operators, administrators, managers, investors, etc.). There are two ways to perform software validation: internal and external. During internal software validation, it is assumed that the goals of the stakeholders were correctly understood and that they were expressed in the requirement artifacts precisely and comprehensively. If the software meets the requirement specification, it has been internally validated. External validation happens when it is performed by asking the stakeholders if the software meets their needs. Different software development methodologies call for different levels of user and stakeholder involvement and feedback; so, external validation can be a discrete or a continuous event. Successful final external validation occurs when all the stakeholders accept the software product and express that it satisfies their needs. Such final external validation requires the use of an [[acceptance testing|acceptance test]] which is a [[dynamic testing|dynamic test]].\n\nHowever, it is also possible to perform internal static tests to find out if it meets the requirements specification but that falls into the scope of static verification because the software is not running.\n\n=== Artifact or specification validation ===\nRequirements should be validated before the software product as a whole is ready (the waterfall development process requires them to be perfectly defined before design starts; but, iterative development processes do not require this to be so and allow their continual improvement).\n\nExamples of artifact validation:\n\n* User Requirements Specification validation: User requirements as stated in a document called User Requirements Specification are validated by checking if they indeed represent the will and goals of the stakeholders. This can be done by interviewing them and asking them directly (static testing) or even by releasing prototypes and having the users and stakeholders to assess them (dynamic testing).\n* User input validation: User input (gathered by any peripheral such as keyboard, bio-metric sensor, etc.) is [[data validation|validated]] by checking if the input provided by the software operators or users meet the domain rules and constraints (such as data type, range, and format).\n\n=== Validation vs. verification===\nAccording to the [[Capability Maturity Model]] (CMMI-SW v1.1),\n* Software Validation: The process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements. [IEEE-STD-610]\n* Software Verification: The process of evaluating software to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase. [IEEE-STD-610]\n\nValidation during the software development process can be seen as a form of User Requirements Specification validation; and, that at the end of the development process is equivalent to Internal and/or External Software validation. Verification, from CMMI's point of view, is evidently of the artifact kind.\n\nIn other words, software verification ensures that the output of each phase of the software development process effectively carry out what its corresponding input artifact specifies (requirement -> design -> software product), while software validation ensures that the software product meets the needs of all the stakeholders (therefore, the requirement specification was correctly and accurately expressed in the first place). Software verification ensures that \"you built it right\" and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the plans of the developers. Software validation ensures that \"you built the right thing\" and confirms that the product, as provided, fulfills the intended use and goals of the stakeholders.\n\nThis article has used the strict or [[Software verification#Narrow scope|narrow]] definition of verification.\n\nFrom a testing perspective:\n* Fault \u2013 wrong or missing function in the code.\n* Failure \u2013 the manifestation of a fault during execution. The software was not effective. It does not do \"what\" it is supposed to do.\n* Malfunction \u2013 according to its specification the system does not meet its specified functionality. The software was not efficient (it took too many resources such as CPU cycles, it used too much memory, performed too many I/O operations, etc.), it was not usable, it was not reliable, etc. It does not do something \"how\" it is supposed to do it.\n\n==Related concepts==\nBoth verification and validation are related to the concepts of [[Quality (business)|quality]] and of [[software quality assurance]]. By themselves, verification and validation do not guarantee software quality; planning, [[traceability]], configuration management and other aspects of software engineering are required.\n\nWithin the [[modeling and simulation]] (M&S) community, the definitions of verification, validation and accreditation are similar:\n\n* M&S Verification is the process of determining that a [[computer model]], simulation, or federation of models and simulations implementations and their associated data accurately represent the developer's conceptual description and specifications.<ref name=\"Missile Defense Agency\"/>\n* M&S Validation is the process of determining the degree to which a model, simulation, or federation of models and simulations, and their associated data are accurate representations of the real world from the perspective of the intended use(s).<ref name=\"Missile Defense Agency\">{{Cite document\n  | year = 2008\n  | title = Department of Defense Documentation of Verification, Validation & Accreditation (VV&A) for Models and Simulations\n  | publisher = Missile Defense Agency\n  | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n* [[Accreditation]] is the formal certification that a model or simulation is acceptable to be used for a specific purpose.<ref name=\"Missile Defense Agency\"/>\nThe definition of M&S validation focuses on the accuracy with which the M&S represents the real-world intended use(s).  Determining the degree of M&S accuracy is required because all M&S are approximations of reality, and it is usually critical to determine if the degree of approximation is acceptable for the intended use(s).  This stands in contrast to software validation.\n\n==Classification of methods==\nIn [[mission-critical]] software systems, where flawless performance is absolutely necessary, [[formal methods]] may be used to ensure the correct operation of a system.<ref name=\"WangPrecise14\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Bi5BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA262 |chapter=Precise Documentation and Validation of Requirements |title=Formal Techniques for Safety-Critical Systems |author=Wang, C.-W. |author2=Ostroff, J.S. |author3=Hudon, S. |editor=Artho, C. |editor2=\u00d6lveczky, P.C. |publisher=Springer |pages=262\u2013279 |year=2014 |isbn=9783319054162 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}</ref> These formal methods can prove costly, however, representing as much as 80 percent of total software design cost.<ref name=\"KoopmanReli07\">{{cite book |chapter=Reliability, Safety, and Security in Everyday Embedded Systems |title=Dependable Computing |author=Koopman, P. |editor=Bondavelli, A. |editor2=Brasileiro, F. |editor3=Rajsbaum, S. |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75294-3_1 |isbn=978-3-540-75294-3}}</ref>\n\n===Test cases===\n{{main|Test case}}\nA test case is a tool used in the process. Test cases may be prepared for software verification and software validation to determine if the product was built according to the requirements of the user. Other methods, such as reviews, may be used early in the life cycle to provide for software validation.\n\n==Independent Verification and Validation==\nISVV stands for '''Independent Software Verification and Validation'''. ISVV is targeted at safety-critical [[software]] systems and aims to increase the quality of software products, thereby reducing risks and costs through the operational life of the software. ISVV provides assurance that software performs to the specified level of confidence and within its designed parameters and defined requirements.\n\nISVV activities are performed by independent engineering teams, not involved in the software development process, to assess the processes and the resulting products.

In the 19th century and the early 20th century, the term had usually described [[classical liberalism]], which emphasizes [[limited government]], religious freedom, and support for the [[free market]]. The term [[progressivism in the United States|progressivism]], meanwhile, had been used to describe individuals like [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who favored a limited amount of government activism. During the 1920s, the term progressive became associated with politicians such as [[Robert M. La Follette]], who called for government ownership of railroads and utilities in his [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 third-party presidential bid]]. Progressivism thus gained an association with [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] that advocates of more moderate reforms sought to avoid. The term was also unattractive to certain groups because of its longstanding association with the Republican Party and the [[Social Gospel]] movement. In the late 1920s and 1930s, political figures such as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] increasingly adopted the term liberal to describe an individual who favored some government activism, but was opposed to more radical reforms.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reichley |first1=A.

It also came to signify support for organized labor and a degree of hostility, or at least suspicion, of big business. Liberalism did retain some aspects of the term's usage prior to the 1930s, including support for civil liberties and secularism. These positions were contrasted with the [[Far-left politics|far-left]], who favored greater changes, and with [[History of conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], who opposed these changes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reichley |first1=A.

Roosevelt<ref><ref name=Reichley209210/</ref> came to office in 1933, amid the economic calamity of the [[Great Depression]], offering the nation a [[New Deal]] intended to alleviate economic want and unemployment, provide greater opportunities and restore prosperity.

Roosevelt expanded [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA) work relief program and added the CCC, the PWA and the WPA. In 1935, the [[Social Security Act]] and [[unemployment benefit#United States|unemployment insurance]] programs were added. The Social Security Act provided retirement and disability income for Americans unable to work or unable to find jobs.<ref>Sidney M. Milkis and Jerome M.

It involved deficit spending, dropping the [[gold standard]], efforts to re-inflate farm prices that were too low and efforts to increase [[foreign trade]]. New Deal efforts to help the United States recuperate were in part through a much expanded Hoover program, the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC).<ref>Herman, Arthur.

Reform measures included the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA), regulation of Wall Street by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934|Securities Exchange Act]] (SEA), the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] (AAA) for farm programs, [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) insurance for bank deposits enacted through the [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] of 1933 and the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA), also known as the Wagner Act, dealing with labor-management relations. Despite some New Dealers's urgings, there was no major antitrust program. Roosevelt opposed socialism (in the sense of state ownership of the means of production) and only one major program, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA), involved government ownership of the means of production.<ref>James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882\u20131940'' (1956)</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\nRoosevelt was president through most of [[World War II]] and, anticipating the post-war period, strongly supported proposals to create a [[United Nations]] organization as a means of encouraging mutual cooperation to solve problems on the international stage.

Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and the slightly more distant heir to the [[Progressive Era|progressives]] of the early 20th century.<ref>Alonzo L. Hamby, ''Liberalism and Its Challengers: From F.D.R. to Bush'' (1992)</ref> [[Sol Stern]] wrote that \"Cold War liberalism deserves credit for the greatest American achievement since World War II\u2014winning the Cold War\".<ref>Stern, Sol (Winter, 2010) [http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_1_ramparts.html \"The Ramparts I Watched.\"] ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal.]]''</ref>\n\nThe essential tenets of Cold War liberalism can be found in Roosevelt's [[Four Freedoms]] (1941). Of these, [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of religion|of religion]] were classic liberal freedoms as was freedom from fear (freedom from tyrannical government), but freedom from want was another matter. Roosevelt proposed a notion of freedom that went beyond government non-interference in private lives.{{original research inline|date=January 2019}} Freedom from want could justify positive government action to meet economic needs, an idea more associated with the concepts of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], [[Henry Clay]]'s [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s [[American School (economics)|economic principles of government intervention and subsidy]] than the more radical [[socialism]] and [[social democracy]] of European thinkers, or with prior versions of classical liberalism as represented by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Democratic-Republican Party]] and [[Andrew Jackson]]'s [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, both major American political parties included liberal and conservative factions. The Democratic Party had on one hand Northern and Western liberals and on the other generally conservative Southern whites.{{original research inline|date=January 2019}} Difficult to classify were the Northern [[urban area|urban]] Democratic [[political machine]]s. The urban machines had supported New Deal economic policies, but they slowly came apart over racial issues. Some historians have divided the Republican Party into liberal [[Wall Street]] and conservative [[Main Street]] factions while others have noted that the Republican Party's conservatives came from landlocked states ([[Robert Taft Jr.]] of Ohio and [[Barry Goldwater]] of Arizona) and the liberals tended to come from California ([[Earl Warren]] and [[Pete McCloskey]]), New York ([[Nelson Rockefeller]]) and other coastal states.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nOpposing both Communism and conservatism, Cold War liberalism resembled earlier liberalisms in its views on many social issues and personal liberty, but its economic views were not those of [[Free market|free-market]] Jeffersonian liberalism nor those of European social democrats. They never endorsed [[state socialism]], but they did call for spending on education, science and infrastructure, notably the expansion of [[NASA]] and the construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. Their progressive ideas continued the legacy of Lincoln, [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Most prominent and constant among the positions of Cold War liberalism included the following:{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n* Support for a domestic economy built on a balance of power between labor (in the form of organized [[Trade union|unions]]) and management (with a tendency to be more interested in large corporations than in [[small business]]).\n* A foreign policy focused on containing Communism based in the Soviet Union and China. Liberals opposed [[isolationism]], [[d\u00e9tente]] and [[rollback]]. \n* The continuation of New Deal social welfare programs, especially  [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]).\n* An embrace of [[Keynesian economics]] with deficit spending in times of recession. They supported high spending on the military, a policy known as [[military Keynesianism]].\n\nAt first, liberals generally did not see Franklin D. Roosevelt's successor [[Harry S. Truman]] as one of their own, viewing him as a Democratic Party hack. However, liberal politicians and liberal organizations such as the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) sided with Truman in opposing Communism both at home and abroad, sometimes at the sacrifice of [[civil liberties]].<ref>Alonzo L. Hamby, ''Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman'' (1995)</ref> For example, [[Hubert Humphrey]] put before the Senate in 1950 a bill to establish detention centers where those declared subversive by the President could be held without trial, but it did not pass.\n\nLiberals were united in their opposition to [[McCarthyism]].<ref>Richard M. Fried (1991). ''Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective''.</ref>{{vague|date=January 2019}}\n\n==== Decline of Southern liberals ====\nSouthern liberals were an essential part of the New Deal coalition as without them Roosevelt lacked majorities in Congress. Typical leaders were [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in Texas, [[Jim Folsom]] and [[John Sparkman]] in Alabama, [[Claude Pepper]] in Florida, [[Earl Long]] in Louisiana, [[Luther H. Hodges]] in North Carolina and [[Estes Kefauver]] in Tennessee. They promoted subsidies for small farmers and supported the nascent labor union movement. An essential condition for this North\u2013South coalition was for Northern liberals to ignore Southern racism. After 1945, Northern liberals, led especially by young [[Hubert Humphrey]] of Minnesota, increasingly made civil rights a central issue. They convinced Truman to join them in 1948. The conservative Southern Democrats, best known as the [[Dixiecrat]]s, took control of the state parties there and ran [[Strom Thurmond]] for president in 1948. Thurmond carried only the Deep South, but that threat was enough to guarantee the national Democratic Party in 1952 and 1956 would not make civil rights a major issue. In 1956, 101 of the 128 Southern Representatives and Senators signed the [[Southern Manifesto]] denouncing forced desegregation in 1956.<ref>Brent J. Aucoin, \"The Southern Manifesto and Southern Opposition to Desegregation.\" ''Arkansas Historical Quarterly'' 55.2 (1996): 173-193 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40030963 Online].</ref> The labor movement in the South was divided and lost its political influence. Southern liberals were in a quandary as most of them kept quiet or moderated their liberalism whilst others switched sides and the minority remnant continued on the liberal path. One by one, the last group was defeated. According to historian Numan V. Bartley, \"the very word 'liberal' gradually disappeared from the southern political lexicon, except as a term of opprobrium\".<ref>Numan V. Bartley, ''The New South, 1945-1980: the story of the South's modernization '' (1995 pp 61, 67-73, 92, 101; quoting p. 71.  </ref>\n\n==== Liberal consensus ====\nBy 1950, the liberal ideology was so intellectually dominant that the literary critic [[Lionel Trilling]] wrote that \"liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition, [...] there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in circulation\".<ref>Alexander Bloom, ''Prodigal sons: the New York intellectuals & their world'' (1986) p. 178</ref>\n\nFor almost two decades, Cold War liberalism remained the dominant paradigm in American politics, peaking with the landslide victory of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] over [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe post war liberal consensus included acceptance of a modest welfare state and [[Anti-communism#United States|anti-communism]] domestic and foreign policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://s-usih.org/2013/09/the-postwar-liberal-consensus-history-and-historiography/|title=The Postwar Liberal Consensus: History and Historiography {{!}} Society for US Intellectual History|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://d2r6h7ytneza1l.cloudfront.net/title/6abe5378-f05c-48dd-b851-d63a6b9e1ab1/mason&morgan_excerpt.pdf|title=The Liberal Consensus Reconsidered: American Politics and Society in the Postwar Era|last=Hodgson|first=Godfrey|publisher=University of Florida Press|year=|isbn=9780813065274|location=|pages=|chapter=Revisiting the Liberal Consensus}}</ref> Some elements of the consensus where shared with [[Embedded liberalism#Embedded liberalism: 1945\u20131970s|embedded liberalism]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Transformations: Economic Ideas and Institutional Change in the Twentieth Century|last=Blyth|first=Mark|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521010527|location=|pages=}}</ref> that aimed to combine benefits of free markets and interventionist domestic policies.\n\n=== Civil rights laws===\nCold War liberalism emerged at a time when most [[African-American]]s were politically and economically disenfranchised. Beginning with ''To Secure These Rights'', an official report issued by the Truman White House in 1947, self-proclaimed liberals increasingly embraced the [[civil rights movement]]. In 1948, President Truman desegregated the armed forces and the Democrats inserted a strong civil-rights plank in the party platform even though delegates from the Deep South walked out and nominated a third-party ticket, the [[Dixiecrat]]s, headed by [[Strom Thurmond]]. Truman abolished discrimination in the armed forces, leading to the integration of military units in the early 1950s. However, no civil rights legislation was passed until a weak bill in 1957.<ref>James T. Patterson, ''[https://archive.org/details/grandexpectation00patt <!-- quote=liberalism. --> Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945\u20131974]'' (1996) pp. 148\u2013164, 413.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, relations between white liberals and the civil rights movement became increasingly strained as civil-rights leaders accused liberal politicians of temporizing and procrastinating, although they realized they needed the support of liberal Northern Democrats and Republicans for the votes to pass any legislation over Southern obstructionism. Many white liberals believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would only anger many Southern whites and make it even more difficult to pass civil rights laws through Congress. In response to that concern, civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] agreed to tone down the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in 1963. President [[John F. Kennedy]] finally endorsed the March on Washington and proposed what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but he could not get it passed during his lifetime. [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been a New Deal Democrat in the 1930s and by the 1950s had decided that the Democratic Party had to break from its segregationist past and endorse racial liberalism as well as economic liberalism.<ref> Jill Lapore, ''These truths: A history of the United States'' (WW Norton & Company, 2018) pp. 600-609.</ref> Johnson rode the enormous wave of sympathy for the assassinated predecessor. With help from conservative Republicans led by [[Everett Dirksen]], the Southern filibuster was broken. Johnson enacted a mass of [[Great Society]] legislation, headed by the powerful [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which outlawed segregation, and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] which reversed state efforts to stop blacks from voting and facilitated their mobilization as millions of new liberal Democratic voters.<ref> Jill Lapore, ''These truths: A history of the United States'' (WW Norton & Company, 2018) pp. 600-609.</ref> . The result was an immediate end to segregation in most public places (except schools) and an end to restrictions on black voting.<ref>Lapore, ''These truths'' (2018) pp 586, 611,, 617-618. </ref>  Unexpectedly, passage was quickly followed by a wave of black riots in the inner cities which made for the \"long hot summers\" in every major city from 1964 through 1970. The riots alienated much of the white working-class that had been the base of the labor-union element in the civil-rights coalition.<ref>Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945\u20131974'' pp. 542\u201347</ref>\n\nThe civil-rights movement itself was becoming fractured. On March 8, 1964, [[Malcolm X]] stated he was going to organize a [[Black nationalism|black-nationalist]] organization that would try to \"heighten the political consciousness\" of African-Americans.<ref name=Times64-03-09>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/09/archives/malcolm-x-splits-with-muhammad-suspended-muslim-leader-plans-black.html |title=Malcolm X Splits with Muhammad |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |last=Handler |first=M. S. |date=March 9, 1964 |work=The New York Times }}</ref> By 1966, a [[Black Power]] movement had emerged. Black Power advocates accused white liberals of trying to control the civil-rights agenda. Proponents of Black Power wanted African-Americans to follow an \"ethnic model\" for obtaining power, not unlike that of Democratic [[political machine]]s in large cities.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This put them on a collision course with urban machine politicians and on its edges the Black Power movement contained racial separatists who wanted to give up on integration altogether\u2014a program that could not be endorsed by American liberals of any race.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The mere existence of such individuals (who always got more media attention than their actual numbers might have warranted) contributed to \"white backlash\" against liberals and civil rights activists.<ref>Patterson, ''[https://archive.org/details/grandexpectation00patt <!-- quote=liberalism. --> Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945\u20131974]'' pp. 550\u201355, 652\u201368</ref>\n\n=== Clashes with the New Left on Vietnam ===\nWhile the civil rights movement isolated liberals from the white working class and [[Southern Democrats]], the [[Vietnam War]] threw another wedge into the liberal ranks, dividing pro-war \"[[War hawk|hawks]]\" such as Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]] from \"[[War dove|doves]]\" such as Senator and [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential candidate]] [[George McGovern]]. As the war became the leading political issue of the day, agreement on domestic matters was not enough to hold the liberal consensus together.<ref>For the historiography see Charles Chatfield,  \"At the hands of historians: The antiwar movement of the Vietnam era.\" ''Peace & Chang'' 29.3\u20104 (2004): 483-526.<</ref>  Vietnam was part of the strategy of [[containment]] of Soviet Communism which began in earnest in 1947 to counter the Soviet threat. In the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy was more \"hawkish\" on [[Southeast Asia]] than [[Richard Nixon]]. Although the war expanded from 16,000 Americans in Vietnam under Kennedy to 500,000 under Johnson, there was much continuity of their policies, until Nixon arrived in 1969. The deep division between liberals and the New Left, especially on foreign policy, troubled the Democratic Party for decades.<ref>Michael Nelson,  \"The Historical Presidency: Lost Confidence: The Democratic Party, the Vietnam War, and the 1968 Election.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 48.3 (2018): 570-585.  https://doi.org/10.1111/psq.12449</ref>\n\nA large portion of the growing opposition to the war came from younger activists, with a strong base on elite university campuses. They had become alienated from the establishment and formed the [[New Left]]. After Johnson did poorly in the 1968 primaries and decided to focus on peacemaking and not run for reelection, tensions rapidly escalated inside the Democratic Party.  Assassinations struck down the two top liberals, [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, by now a cautious moderate who meekly followed Lyndon Johnson in domestic and foreign policy, was the last man standing at the disastrously violent [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. Much of the party's right-wing, from the South and ethnic white districts in the North, veered off to vote for Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]]. The result was a narrow victory for Republican Richard Nixon in a three-way race. Although touted as a conservative, [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|President Nixon]], with a Democratic Congress, enacted many liberal policies, including the establishment of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], normalizing relations with [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], and starting the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] to reduce the availability of [[ballistic missile]]s.<ref>Hugh Davis Graham, \"Richard Nixon and Civil Rights: Explaining an Enigma\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 26#1 (1996), pp. 93-106 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27551552 Online].</ref>\n\n[[File:Liberal Gallup 8-10.svg|thumb|250px|Percent of self-identified liberals in the United States broken down by state according to [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], August 2010; darker colors mean more liberals per state (click image for details)]]\nLiberals vehemently disliked Nixon and he reciprocated in kind with an [[Nixon's Enemies List|enemies list]]. Yet as president, Nixon took many policy positions that can only be described as liberal. Before Nixon was elected, the liberal wing of his own party favored politicians such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[William Scranton]]. In 1968 Nixon won the nomination by an appeal to a \"[[silent majority]]\" of conservatives, disgusted and frightened by soaring crime rates and widespread race riots.<ref>Michael W.

They organized themselves internally to round up votes, track legislation, mobilize interests, and produce bills without direct assistance from the [[White House]]. A wide range of progressive measures were carried out, such as increases in social security (a 20% benefit increase and linkage to automatic cost-of-living increases in 1972), public welfare (with expansion of unemployment compensation, [[Food Stamp Program|food stamps]] and supplemental security income additions to social security), workplace rules (with the passage of the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act]] in 1970), urban aid (with the addition of mass transit subsidies to highway construction enactments), environmentalism (with the passage of the [[National Environmental Protection Act]] of 1969 and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1970), aid to education (including [[Title IX]] in 1972), civil rights (with the extension of the [[Voting Rights Act]] in 1970)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/renka/ui320-75/presidents/nixon/nixon_imperialpres.asp |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |url-status=dead | title=Richard Nixon and the Imperial Presidency|first=Russell D.|last=Renka|website=Southeast Missouri State University |publisher= UI320 \u2013 The Modern Presidency|date=March 26, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213025040/http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/renka/ui320-75/presidents/nixon/nixon_imperialpres.asp |archivedate=February 13, 2013 }}</ref> and nutrition (with the establishment of the [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children]] in 1972).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r0vaciZ9nJ0C&pg=PA33&dq=hubert+humphrey+WIC+1972&q=hubert%20humphrey%20WIC%201972|title=The Third Freedom|website=google.co.uk|isbn=9780742521254|last1=McGovern|first1=George|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe political dominance of the liberal consensus even into the Nixon years can best be seen in policies by, for example, the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and also in Nixon's failed proposal to replace the welfare system with a guaranteed annual income by way of a [[negative income tax]]. [[Affirmative action]] in its most quota-oriented form was a Nixon administration policy. Even the Nixon [[War on Drugs]] allocated two-thirds of its funds for treatment, a far higher ratio than was to be the case under any subsequent President, Republican or Democrat. Additionally, Nixon's normalization of diplomatic relations with Communist China and his policy of ''[[d\u00e9tente]]'' with the Soviet Union were likely more popular with liberals than with his conservative base. Nixon also successfully supported a [[cost of living adjustment|cost-of-living adjustment]] for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] recipients.\n\nAn opposing view was offered by [[Cass R. Sunstein]] in ''The Second Bill of Rights''.<ref>Cass R. Sunstein (2004). ''The Second Bill of Rights''. Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-08332-3}}.</ref> He argues that through his [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] appointments, Nixon effectively ended a decades-long expansion under United States law of economic rights along the lines of those put forward in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].\n\n=== Since the 1970s ===\nDuring the Nixon years and through the 1970s, the liberal consensus began to come apart. The alliance with [[Dixicrats|white Southern Democrats]] had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough to make up for the loss of some Southern Democrats. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the United States and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it. Within the Democratic Party leadership, there was a turn toward moderation on racial themes after the defeat of liberal [[George McGovern]] in 1972.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walton|first=Hanes|title=Reelection: William Jefferson Clinton as a Native-son Presidential Candidate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wc_ee95tHkoC&pg=PA38|year=2000|publisher=Columbia UP|pages=38\u201339|isbn=9780231115520}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in the Republican ranks, a new wing of the party emerged. The anti-establishment conservatives who had been aroused by [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964 challenged the more liberal leadership in 1976 and took control of the party under [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980.

The [[United States Bill of Rights]] guarantees every citizen the freedoms advocated by the liberal philosophers, namely equality under the law, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to gather in peaceful assembly, the right to petition the government for redress of grievances and the right to bear arms, among other freedoms and rights. In this sense, virtually all Americans are liberals.<ref> Isaac Kramnick, \"Lockean Liberalism and the American Revolution\" [https://ap.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/road-revolution/essays/lockean-liberalism-and-american-revolution ''Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History'' (2019)] </ref>\n\nHowever, both before and after the country was founded legal questions concerning the scope of these rights and freedoms arose. In the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1856\u20131857, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that these rights only applied to white men and that blacks had no rights whatsoever that any white man was obliged to respect. Several constitutional amendments after the Dred Scott decision extended the guarantees of the Bill of Rights to larger classes of citizens, to all citizens in 1868, then specifically to blacks in 1870, to women in 1919 and to people unable to afford a poll tax in 1964.<ref>John Paul Stevens,  \"Keynote Address: The Bill of Rights: A Century of Progress.\" ''University of Chicago Law Review''  59 (1992): 13+ [http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=occasional_papers online].</ref>\n\n=== Classical liberalism ===\n{{Main|Classical liberalism}}\n[[Classical liberalism]] in the United States, also called ''[[laissez-faire]]'' liberalism,<ref name=Adams>Adams, Ian, ''Political Ideology Today'' (2002), Manchester University Press, p. 20</ref> is the belief that a free-market economy is the most productive and government interference favors a few and hurts the many\u2014or as [[Henry David Thoreau]] stated,  \"that government is best which governs least\". Classical liberalism is a philosophy of individualism and self-responsibility with little concern for groups or sub-communities. Classical liberals in the United States believe that if the economy is left to the natural forces of supply and demand, free of government intervention, the result is the most abundant satisfaction of human wants. Modern classical liberals oppose the concepts of [[social democracy]] and the [[welfare state]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Buchanan |first=James M. |authorlink=James M.

He effectively combined classical liberal theory with progressive philosophy and founded the periodical ''[[The New Republic]]'' to present his ideas. Croly presented the case for a [[mixed economy]], increased spending on education and the creation of a society based on the \"brotherhood of mankind\". In 1909, Croly published ''[[The Promise of American Life]]'' in which he proposed raising the general standard of living by means of economic planning, though he opposed aggressive unionization.<ref>Byron Dexter, \"Herbert Croly and the Promise of American Life,\" ''Political Science Quarterly,'' Vol. 70, No. 2 (June 1955), pp. 197\u2013218 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2145222 in JSTOR]</ref> In ''[[The Techniques of Democracy]]'' (1915), Croly argued against both dogmatic individualism and dogmatic socialism.

In the 19th century and the early 20th century, the term had usually described [[classical liberalism]], which emphasizes [[limited government]], religious freedom, and support for the [[free market]]. The term [[progressivism in the United States|progressivism]], meanwhile, had been used to describe individuals like [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who favored a limited amount of government activism. During the 1920s, the term progressive became associated with politicians such as [[Robert M. La Follette]], who called for government ownership of railroads and utilities in his [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 third-party presidential bid]]. Progressivism thus gained an association with [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]] that advocates of more moderate reforms sought to avoid. The term was also unattractive to certain groups because of its longstanding association with the Republican Party and the [[Social Gospel]] movement. In the late 1920s and 1930s, political figures such as [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] increasingly adopted the term liberal to describe an individual who favored some government activism, but was opposed to more radical reforms.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reichley |first1=A.

It also came to signify support for organized labor and a degree of hostility, or at least suspicion, of big business. Liberalism did retain some aspects of the term's usage prior to the 1930s, including support for civil liberties and secularism. These positions were contrasted with the [[Far-left politics|far-left]], who favored greater changes, and with [[History of conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], who opposed these changes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reichley |first1=A.

Roosevelt<ref><ref name=Reichley209210/</ref> came to office in 1933, amid the economic calamity of the [[Great Depression]], offering the nation a [[New Deal]] intended to alleviate economic want and unemployment, provide greater opportunities and restore prosperity.

Roosevelt expanded [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] (FERA) work relief program and added the CCC, the PWA and the WPA. In 1935, the [[Social Security Act]] and [[unemployment benefit#United States|unemployment insurance]] programs were added. The Social Security Act provided retirement and disability income for Americans unable to work or unable to find jobs.<ref>Sidney M. Milkis and Jerome M. Mileur, ''The New Deal and the Triumph of Liberalism'' (2002)</ref> Separate programs were set up for relief in rural areas, such as the [[Resettlement Administration]] and [[Farm Security Administration]].\n\nRecovery programs sought to restore the economy to pre-depression levels. It involved deficit spending, dropping the [[gold standard]], efforts to re-inflate farm prices that were too low and efforts to increase [[foreign trade]]. New Deal efforts to help the United States recuperate were in part through a much expanded Hoover program, the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC).<ref>Herman, Arthur.

Reform measures included the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA), regulation of Wall Street by the [[Securities Exchange Act of 1934|Securities Exchange Act]] (SEA), the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]] (AAA) for farm programs, [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) insurance for bank deposits enacted through the [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] of 1933 and the [[National Labor Relations Act]] (NLRA), also known as the Wagner Act, dealing with labor-management relations. Despite some New Dealers's urgings, there was no major antitrust program. Roosevelt opposed socialism (in the sense of state ownership of the means of production) and only one major program, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA), involved government ownership of the means of production.<ref>James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882\u20131940'' (1956)</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\nRoosevelt was president through most of [[World War II]] and, anticipating the post-war period, strongly supported proposals to create a [[United Nations]] organization as a means of encouraging mutual cooperation to solve problems on the international stage.

Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and the slightly more distant heir to the [[Progressive Era|progressives]] of the early 20th century.<ref>Alonzo L. Hamby, ''Liberalism and Its Challengers: From F.D.R. to Bush'' (1992)</ref> [[Sol Stern]] wrote that \"Cold War liberalism deserves credit for the greatest American achievement since World War II\u2014winning the Cold War\".<ref>Stern, Sol (Winter, 2010) [http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_1_ramparts.html \"The Ramparts I Watched.\"] ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal.]]''</ref>\n\nThe essential tenets of Cold War liberalism can be found in Roosevelt's [[Four Freedoms]] (1941). Of these, [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of religion|of religion]] were classic liberal freedoms as was freedom from fear (freedom from tyrannical government), but freedom from want was another matter. Roosevelt proposed a notion of freedom that went beyond government non-interference in private lives.{{original research inline|date=January 2019}} Freedom from want could justify positive government action to meet economic needs, an idea more associated with the concepts of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], [[Henry Clay]]'s [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s [[American School (economics)|economic principles of government intervention and subsidy]] than the more radical [[socialism]] and [[social democracy]] of European thinkers, or with prior versions of classical liberalism as represented by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Democratic-Republican Party]] and [[Andrew Jackson]]'s [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, both major American political parties included liberal and conservative factions. The Democratic Party had on one hand Northern and Western liberals and on the other generally conservative Southern whites.{{original research inline|date=January 2019}} Difficult to classify were the Northern [[urban area|urban]] Democratic [[political machine]]s. The urban machines had supported New Deal economic policies, but they slowly came apart over racial issues. Some historians have divided the Republican Party into liberal [[Wall Street]] and conservative [[Main Street]] factions while others have noted that the Republican Party's conservatives came from landlocked states ([[Robert Taft Jr.]] of Ohio and [[Barry Goldwater]] of Arizona) and the liberals tended to come from California ([[Earl Warren]] and [[Pete McCloskey]]), New York ([[Nelson Rockefeller]]) and other coastal states.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nOpposing both Communism and conservatism, Cold War liberalism resembled earlier liberalisms in its views on many social issues and personal liberty, but its economic views were not those of [[Free market|free-market]] Jeffersonian liberalism nor those of European social democrats. They never endorsed [[state socialism]], but they did call for spending on education, science and infrastructure, notably the expansion of [[NASA]] and the construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. Their progressive ideas continued the legacy of Lincoln, [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Most prominent and constant among the positions of Cold War liberalism included the following:{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n* Support for a domestic economy built on a balance of power between labor (in the form of organized [[Trade union|unions]]) and management (with a tendency to be more interested in large corporations than in [[small business]]).\n* A foreign policy focused on containing Communism based in the Soviet Union and China. Liberals opposed [[isolationism]], [[d\u00e9tente]] and [[rollback]]. \n* The continuation of New Deal social welfare programs, especially  [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]]).\n* An embrace of [[Keynesian economics]] with deficit spending in times of recession. They supported high spending on the military, a policy known as [[military Keynesianism]].\n\nAt first, liberals generally did not see Franklin D. Roosevelt's successor [[Harry S. Truman]] as one of their own, viewing him as a Democratic Party hack. However, liberal politicians and liberal organizations such as the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) sided with Truman in opposing Communism both at home and abroad, sometimes at the sacrifice of [[civil liberties]].<ref>Alonzo L. Hamby, ''Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman'' (1995)</ref> For example, [[Hubert Humphrey]] put before the Senate in 1950 a bill to establish detention centers where those declared subversive by the President could be held without trial, but it did not pass.\n\nLiberals were united in their opposition to [[McCarthyism]].<ref>Richard M. Fried (1991). ''Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective''.</ref>{{vague|date=January 2019}}\n\n==== Decline of Southern liberals ====\nSouthern liberals were an essential part of the New Deal coalition as without them Roosevelt lacked majorities in Congress. Typical leaders were [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in Texas, [[Jim Folsom]] and [[John Sparkman]] in Alabama, [[Claude Pepper]] in Florida, [[Earl Long]] in Louisiana, [[Luther H. Hodges]] in North Carolina and [[Estes Kefauver]] in Tennessee. They promoted subsidies for small farmers and supported the nascent labor union movement. An essential condition for this North\u2013South coalition was for Northern liberals to ignore Southern racism. After 1945, Northern liberals, led especially by young [[Hubert Humphrey]] of Minnesota, increasingly made civil rights a central issue. They convinced Truman to join them in 1948. The conservative Southern Democrats, best known as the [[Dixiecrat]]s, took control of the state parties there and ran [[Strom Thurmond]] for president in 1948. Thurmond carried only the Deep South, but that threat was enough to guarantee the national Democratic Party in 1952 and 1956 would not make civil rights a major issue. In 1956, 101 of the 128 Southern Representatives and Senators signed the [[Southern Manifesto]] denouncing forced desegregation in 1956.<ref>Brent J. Aucoin, \"The Southern Manifesto and Southern Opposition to Desegregation.\" ''Arkansas Historical Quarterly'' 55.2 (1996): 173-193 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40030963 Online].</ref> The labor movement in the South was divided and lost its political influence. Southern liberals were in a quandary as most of them kept quiet or moderated their liberalism whilst others switched sides and the minority remnant continued on the liberal path. One by one, the last group was defeated. According to historian Numan V. Bartley, \"the very word 'liberal' gradually disappeared from the southern political lexicon, except as a term of opprobrium\".<ref>Numan V. Bartley, ''The New South, 1945-1980: the story of the South's modernization '' (1995 pp 61, 67-73, 92, 101; quoting p. 71.  </ref>\n\n==== Liberal consensus ====\nBy 1950, the liberal ideology was so intellectually dominant that the literary critic [[Lionel Trilling]] wrote that \"liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition, [...] there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in circulation\".<ref>Alexander Bloom, ''Prodigal sons: the New York intellectuals & their world'' (1986) p. 178</ref>\n\nFor almost two decades, Cold War liberalism remained the dominant paradigm in American politics, peaking with the landslide victory of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] over [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe post war liberal consensus included acceptance of a modest welfare state and [[Anti-communism#United States|anti-communism]] domestic and foreign policies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://s-usih.org/2013/09/the-postwar-liberal-consensus-history-and-historiography/|title=The Postwar Liberal Consensus: History and Historiography {{!}} Society for US Intellectual History|accessdate=December 30, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://d2r6h7ytneza1l.cloudfront.net/title/6abe5378-f05c-48dd-b851-d63a6b9e1ab1/mason&morgan_excerpt.pdf|title=The Liberal Consensus Reconsidered: American Politics and Society in the Postwar Era|last=Hodgson|first=Godfrey|publisher=University of Florida Press|year=|isbn=9780813065274|location=|pages=|chapter=Revisiting the Liberal Consensus}}</ref> Some elements of the consensus where shared with [[Embedded liberalism#Embedded liberalism: 1945\u20131970s|embedded liberalism]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Transformations: Economic Ideas and Institutional Change in the Twentieth Century|last=Blyth|first=Mark|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521010527|location=|pages=}}</ref> that aimed to combine benefits of free markets and interventionist domestic policies.\n\n=== Civil rights laws===\nCold War liberalism emerged at a time when most [[African-American]]s were politically and economically disenfranchised. Beginning with ''To Secure These Rights'', an official report issued by the Truman White House in 1947, self-proclaimed liberals increasingly embraced the [[civil rights movement]]. In 1948, President Truman desegregated the armed forces and the Democrats inserted a strong civil-rights plank in the party platform even though delegates from the Deep South walked out and nominated a third-party ticket, the [[Dixiecrat]]s, headed by [[Strom Thurmond]]. Truman abolished discrimination in the armed forces, leading to the integration of military units in the early 1950s. However, no civil rights legislation was passed until a weak bill in 1957.<ref>James T. Patterson, ''[https://archive.org/details/grandexpectation00patt <!-- quote=liberalism. --> Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945\u20131974]'' (1996) pp. 148\u2013164, 413.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1960s, relations between white liberals and the civil rights movement became increasingly strained as civil-rights leaders accused liberal politicians of temporizing and procrastinating, although they realized they needed the support of liberal Northern Democrats and Republicans for the votes to pass any legislation over Southern obstructionism. Many white liberals believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would only anger many Southern whites and make it even more difficult to pass civil rights laws through Congress. In response to that concern, civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] agreed to tone down the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in 1963. President [[John F. Kennedy]] finally endorsed the March on Washington and proposed what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but he could not get it passed during his lifetime. [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had been a New Deal Democrat in the 1930s and by the 1950s had decided that the Democratic Party had to break from its segregationist past and endorse racial liberalism as well as economic liberalism.<ref> Jill Lapore, ''These truths: A history of the United States'' (WW Norton & Company, 2018) pp. 600-609.</ref> Johnson rode the enormous wave of sympathy for the assassinated predecessor. With help from conservative Republicans led by [[Everett Dirksen]], the Southern filibuster was broken. Johnson enacted a mass of [[Great Society]] legislation, headed by the powerful [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which outlawed segregation, and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] which reversed state efforts to stop blacks from voting and facilitated their mobilization as millions of new liberal Democratic voters.<ref> Jill Lapore, ''These truths: A history of the United States'' (WW Norton & Company, 2018) pp. 600-609.</ref> . The result was an immediate end to segregation in most public places (except schools) and an end to restrictions on black voting.<ref>Lapore, ''These truths'' (2018) pp 586, 611,, 617-618. </ref>  Unexpectedly, passage was quickly followed by a wave of black riots in the inner cities which made for the \"long hot summers\" in every major city from 1964 through 1970. The riots alienated much of the white working-class that had been the base of the labor-union element in the civil-rights coalition.<ref>Patterson, ''Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945\u20131974'' pp. 542\u201347</ref>\n\nThe civil-rights movement itself was becoming fractured. On March 8, 1964, [[Malcolm X]] stated he was going to organize a [[Black nationalism|black-nationalist]] organization that would try to \"heighten the political consciousness\" of African-Americans.<ref name=Times64-03-09>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/09/archives/malcolm-x-splits-with-muhammad-suspended-muslim-leader-plans-black.html |title=Malcolm X Splits with Muhammad |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |last=Handler |first=M. S. |date=March 9, 1964 |work=The New York Times }}</ref> By 1966, a [[Black Power]] movement had emerged. Black Power advocates accused white liberals of trying to control the civil-rights agenda. Proponents of Black Power wanted African-Americans to follow an \"ethnic model\" for obtaining power, not unlike that of Democratic [[political machine]]s in large cities.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} This put them on a collision course with urban machine politicians and on its edges the Black Power movement contained racial separatists who wanted to give up on integration altogether\u2014a program that could not be endorsed by American liberals of any race.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The mere existence of such individuals (who always got more media attention than their actual numbers might have warranted) contributed to \"white backlash\" against liberals and civil rights activists.<ref>Patterson, ''[https://archive.org/details/grandexpectation00patt <!-- quote=liberalism. --> Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945\u20131974]'' pp. 550\u201355, 652\u201368</ref>\n\n=== Clashes with the New Left on Vietnam ===\nWhile the civil rights movement isolated liberals from the white working class and [[Southern Democrats]], the [[Vietnam War]] threw another wedge into the liberal ranks, dividing pro-war \"[[War hawk|hawks]]\" such as Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]] from \"[[War dove|doves]]\" such as Senator and [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential candidate]] [[George McGovern]]. As the war became the leading political issue of the day, agreement on domestic matters was not enough to hold the liberal consensus together.<ref>For the historiography see Charles Chatfield,  \"At the hands of historians: The antiwar movement of the Vietnam era.\" ''Peace & Chang'' 29.3\u20104 (2004): 483-526.<</ref>  Vietnam was part of the strategy of [[containment]] of Soviet Communism which began in earnest in 1947 to counter the Soviet threat. In the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy was more \"hawkish\" on [[Southeast Asia]] than [[Richard Nixon]]. Although the war expanded from 16,000 Americans in Vietnam under Kennedy to 500,000 under Johnson, there was much continuity of their policies, until Nixon arrived in 1969. The deep division between liberals and the New Left, especially on foreign policy, troubled the Democratic Party for decades.<ref>Michael Nelson,  \"The Historical Presidency: Lost Confidence: The Democratic Party, the Vietnam War, and the 1968 Election.\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 48.3 (2018): 570-585.  https://doi.org/10.1111/psq.12449</ref>\n\nA large portion of the growing opposition to the war came from younger activists, with a strong base on elite university campuses. They had become alienated from the establishment and formed the [[New Left]]. After Johnson did poorly in the 1968 primaries and decided to focus on peacemaking and not run for reelection, tensions rapidly escalated inside the Democratic Party.  Assassinations struck down the two top liberals, [[Martin Luther King]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, by now a cautious moderate who meekly followed Lyndon Johnson in domestic and foreign policy, was the last man standing at the disastrously violent [[1968 Democratic National Convention]]. Much of the party's right-wing, from the South and ethnic white districts in the North, veered off to vote for Alabama Governor [[George Wallace]]. The result was a narrow victory for Republican Richard Nixon in a three-way race. Although touted as a conservative, [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|President Nixon]], with a Democratic Congress, enacted many liberal policies, including the establishment of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], normalizing relations with [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], and starting the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] to reduce the availability of [[ballistic missile]]s.<ref>Hugh Davis Graham, \"Richard Nixon and Civil Rights: Explaining an Enigma\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 26#1 (1996), pp. 93-106 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27551552 Online].</ref>\n\n[[File:Liberal Gallup 8-10.svg|thumb|250px|Percent of self-identified liberals in the United States broken down by state according to [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], August 2010; darker colors mean more liberals per state (click image for details)]]\nLiberals vehemently disliked Nixon and he reciprocated in kind with an [[Nixon's Enemies List|enemies list]]. Yet as president, Nixon took many policy positions that can only be described as liberal. Before Nixon was elected, the liberal wing of his own party favored politicians such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[William Scranton]].

A wide range of progressive measures were carried out, such as increases in social security (a 20% benefit increase and linkage to automatic cost-of-living increases in 1972), public welfare (with expansion of unemployment compensation, [[Food Stamp Program|food stamps]] and supplemental security income additions to social security), workplace rules (with the passage of the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act]] in 1970), urban aid (with the addition of mass transit subsidies to highway construction enactments), environmentalism (with the passage of the [[National Environmental Protection Act]] of 1969 and the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] of 1970), aid to education (including [[Title IX]] in 1972), civil rights (with the extension of the [[Voting Rights Act]] in 1970)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/renka/ui320-75/presidents/nixon/nixon_imperialpres.asp |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |url-status=dead | title=Richard Nixon and the Imperial Presidency|first=Russell D.|last=Renka|website=Southeast Missouri State University |publisher= UI320 \u2013 The Modern Presidency|date=March 26, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213025040/http://cstl-cla.semo.edu/renka/ui320-75/presidents/nixon/nixon_imperialpres.asp |archivedate=February 13, 2013 }}</ref> and nutrition (with the establishment of the [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children]] in 1972).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=r0vaciZ9nJ0C&pg=PA33&dq=hubert+humphrey+WIC+1972&q=hubert%20humphrey%20WIC%201972|title=The Third Freedom|website=google.co.uk|isbn=9780742521254|last1=McGovern|first1=George|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nThe political dominance of the liberal consensus even into the Nixon years can best be seen in policies by, for example, the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency and also in Nixon's failed proposal to replace the welfare system with a guaranteed annual income by way of a [[negative income tax]]. [[Affirmative action]] in its most quota-oriented form was a Nixon administration policy. Even the Nixon [[War on Drugs]] allocated two-thirds of its funds for treatment, a far higher ratio than was to be the case under any subsequent President, Republican or Democrat. Additionally, Nixon's normalization of diplomatic relations with Communist China and his policy of ''[[d\u00e9tente]]'' with the Soviet Union were likely more popular with liberals than with his conservative base. Nixon also successfully supported a [[cost of living adjustment|cost-of-living adjustment]] for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] recipients.\n\nAn opposing view was offered by [[Cass R. Sunstein]] in ''The Second Bill of Rights''.<ref>Cass R. Sunstein (2004). ''The Second Bill of Rights''. Basic Books. {{ISBN|0-465-08332-3}}.</ref> He argues that through his [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] appointments, Nixon effectively ended a decades-long expansion under United States law of economic rights along the lines of those put forward in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted in 1948 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]].\n\n=== Since the 1970s ===\nDuring the Nixon years and through the 1970s, the liberal consensus began to come apart. The alliance with [[Dixicrats|white Southern Democrats]] had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not quite enough to make up for the loss of some Southern Democrats. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the United States and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it. Within the Democratic Party leadership, there was a turn toward moderation on racial themes after the defeat of liberal [[George McGovern]] in 1972.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walton|first=Hanes|title=Reelection: William Jefferson Clinton as a Native-son Presidential Candidate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wc_ee95tHkoC&pg=PA38|year=2000|publisher=Columbia UP|pages=38\u201339|isbn=9780231115520}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in the Republican ranks, a new wing of the party emerged. The anti-establishment conservatives who had been aroused by [[Barry Goldwater]] in 1964 challenged the more liberal leadership in 1976 and took control of the party under [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980. Liberal Republicans faded away even in their Northeastern strongholds.<ref>Nicol C.

The [[United States Bill of Rights]] guarantees every citizen the freedoms advocated by the liberal philosophers, namely equality under the law, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to gather in peaceful assembly, the right to petition the government for redress of grievances and the right to bear arms, among other freedoms and rights. In this sense, virtually all Americans are liberals.<ref> Isaac Kramnick, \"Lockean Liberalism and the American Revolution\" [https://ap.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/road-revolution/essays/lockean-liberalism-and-american-revolution ''Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History'' (2019)] </ref>\n\nHowever, both before and after the country was founded legal questions concerning the scope of these rights and freedoms arose. In the [[Dred Scott]] decision of 1856\u20131857, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that these rights only applied to white men and that blacks had no rights whatsoever that any white man was obliged to respect. Several constitutional amendments after the Dred Scott decision extended the guarantees of the Bill of Rights to larger classes of citizens, to all citizens in 1868, then specifically to blacks in 1870, to women in 1919 and to people unable to afford a poll tax in 1964.<ref>John Paul Stevens,  \"Keynote Address: The Bill of Rights: A Century of Progress.\" ''University of Chicago Law Review''  59 (1992): 13+ [http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context=occasional_papers online].</ref>\n\n=== Classical liberalism ===\n{{Main|Classical liberalism}}\n[[Classical liberalism]] in the United States, also called ''[[laissez-faire]]'' liberalism,<ref name=Adams>Adams, Ian, ''Political Ideology Today'' (2002), Manchester University Press, p. 20</ref> is the belief that a free-market economy is the most productive and government interference favors a few and hurts the many\u2014or as [[Henry David Thoreau]] stated,  \"that government is best which governs least\". Classical liberalism is a philosophy of individualism and self-responsibility with little concern for groups or sub-communities. Classical liberals in the United States believe that if the economy is left to the natural forces of supply and demand, free of government intervention, the result is the most abundant satisfaction of human wants. Modern classical liberals oppose the concepts of [[social democracy]] and the [[welfare state]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Buchanan |first=James M. |authorlink=James M.

He effectively combined classical liberal theory with progressive philosophy and founded the periodical ''[[The New Republic]]'' to present his ideas. Croly presented the case for a [[mixed economy]], increased spending on education and the creation of a society based on the \"brotherhood of mankind\". In 1909, Croly published ''[[The Promise of American Life]]'' in which he proposed raising the general standard of living by means of economic planning, though he opposed aggressive unionization.<ref>Byron Dexter, \"Herbert Croly and the Promise of American Life,\" ''Political Science Quarterly,'' Vol. 70, No. 2 (June 1955), pp. 197\u2013218 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2145222 in JSTOR]</ref> In ''[[The Techniques of Democracy]]'' (1915), Croly argued against both dogmatic individualism and dogmatic socialism. As editor of ''The New Republic'', he had the forum to reach the intellectual community.<ref>David W. Levy, ''Herbert Croly of the New Republic: The Life and Thought of an American Progressive'' (1985)</ref>\n\nAccording to Paul Starr, sociologist at Princeton University: {{quote|Liberalism wagers that a state [...] can be strong but constrained\u2014strong because constrained. [...] Rights to education and other requirements for human development and security aim to advance the opportunity and personal dignity of minorities and to promote a creative and productive society.

Tapirs inhabit jungle and forest regions of [[South America]], [[Central America]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. There are four widely recognized extant [[species]] of tapirs, all of the family '''Tapiridae''' and the genus '''''Tapirus'''''. They are the [[South American tapir|Brazilian tapir]], the [[Malayan tapir]], the [[Baird's tapir]], and the [[mountain tapir]]. In 2013, a group of researchers claimed to have identified a fifth species of tapir, the [[kabomani tapir]].

Tapirs near a water source will swim, sink to the bottom, and walk along the riverbed to feed, and have been known to submerge themselves to allow small fish to pick parasites off their bulky bodies.<ref name=morris/> Along with freshwater lounging, tapirs often wallow in mud pits, which also help to keep them cool and free of insects.\n\nIn the wild, the tapir's diet consists of fruit, berries, and leaves, particularly young, tender growth. Tapirs will spend many of their waking hours foraging along well-worn trails, snouts to the ground in search of food. Baird's tapirs have been observed to eat around 40&nbsp;kg (85&nbsp;lb) of vegetation in one day.<ref>[http://www.tapirback.com/tapirgal/tpf-news/2001/tpfn0107.htm TPF News], Tapir Preservation Fund, Vol. 4, No. 7, July 2001.

They have [[monocular vision]].\n\nCopulation may occur in or out of water.

The creatures are also able to run fairly quickly, considering their size and cumbersome appearance, finding shelter in the thick undergrowth of the forest or in water. Hunting for meat and hides has substantially reduced their numbers and, more recently, habitat loss has resulted in the conservation watch-listing of all four species; the Brazilian tapir is classified as vulnerable, and the Baird's tapir, the mountain tapir, and the Malayan tapir are endangered.\n\n==Evolution and natural history==\nThe first tapirids, such as ''[[Heptodon]]'', appeared in the early [[Eocene]] of North America.<ref name = \"Ballenger2001\">{{cite web\n | last1 = Ballenger | first1 = L. | last2 = Myers | first2 = P.\n | title = Family Tapiridae | work = [[Animal Diversity Web]] | date = 2001\n | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Tapiridae.html\n | accessdate = 2014-05-11 | archivedate = 2013-04-13\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130413043743/http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Tapiridae.html}}</ref> They appeared very similar to modern forms, but were about half the size, and lacked the proboscis.

Tapirs near a water source will swim, sink to the bottom, and walk along the riverbed to feed, and have been known to submerge themselves to allow small fish to pick parasites off their bulky bodies.<ref name=morris/> Along with freshwater lounging, tapirs often wallow in mud pits, which also help to keep them cool and free of insects.\n\nIn the wild, the tapir's diet consists of fruit, berries, and leaves, particularly young, tender growth. Tapirs will spend many of their waking hours foraging along well-worn trails, snouts to the ground in search of food.

The creatures are also able to run fairly quickly, considering their size and cumbersome appearance, finding shelter in the thick undergrowth of the forest or in water. Hunting for meat and hides has substantially reduced their numbers and, more recently, habitat loss has resulted in the conservation watch-listing of all four species; the Brazilian tapir is classified as vulnerable, and the Baird's tapir, the mountain tapir, and the Malayan tapir are endangered.\n\n==Evolution and natural history==\nThe first tapirids, such as ''[[Heptodon]]'', appeared in the early [[Eocene]] of North America.<ref name = \"Ballenger2001\">{{cite web\n | last1 = Ballenger | first1 = L. | last2 = Myers | first2 = P.\n | title = Family Tapiridae | work = [[Animal Diversity Web]] | date = 2001\n | url = http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Tapiridae.html\n | accessdate = 2014-05-11 | archivedate = 2013-04-13\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130413043743/http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Tapiridae.html}}</ref> They appeared very similar to modern forms, but were about half the size, and lacked the proboscis.
