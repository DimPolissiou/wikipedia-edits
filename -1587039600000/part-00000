Deposited with the unnamed baby is a note asking the unknown finder to take good care of her and a bag containing clues to the parents' identity. The trio sets out to find the baby's parents. The baby is named {{nihongo|Kiyoko|\u6e05\u5b50}} by Hana, based on the Japanese translation of ''[[Silent Night]]'' literally meaning \"pure child\", as she is found on [[Christmas Eve]]. Outside a [[cemetery]], the group encounters a high-ranking [[yakuza]] boss trapped under his car. The man happens to know the owner of the club where Kiyoko's mother used to work; his daughter is going to be marrying the club's owner that day. At the wedding reception, the groom tells them that the baby's mother is a former bar girl named Sachiko. He gives them Sachiko's address, but the party is interrupted when a maid, revealed to be a Latino [[Contract killing|hitman]] in disguise, attempts to shoot the bride's father. The hitman kidnaps Miyuki and baby Kiyoko while holding them hostage at gunpoint and takes them back to his home. There, Miyuki befriends the hitman's wife and confesses to fleeing her home after stabbing her father.\n\nHana searches for Miyuki and Kiyoko while Gin takes care of an elderly homeless man who is dying in the street. After giving Gin a little red bag, the old man peacefully passes away. Some teenagers show up and beat up Gin and the dead old man's corpse. Meanwhile, Hana finds the girls and they go off to find a place to stay. They go to Angel Tower, a club where Hana had worked before being fired for assaulting a rude and intoxicated customer. Gin, who was rescued by another member of the club, is also there. The trio sets out to find Sachiko's house, but they discover that it has been torn down. They are informed of the unhappy relationship between Sachiko and her husband, who is a gambling alcoholic. The group rests at a store until they are told to leave by the clerk. Hana collapses, and is taken by Gin and Miyuki to the hospital. Once at the hospital, Gin finds his estranged daughter, who is also named Kiyoko, working as a nurse. Hana berates Gin in front of his daughter and storms out of the hospital, with Miyuki following behind with baby Kiyoko in hand. Hana and Miyuki find Sachiko about to jump off a bridge. Sachiko insists that her husband got rid of the baby without her knowledge, and that they return the baby to her.\n\nGin finds Sachiko's husband, who confirms a TV report Gin saw earlier that Kiyoko was actually stolen by Sachiko from the hospital. They chase after Sachiko and Kiyoko. After an intense car chase, Miyuki chases Sachiko to the top of a building. Sachiko reveals she became pregnant in hopes it would bring her closer to her husband. When her baby was [[Stillbirth|stillborn]], she decided to kidnap Kiyoko from the hospital's nursery, thinking, in her grief, the baby was hers. As Sachiko is about to jump off the building intending to commit suicide with Kiyoko in her hands, her husband comes out of his apartment, located just across the street, and begs her to start over with him. Sachiko jumps off nevertheless, but Miyuki manages to catch her before she falls, but then Sachiko accidentally drops Kiyoko. Hana jumps off the building after Kiyoko, catches the baby, and lands safely due to a miraculous gust of wind. Hana, Miyuki, and Gin are taken to the hospital. Miyuki hands Gin his cigarettes and drops the old man's small red bag on the floor, revealing a winning [[lottery]] ticket. Kiyoko's real parents want to ask the trio to become her godparents.

The history of the faculty is directly linked to the history of the university as it was opened in the same year with the establishment of the university, under the base of two universities which are \"Republican Russian language and literature pedagogic institute\" and the \"Tashkent State Foreign Languages Pedagogic Institute\". The main purpose of the faculty is training the professionals who would contribute their knowledge in the way of development of Republic of Uzbekistan.

One of the pioneering architects of the early [[Art Nouveau]] or Jugendstil style in Finland at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, he continued to influence generations of students by introducing them to the style. Many of his key architectural works were made while he was in the architectural partnership Usko Nystr\u00f6m\u2500Petrelius\u2500Penttil\u00e4 which operated from 1895 to 1908. His most famous work is the Grand H\u00f4tel Cascade (1903) (nowadays known as the Imatran Valtionhotelli) in Imatra.\n[[File:Imatrankoski Valtionhotelli ilma.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Grand H\u00f4tel Cascade (1903) (nowadays the Imatran Valtionhotelli) Imatra.]]\n\n== Life and career ==\nUsko Nystr\u00f6m was born in [[Virrat]], Finland, at a time when Finland was a [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Duchy]] under the rule of Russia. His parents were Johan Abraham Nystr\u00f6m, a civil servant, and Clara Chalotta Nystr\u00f6m (n\u00e9e Vikman). There were several children in the family. Nystr\u00f6m's brother, Konrad Into Nystr\u00f6m, is even more well known, as a photographer, writer and translator, under the name [[I. K. Inha]].<ref>[http://www.gallen-kallela.fi/inha/index_en.html ''I.K. Inha \u2013 The Dream of the Landscape'']</ref>\n\nUsko Nystr\u00f6m was schooled in the city of [[H\u00e4meenlinna]] before going on in 1880 to study first mathematics and then \u201chumanities\u201d, among other things aesthetics, at the Imperial Alexander University of Finland (the precursor to the present-day [[University of Helsinki]]). However, in 1885 he switched to studying architecture at the Polytechnic Institute in Helsinki, graduating in 1888. While still studying he worked first for architect [[Josef Stenb\u00e4ck]] (a notable designer of churches) and then architect Gustav Nystr\u00f6m (no relation), who was also professor of architecture at the Polytechnic Institute. He achieved some success almost immediately on graduating, winning the competition for the design of the pedestal for the memorial bust to commemorate the architect [[Carl Ludwig Engel]] \u2013 but it was never realised.<ref name=\"Rauske\">Eija Rauske, ''Kivet puhuvat arkkitehtuuritoimiston Usko Nystr\u00f6m-Petrelius-Penttil\u00e4 asuinkerrostalot Helsingiss\u00e4 1895-1908'', Helsinki: Suomen muinaismuistoyhdistys, 2004.</ref>\n\nIn 1890 Nystr\u00f6m won a state grant to travel and study abroad, studying at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris in 1890\u201391, and travelling throughout Europe. He travelled to Italy and Greece, exploring the ancient architecture, as well as around France and to England, where he was particularly interested in the medieval church architecture. During his time abroad he kept detailed notebooks and sketchbooks (nowadays held in the [[Museum of Finnish Architecture]] archives). In 1892, soon after returning to Finland, he was appointed assistant lecturer at the Polytechnic Institute (founded 1879), where he himself had previously been a student, a position he held for the rest of his life, and where the head of the school at the time was Gustaf Nystr\u00f6m. He was a highly skilled draftsman and his talent was used first in teaching linear and free-hand drawing. In 1901 he was promoted to lecturer in architecture, teaching ancient and medieval architecture and their styles, along with exercises in design and drawing. For many years Nystr\u00f6m also taught ornamentation and style history at the Central School of Applied Arts in Helsinki (precursor to the present-day [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture]]). He received the honorary title of professor in 1922. It has often been noted by his former students how very popular he was as a teacher, in part due to his keen sense of humour but also in conveying something of his drawing skills to the students. He also had a significant role in spreading the Art Nouveau style to several generations of students.<ref>Pekka Korvenmaa (ed.), ''The Work of Architects'', Rakennustieto, Helsinki, 1992.</ref>\n\nNystr\u00f6m never married. He died suddenly on January 6, 1925 in [[Kotka]], while visiting his sister. He is buried in [[Hietaniemi cemetery]] in Helsinki. In 1928 the [[SAFA (architecture)|Finnish Association of Architects]] arranged a competition for the design of Nystr\u00f6m's gravestone: it was won by his former student, [[Alvar Aalto]]; the gravestone, in white marble, with the text ''Bene latuit'' from French philosopher [[Rene Descartes]]\u2019 work [[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]], where he had quoted [[Ovid]], ''Bene vixit qui bene latuit'', i.e. The One who lives well, lives unnoticed.\n\n[[File:Viiskulma, Helsinki, 2014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|\"Neo-Renaissance\" Wuorinen apartment building, Helsinki (1896)]]\n{{multiple image\n   | footer    = \"Jugendstil\" Schalin building, Kapteeninkatu 11 \u2013 Tehtaankatu 9, Helsinki (1902)\n   | image1    = Kapteeninkatu 11, Helsinki.jpg\n   | width1    = {{#expr: (100 * 531 / 599) round 0}}\n   | alt1      = Street\n   | caption1  = Street view\n   | image2    = Kapteeninkatu 11, Helsinki, internal courtyard.jpg\n   | width2    = 200\n   | alt2      = Courtyard\n   | caption2  = \"White\" courtyard.\n   | image3    = \"Seaweed decoration\", Kapteeninkatu 11, Helsinki, Finland.jpg\n   | width3    = 200\n   | alt3      = Seaweed\n   | caption3  = \"Seaweed\" decoration on the street facade.\n   | footer_background=#BBDD99\n   | background color=#BBDD99\n   | width=160\n}}\n\nNystr\u00f6m had contributed to the journal Suomen Teollisuuslehti (Finnish Industrial Magazine) edited by his architecture partner Vilho Penttil\u00e4. However, his most significant written contributions were to the 11-volume encyclopaedia ''Tietosanakirja'' published between 1909 and 1922. Nystr\u00f6m wrote the descriptions for almost 300 entries.<ref name=\"Rauske\"/><ref>Jalmar Castr\u00e9n et al (eds.), ''Tietosanakirja, 11 osa, T\u00e4ydennysosa'', Helsinki, Tietosanakirja, 1922.</ref>\n\n== Architectural firm Usko Nystr\u00f6m\u2500Petrelius\u2500Penttil\u00e4 ==\nUsko Nyst\u00f6m established a joint architectural form with Albert Petrelius (1865\u20131946) and Vilho Penttil\u00e4 (1868\u20131918) in 1895 and the partnership continued until 1908. The office was one of many joint architectural firms established in Helsinki at around that time \u2013 [[Gesellius, Lindgren, and Saarinen]] becoming the most renowned. Each of the partners had at one time worked for the master builder J. G. Rosenberg. Nystr\u00f6m was the leading figure in the architectural firm \u2013 only his first name was included in its official name. Albert Petrelius was both an architect and master builder and as well as being a partner in the architectural form also simultaneously worked for a fire insurance company, while the architect Vilho Penttil\u00e4 was also editor-in-chief of the journal ''Suomen Teollisuuslehti'' (Finnish Industrial Magazine), and which provided an outlet for showing the works of the architectural firm. Petrelius and Penttil\u00e4 were members of the pro-Finnish language and pro-Independence [[Fennoman movement]] (at that time the vast majority of architects were Swedish-speaking). In fact, some of the architectural firm's customers were also connected with the Fennoman movement, in particular the KOP Bank ([[Kansallis-Osake-Pankki]]).\n\nAmong the most notable works of Usko Nystr\u00f6m\u2500Petrelius\u2500Penttil\u00e4 were 18 bourgeois apartment buildings in central Helsinki, designed and built between 1895 and 1907. Helsinki was going through a building boom period at that time, aided by the Companies Act of 1895 and new forms of credit institutions, at a time when industry in the cities was on the rise and there was a shortage of housing. The style of their architecture represents the period of transition from neo-gothic and neo-renaissance to the Jugendstil or Art Nouveau style, also referred to as the National Romantic style. Historian Eija Rauske suggests that models for the designs of the apartment blocks came from the major cities of central Europe, and in particular Paris and Vienna.<ref name=\"Rauske\"/> An idea of the transitional style of the architectural firm can be seen by comparing two apartment blocks, both fairly close to each other in central Helsinki. The Wuorinen apartment building is a 5-storey (plus attic storey) neo-Renaissance style building taking up an entire city block, with heavily rusticated ground floor (containing shops) and heavy roof cornice; the finesse of the facades is supposedly picked out in the exposed brickwork on the upper floors and plaster-cast emblems of various forms, in particular the letter W, referring to the client of the project. By contrast, the Schalin apartment building at Kapteeninkatu 11 \u2013 Tehtaankatu 9, Helsinki (1902), is a 5-storey (plus attic storey) Jugendstil or Art Nouveau work, in unpainted rough render decorated with patterns depicting seaweed made from granite insets. The corner dome has echoes of medieval castle towers. The fa\u00e7ade also includes seemingly randomly placed decorative balconies. The curved forms continue partly in the interior with some oval-shaped rooms. However, the rear internal courtyard is far more restrained and rational, and painted in white.<ref>Johnathan Moorhouse, Michael Carapetian, Leena Ahtola-Moorhouse, ''Helsinki Jugendstil Architecture 1895-1915.'' Helsinki, Otava, 1987.</ref>\n\nNystr\u00f6m's most famous work was designed during the period of the partnership \u2013 though it is attributed to him alone \u2013 the Grand H\u00f4tel Cascade (1903) (nowadays known as the Imatran Valtionhotelli) in Imatra. With its turreted towers, the work brings to mind the castles in France Nystr\u00f6m had seen during his travels there a decade earlier.<ref>Henrik Lilius, ''Imatran valtionhotelli: Kuvia rakennuksen vaiheista'', Helsinki, Alko, 1983.</ref>\n\nIn actual fact, the first building designs of Usko Nystr\u00f6m\u2500Petrelius\u2500Penttil\u00e4 were wooden buildings, designed in a rustic, proto-National Romantic style. Penttil\u00e4 even campaigned for a Finnish National Romantic style of architecture on the pages of the journal he edited, ''Suomen Teollisuuslehti'', with the designs showing exposed notched corner joints, rather than covering the logs with boarding, which had been the custom at that time. Among their distinct wooden buildings were the Hollola Municipal House (1902), the Suviranta artists\u2019 home for artist [[Eero J\u00e4rnefelt]], in [[Tuusulanj\u00e4rvi]], along the same lake shore where other artists would build their atelier homes, most notably [[Jean Sibelius]]. By far the largest scale project of the architectural firm was never realised, the [[Vyborg]] City Hall, which Nystr\u00f6m and Penttil\u00e4 had won in an architectural competition in 1899. Their entry is in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] style. However, over the following years, as the project awaited the go-ahead, the design changed to a more [[Renaissance Revival architecture|neo-renaissance]] style. The project was never built.<ref name=\"Rauske\"/>\n[[File:Lammin kirkko urut.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Interior, Lammi Church (1918-1929)]]\nIn total the firm employed 15 people, and as a teacher at the school of architecture Nystr\u00f6m was able to hire talented students. Among their staff who went on to have distinguished careers were Emil Werner von Essen, Kauno Kallio, Kalle Kontio, V\u00e4in\u00f6 Kein\u00e4nen, Clas Axel Gylden and [[Uno Ullberg]]. After the joint architectural firm was disbanded, each of the architects continued individually, but with Penttil\u00e4 continuing with their main clients, that is, the banks.<ref>Otto-I. Meurman, \n''Viipurin arkkitehdit'', Viipurin Suomalaisen Kirjallisuusseuran toimitteita 2, Helsinki, 1977.</ref>\n\nFollowing the break up of the Usko Nystr\u00f6m\u2500Petrelius\u2500Penttil\u00e4 Nystr\u00f6m continued to teach, but also worked on a number of architectural projects of his own. His former architect partner Vilho Penttil\u00e4 was killed during the [[Finnish Civil War]] of 1918. The medieval [[Lammi]] Church was burnt down during the war \u2013 and afterwards Nystr\u00f6m was awarded the commission for its restoration and reconstruction. Historian Rauske even calls the fire a \u201cblessing in disguise\u201d.<ref name=\"Rauske\"/> While the main outer granite walls had mostly been preserved, Nystr\u00f6m devoted his creativity to a completely new interior using reinforced concrete to create new vaults, which while inspired by medieval church architecture have a more modern feel, a colourful example of Art Nouveau but also in a fluidity that has affinities with [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]] which was already at its height at that time in central Europe. The work was finally completed in 1929, after Nystr\u00f6m's death.\n\n== Selection of works by Usko Nystr\u00f6m ==\n* Villa, En\u00e4j\u00e4rvi Lake, Sammatti (1895)\n* West-Finland school, Aino Voipion tie 30, Huittinen (1895)\n* Uudenmaankatu 17 apartment building, Helsinki (1898)\n* \u201cVanhakartano\u201d manor house, Kirkkokankaantie, Pori (1902)\n* Schalin apartment building, Kapteeninkatu 11 \u2013 Tehtaankatu 9, Helsinki (1902)\n* Virrat cemetery chapel, Virrat (1902)\n* Grand H\u00f4tel Cascade (nowadays the Imatran Valtionhotelli), Imatra (1903) \n* Wuorinen apartment building, Helsinki\n* Suviranta atelier home for artist Eero J\u00e4rnefeltin, Tuusulanj\u00e4rvi, J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 (1901)\n* St\u00e4det apartment building, Meritullinkatu 9, Helsinki (1905) \n* Mielikki apartment building, Kapteeninkatu 20\u201322, Helsinki (1906)\n* Vilhola apartment building, Vilhonkatu 9, Helsinki (1907)\n* Koint\u00e4hti apartment building, Pietarinkatu 9, Helsinki (1907)\n* Kotirinne apartment building, Pohjois Rautatiekatu 11 \u2013 Nervanderinkatu 1 \u2013 Ainonkatu 4, Helsinki (1911) \n* Cygnaeus School, Pori (1912)\n* [[Lammi Church]] restoration (1918-1929)\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=160px heights=130px>\nFile:Kuva 1 Virrat.jpg|Virrat cemetery chapel, Virrat (1902)\nFile:State hotel in Imatra.jpg|Grand H\u00f4tel Cascade (nowadays Imatran Valtionhotelli) Imatra (1903)\nFile:Kapteeninkatu 22, Helsinki, Finland.jpg|Mielikki apartment building, Helsinki (1906)\nFile:Pietarinkatu Helsinki.jpg|(centre) Koint\u00e4hti apartment building, Helsinki (1907)\nFile:Cygnaeuksen koulu (Pori).jpg|Cygnaeus School, Pori (1912)\nFile:Lammin kirkko helmikuussa 2007.jpg|Lammi Church restoration (1918-1929)\nFile:Lammin kirkko holvaus.jpg|Detail, Lammi Church restoration (1918-1929)\n</gallery>\n\n== Selection of works by Usko Nystr\u00f6m-Petrelius-Penttil\u00e4 ==\n* Wuorinen apartment building, Fredrikinkatu 19 \u2013 Merimiehenkatu 6, Helsinki (1896)\n* Vyborg Town Hall, Vyborg (nowadays in Russia) (1899 competition victory, redesigned up until 1920, never realised)\n* Apartment building, Uudenmaankatu 9, Helsinki (1900)\n* Kansallis-Osake-Pankki bank building, Kirkkokatu 6 \u2013 Pakkahuoneenkatu 11, Oulu (1900, demolished 1960)\n* Savonlinna Tourist Hotel, Savonlinna (1901)\n* Hollola Municipal House (1902)\n* Kansallis-Osake-Pankki bank building, Torkkelinkatu 8, Vyborg (1901)\n* Kataja apartment building, Kauppiaankatu 2, Katajanokka, Helsinki (1902)\n* Apartment building, Kristianinkatu 1, Kruununhaka, Helsinki (1902)\n* Apartment building, Oikokatu 13, Kruununhaka, Helsinki (1903)\n* Kotka Finnish School (nowadays the Arcus building of Kotka Lyceum High School) (1905)\n* Pohjolan Pirtti pavilion, Lammassaari, Helsinki (1905)\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=160px heights=130px>\nFile:Lahden yhteiskoulu.jpg|Lahti co-educational school, Lahti (1899)\nFile:Usko Nystr\u00f6m, Vyborg town hall, model.jpg|Vyborg City Hall, model (1899)\nFile:Kirkkokatu 6 Oulu 1900.jpg|KOP Bank building (left), Oulu (1900, demolished 1960)\nFile:Vyborg.

In 1892, soon after returning to Finland, he was appointed assistant lecturer at the Polytechnic Institute (founded 1879), where he himself had previously been a student, a position he held for the rest of his life, and where the head of the school at the time was Gustaf Nystr\u00f6m. He was a highly skilled draftsman and his talent was used first in teaching linear and free-hand drawing. In 1901 he was promoted to lecturer in architecture, teaching ancient and medieval architecture and their styles, along with exercises in design and drawing. For many years Nystr\u00f6m also taught ornamentation and style history at the Central School of Applied Arts in Helsinki (precursor to the present-day [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture]]). He received the honorary title of professor in 1922. It has often been noted by his former students how very popular he was as a teacher, in part due to his keen sense of humour but also in conveying something of his drawing skills to the students. He also had a significant role in spreading the Art Nouveau style to several generations of students.<ref>Pekka Korvenmaa (ed.), ''The Work of Architects'', Rakennustieto, Helsinki, 1992.</ref>\n\nNystr\u00f6m never married. He died suddenly on January 6, 1925 in [[Kotka]], while visiting his sister. He is buried in [[Hietaniemi cemetery]] in Helsinki. In 1928 the [[SAFA (architecture)|Finnish Association of Architects]] arranged a competition for the design of Nystr\u00f6m\u2019s gravestone: it was won by his former student, [[Alvar Aalto]]; the gravestone, in white marble, with the text ''Bene latuit'' from French philosopher [[Rene Descartes]]\u2019 work [[Meditations on First Philosophy|Meditations]], where he had quoted [[Ovid]], ''Bene vixit qui bene latuit'', i.e. The One who lives well, lives unnoticed.\n\n[[File:Viiskulma, Helsinki, 2014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|\"Neo-Renaissance\" Wuorinen apartment building, Helsinki (1896)]]\n{{multiple image\n   | footer    = \"Jugendstil\" Schalin building, Kapteeninkatu 11 \u2013 Tehtaankatu 9, Helsinki (1902)\n   | image1    = Kapteeninkatu 11, Helsinki.jpg\n   | width1    = {{#expr: (100 * 531 / 599) round 0}}\n   | alt1      = Street\n   | caption1  = Street view\n   | image2    = Kapteeninkatu 11, Helsinki, internal courtyard.jpg\n   | width2    = 200\n   | alt2      = Courtyard\n   | caption2  = \"White\" courtyard.\n   | image3    = \"Seaweed decoration\", Kapteeninkatu 11, Helsinki, Finland.jpg\n   | width3    = 200\n   | alt3      = Seaweed\n   | caption3  = \"Seaweed\" decoration on the street facade.\n   | footer_background=#BBDD99\n   | background color=#BBDD99\n   | width=160\n}}\n\nNystr\u00f6m had contributed to the journal Suomen Teollisuuslehti (Finnish Industrial Magazine) edited by his architecture partner Vilho Penttil\u00e4. However, his most significant written contributions were to the 11-volume encyclopaedia ''Tietosanakirja'' published between 1909 and 1922. Nystr\u00f6m wrote the descriptions for almost 300 entries.<ref name=\"Rauske\"/><ref>Jalmar Castr\u00e9n et al (eds.), ''Tietosanakirja, 11 osa, T\u00e4ydennysosa'', Helsinki, Tietosanakirja, 1922.</ref>\n\n== Architectural firm Usko Nystr\u00f6m\u2500Petrelius\u2500Penttil\u00e4 ==\nUsko Nyst\u00f6m established a joint architectural form with Albert Petrelius (1865\u20131946) and Vilho Penttil\u00e4 (1868\u20131918) in 1895 and the partnership continued until 1908. The office was one of many joint architectural firms established in Helsinki at around that time \u2013 [[Gesellius, Lindgren, and Saarinen]] becoming the most renowned. Each of the partners had at one time worked for the master builder J. G. Rosenberg. Nystr\u00f6m was the leading figure in the architectural firm \u2013 only his first name was included in its official name. Albert Petrelius was both an architect and master builder and as well as being a partner in the architectural form also simultaneously worked for a fire insurance company, while the architect Vilho Penttil\u00e4 was also editor-in-chief of the journal ''Suomen Teollisuuslehti'' (Finnish Industrial Magazine), and which provided an outlet for showing the works of the architectural firm. Petrelius and Penttil\u00e4 were members of the pro-Finnish language and pro-Independence [[Fennoman movement]] (at that time the vast majority of architects were Swedish-speaking). In fact, some of the architectural firm\u2019s customers were also connected with the Fennoman movement, in particular the KOP Bank ([[Kansallis-Osake-Pankki]]).\n\nAmong the most notable works of Usko Nystr\u00f6m\u2500Petrelius\u2500Penttil\u00e4 were 18 bourgeois apartment buildings in central Helsinki, designed and built between 1895 and 1907. Helsinki was going through a building boom period at that time, aided by the Companies Act of 1895 and new forms of credit institutions, at a time when industry in the cities was on the rise and there was a shortage of housing. The style of their architecture represents the period of transition from neo-gothic and neo-renaissance to the Jugendstil or Art Nouveau style, also referred to as the National Romantic style. Historian Eija Rauske suggests that models for the designs of the apartment blocks came from the major cities of central Europe, and in particular Paris and Vienna.<ref name=\"Rauske\"/> An idea of the transitional style of the architectural firm can be seen by comparing two apartment blocks, both fairly close to each other in central Helsinki. The Wuorinen apartment building is a 5-storey (plus attic storey) neo-Renaissance style building taking up an entire city block, with heavily rusticated ground floor (containing shops) and heavy roof cornice; the finesse of the facades is supposedly picked out in the exposed brickwork on the upper floors and plaster-cast emblems of various forms, in particular the letter W, referring to the client of the project. By contrast, the Schalin apartment building at Kapteeninkatu 11 \u2013 Tehtaankatu 9, Helsinki (1902), is a 5-storey (plus attic storey) Jugendstil or Art Nouveau work, in unpainted rough render decorated with patterns depicting seaweed made from granite insets. The corner dome has echoes of medieval castle towers. The fa\u00e7ade also includes seemingly randomly placed decorative balconies. The curved forms continue partly in the interior with some oval-shaped rooms. However, the rear internal courtyard is far more restrained and rational, and painted in white.<ref>Johnathan Moorhouse, Michael Carapetian, Leena Ahtola-Moorhouse, ''Helsinki Jugendstil Architecture 1895-1915.'' Helsinki, Otava, 1987.</ref>\n\nNystr\u00f6m\u2019s most famous work was designed during the period of the partnership \u2013 though it is attributed to him alone \u2013 the Grand H\u00f4tel Cascade (1903) (nowadays known as the Imatran Valtionhotelli) in Imatra. With its turreted towers, the work brings to mind the castles in France Nystr\u00f6m had seen during his travels there a decade earlier.<ref>Henrik Lilius, ''Imatran valtionhotelli: Kuvia rakennuksen vaiheista'', Helsinki, Alko, 1983.</ref>\n\nIn actual fact, the first building designs of Usko Nystr\u00f6m\u2500Petrelius\u2500Penttil\u00e4 were wooden buildings, designed in a rustic, proto-National Romantic style. Penttil\u00e4 even campaigned for a Finnish National Romantic style of architecture on the pages of the journal he edited, ''Suomen Teollisuuslehti'', with the designs showing exposed notched corner joints, rather than covering the logs with boarding, which had been the custom at that time. Among their distinct wooden buildings were the Hollola Municipal House (1902), the Suviranta artists\u2019 home for artist [[Eero J\u00e4rnefelt]], in [[Tuusulanj\u00e4rvi]], along the same lake shore where other artists would build their atelier homes, most notably [[Jean Sibelius]]. By far the largest scale project of the architectural firm was never realised, the [[Vyborg]] City Hall, which Nystr\u00f6m and Penttil\u00e4 had won in an architectural competition in 1899. Their entry is in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] style. However, over the following years, as the project awaited the go-ahead, the design changed to a more [[Renaissance Revival architecture|neo-renaissance]] style. The project was never built.<ref name=\"Rauske\"/>\n[[File:Lammin kirkko urut.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Interior, Lammi Church (1918-1929)]]\nIn total the firm employed 15 people, and as a teacher at the school of architecture Nystr\u00f6m was able to hire talented students. Among their staff who went on to have distinguished careers were Emil Werner von Essen, Kauno Kallio, Kalle Kontio, V\u00e4in\u00f6 Kein\u00e4nen, Clas Axel Gylden and [[Uno Ullberg]]. After the joint architectural firm was disbanded, each of the architects continued individually, but with Penttil\u00e4 continuing with their main clients, that is, the banks.<ref>Otto-I. Meurman, \n''Viipurin arkkitehdit'', Viipurin Suomalaisen Kirjallisuusseuran toimitteita 2, Helsinki, 1977.</ref>\n\nFollowing the break up of the Usko Nystr\u00f6m\u2500Petrelius\u2500Penttil\u00e4 Nystr\u00f6m continued to teach, but also worked on a number of architectural projects of his own. His former architect partner Vilho Penttil\u00e4 was killed during the [[Finnish Civil War]] of 1918. The medieval [[Lammi]] Church was burnt down during the war \u2013 and afterwards Nystr\u00f6m was awarded the commission for its restoration and reconstruction. Historian Rauske even calls the fire a \u201cblessing in disguise\u201d.<ref name=\"Rauske\"/> While the main outer granite walls had mostly been preserved, Nystr\u00f6m devoted his creativity to a completely new interior using reinforced concrete to create new vaults, which while inspired by medieval church architecture have a more modern feel, a colourful example of Art Nouveau but also in a fluidity that has affinities with [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]] which was already at its height at that time in central Europe. The work was finally completed in 1929, after Nystr\u00f6m\u2019s death.\n\n== Selection of works by Usko Nystr\u00f6m ==\n* Villa, En\u00e4j\u00e4rvi Lake, Sammatti (1895)\n* West-Finland school, Aino Voipion tie 30, Huittinen (1895)\n* Uudenmaankatu 17 apartment building, Helsinki (1898)\n* \u201cVanhakartano\u201d manor house, Kirkkokankaantie, Pori (1902)\n* Schalin apartment building, Kapteeninkatu 11 \u2013 Tehtaankatu 9, Helsinki (1902)\n* Virrat cemetery chapel, Virrat (1902)\n* Grand H\u00f4tel Cascade (nowadays the Imatran Valtionhotelli), Imatra (1903) \n* Wuorinen apartment building, Helsinki\n* Suviranta atelier home for artist Eero J\u00e4rnefeltin, Tuusulanj\u00e4rvi, J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 (1901)\n* St\u00e4det apartment building, Meritullinkatu 9, Helsinki (1905) \n* Mielikki apartment building, Kapteeninkatu 20\u201322, Helsinki (1906)\n* Vilhola apartment building, Vilhonkatu 9, Helsinki (1907)\n* Koint\u00e4hti apartment building, Pietarinkatu 9, Helsinki (1907)\n* Kotirinne apartment building, Pohjois Rautatiekatu 11 \u2013 Nervanderinkatu 1 \u2013 Ainonkatu 4, Helsinki (1911) \n* Cygnaeus School, Pori (1912)\n* [[Lammi Church]] restoration (1918-1929)\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=160px heights=130px>\nFile:Kuva 1 Virrat.jpg|Virrat cemetery chapel, Virrat (1902)\nFile:State hotel in Imatra.jpg|Grand H\u00f4tel Cascade (nowadays Imatran Valtionhotelli) Imatra (1903)\nFile:Kapteeninkatu 22, Helsinki, Finland.jpg|Mielikki apartment building, Helsinki (1906)\nFile:Pietarinkatu Helsinki.jpg|(centre) Koint\u00e4hti apartment building, Helsinki (1907)\nFile:Cygnaeuksen koulu (Pori).jpg|Cygnaeus School, Pori (1912)\nFile:Lammin kirkko helmikuussa 2007.jpg|Lammi Church restoration (1918-1929)\nFile:Lammin kirkko holvaus.jpg|Detail, Lammi Church restoration (1918-1929)\n</gallery>\n\n== Selection of works by Usko Nystr\u00f6m-Petrelius-Penttil\u00e4 ==\n* Wuorinen apartment building, Fredrikinkatu 19 \u2013 Merimiehenkatu 6, Helsinki (1896)\n* Vyborg Town Hall, Vyborg (nowadays in Russia) (1899 competition victory, redesigned up until 1920, never realised)\n* Apartment building, Uudenmaankatu 9, Helsinki (1900)\n* Kansallis-Osake-Pankki bank building, Kirkkokatu 6 \u2013 Pakkahuoneenkatu 11, Oulu (1900, demolished 1960)\n* Savonlinna Tourist Hotel, Savonlinna (1901)\n* Hollola Municipal House (1902)\n* Kansallis-Osake-Pankki bank building, Torkkelinkatu 8, Vyborg (1901)\n* Kataja apartment building, Kauppiaankatu 2, Katajanokka, Helsinki (1902)\n* Apartment building, Kristianinkatu 1, Kruununhaka, Helsinki (1902)\n* Apartment building, Oikokatu 13, Kruununhaka, Helsinki (1903)\n* Kotka Finnish School (nowadays the Arcus building of Kotka Lyceum High School) (1905)\n* Pohjolan Pirtti pavilion, Lammassaari, Helsinki (1905)\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=160px heights=130px>\nFile:Lahden yhteiskoulu.jpg|Lahti co-educational school, Lahti (1899)\nFile:Usko Nystr\u00f6m, Vyborg town hall, model.jpg|Vyborg City Hall, model (1899)\nFile:Kirkkokatu 6 Oulu 1900.jpg|KOP Bank building (left), Oulu (1900, demolished 1960)\nFile:Vyborg.

{"title_page": "Dye penetrant inspection", "text_new": "\n\n'''Dye penetrant inspection''' ('''DP'''), also called '''liquid penetrate inspection''' ('''LPI''') or '''penetrant testing''' ('''PT'''), is a widely applied and low-cost inspection method used to check surface-breaking defects in all [[Porosity|non-porous]] materials (metals, plastics, or ceramics). The penetrant may be applied to all non-ferrous materials and ferrous materials, although for ferrous components [[magnetic-particle inspection]] is often used instead for its subsurface detection capability.  LPI is used to detect casting, forging and welding surface defects such as hairline cracks, surface [[porosity]], leaks in new products jai , and [[fatigue crack]]s on in-service components.\n\n== History ==\nThe oil and whiting method used in the railroad industry in the early 1900s was the first recognized use of the principles of penetrants to detect cracks. The oil and whiting method used an oil solvent for cleaning followed by the application of a whiting or chalk coating, which absorbed oil from the cracks revealing their locations. Soon a dye was added to the liquid. By the 1940s, fluorescent or visible dye was added to the oil used to penetrate test objects.\n\nExperience showed that temperature and soak time were important. This started the practice of written instructions to provide standard, uniform results. The use of written procedures has evolved, giving the ability for design engineers and manufacturers to get the high standard results from any properly trained and certified liquid penetrant testing technician.\n\n== Principles ==\nDPI is based upon [[capillary action]], where low surface tension fluid penetrates into clean and dry surface-breaking discontinuities. Penetrant may be applied to the test component by dipping, spraying, or brushing. After adequate penetration time has been allowed, the excess penetrant is removed and a developer is applied. The developer helps to draw penetrant out of the flaw so that an invisible indication becomes visible to the inspector. Inspection is performed under ultraviolet or white light, depending on the type of dye used - [[fluorescent]] or nonfluorescent (visible).\n\n== Inspection steps ==\nBelow are the main steps of Liquid Penetrant Inspection:\n\n'''1. Pre-cleaning:'''\n\nThe test  surface is cleaned to remove any dirt, paint, oil, grease or any loose scale that could either keep penetrant out of a defect, or cause irrelevant or false indications. Cleaning methods may include [[solvent]]s, alkaline cleaning steps, [[vapor degreasing]], or media blasting. The end goal of this step is a clean surface where any defects present are open to the surface, dry, and free of contamination. Note that if media blasting is used, it may \"work over\" small discontinuities in the part, and an etching bath is recommended as a post-blasting treatment.\n\n[[Image:KD-Check Anwendungsbild.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Application of the penetrant to a part in a ventilated test area.]]\n\n'''2. Application of Penetrant:'''\n\nThe penetrant is then applied to the surface of the item being tested. The penetrant is usually a brilliant coloured mobile fluid with high wetting capability.<ref>https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/PenetrantTest/PTMaterials/surfaceenergy.htm</ref> The penetrant is allowed \"dwell time\" to soak into any flaws (generally 5 to 30 minutes). The dwell time mainly depends upon the penetrant being used, material being tested and the size of flaws sought.  As expected, smaller flaws require a longer penetration time.  Due to their incompatible nature one must be careful not to apply solvent-based penetrant to a surface which is to be inspected with a water-washable penetrant.\n\n'''3. Excess Penetrant Removal:'''\n\nThe excess penetrant is then removed from the surface.  The removal method is controlled by the type of penetrant used.  Water-washable, solvent-removable, [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] post-emulsifiable, or [[hydrophilicity|hydrophilic]] post-emulsifiable are the common choices.  [[Emulsifier]]s represent the highest sensitivity level, and chemically interact with the oily penetrant to make it removable with a water spray.  When using solvent remover and lint-free cloth it is important to not spray the solvent on the test surface directly, because this can remove the penetrant from the flaws.  If excess penetrant is not properly removed, once the developer is applied, it may leave a background in the developed area that can mask indications or defects.  In addition, this may also produce false indications severely hindering the ability to do a proper inspection. Also, the removal of excessive penetrant is done towards one direction either vertically or horizontally as the case may be.   \n\n'''4. Application of Developer:'''\n\nAfter excess penetrant has been removed, a white developer is applied to the sample.  Several developer types are available, including: [[non-aqueous wet developer]], dry powder, water-suspendable, and water-soluble.  Choice of developer is governed by penetrant compatibility (one can't use water-soluble or -suspendable developer with water-washable penetrant), and by inspection conditions.  When using non-aqueous wet developer (NAWD) or dry powder, the sample must be dried prior to application, while soluble and suspendable developers are applied with the part still wet from the previous step.  NAWD is commercially available in aerosol spray cans, and may employ [[acetone]], [[isopropyl alcohol]], or a propellant that is a combination of the two.  Developer should form a semi-transparent, even coating on the surface.\n\nThe developer draws penetrant from defects out onto the surface to form a visible indication, commonly known as bleed-out. Any areas that bleed out can indicate the location, orientation and possible types of defects on the surface.  Interpreting the results and characterizing defects from the indications found may require some training and/or experience [the indication size is not the actual size of the defect].\n\n'''5. Inspection:'''\n\nThe inspector will use visible light with adequate intensity (100 [[foot-candles]] or 1100 [[lux]] is typical) for visible dye penetrant. Ultraviolet (UV-A) radiation of adequate intensity (1,000 micro-watts per centimeter squared is common), along with low ambient light levels (less than 2 foot-candles) for fluorescent penetrant examinations.  Inspection of the test surface should take place after 10- to 30-minute development time, and is dependent on the penetrant and developer used.  This time delay allows the blotting action to occur.  The inspector may observe the sample for indication formation when using visible dye.  It is also good practice to observe indications as they form because the characteristics of the bleed out are a significant part of interpretation characterization of flaws.\n  \n'''6. Post Cleaning:'''\n\nThe test surface is often cleaned after inspection and recording of defects, especially if post-inspection coating processes are scheduled.\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\nThe main advantages of DPI are the speed of the test and the low cost. Disadvantages include the detection of only surface flaws, skin irritation, and the inspection should be on a smooth clean surface where excessive penetrant can be removed prior to being developed. Conducting the test on rough surfaces, such as \"as-welded\" welds, will make it difficult to remove any excessive penetrant and could result in false indications. Water-washable penetrant should be considered here if no other option is available. Also, on certain surfaces a great enough color contrast cannot be achieved or the dye will stain the workpiece.<ref>{{Citation | last = Kohan | first = Anthony Lawrence | title = Boiler operator's guide | page = 240 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 1997 | edition = 4th | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tAQ-Gc2xv-UC&pg=PA240 | isbn = 978-0-07-036574-2 | postscript =.}}</ref>\n\nLimited training is required for the operator \u2014 although experience is quite valuable. Proper cleaning is necessary to assure that surface contaminants have been removed and any defects present are clean and dry.  Some cleaning methods have been shown to be detrimental to test sensitivity, so acid etching to remove metal smearing and re-open the defect may be necessary.<ref>http://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/PenetrantTest/MethodsTech/materialsmear.htm</ref>\n\n== Standards ==\n;[[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)\n\n*ISO 3059, ''Non-destructive testing - Penetration testing and magnetic particle testing - Viewing conditions''\n* ISO 3452-1, ''Non-destructive testing.

Penetrant may be applied to the test component by dipping, spraying, or brushing. After adequate penetration time has been allowed, the excess penetrant is removed and a developer is applied. The developer helps to draw penetrant out of the flaw so that an invisible indication becomes visible to the inspector. Inspection is performed under ultraviolet or white light, depending on the type of dye used - [[fluorescent]] or nonfluorescent (visible).\n\n== Inspection steps ==\nBelow are the main steps of Liquid Penetrant Inspection:\n\n'''1. Pre-cleaning:'''\n\nThe test  surface is cleaned to remove any dirt, paint, oil, grease or any loose scale that could either keep penetrant out of a defect, or cause irrelevant or false indications. Cleaning methods may include [[solvent]]s, alkaline cleaning steps, [[vapor degreasing]], or media blasting. The end goal of this step is a clean surface where any defects present are open to the surface, dry, and free of contamination. Note that if media blasting is used, it may \"work over\" small discontinuities in the part, and an etching bath is recommended as a post-blasting treatment.\n\n[[Image:KD-Check Anwendungsbild.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Application of the penetrant to a part in a ventilated test area.]]\n\n'''2. Application of Penetrant:'''\n\nThe penetrant is then applied to the surface of the item being tested. The penetrant is usually a brilliant coloured mobile fluid with high wetting capability.<ref>https://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/PenetrantTest/PTMaterials/surfaceenergy.htm</ref> The penetrant is allowed \"dwell time\" to soak into any flaws (generally 5 to 30 minutes). The dwell time mainly depends upon the penetrant being used, material being tested and the size of flaws sought.  As expected, smaller flaws require a longer penetration time.  Due to their incompatible nature one must be careful not to apply solvent-based penetrant to a surface which is to be inspected with a water-washable penetrant.\n\n'''3. Excess Penetrant Removal:'''\n\nThe excess penetrant is then removed from the surface.  The removal method is controlled by the type of penetrant used.  Water-washable, solvent-removable, [[Lipophilicity|lipophilic]] post-emulsifiable, or [[hydrophilicity|hydrophilic]] post-emulsifiable are the common choices.  [[Emulsifier]]s represent the highest sensitivity level, and chemically interact with the oily penetrant to make it removable with a water spray.  When using solvent remover and lint-free cloth it is important to not spray the solvent on the test surface directly, because this can remove the penetrant from the flaws.  If excess penetrant is not properly removed, once the developer is applied, it may leave a background in the developed area that can mask indications or defects.  In addition, this may also produce false indications severely hindering the ability to do a proper inspection. Also, the removal of excessive penetrant is done towards one direction either vertically or horizontally as the case may be.   \n\n'''4. Application of Developer:'''\n\nAfter excess penetrant has been removed, a white developer is applied to the sample.  Several developer types are available, including: [[non-aqueous wet developer]], dry powder, water-suspendable, and water-soluble.  Choice of developer is governed by penetrant compatibility (one can't use water-soluble or -suspendable developer with water-washable penetrant), and by inspection conditions.  When using non-aqueous wet developer (NAWD) or dry powder, the sample must be dried prior to application, while soluble and suspendable developers are applied with the part still wet from the previous step.  NAWD is commercially available in aerosol spray cans, and may employ [[acetone]], [[isopropyl alcohol]], or a propellant that is a combination of the two.  Developer should form a semi-transparent, even coating on the surface.\n\nThe developer draws penetrant from defects out onto the surface to form a visible indication, commonly known as bleed-out. Any areas that bleed out can indicate the location, orientation and possible types of defects on the surface.  Interpreting the results and characterizing defects from the indications found may require some training and/or experience [the indication size is not the actual size of the defect].\n\n'''5. Inspection:'''\n\nThe inspector will use visible light with adequate intensity (100 [[foot-candles]] or 1100 [[lux]] is typical) for visible dye penetrant. Ultraviolet (UV-A) radiation of adequate intensity (1,000 micro-watts per centimeter squared is common), along with low ambient light levels (less than 2 foot-candles) for fluorescent penetrant examinations.  Inspection of the test surface should take place after 10- to 30-minute development time, and is dependent on the penetrant and developer used.  This time delay allows the blotting action to occur.  The inspector may observe the sample for indication formation when using visible dye.  It is also good practice to observe indications as they form because the characteristics of the bleed out are a significant part of interpretation characterization of flaws.\n  \n'''6. Post Cleaning:'''\n\nThe test surface is often cleaned after inspection and recording of defects, especially if post-inspection coating processes are scheduled.\n\n== Advantages and disadvantages ==\nThe main advantages of DPI are the speed of the test and the low cost. Disadvantages include the detection of only surface flaws, skin irritation, and the inspection should be on a smooth clean surface where excessive penetrant can be removed prior to being developed. Conducting the test on rough surfaces, such as \"as-welded\" welds, will make it difficult to remove any excessive penetrant and could result in false indications. Water-washable penetrant should be considered here if no other option is available. Also, on certain surfaces a great enough color contrast cannot be achieved or the dye will stain the workpiece.<ref>{{Citation | last = Kohan | first = Anthony Lawrence | title = Boiler operator's guide | page = 240 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 1997 | edition = 4th | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tAQ-Gc2xv-UC&pg=PA240 | isbn = 978-0-07-036574-2 | postscript =.}}</ref>\n\nLimited training is required for the operator \u2014 although experience is quite valuable. Proper cleaning is necessary to assure that surface contaminants have been removed and any defects present are clean and dry.  Some cleaning methods have been shown to be detrimental to test sensitivity, so acid etching to remove metal smearing and re-open the defect may be necessary.<ref>http://www.nde-ed.org/EducationResources/CommunityCollege/PenetrantTest/MethodsTech/materialsmear.htm</ref>\n\n== Standards ==\n;[[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)\n\n*ISO 3059, ''Non-destructive testing - Penetration testing and magnetic particle testing - Viewing conditions''\n* ISO 3452-1, ''Non-destructive testing.

She was well-educated for a woman in her era, and knew French, Spanish, and Italian. She was a member of the Sidney/Essex circle from birth, through her father, first cousin to Sir [[Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Sidney]] and [[Mary Sidney|Mary, Countess of Pembroke]]; she was a close friend of Essex's sisters [[Penelope Blount, Countess of Devonshire|Penelope Rich]] and [[Dorothy Percy, Countess of Northumberland]], and the latter named one of her daughters Lucy after her.\n\nLucy Harington married [[Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford]], on 12 December 1594, when she was thirteen years old and he was twenty-two, at [[St Dunstan's, Stepney|St Dunstan's on Stepney Green]]. She miscarried her first child in February 1596 at Bedford House on the [[Strand, London|Strand]] in London.<ref>Lesley Lawson, ''Out of the Shadows'' (London, 2007), pp. 19, 28.</ref>\n\nThe Earl of Bedford got himself into serious trouble in 1601 when he rode with the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] in rebellion against Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]. The Bedford fortunes revived when the reign of [[James I of England|James I]] began in 1603. Several English nobles secretly sent representatives into Scotland to try to gain favour and court appointments.<ref>''Journal of Sir Roger Wilbraham'' (London, 1902), p. 55.</ref> The Countess of Bedford audaciously skipped the late queen's funeral and rode hard to the Scottish border, ahead of a party of gentlewomen appointed by the [[Privy Council]], and got an audience in Scotland with the new king's wife [[Anne of Denmark]]. The new queen immediately made her a [[Lady of the Bedchamber]] and she became a trusted confidant.<ref>John Leeds Barroll, ''Anna of Denmark, Queen of England'' (Philadelphia, 2001), pp. 43-45.</ref>\n\n==Masquing==\nBedford performed in several of the [[masque]]s staged at Court in the early 17th century, including ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]'', ''[[Hymenaei]]'', ''[[The Masque of Beauty]]'', ''[[The Masque of Queens]]'', and ''[[The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses]]''. On two occassions in 1617, she functioned as a theatrical producer, instigating and organising the 1617 Court performance of [[Robert White (fl. 1617)|Robert White's]] masque ''Cupid's Banishment'', acted by students from the first English girls' school, the [[Ladies Hall]] in [[Deptford]]. In February 1617 the masque by [[Ben Jonson]] presented by [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Lord Hay]] to the French ambassador [[Charles Cauchon de Maupas|Baron de Tour]], the ''[[Lovers Made Men]]'', was staged by the Countess of Bedford.<ref>Norman Egbert McClure, ''The Letters of John Chamberlain'', vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), pp. 51, 55, 57.</ref>\n\n==Patronage==\n'''Jonson'''<br>\nShe was a noted patron of [[Ben Jonson]], who dedicated his play ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' (1600) to her and addressed several of his ''Epigrams'' to her, extolling her patronage. By his own admission, Jonson portrayed her as Ethra in his lost pastoral, ''The May Lord'' \u2014 though he may also have depicted her as Lady Haughty, president of the Collegiates in [[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman|''Epicene'']] (1609). When Jonson was imprisoned in 1605 for his role in the ''[[Eastward Ho]]'' scandal, he wrote a letter to an unknown lady, who is thought by some scholars to have been the Countess of Bedford.<ref>Joseph, p. 98.</ref>\n\n'''Others'''<br>\nIn addition to Jonson, Bedford supported other significant poets of her era, including [[Michael Drayton]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[George Chapman]], and [[John Donne]]. She might be the \"Idea\" of Drayton's pastoral ''Idea: The Shepherd's Garland'' (1593) and of his sonnet sequence ''Idea's Mirror'' (1594). Drayton dedicated his ''Mortimeriados'' (1594) to her, as Daniel did his ''Vision of the Twelve Goddesses'' (1604). Bedford patronised a range of lesser writers of her era, including the translator [[John Florio]], who credited her help in his translation of the essays of [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]. She \"received more dedications than any other woman associated with the drama\" in her era.<ref>Bergeron, p. 82.</ref>\n\nBedford was the godmother of Donne's second daughter, also named Lucy, and the namesake of Sir Henry Goodere's daughter (later wife of Sir Francis Nethersole). Donne seems to have been deeply involved with her on a psychological level \u2014 \"Most of the poems of Donne's middle years relate, in one way or another, to this glamorous and intriguing woman.\"<ref>Carey, p. xxvii.</ref> Her contradictions could be provocative: the Countess was a dedicated [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], and supported many Calvinist authors and thinkers \u2013 yet she allegedly performed bare-breasted in Court masques. Her relationships with some of her poets, including Donne and Drayton, were sometimes uneven; poets who dedicated their works to her could also complain of the loss of her favour.\n\nShe was also receptive to women poets, such as her cousin [[Cecily Bulstrode]]. Bedford occasionally wrote poems herself, including a poem Donne claims he saw in the garden of her Twickenham estate. Only one of her poems is extant, \"Death be not proud, thy hand gave not this blow\", an epitaph on Bulstrode. This poem has been attributed to Donne, and suggestively shares an opening clause with his [[Death Be Not Proud (poem)|Holy Sonnet X]]; nevertheless, it is now considered much more likely to be Bedford's poem. Bedford certainly wrote an elegy on the death of her cousin [[Bridget Markham]] at Twickenham Park in 1609.<ref>See external links.</ref>\n\nWhile best remembered for her patronage of writers, Bedford also supported musicians, [[John Dowland]] being a noteworthy example. She is the dedicatee of Dowland's ''[[Second Booke of Songes or Ayres|Second Book of Songs]]'' (1600).\n\nA few scholars have identified the Earl and Countess of Bedford as the allegorised couple in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]],'' who left \"no posterity\" (line 59) \u2014 yet since the poem was published in 1601, when the Countess was only twenty years old, the identification has struck others as unlikely.\n\n'''Gardens'''<br>\nShe was a significant figure in the development of English country-house and garden design, centering on her estates at [[Twickenham Park]] and [[Moor Park (house)|Moor Park]]. An Italian writer [[Giacomo Castelvetro]] dedicated a book on fruit and vegetables to her.<ref>Joan Thirsk,''Food in Early Modern England'' (London, 2007), p. 67.</ref> She described her building and improvements at Moor Park in a letter to a friend; \"my works att the More, whear I have been a patcher this sommer and I am still adding some trifles of pleasure to that place I am so much love with, as I were so fond of any man I were in hard case.\"<ref>Lord Braybrooke, ''The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis'' (London, 1842), p. 48.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAs one of the most influential women at James's court, she was also involved in a range of political issues; in the later part of the reign she was among the most prominent supporters of [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]], who had been brought up in her father's household at [[Coombe Abbey]].\n\nHer husband, the Earl of Bedford fell from his horse in July 1613 and was seriously injured.<ref>Lesley Lawson, ''Out of the Shadows'' (London, 2007), pp. 121-2.</ref> The Countess gave up a plan to travel to [[Spa, Belgium]] for her health. [[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] wrote that she came back to the royal court, but affected by grief she used less cosmetics than the other women at court, \"Marry, she is somewhat reformed in her attire, and forebears painting, which they say makes her somewhat strange among so many vizards, which together with their frizzled powdered hair makes them look all alike, so you can scant know one from another at first view.\"<ref>[[Thomas Birch]] & Robert Folkestone Williams, [https://archive.org/details/courtandtimesja00willgoog/page/n286/mode/2up ''The Court and times of James the First'', vol. 1 (London, 1848), p. 262.</ref> \n\nIn 1617 she was godmother of Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of [[Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun]] and Louisa Gordon whose mother [[Genevi\u00e8ve Petau de Maulette]] is said to have taught French to Elizabeth of Bohemia. The other godparents were the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford|Earl of Hertford]] and [[Jean Ker, Countess of Roxburghe|Jean Drummond, Countess of Roxburghe]].<ref>Robert Gordon, ''Genealogical history of the Earldom of Sutherland'' (Edinburgh, 1813), p. 343.</ref>\n\nProminent as she was, both Bedford and her husband had serious financial problems throughout their lives. Lady Bedford reportedly had debts of \u00a350,000 in 1619, apart from the Earl's massive indebtedness.\n\nThe court physician [[Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne]] noted she had \"podagra\" or [[gout]].<ref>Henry Ellis, ''Original Letters'', 2nd series vol. 3 (London, 1827), p. 247.</ref> In 1619 he treated her for the [[smallpox]] that blinded her in one eye, and in 1620 treated her for depression which he recorded as \"hypochondriacus\".<ref>Lesley Lawson, ''Out of the Shadows'' (London, 2007), pp. 149-51, 155.</ref>\n\nLucy, Countess of Bedford died in the same month as her husband, May 1627.

Donne seems to have been deeply involved with her on a psychological level \u2014 \"Most of the poems of Donne's middle years relate, in one way or another, to this glamorous and intriguing woman.\"<ref>Carey, p. xxvii.</ref> Her contradictions could be provocative: the Countess was a dedicated [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], and supported many Calvinist authors and thinkers \u2013 yet she allegedly performed bare-breasted in Court masques. Her relationships with some of her poets, including Donne and Drayton, were sometimes uneven; poets who dedicated their works to her could also complain of the loss of her favour.\n\nShe was also receptive to women poets, such as her cousin [[Cecily Bulstrode]]. Bedford occasionally wrote poems herself, including a poem Donne claims he saw in the garden of her Twickenham estate. Only one of her poems is extant, \"Death be not proud, thy hand gave not this blow\", an epitaph on Bulstrode. This poem has been attributed to Donne, and suggestively shares an opening clause with his [[Death Be Not Proud (poem)|Holy Sonnet X]]; nevertheless, it is now considered much more likely to be Bedford's poem. Bedford certainly wrote an elegy on the death of her cousin [[Bridget Markham]] at Twickenham Park in 1609.<ref>See external links.</ref>\n\nWhile best remembered for her patronage of writers, Bedford also supported musicians, [[John Dowland]] being a noteworthy example. She is the dedicatee of Dowland's ''[[Second Booke of Songes or Ayres|Second Book of Songs]]'' (1600).\n\nA few scholars have identified the Earl and Countess of Bedford as the allegorised couple in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]],'' who left \"no posterity\" (line 59) \u2014 yet since the poem was published in 1601, when the Countess was only twenty years old, the identification has struck others as unlikely.\n\n'''Gardens'''<br>\nShe was a significant figure in the development of English country-house and garden design, centering on her estates at [[Twickenham Park]] and [[Moor Park (house)|Moor Park]]. An Italian writer [[Giacomo Castelvetro]] dedicated a book on fruit and vegetables to her.<ref>Joan Thirsk,''Food in Early Modern England'' (London, 2007), p. 67.</ref> She described her building and improvements at Moor Park in a letter to a friend; \"my works att the More, whear I have been a patcher this sommer and I am still adding some trifles of pleasure to that place I am so much love with, as I were so fond of any man I were in hard case.\"<ref>Lord Braybrooke, ''The Private Correspondence of Jane Lady Cornwallis'' (London, 1842), p. 48.</ref>\n\n\n==Career==\nAs one of the most influential women at James's court, she was also involved in a range of political issues; in the later part of the reign she was among the most prominent supporters of [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]], who had been brought up in her father's household at [[Coombe Abbey]].\n\nHer husband, the Earl of Bedford fell from his horse in July 1613 and was seriously injured.<ref>Lesley Lawson, ''Out of the Shadows'' (London, 2007), pp. 121-2.</ref> The Countess gave up a plan to travel to [[Spa, Belgium]] for her health. [[John Chamberlain (letter writer)|John Chamberlain]] wrote that she came back to the royal court, but affected by grief she used less cosmetics than the other women at court, \"Marry, she is somewhat reformed in her attire, and forebears painting, which they say makes her somewhat strange among so many vizards, which together with their frizzled powdered hair makes them look all alike, so you can scant know one from another at first view.\"<ref>[[Thomas Birch]] & Robert Folkestone Williams, [https://archive.org/details/courtandtimesja00willgoog/page/n286/mode/2up ''The Court and times of James the First'', vol. 1 (London, 1848), p. 262.</ref> \n\nIn 1617 she was godmother of Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of [[Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet|Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun]] and Louisa Gordon whose mother [[Genevi\u00e8ve Petau de Maulette]] is said to have taught French to Elizabeth of Bohemia. The other godparents were the [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford|Earl of Hertford]] and [[Jean Ker, Countess of Roxburghe|Jean Drummond, Countess of Roxburghe]].<ref>Robert Gordon, ''Genealogical history of the Earldom of Sutherland'' (Edinburgh, 1813), p. 343.</ref>\n\nProminent as she was, both Bedford and her husband had serious financial problems throughout their lives. Lady Bedford reportedly had debts of \u00a350,000 in 1619, apart from the Earl's massive indebtedness.\n\nThe court physician [[Th\u00e9odore de Mayerne]] noted she had \"podagra\" or [[gout]].<ref>Henry Ellis, ''Original Letters'', 2nd series vol. 3 (London, 1827), p. 247.</ref> In 1619 he treated her for the [[smallpox]] that blinded her in one eye, and in 1620 treated her for depression which he recorded as \"hypochondriacus\".<ref>Lesley Lawson, ''Out of the Shadows'' (London, 2007), pp. 149-51, 155.</ref>\n\nLucy, Countess of Bedford died in the same month as her husband, May 1627. None of their children survived infancy.\n\n== In fiction==\n* Lucy Russell is the subject of ''The Noble Assassin'' (2011), a historical novel by Christie Dickason.\n* Vivian Bearing refers to herself as Lucy, Countess of Bedford on one occasion in Margaret Edson's play [[Wit (play)|''Wit'']].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Barroll, John Leeds.

Instead, they are planning to get their daughter married to wealthy businessman Prem Rajendra Bharadwaj. At the day of the wedding, there's a great dancing contest and to allow Simar to participate in it without disturbing their parents, Roli takes Simar's place until the latter returns. However, Simar is late and thus, dressed up and veiled Roli is forced to marry Prem. This creates problems, as Simar and Prem love each other and Roli is in love with Siddhand. After some time, everybody unites with the person he/she loves and both Simar and Roli are accepted in Bharadwaj House. Nirmala ([[Jayati Bhatia]]), Simar and Roli's grandmother-in-law and family [[matriarch]] and Rajendra and Sujata, their parents-in-law, have deep trust in the sisters and always support them but Pari, Uma and Khushi, the other daughter-in-laws of the Bharadwajs, are jealous of them as they do not get such attention and respect due to their craftiness and greed and try to create difficulties in their lives from time to time. Simar is unable to conceive again after a [[miscarriage]] and Khushi ([[Jyotsna Chandola]]) agrees to become a [[surrogate mother]] of Prem and Simar's child. A daughter named Anjali is born and the Bharadwajs look after her with much love and care. But later, Roli has a car accident and unintentionally runs over a woman named Sunaina. While looking around the place of the accident for clues, Simar is kidnapped by Sunaina's husband Vikrant and forced to leave her family and look after his daughter Sanjana.\n\n===2 years later===\nSimar returns to her family to find out Prem has remarried to another woman named Surabhi ([[Nehalaxmi Iyer]]). Simar, Roli, Prem and Siddhant also have to cope up with a [[supernatural]] creature: Sunaina's [[spirit]] who has returned for a revenge, and also with Vikrant, who falls in love with Simar. Eventually, Sunaina and Surabhi (who tries to kill Simar), are banished. Vikrant tries to murder Prem and is sent to jail. Sanjana is adopted by Simar and Prem.\n\nLater, the story revolves around Simar, Roli, Prem and Siddhant and how they protect Bharadwaj House from some [[supernatural]] creatures who want to destroy them. These [[supernatural]] creatures include Sunaina's [[soul]], [[ichchhadhari naagin|a shapeshifting female serpent]] named Maya ([[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]]), daayans named Mohini (late [[Pratyusha Banerjee]]) and Indravati, Patali [[Devi]]-Gayatri, [[ghosts]] named Maalti, Madhavi and Chhoti Dulhan (Young Bride), [[Shaitan]] ([[Kaal]]), a [[Moon]] Jewel (Princess) named Chandramani and another two daayans named Mahamaya and Kamya. During defeating Patali [[Devi]]-Gayatri and [[Kaal]], Simar's life gets in danger. To protect her elder sister, Roli sacrifices her life and she dies. After Roli's sad demise, Siddhand is remarried to Prerna ([[Mansi Srivastava]]), Simar's childhood friend and moves abroad with her. To gain his powers back and return to the world, [[Kaal]], with the help of some [[witches]], among which are Mahamaya and Kamya, casts a spell on Simar and impregnates her with a child possessing evil powers. Simar has no other option but to leave Bharadwaj House with her newborn son Piyush.\n\n===16 years later===\nAfter major time leaps, the story shows Simar ([[Keerti Gaekwad Kelkar]]) and Piyush ([[Varun Sharma]]) returning to Bharadwaj House and reuniting with their family. Simar and Prem ([[Dheeraj Dhoopar]]/[[Mazher Sayed]])'s daughter Anjali ([[Vaishali Takkar]]), brought up by Bharadwaj's treacherous and crafty daughter-in-law Khushi, has grown up to be a spoilt and selfish fashionista, who blames her mother for abandoning her. Simar and Prem together help their children in their lives. They marry Anjali to Vikram Sanjeev Agarwal (Siddharth Shivpuri) and later Piyush to his best friend Roshni Sumit Kapoor (Nikki Sharma). After Simar helps Anjali managing her marriage, Anjali accepts her mother.\n\n[[Kaal]] awakens on Piyush's 25th birthday, possessing him, and killing Roshni's father, Sumit Kapoor ([[Rushad Rana]]), but is finally defeated by a [[sorceress (fantasy)|sorceress]] named Ridhima. Later, Anjali is divorces her husband and returns to the Bharadwaj House. Sanjana ([[Krissann Barretto]]) returns to Bharadwaj House from [[London]], where she was sent years ago to pursue higher studies. Upon realising Sanjana and her college friend Sameer Dhanraj Kapoor ([[Rohan Mehra]])'s mutual feelings, the Bharadwajs fix their marriage. However, Anjali discovers that Sameer is a fraud who is conspiring against the Bharadwajs and to spare herself from the same fate, she marries Sameer in a secret ceremony. She humiliates her family members and treats them like servants. She even slaps her mother Simar. After Piyush plots a master plan to get the Bharadwajs property back from Anjali, she threatens to kill her own mother but is stopped by Simar who shoots her and Anjali falls into a coma.\n\nBhairavi ([[Vandana Vithlani]]), Sameer's mother is revealed to have shot Anjali. Together with Sameer, she enters the Bharadwajs' lives to avenge Prem for running her husband and Sameer's father over. It is subsequently revealed than Bhairavi murdered him herself after he discovered she was a drug dealer and is using the Bharadwajs as a cover-up. After absorbing [[supernatural]] powers, Bhairavi turns into a ''daayan'' and kills Simar, leaving the Bharadwajs heartbroken. However, the Mother [[Goddess]] [[Durga]], deeply worshipped by the Bharadwaj Family, enters their household in the form of Simar, to destroy Bhairavi and bring Simar back to life. After her defeat, Bhairavi is arrested. Sameer repents for his mistakes and the Bharadwajs forgive and accept him after realising he truly loves Sanjana. Anjali wakes up from coma and asks forgiveness from all the family members but in reality, her purpose is taking Sameer away from Sanjana. Her intentions are revealed when she tries to kill her new fianc\u00e8e Sahil and set Bharadwaj Mansion on fire, and she is arrested. Simar considers her daughter dead and asks the other family members to forget about her. The Saga of the Mystery Box begins, leading to Aaliya, who shoots Roshni with a gun to avenge her father's death who had committed suicide due to Piyush's mistake, and Roshni sadly dies, leaving the family in sadness and making Piyush mad.\n\n6 months pass after Roshni's sad demise. The show portrays the story of Simar and Prem searching for their son Piyush who got lost after Roshni's death 6 months prior, and managing the married life of their adopted daughter, Sanjana. Simar finds out that Piyush has lost his memory and is being looked after by a girl named Avni ([[Monica Sharma]]) and her mother, Hema. Simar takes her son back to Bharadwaj House together with Avni and Hema. Bhairavi has returned from jail and is living with Sameer and Sanjana, but is actually plotting her revenge, having paid Avni and Hema to kidnap Piyush and destroy the Bharadwaj Family. Sanjana loses her unborn child. When Avni tries to expose Bhairavi, the latter attempts to kill her but only succeeds in murdering Avni's mother. Bhairavi shooting a gun leads to Piyush regaining his memory. In the end, Simar kills Bhairavi and Piyush marries Avni, promising her that he would always be by her side. The Bharadwajs worship the Mother [[Goddess]] and celebrate togetherness. Pari apologises to Simar for her past mistakes. Simar also remembers her sister Roli and Nirmala says that the Bharadwaj Family is not only a family but a thought.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dipika Kakar]] as Simar Jamnalal Dwivedi/ Simar Prem

Instead, they are planning to get their daughter married to wealthy businessman Prem Rajendra Bharadwaj. At the day of the wedding, there's a great dancing contest and to allow Simar to participate in it without disturbing their parents, Roli takes Simar's place until the latter returns. However, Simar is late and thus, dressed up and veiled Roli is forced to marry Prem. This creates problems, as Simar and Prem love each other and Roli is in love with Siddhand. After some time, everybody unites with the person he/she loves and both Simar and Roli are accepted in Bharadwaj House. Nirmala ([[Jayati Bhatia]]), Simar and Roli's grandmother-in-law and family [[matriarch]] and Rajendra and Sujata, their parents-in-law, have deep trust in the sisters and always support them but Pari, Uma and Khushi, the other daughter-in-laws of the Bharadwajs, are jealous of them as they do not get such attention and respect due to their craftiness and greed and try to create difficulties in their lives from time to time. Simar is unable to conceive again after a [[miscarriage]] and Khushi ([[Jyotsna Chandola]]) agrees to become a [[surrogate mother]] of Prem and Simar's child. A daughter named Anjali is born and the Bharadwajs look after her with much love and care. But later, Roli has a car accident and unintentionally runs over a woman named Sunaina. While looking around the place of the accident for clues, Simar is kidnapped by Sunaina's husband Vikrant and forced to leave her family and look after his daughter Sanjana.\n\n===2 years later===\nSimar returns to her family to find out Prem has remarried to another woman named Surabhi ([[Nehalaxmi Iyer]]). Simar, Roli, Prem and Siddhant also have to cope up with a [[supernatural]] creature: Sunaina's [[spirit]] who has returned for a revenge, and also with Vikrant, who falls in love with Simar. Eventually, Sunaina and Surabhi (who tries to kill Simar), are banished. Vikrant tries to murder Prem and is sent to jail. Sanjana is adopted by Simar and Prem.\n\nLater, the story revolves around Simar, Roli, Prem and Siddhant and how they protect Bharadwaj House from some [[supernatural]] creatures who want to destroy them. These [[supernatural]] creatures include Sunaina's [[soul]], [[ichchhadhari naagin|a shapeshifting female serpent]] named Maya ([[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]]), daayans named Mohini (late [[Pratyusha Banerjee]]) and Indravati, Patali [[Devi]]-Gayatri, [[ghosts]] named Maalti, Madhavi and Chhoti Dulhan (Young Bride), [[Shaitan]] ([[Kaal]]), a [[Moon]] Jewel (Princess) named Chandramani and another two daayans named Mahamaya and Kamya. During defeating Patali [[Devi]]-Gayatri and [[Kaal]], Simar's life gets in danger. To protect her elder sister, Roli sacrifices her life and she dies. After Roli's sad demise, Siddhand is remarried to Prerna ([[Mansi Srivastava]]), Simar's childhood friend and moves abroad with her. To gain his powers back and return to the world, [[Kaal]], with the help of some [[witches]], among which are Mahamaya and Kamya, casts a spell on Simar and impregnates her with a child possessing evil powers. Simar has no other option but to leave Bharadwaj House with her newborn son Piyush.\n\n===16 years later===\nAfter major time leaps, the story shows Simar ([[Keerti Gaekwad Kelkar]]) and Piyush ([[Varun Sharma]]) returning to Bharadwaj House and reuniting with their family. Simar and Prem ([[Dheeraj Dhoopar]]/[[Mazher Sayed]])'s daughter Anjali ([[Vaishali Takkar]]), brought up by Bharadwaj's treacherous and crafty daughter-in-law Khushi, has grown up to be a spoilt and selfish fashionista, who blames her mother for abandoning her. Simar and Prem together help their children in their lives. They marry Anjali to Vikram Sanjeev Agarwal (Siddharth Shivpuri) and later Piyush to his best friend Roshni Sumit Kapoor (Nikki Sharma). After Simar helps Anjali managing her marriage, Anjali accepts her mother.\n\n[[Kaal]] awakens on Piyush's 25th birthday, possessing him, and killing Roshni's father, Sumit Kapoor ([[Rushad Rana]]), but is finally defeated by a [[sorceress (fantasy)|sorceress]] named Ridhima. Later, Anjali is divorces her husband and returns to the Bharadwaj House. Sanjana ([[Krissann Barretto]]) returns to Bharadwaj House from [[London]], where she was sent years ago to pursue higher studies. Upon realising Sanjana and her college friend Sameer Dhanraj Kapoor ([[Rohan Mehra]])'s mutual feelings, the Bharadwajs fix their marriage. However, Anjali discovers that Sameer is a fraud who is conspiring against the Bharadwajs and to spare herself from the same fate, she marries Sameer in a secret ceremony. She humiliates her family members and treats them like servants. She even slaps her mother Simar. After Piyush plots a master plan to get the Bharadwajs property back from Anjali, she threatens to kill her own mother but is stopped by Simar who shoots her and Anjali falls into a coma.\n\nBhairavi ([[Vandana Vithlani]]), Sameer's mother is revealed to have shot Anjali. Together with Sameer, she enters the Bharadwajs' lives to avenge Prem for running her husband and Sameer's father over. It is subsequently revealed than Bhairavi murdered him herself after he discovered she was a drug dealer and is using the Bharadwajs as a cover-up. After absorbing [[supernatural]] powers, Bhairavi turns into a ''daayan'' and kills Simar, leaving the Bharadwajs heartbroken. However, the Mother [[Goddess]] [[Durga]], deeply worshipped by the Bharadwaj Family, enters their household in the form of Simar, to destroy Bhairavi and bring Simar back to life. After her defeat, Bhairavi is arrested. Sameer repents for his mistakes and the Bharadwajs forgive and accept him after realising he truly loves Sanjana. Anjali wakes up from coma and asks forgiveness from all the family members but in reality, her purpose is taking Sameer away from Sanjana. Her intentions are revealed when she tries to kill her new fianc\u00e8e Sahil and set Bharadwaj Mansion on fire, and she is arrested. Simar considers her daughter dead and asks the other family members to forget about her. The Saga of the Mystery Box begins, leading to Aaliya, who shoots Roshni with a gun to avenge her father's death who had committed suicide due to Piyush's mistake, and Roshni sadly dies, leaving the family in sadness and making Piyush mad.\n\n6 months pass after Roshni's sad demise. The show portrays the story of Simar and Prem searching for their son Piyush who got lost after Roshni's death 6 months prior, and managing the married life of their adopted daughter, Sanjana. Simar finds out that Piyush has lost his memory and is being looked after by a girl named Avni ([[Monica Sharma]]) and her mother, Hema. Simar takes her son back to Bharadwaj House together with Avni and Hema. Bhairavi has returned from jail and is living with Sameer and Sanjana, but is actually plotting her revenge, having paid Avni and Hema to kidnap Piyush and destroy the Bharadwaj Family. Sanjana loses her unborn child. When Avni tries to expose Bhairavi, the latter attempts to kill her but only succeeds in murdering Avni's mother. Bhairavi shooting a gun leads to Piyush regaining his memory. In the end, Simar kills Bhairavi and Piyush marries Avni, promising her that he would always be by her side. The Bharadwajs worship the Mother [[Goddess]] and celebrate togetherness. Pari apologises to Simar for her past mistakes. Simar also remembers her sister Roli and Nirmala says that the Bharadwaj Family is not only a family but a thought.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cleanup|section|date=February 2018|reason=Section needs to be brought into conformity with [[WP:TVCAST]] to reflect the entire history of the cast, not just the most current lineup. Former main cast members need to be moved back to the top of the Main cast section. Former recurring cast need to be moved back to the top of the Recurring cast section, as cast members do not cease to be of academic importance just because they've left the series or have been written off. \"Supernatural cast\" is not a valid subsection. Any significant \"supernatural cast\" member should be moved to either the Main or Recurring sections. Consider that if the series is cancelled ''everybody'' becomes part of former cast, and the label no longer has meaning then.}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Dipika Kakkar]] as Simar Bhardwaj: Roli's sister; Prem's wife, Anjali, Piyush and Sanjana\u2019s mother (2011\u20132017)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bollywoodlife.com/news-gossip/why-is-dipika-kakar-quitting-sasural-simar-ka/|title=Why is Dipika Kakar quitting Sasural Simar Ka?|last=Iyengar|first=Anusha|access-date=20 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://m.mid-day.com/articles/keerti-kelkar-sasural-simar-ka-enter-bhardwaj-house-telly-news/18058169|title=Keerti Kelkar to enter Bhardwaj house in Sasural Simar Ka|date=8 March 2017|work=mid-day|access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/sasural-simar-ka-keerti-gaekwad-kelkar-replaces-dipika-kakar-as-simar-4541314/|title=Sasural Simar Ka: Keerti Gaekwad Kelkar replaces Dipika Kakar as Simar|date=24 February 2017|work=The Indian Express|access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Shoaib Ibrahim]] as Prem Bhardwaj: Siddhant's brother;

Manu pressed the button, removing Felipe & Gizelly from nominations.\n\n* {{note|15|Note 15}}: {{colorbox|#959FFD}} Unbeknownst to the housemates, the first and the last housemates eliminated from week 8's HoH endurance competition would be instantly nominated for eviction. Babu was the first to leave, while Rafa was the last, so they became the first two nominees of the week. The housemates were only informed about the twist during the live nominations.\n\n* {{note|16|Note 16}}: {{colorbox|#959FFD}} {{Color box|#FBF373}} During Week 9's HoH endurance competition, the first housemate eliminated would be automatically nominated, while the last eliminated housemate would win immunity.\n\n* {{note|17|Note 17}}:  {{colorbox|#959FFD}} The House's nominee had the power to name an additional nominee. The house voted for Felipe to be nominated, who in-turn nominated Ivy for eviction.\n\n* {{note|18|Note 18}}: {{colorbox|#959FFD}}  Week 10's HoH competition, was a pairs competition. The winning pair of Gizelly and Ivy had to allocate among themselves the HoH title (chosen by Gizelly) & a cash prize of R$10.000 (chosen by Ivy). Additionally, the losing pair would be automatically nominated. Gabi & Mari lost and were nominated. \n\n* {{note|19|Note 19}}: {{colorbox|#959FFD}} This week, the HoH's nominee had the power to name an additional nominee. Gizelly as HoH nominated Felipe, who in-turn nominated Manu for eviction.\n\n* {{note|20|Note 20}}: As Head of Household, Gizelly was forced to break the tie between Babu, Flayslane and Rafa (with three votes each). She nominated Flayslane.\n\n* {{note|21|Note 21}}: Week 10 featured a double Veto. Of the 4 Veto players, 2 would win a veto and avoid nominations, leaving the other two facing Brazil's vote alongside the HoH's nominee.\n\n* {{note|22|Note 22}}: As Head of Household, Flayslane was forced to break the tie between Babu and Mari (with four votes each). She nominated Babu.\n\n* {{note|23|Note 23}}: {{colorbox|#959FFD}} This round, the House's nominee had the power to name an additional nominee. The Housemates nominated Babu, who in-turn nominated Gabi for eviction.\n\n* {{note|24|Note 24}}: This round, the House (except Head of Household Thelma) was divided into two groups of four each, where they could only nominate a housemate from the other group - additionally, this round of had the housemates nominate in a round of face-to-face voting. The first group (Babu, Manu, Mari and Rafa) nominated Marcela with two votes. The second group (Flayslane, Gizelly, Ivy and Marcela) nominated Babu with two votes.\n\n* {{note|25|Note 25}}: This round, the housemates nominated in a face-to-face round of voting with top 2 vote recipients becoming the House\u2019s Nominees.\n\n* {{note|26|Note 26}}: As Head of Household, Ivy was forced to break the tie between Babu, Gizelly, Manu and Rafa (with one vote each) to determine the House's second nominee. She nominated Babu.\n\n* {{note|27|Note 27}}: This round, two Housemates were nominated by the house - the Haves (Babu, Rafa and Thelma) had to vote to nominate one of their own, and the Have-Nots (Gizelly, Ivy and Mari) nominating one of their own. As Mari was previously nominated by the HoH Manu, Gizelly and Ivy remained with no options for nominating. So, Mari was the only one from the Have-Not group to cast a vote.}}\n\n=== Have and Have-Nots === <!---Following previous seasons standarts--->\n<div style=\"overflow:auto; padding:4px;\"> <!--- Following Big Brother articles in order to conforming to page margins without reducing the font size.
