On the [[Army Combat Uniform]], the tabs are worn above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder patch]] and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below [[Awards and decorations of the United States Army|medals or ribbons]] on the [[Army Service Uniform]]. \n\nTabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because unlike medals - which are only worn on a soldier's garrison or dress uniform - tabs are worn on a soldier's combat uniform. Moreover, tabs are worn above a soldier's shoulder unit insignia patch which rarely include words as a part of their symbolism. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \"SPECIAL FORCES\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab).\n\nSome tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered [[Badges of the United States Army|special skill badges]] and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform). Other tabs recognize a whole unit's special skill and are considered to be part of a specific unit's shoulder sleeve patch and are worn by a soldier only while they belong to that unit.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Tab/Tabs.htm Pentagon.mil]</ref> The Jungle Expert and Arctic Tabs are unique in that while they are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's skill, it is only worn by soldiers while they belong to certain units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmedals.com/detail.aspx?ID=5717|title=USmedals.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Similarly, tabs awarded at the state level by the U.S. Army National Guard can only be worn by soldiers while they are on state-level orders.\n\n==Individual tabs==\nThere are currently four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs authorized for wear by the U.S. Army. In order of precedence, they are the [[Special Forces Tab]], the [[Ranger Tab]], the [[Sapper Tab]], and the [[President's Hundred Tab]]. Only three skill tabs may be worn at one time.<ref name=\"P670-1\">[http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p670_1.pdf U.S. Army Pamphlet 670\u20131: Uniform and Insignia, Guide to the Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506235717/http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p670_1.pdf |date=6 May 2014 }}, Department of the Army, dated 31 March 2014, last accessed 7 March 2015</ref> A soldier wearing three tabs is said to have achieved the \"tower of power\" or a \"triple canopy\" in military slang. Prior to the creation of the \"Sapper\" tab, this required a soldier to earn both a Special Forces and Ranger tab as well as serve in a unit with an Airborne or Mountain tab as part of its shoulder sleave insignia. This slang provides is the source for the name of the prominent private security company [[Triple Canopy]].\n\n===Special Forces===\n[[File:SpecialForcesTabMetal.jpg|170px|thumb|Special Forces Tab]]\nThe [[Special Forces Tab]] is a service school qualification tab of the [[United States Army]], awarded to any soldier completing either the [[Special Forces Qualification Course]], or the Special Forces Detachment Officer Qualification Course. Soldiers who are awarded the Special Forces Tab are authorized to wear it for the remainder of their military careers, even when not serving in a [[United States Army Special Forces|Special Forces]] command. The Special Forces Tab can be revoked by the Chain of Command for significant violations of conduct considered contrary to the high standards expected of a Special Forces soldier (for example, DUI or other forms of misconduct).\n\nThe Special Forces Tab was created in 1983 and is an embroidered quadrant patch worn on the upper left sleeve of a military uniform. The cloth tab is {{convert|3+7/4|in|cm}} wide and is teal blue with yellow embroidered letters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qmmuseum.lee.army.mil/airborne/sf_tab.htm|title=Special Forces Tab|website=www.qmmuseum.lee.army.mil|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref><ref>Army Regulation 600-8-22, Section 8-49.</ref>\n\n===Ranger===\n[[File:Ranger Tab.svg|150px|thumb|Ranger Tab]]\nThe Ranger Tab is a qualification tab authorized upon completion of the [[Ranger School|U.S. Army's Ranger School]] by a member of the U.S. military, civilian personnel, or non-U.S. military personnel.

The original unit patch design was eventually softened to less directly replicate the Recondo arrowhead patch after complaints from the US Army special forces community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beret for Soldiers of 1st SFAB \u2013 Concern in SF Community |url=https://sof.news/sfa/sfab-beret/}}</ref> The SFAB unit patches also introduced the new \"ADVISOR\" unit level tab to the Army uniform.\n\nThe US Army ROTC still issues a Recondo Badge to cadets who successfully complete Recondo training at the Leader Development and Assessment Course.\n\n===Pershing===\n[[File:US Army Pershing Tab of the Former 56th Field Artillery Command.png|right|thumb|160px|Pershing Tab]]\nThe Pershing Tab was worn as part of the shoulder sleeve insignia (SSI) for units supporting the [[Pershing missile]] system.

In 1971 the 56th FA received their own SSI that included the Pershing tab, which continued through redesignation as the 56th Field Artillery Command in 1986.

On the [[Army Combat Uniform]], the tabs are worn above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder patch]] and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below [[Awards and decorations of the United States Army|medals or ribbons]] on the [[Army Service Uniform]]. \n\nTabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because unlike medals - which are only worn on a soldier's garrison or dress uniform - tabs are worn on a soldier's combat uniform. Moreover, tabs are worn above a soldier's shoulder unit insignia patch which rarely include words as a part of their symbolism. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \"SPECIAL FORCES\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab).\n\nSome tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered [[Badges of the United States Army|special skill badges]] and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform). Other tabs recognize a whole unit's special skill and are considered to be part of a specific unit's shoulder sleeve patch and are worn by a soldier only while they belong to that unit.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Tab/Tabs.htm Pentagon.mil]</ref> The Jungle Expert and Arctic Tabs are unique in that while they are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's skill, it is only worn by soldiers while they belong to certain units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmedals.com/detail.aspx?ID=5717|title=USmedals.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Similarly, tabs awarded at the state level by the U.S. Army National Guard can only be worn by soldiers while they are on state-level orders.\n\n==Individual tabs==\nThere are currently four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs authorized for wear by the U.S. Army.

These include tabs containing the words \"SNIPER\", \"[[Artillery observer|FISTER]]\", \"SCOUT\", or \"RECON\". The \"SAPPER\" tab was one of these unofficial tabs until 2004 when it became an official special skill badge/tab of the U.S. Army. Other tabs are often still worn unofficially but were at some point official before being retired. Retired tabs include \"RECONDO\", \"PERSHING\", \"AIR ASSAULT\", as well as various tabs identifying commands within the Army Air Forces. \n\n===Long-range reconnaissance patrol===\n{{multiple image\n|align    = right\n|width1 = 160\n|image1 = LRRP.jpg\n|caption1 = LRRP tab\n}}\n[[Long-range reconnaissance patrol]] (LRRP or LRP) units were pre-cursors to the present-day [[75th Infantry Regiment (Ranger)|75th Ranger Regiment]]. Members of LRRP units would wear LRRP tabs over their division (or brigade unit patch), while those who were individually \"Ranger\" qualified would also wear an additional Ranger tab. Beginning in 1956 at the earliest, these units existed up until 1969 when all U.S. Army LRRP units were reorganized as the 75th Ranger Regiment.<ref name=\"amazon.com\">Ankony, Robert C., ''Lurps: A Ranger's Diary of Tet, Khe Sanh, A Shau, and Quang Tri'', revised ed., Hamilton Books, LandHam, MD, 2009. [https://www.amazon.com/Lurps-Rangers-Diary-Sanh-Quang/dp/0761843728/ref=dp_ob_image_bk]</ref> At that time, there were 15 LRRP companies which transitioned into becoming Ranger companies A-I and K-P.\n\n===Recondo===\n{{multiple image\n|align    = right\n|width1 = 93\n|image1 = Recondo Pocket Badge.jpg\n|caption1 = Vietnam-era 'Recondo' Patch\n|width2   = 145\n|image2   = US Army ROTC Recondo Badge.png\n|caption2 = Current ROTC Recondo Badge\n|width3   = 145\n|image3   = Recondo.jpg\n|caption3 = Recondo Tab\n}}\n[[Recondo]] was a [[Vietnam War]]-era title meant to designate soldiers who had graduated from the \"Reconnaissance Commando\" school. The standard Recondo insignia was a downward-pointing arrowhead with \"RECONDO\" printed above. The Recondo patch was standardly worn on each graduate's right breast pocket. Recondo was also sometimes worn in the style of the more traditional shoulder tab.\n\nBetween 1958-1986 many different Recondo schools were run independently by numerous different US Army units as well as [[United States Military Academy|West Point]].<ref>[http://www.usmcweb.com/HomePage/UnitPageHistory/1,13506,100072%7C902143,00.html Usmcweb.com]</ref> The most famous of which was [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV's]] Recondo school at [[Nha Trang]] which ran between 1966 and 1970. Other U.S. Army [[Division (military)|division]] and [[corps]] Recondo Schools either carried-on with their curriculum or disbanded throughout the 1970s and '80s. The 9th Infantry Division ran a Recondo School from 1975 to 1978, and the XVIII Airborne ran a Recondo school up until 1986.\n\nIn designing the unit patch for the [[Security Force Assistance Brigade]] stood up in 2018, the US Army took inspiration from the classic Recondo arrowhead design. The original unit patch design was eventually softened to less directly replicate the Recondo arrowhead patch after complaints from the US Army special forces community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beret for Soldiers of 1st SFAB \u2013 Concern in SF Community |url=https://sof.news/sfa/sfab-beret/}}</ref> The SFAB unit patches also introduced the new \"ADVISOR\" unit level tab to the Army uniform.\n\nThe US Army ROTC still issues a Recondo Badge to cadets who successfully complete Recondo training at the Leader Development and Assessment Course.\n\n===Pershing===\n[[File:US Army Pershing Tab of the Former 56th Field Artillery Command.png|right|thumb|160px|Pershing Tab]]\nThe Pershing Tab was worn as part of the shoulder sleeve insignia (SSI) for units supporting the [[Pershing missile]] system. From 1970 to 1971 the [[56th Artillery Brigade]] wore the SSI of the Seventh Army with the Pershing tab. In 1971 the 56th FA received their own SSI that included the Pershing tab, which continued through redesignation as the 56th Field Artillery Command in 1986. The [[3rd Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment]] wore the Pershing tab with the SSI of [[III Corps (United States)|III Corps]] from 1971 to 1981, then with that of the [[214th Field Artillery Brigade]] when it had a SSI created in 1981. The Pershing tab was discontinued with the deactivation of units following the elimination of the [[Pershing missile]] system in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |title=56th Field Artillery Command: Shoulder Sleeve Insignia; Distinctive Unit Insignia |work=[[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=3448&grp=2&menu=Uniformed%20Services}}</ref>\n\n===Air Assault===\n[[File:101st Air Assault.jpg|thumb|right|90px|101st Airborne Division SSI with Air Assault tab]]\n{{Stack|[[File:US Army 11th Air Assault Tab-Historical.png|thumb|150px|SSI tab of the former 11th Air Assault Division]]}}\nIn 1963, the [[11th Airborne Division (United States)#Reactivation (11th Air Assault Division) and inactivation|11th Air Assault Division (Test)]] was established\u2014formed from reactivated elements of the [[11th Airborne Division (United States)|11th Airborne Division]]\u2014to explore the theory and practicality of [[air assault|helicopter assault tactics]], and was inactivated two years later when testing was completed and the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile)]] was formed.

The younger daughter of the [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire|5th Duke of Devonshire]], she was a member of the wealthy [[House of Cavendish|Cavendish]] and [[Spencer family|Spencer]] families and spent her childhood under the care of a governess with her two siblings.\n\nIn 1809 Harriet married [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|Granville Leveson-Gower]], a diplomat who had been her maternal aunt's lover for seventeen years. Despite this unusual connection, the couple's marriage was happy and they had five children. During intermittent periods between 1824 and 1841, Granville served as the [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France|British ambassador to France]], requiring Harriet to perform a relentless array of social duties in Paris that she often found exhausting and frivolous.\n\nA prolific writer of letters, Harriet corresponded with others for most of her life, often humourously describing her observations of those around her. Historians have since found her detailed accounts to be a valuable source of information on life as an ambassadress as well as life in the 19th-century aristocracy. Between 1894 and 1990, four edited collections of Harriet's correspondence were published. \n\n==Early life and family==\nLady Henrietta Elizabeth Cavendish was born on 29 August 1785 at [[Devonshire House]], [[Piccadilly]], London. Her parents were [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]], and his first wife, [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Lady Georgiana Spencer]].{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=10}}{{sfn|Surtees|2004}} As major landowners, the [[Spencer family|Spencer]] family controlled one of the largest fortunes in England. The Duke of Devonshire possessed even more wealth, with an annual income that was twice as much as that of Georgiana's father; in addition to Devonshire House, he owned [[Chatsworth House]] and four other estates of similar opulence.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=4, 17}}\n\nThe new baby became known as \"Harriet\" or \"Harryo\" to her family. Her birth, which came two years after that of her sister [[Georgiana Howard, Countess of Carlisle|Georgiana]], was a disappointment to the Duke; he had hoped for a male heir.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=10}} His marriage to the Duchess was contentious; they had little in common and she had difficulty bringing her pregnancies to term.{{sfn|Foreman|2004}}{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=29\u201331}} The birth of the long-desired heir, Harriet's brother [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|William]], arrived in 1790 after 16 years of marriage.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=237\u20138}}{{sfn|Lees-Milne|1998|p=3}} Seeking distraction from an unhappy match, the Duchess spent her time socialising and gambling, and became a popular political hostess and leader of fashion.{{sfn|Foreman|2004}}{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=34\u20138, 48}} By the mid-1780s, Devonshire House had become the centre of fashionable life in the [[Georgian era]].{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=11\u20132}}{{sfn|Surtees|1990|p=12}}\n\nAs Harriet was neither the eldest nor the desired male heir, she was probably the least favorite of her parents' three children. She had a somewhat uneasy relationship with her father throughout his life. In her early years she was devoted to her loving mother,{{sfn|Furness|2018|pp=10, 13}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=17}} though this relationship suffered a temporary setback in the 1790s. The Duchess, pregnant by the future prime minister [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]], was forced to move abroad and give birth in secret. A two-year separation ensued before she saw her children again, and upon her return she observed that eight-year-old Harriet had become reserved and irritable.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=258\u201377}}{{sfn|Furness|2018|pp=12\u201313}} One biographer posits that this reticence carried into adulthood during \"situations of great difficulty and tragedy\", when Harriet would hide her emotions even from those to whom she was usually close.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=13}}\n\n==Upbringing and first London season==\nThe Devonshire household was unusual in that it included the Duke's mistress [[Elizabeth Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Lady Elizabeth Foster]] and their two illegitimate children, who were raised alongside the legitimate Cavendishes.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=11}}{{#tag:ref|In 1782 Georgiana had befriended Elizabeth Foster, who was separated from her husband and living in Bath. Elizabeth soon became the Duke's mistress and manipulated her way into the Devonshire household. She married the Duke in 1809.{{sfn|Surtees|2004}}|group=note}} Harriet and her siblings, who did not understand why Elizabeth resided with them, disliked her; they also held antipathy for her two teenage sons from a previous marriage, who joined the household in 1796.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=13}}{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=308\u201309}} The [[Georgiana Spencer, Countess Spencer|Dowager Countess Spencer]] felt the Devonshire household was amoral and took a prominent role in her grandchildren's upbringing. When Harriet was three, Lady Spencer hired Miss Selina Trimmer as their new governess.{{sfn|Furness|2018|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=17\u201318}}{{#tag:ref|Selina's mother was the famous educationalist [[Sarah Trimmer]], a writer of children's stories that employed moral themes.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|p=243}}|group=note}} Selina agreed with Lady Spencer that in order to protect the children, the Devonshire household required moral guidance.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|p=243}} Deeply religious,{{sfn|Lees-Milne|1998|p=6}} Selina encouraged her charges to be morally principled and pious,{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=301}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=23}} and strove to provide a stable upbringing with a good education.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=12}} Though she was often severe, the Cavendish children came to view their governess with affection.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=24}} Selina became another mother figure in Harriet's life,{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=12}} and had a lasting impact on her piety, which especially thrived in later life.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=23, 169}}\n\nHarriet began writing letters from a young age; early topics included the activities of family members, and thoughts on the books she was reading.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=12}} As she grew older it became readily apparent to all, including herself, that she lacked her mother's beauty and slim figure. But she was intelligent and witty in conversation, and did not have her sister's shyness.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|p=347}}{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=32}} While Georgiana's first [[Season (society)#Social season of London|London season]] quickly drew two eligible admirers and ended in marriage to one of them in 1801,{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=27\u201330}} Harriet's first season two years later produced no such offers.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=32}}{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=347\u201348}} As she remained single over the next several years, her family increasingly expected that she would marry her cousin [[John Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough|John, Viscount Duncannon]]. Harriet herself had held this expectation since a young age, though she was unsure whether she cared for him enough to marry.{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=223}}{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=29}} But after three years of indecisiveness, Duncannon married another woman.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=29}}{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=274}} Her family also unsuccessfully encouraged a match with another cousin, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|John, Viscount Althorp]].{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=47}}{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=295}}\n\nThe Duchess's sudden death in 1806 contributed to profound changes in her younger daughter's life.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=43\u20134}}{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=35}} Elizabeth Foster, the Duke's longtime mistress, took control of the Devonshire household and thus usurped this role from his unmarried daughter. Harriet, who had long disliked Elizabeth, avoided her as much as possible.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=36}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=44}} While social norms dictated Harriet could not permanently move out, she was able to frequently stay with other family members, including with her sister at [[Castle Howard]] in [[North Yorkshire]].{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=36}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=48}} Harriet's son [[Frederick Leveson-Gower (Bodmin)|Frederick]] later wrote that the experience \"strengthened the tie of sisterly affection, which bound them together during the whole of their joint lives\".{{sfn|Leveson-Gower|1894|p=vii}} From 1801 onwards, Harriet wrote to her sister almost daily until the latter's death in 1858,{{sfn|Surtees|2004}} corresponding in English and French.{{sfn|Surtees|1990|p=9}}\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Thomas Lawrence, Portrait of Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, later 1st Earl Granville (c. 1804\u20131809).jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|A portrait of Granville Leveson-Gower shortly before his marriage, by the artist [[Thomas Lawrence]] ]]\nThe Duchess's sister, [[Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough|Henrietta, Countess of Bessborough]], felt obligated to help her niece escape a difficult home situation. Harriet had previously been critical of her aunt, but with her mother gone, now turned to her for affection and support.{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=288}} When the Duke announced his desire to marry his mistress,{{sfn|Surtees|2004}} Henrietta began searching for a suitable marriage prospect for her niece. The chosen candidate was [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|Lord Granville Leveson-Gower]], a politician and diplomat who had been her lover for seventeen years and the father of her two illegitimate children.{{sfn|Surtees|2004}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2004}} Though still infatuated with him, she knew that Granville would need to eventually marry and produce legitimate offspring, and that when he did so, she would likely lose him. Convincing her niece to marry him was one way of keeping him within her social circle.{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|pp=225, 301\u201302}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=59}}\n\nThough Granville had represented several [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] in the [[House of Commons]] and served briefly in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] of the [[Second Portland ministry]], his career was primarily in diplomacy.

The younger daughter of the [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire|5th Duke of Devonshire]], she was a member of the wealthy [[House of Cavendish|Cavendish]] and [[Spencer family|Spencer]] families and spent her childhood under the care of a governess with her two siblings.\n\nIn 1809 Harriet married [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|Granville Leveson-Gower]], a diplomat who had been her maternal aunt's lover for seventeen years. Despite this unusual connection, the couple's marriage was happy and they had five children. During intermittent periods between 1824 and 1841, Granville served as the [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France|British ambassador to France]], requiring Harriet to perform a relentless array of social duties in Paris that she often found exhausting and frivolous.\n\nA prolific writer of letters, Harriet corresponded with others for most of her life, often humourously describing her observations of those around her. Historians have since found her detailed accounts to be a valuable source of information on life as an ambassadress as well as life in the 19th-century aristocracy. Between 1894 and 1990, four edited collections of Harriet's correspondence were published. \n\n==Early life and family==\nLady Henrietta Elizabeth Cavendish was born on 29 August 1785 at [[Devonshire House]], [[Piccadilly]], London. Her parents were [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]], and his first wife, [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Lady Georgiana Spencer]].{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=10}}{{sfn|Surtees|2004}} As major landowners, the [[Spencer family|Spencer]] family controlled one of the largest fortunes in England. The Duke of Devonshire possessed even more wealth, with an annual income that was twice as much as that of Georgiana's father; in addition to Devonshire House, he owned [[Chatsworth House]] and four other estates of similar opulence.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=4, 17}}\n\nThe new baby became known as \"Harriet\" or \"Harryo\" to her family. Her birth, which came two years after that of her sister [[Georgiana Howard, Countess of Carlisle|Georgiana]], was a disappointment to the Duke; he had hoped for a male heir.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=10}} His marriage to the Duchess was contentious; they had little in common and she had difficulty bringing her pregnancies to term.{{sfn|Foreman|2004}}{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=29\u201331}} The birth of the long-desired heir, Harriet's brother [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|William]], arrived in 1790 after 16 years of marriage.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=237\u20138}}{{sfn|Lees-Milne|1998|p=3}} Seeking distraction from an unhappy match, the Duchess spent her time socialising and gambling, and became a popular political hostess and leader of fashion.{{sfn|Foreman|2004}}{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=34\u20138, 48}} By the mid-1780s, Devonshire House had become the centre of fashionable life in the [[Georgian era]].{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=11\u20132}}{{sfn|Surtees|1990|p=12}}\n\nAs Harriet was neither the eldest nor the desired male heir, she was probably the least favorite of her parents' three children. She had a somewhat uneasy relationship with her father throughout his life. In her early years she was devoted to her loving mother,{{sfn|Furness|2018|pp=10, 13}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=17}} though this relationship suffered a temporary setback in the 1790s. The Duchess, pregnant by the future prime minister [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Charles Grey]], was forced to move abroad and give birth in secret. A two-year separation ensued before she saw her children again, and upon her return she observed that eight-year-old Harriet had become reserved and irritable.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=258\u201377}}{{sfn|Furness|2018|pp=12\u201313}} One biographer posits that this reticence carried into adulthood during \"situations of great difficulty and tragedy\", when Harriet would hide her emotions even from those to whom she was usually close.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=13}}\n\n==Upbringing and first London season==\nThe Devonshire household was unusual in that it included the Duke's mistress [[Elizabeth Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Lady Elizabeth Foster]] and their two illegitimate children, who were raised alongside the legitimate Cavendishes.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=11}}{{#tag:ref|In 1782 Georgiana had befriended Elizabeth Foster, who was separated from her husband and living in Bath. Elizabeth soon became the Duke's mistress and manipulated her way into the Devonshire household. She married the Duke in 1809.{{sfn|Surtees|2004}}|group=note}} Harriet and her siblings, who did not understand why Elizabeth resided with them, disliked her; they also held antipathy for her two teenage sons from a previous marriage, who joined the household in 1796.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=13}}{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=308\u201309}} The [[Georgiana Spencer, Countess Spencer|Dowager Countess Spencer]] felt the Devonshire household was amoral and took a prominent role in her grandchildren's upbringing. When Harriet was three, Lady Spencer hired Miss Selina Trimmer as their new governess.{{sfn|Furness|2018|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=17\u201318}}{{#tag:ref|Selina's mother was the famous educationalist [[Sarah Trimmer]], a writer of children's stories that employed moral themes.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|p=243}}|group=note}} Selina agreed with Lady Spencer that in order to protect the children, the Devonshire household required moral guidance.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|p=243}} Deeply religious,{{sfn|Lees-Milne|1998|p=6}} Selina encouraged her charges to be morally principled and pious,{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=301}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=23}} and strove to provide a stable upbringing with a good education.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=12}} Though she was often severe, the Cavendish children came to view their governess with affection.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=24}} Selina became another mother figure in Harriet's life,{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=12}} and had a lasting impact on her piety, which especially thrived in later life.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=23, 169}}\n\nHarriet began writing letters from a young age; early topics included the activities of family members, and thoughts on the books she was reading.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=12}} As she grew older it became readily apparent to all, including herself, that she lacked her mother's beauty and slim figure. But she was intelligent and witty in conversation, and did not have her sister's shyness.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|p=347}}{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=32}} While Georgiana's first [[Season (society)#Social season of London|London season]] quickly drew two eligible admirers and ended in marriage to one of them in 1801,{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=27\u201330}} Harriet's first season two years later produced no such offers.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=32}}{{sfn|Foreman|1998|pp=347\u201348}} As she remained single over the next several years, her family increasingly expected that she would marry her cousin [[John Ponsonby, 4th Earl of Bessborough|John, Viscount Duncannon]]. Harriet herself had held this expectation since a young age, though she was unsure whether she cared for him enough to marry.{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=223}}{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=29}} But after three years of indecisiveness, Duncannon married another woman.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=29}}{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=274}} Her family also unsuccessfully encouraged a match with another cousin, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|John, Viscount Althorp]].{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=47}}{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=295}}\n\nThe Duchess's sudden death in 1806 contributed to profound changes in her younger daughter's life.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=43\u20134}}{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=35}} Elizabeth Foster, the Duke's longtime mistress, took control of the Devonshire household and thus usurped this role from his unmarried daughter. Harriet, who had long disliked Elizabeth, avoided her as much as possible.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=36}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=44}} While social norms dictated Harriet could not permanently move out, she was able to frequently stay with other family members, including with her sister at [[Castle Howard]] in [[North Yorkshire]].{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=36}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=48}} Harriet's son [[Frederick Leveson-Gower (Bodmin)|Frederick]] later wrote that the experience \"strengthened the tie of sisterly affection, which bound them together during the whole of their joint lives\".{{sfn|Leveson-Gower|1894|p=vii}} From 1801 onwards, Harriet wrote to her sister almost daily until the latter's death in 1858,{{sfn|Surtees|2004}} corresponding in English and French.{{sfn|Surtees|1990|p=9}}\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Thomas Lawrence, Portrait of Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, later 1st Earl Granville (c. 1804\u20131809).jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|A portrait of Granville Leveson-Gower shortly before his marriage, by the artist [[Thomas Lawrence]] ]]\nThe Duchess's sister, [[Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough|Henrietta, Countess of Bessborough]], felt obligated to help her niece escape a difficult home situation. Harriet had previously been critical of her aunt, but with her mother gone, now turned to her for affection and support.{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=288}} When the Duke announced his desire to marry his mistress,{{sfn|Surtees|2004}} Henrietta began searching for a suitable marriage prospect for her niece. The chosen candidate was [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville|Lord Granville Leveson-Gower]], a politician and diplomat who had been her lover for seventeen years and the father of her two illegitimate children.{{sfn|Surtees|2004}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2004}} Though still infatuated with him, she knew that Granville would need to eventually marry and produce legitimate offspring, and that when he did so, she would likely lose him. Convincing her niece to marry him was one way of keeping him within her social circle.{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|pp=225, 301\u201302}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=59}}\n\nThough Granville had represented several [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] in the [[House of Commons]] and served briefly in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinet]] of the [[Second Portland ministry]], his career was primarily in diplomacy. He had been stationed in various European courts since 1796, and by 1809 had become a mid-career diplomat.{{sfn|Reynolds|2004}}{{sfn|Mori|2015|p=141}} Known to Harriet since her childhood, he was twelve years her senior.{{sfn|Furness|2018|pp=37\u20138}} She had never particularly cared for him, having disapproved of his hauteur and illicit liaison with her aunt.{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=289}} But Harriet\u2019s opinion of him now improved.{{sfn|Surtees|2004}} Though he had little wealth of his own, he was a leading member of society as part of the prominent [[Leveson-Gower family]]; his half-brother was the very rich [[George Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland|Marquess of Stafford]] (later Duke of Sutherland).{{sfn|Surtees|1990|p=11}}{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=37}} Additionally, the historian [[K. D. Reynolds]] writes that Granville was \"considered one of the most handsome men of his time; his curly brown hair, blue eyes, and sensuous features brought him strings of female admirers\".{{sfn|Reynolds|2004}}\n\nThough eager to leave Devonshire House, Harriet insisted that Granville's affair with her aunt be truly over.{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=301}} The prospective groom was unsure if he wanted the unglamorous Harriet as a marriage partner, however, and spent some time pursuing other candidates; their refusals, often due to his womanising reputation, led Granville to ultimately choose Harriet.{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|pp=292\u201397}} They became engaged on 13 November 1809.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=64\u20135}} The Duke provided his younger daughter with a dowry of \u00a310,000 ({{Inflation|UK|10000|1809|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=\u22124}}{{Inflation/fn|UK}}), a relatively low sum compared to the nearly \u00a330,000 ({{Inflation|UK|30000|1809|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3|r=\u22125}}{{Inflation/fn|UK}}) given to his illegitimate daughter Caroline St. Jules that same year.{{sfn|Douglass|2004|p=87}}{{sfn|Foreman|1998|p=378}} On 24 December 1809,{{sfn|Reynolds|2004}} Harriet married Granville in the drawing room of [[Chiswick House]],{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|pp=306\u20137}} an elegant London villa owned by her father.{{sfn|Foreman|1998|p=301}}\n\n==Social hostess==\nDespite the unusual circumstances surrounding the marriage, Harriet and Granville\u2019s letters reveal both were very happy.{{sfn|Surtees|2004}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=69}} After a long and difficult labour, their eldest child Susan was born healthy.{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|pp=310\u201311}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=74}} They would have five children in total \u2013 Susan, later the wife of the [[George Pitt-Rivers, 4th Baron Rivers|4th Baron Rivers]]; [[Georgiana Fullerton]], a novelist; [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Granville, 2nd Earl Granville]], the future [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|foreign secretary]]; William, who died young; and [[Frederick Leveson-Gower (Bodmin)|Frederick]], a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician.{{sfn|Surtees|2004}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2004}} They also adopted [[Harriet Osborne, Baroness Godolphin|Harriet]] and George Stewart, Granville's two illegitimate children with Henrietta; the pair flourished in the happy household.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=76\u201377}}{{sfn|Gleeson|2008|p=367}} The elder Harriet found her twelve-year-old step-daughter to be a \"most amiable little creature\", and the two would grow especially close in the years that followed.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=77}}\n\nDuring their first few years together, the Leveson-Gowers split their time between London and the various [[English country house|country houses]] of friends and family.{{sfn|Leveson-Gower|1894|p=viii}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=70\u20132}} As neither brought significant wealth{{sfn|Surtees|1990|p=11}} or an [[Estate (land)|estate]] into the marriage, the smaller size of Harriet's dowry must have caused some disappointment; upon her father's death in 1811, her brother \u2013 now 6th Duke of Devonshire \u2013 quickly increased her settlement to \u00a330,000.{{sfn|Furness|2018|pp=41\u20132}}{{sfn|Lees-Milne|1998|p=20}} With this new income they were able to rent [[Tixall Hall]] in [[Staffordshire]], taking up residence for eight years to raise their growing family and host visitors.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=72}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=75}} In 1819, seeking to be closer to the government in London, they rented [[Wherstead Park, Suffolk|Wherstead Park]] in [[Suffolk]],{{sfn|Furness|2018|pp=72\u20133}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=107}} living there until 1824.{{sfn|Surtees|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe Leveson-Gowers regularly attended large gatherings and parties at country houses. As Granville was gregarious and social, Harriet worked to be a great hostess; she was also a welcome guest when visiting others.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=70, 108, 116}} Her letters reveal her amusement at those around her, particularly during the visits of dissimilar guests to Wherstead, where they hosted frequently.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=108}} After one visit to Tixall Hall, [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] \u2013 her normally hypercritical cousin \u2013 wrote that he could not \"remember so agreeable a party\", and described Harriet as possessing \"a great deal of genius, humour, strong feelings, enthusiasm, delicacy, refinement, good taste, na\u00efvet\u00e9 which just misses being affectation, and a bonhomie which extends to all around her\".{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=75}}\n\nFor his service in government, Granville was raised to the [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peerage]] and given a [[viscountcy]] in 1815.{{sfn|Reynolds|2004}} An [[Earl Granville|earldom]] followed in 1833, whereupon he and his wife became known as Earl and Countess Granville.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=123}}\n\n==Ambassadress==\nIn February 1824, Granville moved to [[The Hague]] to begin his service as [[List of diplomats of the United Kingdom to the Netherlands|British ambassador to the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2004}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=138}} Harriet, by now a thirty-nine-year-old mother of five, accompanied him along with their two daughters (their two youngest sons followed in April).{{sfn|Hickman|1999|p=119}}{{sfn|Leveson-Gower|1894|pp=244\u201348, 253\u201354, 280}} Though she had not wished to leave her comfortable life in England, where she had been surrounded by friends and family, she did so to support her husband.{{sfn|Hickman|1999|p=119}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=136}} After completing the first few days of official duties, Harriet devoted much of her time to domestic routine and being with her children.{{sfn|Hickman|1999|pp=119\u201320}} They only had a short period of time to get settled.

But after overseeing restoration work,{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=148\u201349}} the couple hosted large dinner parties, balls, and [[Party#receptions|receptions]] on a regular basis.{{sfn|Jones|1983|pp=73\u20134}}{{sfn|Mori|2015|p=148}} As the wife of the British ambassador, Harriet was a prominent figure in Paris and her gatherings became popular events.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=146}}{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=78}} Her duties required her to visit the [[royal court]], attend and host parties, receive visitors and reciprocate their visits, and patronise local organisations.{{sfn|Mori|2015|p=141}} Harriet did not enjoy the relentlessness of her strictly regulated social duties, finding them exhausting and often frivolous.{{sfn|Hickman|1999|pp=153, 158, 273\u201374}} But she recognised that an embassy's effectiveness often depended on [[social capital]].{{sfn|Mori|2015|p=145}}\n\nAt first Harriet viewed many of the French elite with dislike, believing they were superficial and vacuous.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=144}}{{sfn|Hickman|1999|pp=120\u201321}} They possessed \"not as much mind as would fill a pea-shell\", she wrote in one letter.{{sfn|Furness|2018|p=77}}{{sfn|Leveson-Gower|1894|p=319}} \"It is odd that their effect on me is to crush me with the sense of my inferiority whilst I am absolutely gasping with the sense of my superiority\", she wrote in another.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=143}}{{sfn|Surtees|1990|p=191}} But she was determined to earn their approval, especially as the British government's foreign policy was producing some resentment among the French.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|pp=144\u201345}} During a visit in March 1825, the Duke of Devonshire provided his sister with advice on French culture as well as her deportment and appearance.{{sfn|Lees-Milne|1998|p=65}}{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=149}} She invested in the latest fashions and became effective at managing the French elite, having come to the conclusion that they were like \"children\" whose \"object is to be amused and received\".{{sfn|Hickman|1999|pp=122\u201323}} After six months in Paris the new ambassadress had reached a point of amused acceptance with her social surroundings.{{sfn|Hickman|1999|pp=122\u201323}} She was successful in her efforts and soon became very popular.{{sfn|Askwith|1982|p=146}}\n\nDespite being inundated with politics from a young age, Harriet cared little for the subject until later in life.
