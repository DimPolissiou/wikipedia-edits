The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and an [[absolute majority]] of at least 270 electoral votes is required to win the election. According to [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution, each [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] determines the manner by which its [[U.S. state|state's]] electors are chosen.

In [[Federalist No. 39]], Madison argued the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of [[Federalism in the United States|state-based]] and [[Proportional representation|population-based]] government. [[United States Congress|Congress]] would have two houses: the state-based [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

The electors come directly from the people and them alone for that purpose only, and for that time only. This avoided a party-run legislature, or a permanent body that could be influenced by foreign interests before each election.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\">Hamilton. [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp The Federalist Papers: No. 68] The Avalon Project, Yale Law School. viewed November 10, 2016.</ref> Hamilton explained the election was to take place among all the states, so no corruption in any state could taint \"the great body of the people\" in their selection. The choice was to be made by a majority of the Electoral College, as majority rule is critical to the principles of republican government. Hamilton argued that electors meeting in the state capitals were able to have information unavailable to the general public. Hamilton also argued that since no federal officeholder could be an elector, none of the electors would be beholden to any presidential candidate.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAnother consideration was the decision would be made without \"tumult and disorder\" as it would be a broad-based one made simultaneously in various locales where the decision-makers could deliberate reasonably, not in one place where decision-makers could be threatened or intimidated. If the Electoral College did not achieve a decisive majority, then the House of Representatives was to choose the president from among the top five candidates,<ref>The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] changed this to the top three candidates</ref> ensuring selection of a presiding officer administering the laws would have both ability and good character. Hamilton was also concerned about somebody unqualified, but with a talent for \"low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity\" attaining high office.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Federalist No. 10]], James Madison argued against \"an interested and overbearing majority\" and the \"mischiefs of faction\" in an electoral system. He defined a faction as \"a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\" What was then called republican government (i.e., [[representative democracy]], as opposed to [[direct democracy]]) combined with the principles of [[federalism]] (with distribution of voter rights and separation of government powers) would countervail against factions. Madison further postulated in the Federalist No.{{nbsp}}10 that the greater the population and expanse of the Republic, the more difficulty factions would face in organizing due to such issues as [[sectionalism]].<ref>''The Federalist Papers: Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay'' The New American Library, 1961</ref>\n\nAlthough the United States Constitution refers to \"Electors\" and \"electors\", neither the phrase \"Electoral College\" nor any other name is used to describe the electors collectively. It was not until the early 19th century the name \"Electoral College\" came into general usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast votes for president and vice president. The phrase was first written into federal law in 1845 and today the term appears in {{USC|3|4}}, in the section heading and in the text as \"college of electors\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html|title=U. S. Electoral College: Frequently Asked Questions|website=archives.gov}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, the state legislatures chose the electors in more than half the states. That practice changed during the early 19th century, as states extended the right to vote to wider segments of the population. By [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], only [[South Carolina]] had not transitioned to popular election. Since [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]], the electors in every state have been chosen based on a popular election held on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]].<ref name=CRS2017THN/> The popular election for electors means the president and vice president are in effect chosen through [[indirect election]] by the citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electoral College|website=history.com|url=https://www.history.com/topics/electoral-college|publisher=A+E Networks|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> {{anchor|EvsP}}Since the mid-19th century when all electors have been popularly chosen, the Electoral College has elected the candidate who received the most popular votes nationwide, except in four elections: [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]], [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. In [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], there were six states in which electors were legislatively appointed, rather than popularly elected, so the true national popular vote is uncertain; the electors failed to select a winning candidate, so the matter was decided by the House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/|title=Presidents Winning Without Popular Vote|first=D'Angelo|last=Gore|date=December 23, 2016|publisher=[[FactCheck.org]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Original plan ===\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 3]] of the Constitution provided the original plan by which the electors voted for president. Under the original plan, each elector cast two votes for president; electors did not vote for vice president. Whoever received a majority of votes from the electors would become president, with the person receiving the second most votes becoming vice president.\n\nThe original plan of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Stanley|title=Updating the Electoral College: The National Popular Vote Legislation|journal=Harvard Journal on Legislation|volume=44|issue=205, at 208|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|location=Cambridge, MA|year=2007}}</ref>\n# Choice of the president should reflect the \"sense of the people\" at a particular time, not the dictates of a faction in a \"pre-established body\" such as Congress or the State legislatures, and independent of the influence of \"foreign powers\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Hamilton, Alexander.

Hamilton so strongly believed this was to be done district by district, and when states began doing otherwise, he proposed a constitutional amendment to mandate the district system (Hamilton, [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289 Draft of a Constitutional Amendment]). Madison concurred, \"The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted.\" ([https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023 Madison to Hay, 1823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|date=May 25, 2017}})</ref>\n# Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting, deliberating with the most complete information available in a system that over time, tended to bring about a good administration of the laws passed by Congress.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n# Candidates would not pair together on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president.\n# The system as designed would rarely produce a winner, thus sending the presidential election to the House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to the text of Article II, however, each state government was free to have its own plan for selecting its electors, and the Constitution does not explicitly require states to popularly elect their electors. Several methods for selecting electors are described [[United States Electoral College#Alternative methods of choosing electors|below]].\n\n==== Breakdown and revision ====\nThe emergence of [[Political party|political parties]] and nationally coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]] and [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]. In 1796, [[Federalist Party]] candidate [[John Adams]] won the presidential election. Finishing in second place was [[Democratic-Republican Party]] candidate [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Federalists' opponent, who became the vice president. This resulted in the president and vice president being of different political parties.\n\nIn 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for president and also nominated [[Aaron Burr]] for vice president. After the electors voted, Jefferson and Burr tied one another with 73 electoral votes each. Since ballots did not distinguish between votes for president and votes for vice president, every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to become president, despite Jefferson clearly being his party's first choice. Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the election had to be decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] pursuant to the Constitution's contingency election provision.\n\nHaving already lost the presidential contest, Federalist Party representatives in the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] House session seized upon the opportunity to embarrass their opposition by attempting to elect Burr over Jefferson. The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations in the House (the votes of nine states were needed for a conclusive election). Jefferson achieved electoral victory on the 36th ballot, but only after Federalist Party leader [[Alexander Hamilton]]\u2014who disfavored Burr's personal character more than Jefferson's policies\u2014had made known his preference for Jefferson.\n\nResponding to the problems from those elections, the Congress proposed on December 9, 1803, and three-fourths of the states ratified by June 15, 1804, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. Starting with the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 election]], the amendment requires electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president, replacing the system outlined in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3.\n\n=== Evolution to the general ticket ===\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution states:\n{{quote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.}}\n\nAlexander Hamilton described the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers']] view of how electors would be chosen: {{quote|A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated [tasks].<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\">{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp|title=Federalist No 68|publisher=The Avalon Project}}</ref>}} They assumed this would take place district by district. That plan was carried out by many states until the 1880s. For example, in [[Massachusetts]] in 1820, the rule stated \"the people shall vote by ballot, on which shall be designated who is voted for as an Elector for the district.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0ouAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245|title=Resolves of the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Passed at Their Session, which Commenced on Wednesday, the Thirty First of May, and Ended on the Seventeenth of June, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty.

Russell, 1820; [repr|date=January 1, 1820|publisher=Boston Book Company|via=Google Books}}</ref> In other words, the people did not place the name of a candidate for a president on the ballot, instead they voted for their local elector, whom they trusted later to cast a responsible vote for president.\n\nSome states reasoned that the favorite presidential candidate among the people in their state would have a much better chance if all of the electors selected by their state were sure to vote the same way\u2014a \"general ticket\" of electors pledged to a party candidate.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\">Devin McCarthy (Ph.D. Polysci, Duke), [http://www.fairvote.org/how-the-electoral-college-became-winner-take-all \"How the Electoral College Became Winner-Take-All\"]</ref> So the slate of electors chosen by the state were no longer free agents, independent thinkers, or deliberative representatives. They became \"voluntary party lackeys and intellectual non-entities.\"<ref>Chief Justice Robert Jackson, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/214 Ray v. Blair, dissent, 1952]</ref> Once one state took that strategy, the others felt compelled to follow suit in order to compete for the strongest influence on the election.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\"/>\n\nWhen [[James Madison]] and Hamilton, two of the most important architects of the Electoral College, saw this strategy being taken by some states, they protested strongly. Madison and Hamilton both made it clear this approach violated the spirit of the Constitution. According to Hamilton, the selection of the president should be \"made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president].\"<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\"/> According to Hamilton, the electors were to analyze the list of potential presidents and select the best one. He also used the term \"deliberate\". Hamilton considered a pre-pledged elector to violate the spirit of Article II of the Constitution insofar as such electors could make no \"analysis\" or \"deliberate\" concerning the candidates. Madison agreed entirely, saying that when the Constitution was written, all of its authors assumed individual electors would be elected in their districts and it was inconceivable a \"general ticket\" of electors dictated by a state would supplant the concept. Madison wrote to George Hay: {{quote|The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted; & was exchanged for the general ticket [many years later].<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\">{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|title=Founders Online: James Madison to George Hay, 23 August 1823|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Founding Fathers assumed that each elector would be elected by the citizens of a district and that elector was to be free to analyze and deliberate regarding who is best suited to be president.\n\nMadison and Hamilton were so upset by what they saw as a distortion of the original intent that they advocated a constitutional amendment to prevent anything other than the district plan: \"the election of Presidential Electors by districts, is an amendment very proper to be brought forward,\" Madison told George Hay in 1823.<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\"/> Hamilton went further.

Then Andrew Jackson won in 1828, but that second campaign would also have been lost if the count in the Electoral College were by citizen-only apportionment alone. Scholars conclude that in the 1828 race, Jackson benefited materially from the Three-fifths clause by providing his margin of victory. The impact of the Three-fifths clause in both Jefferson's first and Jackson's first presidential elections was significant because each of them launched sustained Congressional party majorities over several Congresses, as well as presidential party eras.<ref>Brian D.

In most states, voters choose a slate of electors, and only a few states list on the ballot the names of proposed electors. In some states, if a voter wants to write in a candidate for president, the voter is also required to write in the names of proposed electors.\n\nAfter the election, each state prepares seven Certificates of Ascertainment, each listing the candidates for president and vice president, their pledged electors, and the total votes each candidacy received.<ref name=\"electcollinstr\">{{cite web|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|title=Electoral College Instructions to State Officials|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/resources/state-officials-instructions.pdf|accessdate=22 January 2014}}</ref> One certificate is sent, as soon after Election Day as practicable, to the National Archivist in Washington.

Electors meet in their respective [[List of capitals in the United States#State capitals|state capitals]] (electors for the District of Columbia meet within the District) on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, at which time they cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for president and vice president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment12/|title=Twelfth Amendment|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment23/|title=Twenty-third Amendment|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/3/1/7|title=U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;7 : US Code \u2013 Section 7: Meeting and vote of electors|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough procedures in each state vary slightly, the electors generally follow a similar series of steps, and the Congress has constitutional authority to regulate the procedures the states follow. The meeting is opened by the election certification official \u2013 often that state's [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]] or equivalent \u2014 who reads the Certificate of Ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is the selection of a president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states, political officials give short speeches at this point in the proceedings.\n\nWhen the time for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or two people to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. In [[New Jersey]], the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in [[North Carolina]], the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.\n\nEach state's electors must complete six Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must be signed by all of the electors and a Certificate of Ascertainment must be attached to each of the Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must include the names of those who received an electoral vote for either the office of president or of vice president. The electors certify the Certificates of Vote and copies of the Certificates are then sent in the following fashion:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|title=U.S. Electoral College \u2013 For State Officials|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=November 7, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053914/http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* One is sent by [[registered mail]] to the [[President of the Senate]] (who usually is the incumbent [[vice president of the United States]]);\n* Two are sent by registered mail to the [[Archivist of the United States]];\n* Two are sent to the state's Secretary of State; and\n* One is sent to the chief judge of the [[United States district court]] where those electors met.\n\nA staff member of the President of the Senate collects the Certificates of Vote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the Congress.

Of that group, 71 did so because the nominee had died{{snd}}63 Democratic Party electors in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], when presidential nominee [[Horace Greeley]] died; and eight Republican Party electors in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]], when vice presidential nominee [[James S.

As a result, Adams attained 71 electoral votes, Jefferson received 68, and Pinckney received 59, meaning Jefferson, rather than Pinckney, became vice president.<ref>Chernow, Ron. Alexander Hamilton.

As stated in the ruling, electors are acting as a functionary of the state, not the federal government. Therefore, states have the right to govern the process of choosing electors. The constitutionality of state laws punishing electors for actually casting a faithless vote, rather than refusing to pledge, has never been decided by the Supreme Court. However, in his dissent in ''Ray v. Blair'', Justice [[Robert H. Jackson|Robert Jackson]] wrote: \"no one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text \u2014 that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices.\"\n\n=== Joint session of Congress ===\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uiAex46pVw A joint session of Congress confirms the 2016 electoral college results], YouTube video.

The vice president and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] sit at the podium, with the vice president in the seat of the Speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the certificate of vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.\n\nMembers of Congress can object to any state's vote count, provided objection is presented in writing and is signed by at least one member of each house of Congress. An objection supported by at least one senator and one representative will be followed by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each House of Congress; after both Houses deliberate on the objection, the joint session is resumed. \n\nA state's certificate of vote can be rejected only if both Houses of Congress vote to accept the objection, meaning the votes from the State in question are not counted. Individual votes can also be rejected, and are also not counted. \n\nIn [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]], all of the votes from Louisiana and Tennessee were rejected, and in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], all of the votes from Arkansas and Louisiana plus three of the eleven electoral votes  from Georgia were rejected. <ref>{{cite book|author=David A.

Bush of Texas and the vice president of the United States, Al Gore. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of which were raised by only several representatives and would have favored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object. Objections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections, and on that occasion the document was presented by one representative and one senator. Although the joint session was suspended, the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress. \n\nIf there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply includes a state's votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the official tally.\n\nAfter the certificates from all states are read and the respective votes are counted, the presiding officer simply announces the final result of the vote and, provided the required absolute majority of votes was achieved, declares the names of the persons elected president and vice president. This announcement concludes the joint session and formalizes the recognition of the president-elect and of the vice president-elect. The senators then depart from the House Chamber. The final tally is printed in the Senate and House journals.\n\n=== Contingencies ===\n{{further|Contingent election}}\n\n==== Contingent presidential election by House ====\nThe [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] requires the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to go into session immediately to vote for a president if no candidate for president receives a majority of the electoral votes (since 1964, 270 of the 538 electoral votes).\n\nIn this event, the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes for president. Each state delegation votes ''en bloc'' \u2014 each delegation having a single vote; the District of Columbia does not get to vote. A candidate must receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes (i.e., at present, a minimum of 26 votes) in order for that candidate to become the ''president-elect''. Additionally, delegations from at least two thirds of all the states must be present for voting to take place. The House continues balloting until it elects a president.\n\nThe House of Representatives has chosen the president only twice: in [[1800 United States presidential election|1801]] under Article II, Section 1, Clause 3; and in [[1824 United States presidential election|1825]] under the Twelfth Amendment.\n\n==== Contingent vice presidential election by Senate ====\nIf no candidate for vice president receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, then the [[United States Senate|Senate]] must go into session to elect a vice president. The Senate is limited to choosing from the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. Normally this would mean two candidates, one less than the number of candidates available in the House vote. However, the text is written in such a way that ''all'' candidates with the most and second most electoral votes are eligible for the Senate election \u2013 this number could theoretically be larger than two. The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case (i.e., ballots are individually cast by each senator, not by state delegations). However, two-thirds of the senators must be present for voting to take place.\n\nAdditionally, the Twelfth Amendment states a \"majority of the whole number\" of senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm#_1_8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231654/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm|archivedate=June 28, 2011|title=RL30804: The Electoral College: An Overview and Analysis of Reform Proposals, L.

Section{{nbsp}}3 also specifies Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect in time for the inauguration.

The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by [[North Carolina]] and [[Ohio]] in 1932. [[Alabama]] was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the short ballot.\n\nThe question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain the legislature's choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in two U.S. Supreme Court cases. In ''[[McPherson v. Blacker]]'', {{ussc|146|1|1892}}, the Court cited Article II, Section 1, Clause{{nbsp}}2 which states that a state's electors are selected \"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct\" and wrote these words \"operat[e] as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power\". In ''Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board'', {{ussc|531|70|2000}}, a Florida Supreme Court decision was vacated (not reversed) based on ''McPherson''. On the other hand, three dissenting justices in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', {{ussc|531|98|2000}}, wrote: \"[N]othing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created it.\"<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZD.html ''Bush v. Gore'', (Justice Stevens dissenting)] (quote in second paragraph)</ref>\n\n=== Appointment by state legislature ===\nIn the earliest presidential elections, state legislative choice was the most common method of choosing electors. A majority of the state legislatures selected presidential electors in both 1792 (9 of 15) and 1800 (10 of 16), and half of them did so in 1812.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=John L.|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|edition=2nd|publisher=Congressional Quarterly, Inc.|place=Washington, D.C.|year=1985|page=255|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

As noted above, the two situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an election. However, appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences: [[bicameral]] legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate. This is precisely what happened to New York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=John L.|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|edition=2nd|publisher=Congressional Quarterly, Inc.|place=Washington, D.C.|year=1985|page=254|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

By this method, voters in each district would cast their ballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated by congressional districts. However, the difference stems from the fact that every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to [[gerrymandering]].\n\n=== Proportional vote ===\nUnder such a system, electors would be selected in proportion to the votes cast for their candidate or party, rather than being selected by the statewide plurality vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fairvote.org/e_college/reform.htm#proportional|title=FairVote|publisher=FairVote|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref> \n\n=== Congressional district method ===\nThere are two versions of the congressional district method: one has been implemented in Maine and Nebraska; another has been proposed in Virginia.\nUnder the implemented congressional district method, the electoral votes go to the winner of a plurality of the popular vote winner within each of the states' [[congressional district]]s; the statewide popular vote winner receives two additional electoral votes. While this method may result in a more proportional allocation of electors, this is not necessarily the case. For example, in 1992, [[George H. W. Bush]] won all five of Nebraska's electoral votes with 47% of the vote; in a proportional system, he would have received three and [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ross Perot]] each would have received one. <ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903145758/http://www1.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archivedate=September 3, 2006|title=Fiddling with the Rules|website=Franklin & Marshall College|date=March 9, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a different version of the congressional district method was proposed in Virginia. This version would distribute Virginia's electoral votes based on the popular vote winner within each of Virginia's congressional districts; the two statewide electoral votes would be awarded based on which candidate won the most congressional districts, rather than on who won Virginia's statewide popular vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-in-virginia-other-states-seeking-electoral-college-changes/2013/01/24/430096e6-6654-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|title=Republicans in Virginia, other states seeking electoral college changes|newspaper=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=January 24, 2013|first1=Nia-Malika|last1=Henderson|first2=Errin|last2=Haines|date=January 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe congressional district method can more easily be implemented than other alternatives to the winner-takes-all method, in view of major party resistance to relatively enabling third parties under the proportional method.

Populous states in which pre-election poll results show no clear favorite are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers, and debates, while \"four out of five\" voters in the national election are \"absolutely ignored\", according to one assessment.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-end-electoral-college/|title=It's Time to End the Electoral College: Here's how.|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Since most states use a [[Plurality voting system|winner-takes-all]] arrangement in which the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state's electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively on only a few key undecided states; in recent elections, these states have included [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], and [[Florida]] in 2004 and 2008, and included [[Colorado]] in 2012. In contrast, states with large populations such as [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], have in recent elections been considered \"safe\" for a particular party \u2014 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] for California and New York and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for Texas \u2014 and therefore campaigns spend less time and money there. Many small states are also considered to be \"safe\" for one of the two political parties and are also generally ignored by campaigners: of the 13 smallest states, six are reliably Democratic, six are reliably Republican, and only New Hampshire is considered as a swing state, according to critic [[George C.

For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by [[voter suppression]] methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchising]] specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement has no effect on the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend the electoral college system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.\n\nLegal scholars [[Akhil Reed Amar|Akhil Amar]] and [[Vikram Amar]] have argued that the original Electoral College compromise was enacted partially because it enabled Southern states to disenfranchise their slave populations.<ref name=\"amar\">{{Cite journal|last=Amar|first=Akhil|last2=Amar|first2=Vikram|title=The Electoral College Votes Against Equality|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 2004|url=http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415144403/http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality|archivedate=2010-04-15}}</ref> It permitted Southern states to disfranchise large numbers of slaves while allowing these states to maintain political clout within the federation by using the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].

Proponents of the current system argue the collective opinion of even a small state merits attention at the federal level greater than that given to a small, though numerically equivalent, portion of a very populous state. The system also allows each state the freedom, within constitutional bounds, to design its own laws on voting and enfranchisement without an undue incentive to maximize the number of votes cast.\n\nFor many years early in the nation's history, up until the [[Jacksonian Era]], many states appointed their electors by a vote of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], and proponents argue that, in the end, the election of the president must still come down to the decisions of each state, or the federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive, centralized government.<ref name=\"FEC\">{{cite web|author=Kimberling, William C.|title=The Electoral College|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|url=http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf|date=May 1992|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''[[A More Perfect Constitution]]'', Professor [[Larry Sabato]] elaborated on this advantage of the Electoral College, arguing to \"mend it, don't end it,\" in part because of its usefulness in forcing candidates to pay attention to lightly populated states and reinforcing the role of the state in federalism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sabato|first=Larry|title=A More Perfect Constitution|publisher=Walker Publishing Company|year=2007|edition=First U.S.|isbn=978-0-8027-1621-7|url=https://archive.org/details/moreperfectconst00saba|accessdate=July 30, 2009|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

This encourages candidates to court a wide variety of such minorities and [[advocacy group]]s.<ref name=\"FEC\" />\n\n==== Encouragement of stability through the two-party system ====\n{{main|Two party system}}\n\nProponents of the Electoral College see its negative effect on [[Third party (politics)|third parties]] as beneficial.

They believe it protects the most powerful office in the country from control by what these proponents view as regional minorities until they can moderate their views to win broad, long-term support across the nation. Advocates of a national popular vote for president suggest that this effect would also be true in popular vote elections. Of 918 elections for governor between 1948 and 2009, for example, more than 90% were won by candidates securing more than 50% of the vote, and none have been won with less than 35% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.fairvote.org/majority-and-plurality-in-u-s-gubernatorial-elections Majority and Plurality in U.S. Gubernatorial Elections].

Advocates of the current system argue that human electors would be in a better position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting public.

Such an amendment, which would abolish the Electoral College, will ensure that the candidate chosen by the voters actually becomes President. Under the Electoral College, it is always possible that the winner of the popular vote will not be elected. This has already happened in three elections, 1824, 1876, and 1888. In the last election, the result could have been changed by a small shift of votes in Ohio and Hawaii, despite a popular vote difference of 1.7 million. I do not recommend a Constitutional amendment lightly. I think the amendment process must be reserved for an issue of overriding governmental significance. But the method by which we elect our President is such an issue. I will not be proposing a specific direct election amendment.

The electors come directly from the people and them alone for that purpose only, and for that time only. This avoided a party-run legislature, or a permanent body that could be influenced by foreign interests before each election.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\">Hamilton. [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp The Federalist Papers: No. 68] The Avalon Project, Yale Law School. viewed November 10, 2016.</ref> Hamilton explained the election was to take place among all the states, so no corruption in any state could taint \"the great body of the people\" in their selection. The choice was to be made by a majority of the Electoral College, as majority rule is critical to the principles of republican government. Hamilton argued that electors meeting in the state capitals were able to have information unavailable to the general public. Hamilton also argued that since no federal officeholder could be an elector, none of the electors would be beholden to any presidential candidate.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAnother consideration was the decision would be made without \"tumult and disorder\" as it would be a broad-based one made simultaneously in various locales where the decision-makers could deliberate reasonably, not in one place where decision-makers could be threatened or intimidated. If the Electoral College did not achieve a decisive majority, then the House of Representatives was to choose the president from among the top five candidates,<ref>The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] changed this to the top three candidates</ref> ensuring selection of a presiding officer administering the laws would have both ability and good character. Hamilton was also concerned about somebody unqualified, but with a talent for \"low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity\" attaining high office.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Federalist No. 10]], James Madison argued against \"an interested and overbearing majority\" and the \"mischiefs of faction\" in an electoral system. He defined a faction as \"a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\" What was then called republican government (i.e., [[representative democracy]], as opposed to [[direct democracy]]) combined with the principles of [[federalism]] (with distribution of voter rights and separation of government powers) would countervail against factions. Madison further postulated in the Federalist No.{{nbsp}}10 that the greater the population and expanse of the Republic, the more difficulty factions would face in organizing due to such issues as [[sectionalism]].<ref>''The Federalist Papers: Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay'' The New American Library, 1961</ref>\n\nAlthough the United States Constitution refers to \"Electors\" and \"electors\", neither the phrase \"Electoral College\" nor any other name is used to describe the electors collectively. It was not until the early 19th century the name \"Electoral College\" came into general usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast votes for president and vice president. The phrase was first written into federal law in 1845 and today the term appears in {{USC|3|4}}, in the section heading and in the text as \"college of electors\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html|title=U.

Under the original plan, each elector cast two votes for president; electors did not vote for vice president. Whoever received a majority of votes from the electors would become president, with the person receiving the second most votes becoming vice president.\n\nThe original plan of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Stanley|title=Updating the Electoral College: The National Popular Vote Legislation|journal=Harvard Journal on Legislation|volume=44|issue=205, at 208|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|location=Cambridge, MA|year=2007}}</ref>\n# Choice of the president should reflect the \"sense of the people\" at a particular time, not the dictates of a faction in a \"pre-established body\" such as Congress or the State legislatures, and independent of the influence of \"foreign powers\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Hamilton, Alexander.

Hamilton so strongly believed this was to be done district by district, and when states began doing otherwise, he proposed a constitutional amendment to mandate the district system (Hamilton, [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289 Draft of a Constitutional Amendment]). Madison concurred, \"The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted.\" ([https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023 Madison to Hay, 1823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|date=May 25, 2017}})</ref>\n# Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting, deliberating with the most complete information available in a system that over time, tended to bring about a good administration of the laws passed by Congress.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n# Candidates would not pair together on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president.\n# The system as designed would rarely produce a winner, thus sending the presidential election to the House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to the text of Article II, however, each state government was free to have its own plan for selecting its electors, and the Constitution does not explicitly require states to popularly elect their electors. Several methods for selecting electors are described [[United States Electoral College#Alternative methods of choosing electors|below]].\n\n==== Breakdown and revision ====\nThe emergence of [[Political party|political parties]] and nationally coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]] and [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]. In 1796, [[Federalist Party]] candidate [[John Adams]] won the presidential election. Finishing in second place was [[Democratic-Republican Party]] candidate [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Federalists' opponent, who became the vice president. This resulted in the president and vice president being of different political parties.\n\nIn 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for president and also nominated [[Aaron Burr]] for vice president. After the electors voted, Jefferson and Burr tied one another with 73 electoral votes each. Since ballots did not distinguish between votes for president and votes for vice president, every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to become president, despite Jefferson clearly being his party's first choice. Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the election had to be decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] pursuant to the Constitution's contingency election provision.\n\nHaving already lost the presidential contest, Federalist Party representatives in the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] House session seized upon the opportunity to embarrass their opposition by attempting to elect Burr over Jefferson. The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations in the House (the votes of nine states were needed for a conclusive election). Jefferson achieved electoral victory on the 36th ballot, but only after Federalist Party leader [[Alexander Hamilton]]\u2014who disfavored Burr's personal character more than Jefferson's policies\u2014had made known his preference for Jefferson.\n\nResponding to the problems from those elections, the Congress proposed on December 9, 1803, and three-fourths of the states ratified by June 15, 1804, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. Starting with the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 election]], the amendment requires electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president, replacing the system outlined in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3.\n\n=== Evolution to the general ticket ===\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution states:\n{{quote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.}}\n\nAlexander Hamilton described the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers']] view of how electors would be chosen: {{quote|A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated [tasks].<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\">{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp|title=Federalist No 68|publisher=The Avalon Project}}</ref>}} They assumed this would take place district by district. That plan was carried out by many states until the 1880s. For example, in [[Massachusetts]] in 1820, the rule stated \"the people shall vote by ballot, on which shall be designated who is voted for as an Elector for the district.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0ouAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245|title=Resolves of the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Passed at Their Session, which Commenced on Wednesday, the Thirty First of May, and Ended on the Seventeenth of June, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty.

Russell, 1820; [repr|date=January 1, 1820|publisher=Boston Book Company|via=Google Books}}</ref> In other words, the people did not place the name of a candidate for a president on the ballot, instead they voted for their local elector, whom they trusted later to cast a responsible vote for president.\n\nSome states reasoned that the favorite presidential candidate among the people in their state would have a much better chance if all of the electors selected by their state were sure to vote the same way\u2014a \"general ticket\" of electors pledged to a party candidate.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\">Devin McCarthy (Ph.D. Polysci, Duke), [http://www.fairvote.org/how-the-electoral-college-became-winner-take-all \"How the Electoral College Became Winner-Take-All\"]</ref> So the slate of electors chosen by the state were no longer free agents, independent thinkers, or deliberative representatives. They became \"voluntary party lackeys and intellectual non-entities.\"<ref>Chief Justice Robert Jackson, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/214 Ray v. Blair, dissent, 1952]</ref> Once one state took that strategy, the others felt compelled to follow suit in order to compete for the strongest influence on the election.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\"/>\n\nWhen [[James Madison]] and Hamilton, two of the most important architects of the Electoral College, saw this strategy being taken by some states, they protested strongly. Madison and Hamilton both made it clear this approach violated the spirit of the Constitution. According to Hamilton, the selection of the president should be \"made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president].\"<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\"/> According to Hamilton, the electors were to analyze the list of potential presidents and select the best one. He also used the term \"deliberate\". Hamilton considered a pre-pledged elector to violate the spirit of Article II of the Constitution insofar as such electors could make no \"analysis\" or \"deliberate\" concerning the candidates. Madison agreed entirely, saying that when the Constitution was written, all of its authors assumed individual electors would be elected in their districts and it was inconceivable a \"general ticket\" of electors dictated by a state would supplant the concept. Madison wrote to George Hay: {{quote|The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted; & was exchanged for the general ticket [many years later].<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\">{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|title=Founders Online: James Madison to George Hay, 23 August 1823|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Founding Fathers assumed that each elector would be elected by the citizens of a district and that elector was to be free to analyze and deliberate regarding who is best suited to be president.\n\nMadison and Hamilton were so upset by what they saw as a distortion of the original intent that they advocated a constitutional amendment to prevent anything other than the district plan: \"the election of Presidential Electors by districts, is an amendment very proper to be brought forward,\" Madison told George Hay in 1823.<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\"/> Hamilton went further. He actually drafted an amendment to the Constitution mandating the district plan for selecting electors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289|title=Founders Online: Draft of a Resolution for the Legislature of New York for the{{nbsp}}...|website=founders.archives.gov}}</ref> However, Hamilton's [[Burr-Hamilton duel|untimely death]] in 1804 prevented him from advancing his proposed reforms any further.\n\n=== Evolution of selection plans ===\nIn 1789, at-large popular vote, the winner-take-all method, began with Pennsylvania and Maryland; Virginia and Delaware used a district plan by popular vote, and in the five other states participating in the election (Connecticut, Georgia, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Carolina),<ref>{{cite web|title=1788 Election For the First Term, 1789\u20131793|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/votes/1789_1821.html#1788|website=U.

Beginning with the first census, Electoral College votes repeatedly eclipsed the electoral basis supporting slave-power in the choice of the U.S. president.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130103115308/http://history.house.gov/Institution/Apportionment/Apportionment/ Apportionment by State (PDF)], House of Representatives, History, Art & Archives, viewed January 27, 2019. Unlike the votes taken in the Electoral College, from 1803 to 1846, the U.S. Senate sustained parity between free-soil and slave-holding states. But subsequently, an unbroken chain of free-soil states, including Iowa, Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, Oregon and Kansas, were admitted before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].</ref>\n\nAt the Constitution, the Electoral College was authorized a majority of 49 votes for northern states in the process of abolishing slavery, and 42 votes for slave-holding states (including Delaware). In the event, the first 1788 presidential election did not include Electoral College votes for unratified Rhode Island (3) and North Carolina (7), nor for New York (8) which reported too late; the Northern majority was 38 to 35.<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript U.S. Constitution Transcript], held at the U.S. National Archives, viewed online on February 5, 2019.</ref> Then for the first two decades of census apportionment in the Electoral College, in 1790 and in 1800, the Three-fifths clause awarded free-soil Northern states narrow majorities of 8% and 11% as the Southern states in [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Convention]] had given up two-fifths of their slave population in their federal apportionment compromise.

The seats that the South gained from a slave bonus were evenly distributed between the parties of the period.

Then Andrew Jackson won in 1828, but that second campaign would also have been lost if the count in the Electoral College were by citizen-only apportionment alone. Scholars conclude that in the 1828 race, Jackson benefited materially from the Three-fifths clause by providing his margin of victory. The impact of the Three-fifths clause in both Jefferson's first and Jackson's first presidential elections was significant because each of them launched sustained Congressional party majorities over several Congresses, as well as presidential party eras.<ref>Brian D.

Electors usually vote for the nominees of their party to whom they have been pledged, but some \"[[faithless elector]]s\" have voted for other candidates or refrained from voting.\n\nA candidate must receive an [[absolute majority]] of electoral votes (currently 270) to win the presidency or the vice presidency. If no candidate receives a majority in the election for president or vice president, the election is determined via a [[#Contingencies|contingency procedure]] established by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]].

In some states, such as [[Oklahoma]], [[Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]], electors are nominated in party conventions.

The meeting is opened by the election certification official \u2013 often that state's [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]] or equivalent \u2014 who reads the Certificate of Ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is the selection of a president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states, political officials give short speeches at this point in the proceedings.\n\nWhen the time for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or two people to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. In [[New Jersey]], the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in [[North Carolina]], the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.\n\nEach state's electors must complete six Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must be signed by all of the electors and a Certificate of Ascertainment must be attached to each of the Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must include the names of those who received an electoral vote for either the office of president or of vice president. The electors certify the Certificates of Vote and copies of the Certificates are then sent in the following fashion:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|title=U.S. Electoral College \u2013 For State Officials|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=November 7, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053914/http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* One is sent by [[registered mail]] to the [[President of the Senate]] (who usually is the incumbent [[vice president of the United States]]);\n* Two are sent by registered mail to the [[Archivist of the United States]];\n* Two are sent to the state's Secretary of State; and\n* One is sent to the chief judge of the [[United States district court]] where those electors met.\n\nA staff member of the President of the Senate collects the Certificates of Vote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the Congress.

An objection supported by at least one senator and one representative will be followed by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each House of Congress; after both Houses deliberate on the objection, the joint session is resumed. \n\nA state's certificate of vote can be rejected only if both Houses of Congress vote to accept the objection, meaning the votes from the State in question are not counted. Individual votes can also be rejected, and are also not counted. \n\nIn [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]], all of the votes from Louisiana and Tennessee were rejected, and in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], all of the votes from Arkansas and Louisiana plus three of the eleven electoral votes  from Georgia were rejected. <ref>{{cite book|author=David A.

Bush of Texas and the vice president of the United States, Al Gore. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of which were raised by only several representatives and would have favored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object. Objections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections, and on that occasion the document was presented by one representative and one senator. Although the joint session was suspended, the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress. \n\nIf there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply includes a state's votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the official tally.\n\nAfter the certificates from all states are read and the respective votes are counted, the presiding officer simply announces the final result of the vote and, provided the required absolute majority of votes was achieved, declares the names of the persons elected president and vice president. This announcement concludes the joint session and formalizes the recognition of the president-elect and of the vice president-elect. The senators then depart from the House Chamber. The final tally is printed in the Senate and House journals.\n\n=== Contingencies ===\n{{further|Contingent election}}\n\n==== Contingent presidential election by House ====\nThe [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] requires the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to go into session immediately to vote for a president if no candidate for president receives a majority of the electoral votes (since 1964, 270 of the 538 electoral votes).\n\nIn this event, the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes for president. Each state delegation votes ''en bloc'' \u2014 each delegation having a single vote; the District of Columbia does not get to vote. A candidate must receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes (i.e., at present, a minimum of 26 votes) in order for that candidate to become the ''president-elect''. Additionally, delegations from at least two thirds of all the states must be present for voting to take place. The House continues balloting until it elects a president.\n\nThe House of Representatives has chosen the president only twice: in [[1800 United States presidential election|1801]] under Article II, Section 1, Clause 3; and in [[1824 United States presidential election|1825]] under the Twelfth Amendment.\n\n==== Contingent vice presidential election by Senate ====\nIf no candidate for vice president receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, then the [[United States Senate|Senate]] must go into session to elect a vice president. The Senate is limited to choosing from the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. Normally this would mean two candidates, one less than the number of candidates available in the House vote. However, the text is written in such a way that ''all'' candidates with the most and second most electoral votes are eligible for the Senate election \u2013 this number could theoretically be larger than two. The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case (i.e., ballots are individually cast by each senator, not by state delegations). However, two-thirds of the senators must be present for voting to take place.\n\nAdditionally, the Twelfth Amendment states a \"majority of the whole number\" of senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm#_1_8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231654/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm|archivedate=June 28, 2011|title=RL30804: The Electoral College: An Overview and Analysis of Reform Proposals, L.

In that instance, the Senate adopted an alphabetical [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|roll call]] and voting aloud. The rules further stated, \"[I]f a majority of the number of senators shall vote for either the said [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M.

Section{{nbsp}}3 also specifies Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect in time for the inauguration. Under the [[Presidential Succession Act#Presidential Succession Act of 1947|Presidential Succession Act of 1947]], the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president. Neither of these situations has ever occurred.\n\n=== Current electoral vote distribution ===\n{{see also|Electoral vote changes between United States presidential elections}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Electoral votes (EV) allocations for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.<ref name=\"2010census01\">{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/news/pdf/apport2010_map1.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124045725/http://2010.census.gov/news/pdf/apport2010_map1.pdf|archivedate=2011-01-24|title=Apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives Based on the 2010 Census|date=December 21, 2010|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=December 21, 2010}} Each state's number of electoral votes is equal to its total congressional representation (its number of Representatives plus its two Senators).</ref><br />Triangular markers {{nowrap|(<sup>{{increase}}{{decrease}}</sup>)}} indicate gains or losses following the 2010 Census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/Census10/HouseAndElectors.phtml|title=2010 Census: State Population and the Distribution of Electoral Votes and Representatives|website=The Green Papers}}</ref>\n!

The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by [[North Carolina]] and [[Ohio]] in 1932. [[Alabama]] was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the short ballot.\n\nThe question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain the legislature's choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in two U.S. Supreme Court cases. In ''[[McPherson v. Blacker]]'', {{ussc|146|1|1892}}, the Court cited Article II, Section 1, Clause{{nbsp}}2 which states that a state's electors are selected \"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct\" and wrote these words \"operat[e] as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power\". In ''Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board'', {{ussc|531|70|2000}}, a Florida Supreme Court decision was vacated (not reversed) based on ''McPherson''. On the other hand, three dissenting justices in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', {{ussc|531|98|2000}}, wrote: \"[N]othing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created it.\"<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZD.html ''Bush v.

By this method, voters in each district would cast their ballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated by congressional districts. However, the difference stems from the fact that every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to [[gerrymandering]].\n\n=== Proportional vote ===\nUnder such a system, electors would be selected in proportion to the votes cast for their candidate or party, rather than being selected by the statewide plurality vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fairvote.org/e_college/reform.htm#proportional|title=FairVote|publisher=FairVote|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref> \n\n=== Congressional district method ===\nThere are two versions of the congressional district method: one has been implemented in Maine and Nebraska; another has been proposed in Virginia.\nUnder the implemented congressional district method, the electoral votes go to the winner of a plurality of the popular vote winner within each of the states' [[congressional district]]s; the statewide popular vote winner receives two additional electoral votes. While this method may result in a more proportional allocation of electors, this is not necessarily the case. For example, in 1992, [[George H. W. Bush]] won all five of Nebraska's electoral votes with 47% of the vote; in a proportional system, he would have received three and [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ross Perot]] each would have received one. <ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903145758/http://www1.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archivedate=September 3, 2006|title=Fiddling with the Rules|website=Franklin & Marshall College|date=March 9, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a different version of the congressional district method was proposed in Virginia.

Populous states in which pre-election poll results show no clear favorite are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers, and debates, while \"four out of five\" voters in the national election are \"absolutely ignored\", according to one assessment.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-end-electoral-college/|title=It's Time to End the Electoral College: Here's how.|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Since most states use a [[Plurality voting system|winner-takes-all]] arrangement in which the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state's electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively on only a few key undecided states; in recent elections, these states have included [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], and [[Florida]] in 2004 and 2008, and included [[Colorado]] in 2012. In contrast, states with large populations such as [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], have in recent elections been considered \"safe\" for a particular party \u2014 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] for California and New York and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for Texas \u2014 and therefore campaigns spend less time and money there. Many small states are also considered to be \"safe\" for one of the two political parties and are also generally ignored by campaigners: of the 13 smallest states, six are reliably Democratic, six are reliably Republican, and only New Hampshire is considered as a swing state, according to critic [[George C.

The differences in turnout between swing states and non-swing states under the current electoral college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with direct election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and participation significantly.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==== Obscuring disenfranchisement within states ====\nAccording to this criticism, the electoral college reduces elections to a mere count of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it obscures any voting problems ''within'' a particular state. For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by [[voter suppression]] methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchising]] specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement has no effect on the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend the electoral college system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.\n\nLegal scholars [[Akhil Reed Amar|Akhil Amar]] and [[Vikram Amar]] have argued that the original Electoral College compromise was enacted partially because it enabled Southern states to disenfranchise their slave populations.<ref name=\"amar\">{{Cite journal|last=Amar|first=Akhil|last2=Amar|first2=Vikram|title=The Electoral College Votes Against Equality|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 2004|url=http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415144403/http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality|archivedate=2010-04-15}}</ref> It permitted Southern states to disfranchise large numbers of slaves while allowing these states to maintain political clout within the federation by using the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].

The system also allows each state the freedom, within constitutional bounds, to design its own laws on voting and enfranchisement without an undue incentive to maximize the number of votes cast.\n\nFor many years early in the nation's history, up until the [[Jacksonian Era]], many states appointed their electors by a vote of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], and proponents argue that, in the end, the election of the president must still come down to the decisions of each state, or the federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive, centralized government.<ref name=\"FEC\">{{cite web|author=Kimberling, William C.|title=The Electoral College|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|url=http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf|date=May 1992|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''[[A More Perfect Constitution]]'', Professor [[Larry Sabato]] elaborated on this advantage of the Electoral College, arguing to \"mend it, don't end it,\" in part because of its usefulness in forcing candidates to pay attention to lightly populated states and reinforcing the role of the state in federalism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sabato|first=Larry|title=A More Perfect Constitution|publisher=Walker Publishing Company|year=2007|edition=First U.S.|isbn=978-0-8027-1621-7|url=https://archive.org/details/moreperfectconst00saba|accessdate=July 30, 2009|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

They believe it protects the most powerful office in the country from control by what these proponents view as regional minorities until they can moderate their views to win broad, long-term support across the nation. Advocates of a national popular vote for president suggest that this effect would also be true in popular vote elections. Of 918 elections for governor between 1948 and 2009, for example, more than 90% were won by candidates securing more than 50% of the vote, and none have been won with less than 35% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.fairvote.org/majority-and-plurality-in-u-s-gubernatorial-elections Majority and Plurality in U.S. Gubernatorial Elections].

The letter read in part:{{quote|My fourth recommendation is that the Congress adopt a Constitutional amendment to provide for direct popular election of the President. Such an amendment, which would abolish the Electoral College, will ensure that the candidate chosen by the voters actually becomes President. Under the Electoral College, it is always possible that the winner of the popular vote will not be elected. This has already happened in three elections, 1824, 1876, and 1888. In the last election, the result could have been changed by a small shift of votes in Ohio and Hawaii, despite a popular vote difference of 1.7 million. I do not recommend a Constitutional amendment lightly. I think the amendment process must be reserved for an issue of overriding governmental significance. But the method by which we elect our President is such an issue. I will not be proposing a specific direct election amendment. I prefer to allow the Congress to proceed with its work without the interruption of a new proposal.<ref>''[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=7218.

The natives have worked this ore for ages, as can be seen by their old dumps, and they work it to-day. The field is very extensive, and reaches away to [[Katanga (province)|Katanga]]... The natives inhabiting this part of the country are skilled workmen, and have traded their handiwork with all comers, even as far afield as the Portuguese of the West Coast and the Arabs of the East. These natives, being miners and workers of copper and iron, and being permanently located in the ground, would give the very element needed in developing these fields.''</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>''The increasing use of copper bids fair to make it one of the most valuable products a country can have.... The copper mines of [[Montana]] and [[Arizona]] have proven of more value than the gold mines, regardless of the fact that the copper had to be hauled two thousand miles by rail to the seaboard, and the coal and coke to smelt it hauled hundreds of miles to the mines. So far as natural difficulties are concerned, this northern field can be fed from the coal deposits of the valley of the [[Zambezi]] (Ed: Burnham had previously discovered the massive coal fields at [[Hwange]]), and the product shipped to the East Coast at a less expense than the product of Montana and Arizona can be laid on the dock at [[New York City|New York]].''</blockquote>\n\nMany years later, the [[British South Africa Company]] built towns along the river and a railroad to transport the copper through [[Mozambique]].<ref name=\"juang2008\">{{cite book |last=Juang |first=Richard M. |title=Africa and the Americas: culture, politics, and history : a multidisciplinary encyclopedia, Volume 2 Transatlantic relations series |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=1157 |year=2008 |isbn=1-85109-441-5}}</ref>\n\n== Prehistory ==\nThe Copperbelt was inhabited by many prehistoric groups including the [[Chondwe Goup|Chondwe Group]] whose pottery resembles that of Luangwa vessels found today in the [[Kalambo Falls]] region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillipson|first=D.W.|year=1974|title=Iron Age History and Archaeology in Zambia|jstor=180367|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=15 |issue=1|pages=1\u201325|doi=10.1017/s0021853700013219}}</ref>\n\n==Geology==\nDuring the 1950s, this was the largest copper producing area in the world, and included the [[Luanshya|Roan Antelope Mine]], [[Nkana]] Mine, the [[Nchanga Mines]], the [[Mufulira]] Mine, and the Rokana Mine.

It is responsible for the political action, regulatation and administration of the government of the autonomous region.<ref>''[[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]]'' (2006), Art. 68.</ref>\n\nThe [[President of the Generalitat de Catalunya|President of the Generalitat]] is the [[head of government]]: he or she may also appoint a [[List of First Ministers of Catalonia|First Minister]] (Catalan: ''Conseller(a) primer(a)'') to serve as their deputy, although since 2006 the office has been replaced by that of the [[List of Vice Presidents of Catalonia|Vice-President of the Generalitat of Catalonia]], who must be approved by the [[Parliament of Catalonia]]. The various ministers (Catalan: ''consellers'') are also appointed by the President of the Generalitat. Ministers need not be [[Deputy (Catalonia)|deputies]] in the parliament, as they have an automatic right to intervene in parliamentary \ndebates.\n\nServing members of the government may not be arrested for any acts committed in Catalonia, except ''[[in flagrante delicto]]'', and may only be judged before the [[High Court of Justice of Catalonia]], or the Criminal Chamber of the [[Supreme Court of Spain]] outside of Catalonia.<ref>''[[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia]]'' (2006), Art. 70.</ref>\n\nThe [[Parliament of Catalonia]] unilaterally issued a [[Catalan declaration of independence|declaration of independence]] from Spain on 27 October 2017 in favour of a Catalan Republic. In response [[Prime Minister of Spain|Spanish Prime Minister]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] dissolved the Parliament of Catalonia and called a [[2017 Catalan regional election|snap regional election]] for 21

It is based on the 1978 [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] and how it alters their physical and emotional state. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates and their delusional state is overtaken by reality, resulting in catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite struggling to secure funding for it. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoidance of reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a critical positive response from critics despite tepid success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.  \n\nAt the recommendation of a friend, she visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs and persuades her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]]. \n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between black traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]], and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post [[bail]]. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal, strains their relationship.  \n\nSara's increased dosage distorts her sense of reality and begins to hallucinate, in which she is mocked by a crowd from the television show and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to medication. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] arm. The shocked doctor realizes Harry and Tyrone's situation and they are arrested. \n\nBack in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim, in exchange for heroin, and receives even more when she subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curl into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.

The Harry-Tyrone-Marion story is a very traditional heroin story. But putting it side by side with the Sara story, we suddenly say, 'Oh, my God, what is a drug?' The idea that the same inner monologue goes through a person's head when they're trying to quit drugs, as with cigarettes, as when they're trying to not eat food so they can lose 20 pounds, was really fascinating to me.

He writes the most discordant, angry words that tickle the air with some sweet music around it. It's an unbelievable experience to read his books.

It is based on the 1978 [[Requiem for a Dream (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Hubert Selby Jr.]], with whom Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. The film depicts four characters affected by [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] and how it alters their physical and emotional state. Their addictions cause them to become imprisoned in a world of delusion and desperation. As the film progresses, each character deteriorates and their delusional state is overtaken by reality, resulting in catastrophe.\n\nSelby's novel was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by Aronofsky and producer Eric Watson. Selby had always intended to adapt the novel into a film, as he had written a script years prior to Aronofsky approaching him. Aronofsky was enthusiastic of the story and developed the script with Selby, despite struggling to secure funding for it. He and the cast speak of the film being about addictions in general, and not just drugs, with a theme of loneliness and avoidance of reality in different ways.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], selected as an out-of-competition entry, followed by the United States theatrical release on October 6, 2000, by Artisan Entertainment. It received a critical positive response from critics despite tepid success at the box office. The film's visual style, music and cast were all praised, with Burstyn receiving an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The soundtrack was composed by [[Clint Mansell]].\n\n==Plot==\nSara Goldfarb, a widow who lives alone in a [[Brighton Beach]] apartment, spends her time watching television. Her son Harry is a heroin addict, along with his friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion. The three traffic heroin in a bid to realize their dreams; Harry and Marion plan to open a clothing store for Marion's designs, while Tyrone seeks escape from the ghetto and the approval of his mother. When Sara receives a call that she has been invited to her favorite game show, she begins a restrictive crash diet in an attempt to fit into a red dress that she wore at Harry's graduation.  \n\nAt the recommendation of a friend, she visits a physician who prescribes her [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]] to control her appetite. She begins losing weight rapidly and is excited by how much energy she has. When Harry recognizes the signs and persuades her to stop taking the amphetamines, Sara insists that the chance to appear on television and the increased admiration from her friends are her remaining reasons to live. Sara becomes frantic waiting for the invitation and increases her dosage, which causes her to develop [[Stimulant psychosis|amphetamine psychosis]]. \n\nTyrone is caught in a shootout between black traffickers and the [[Sicilian Mafia]], and is arrested despite his innocence. Harry has to use most of their earned money to post [[bail]]. The local supply of heroin becomes restricted, and they are unable to find any to buy. Eventually, Tyrone hears of a large shipment coming to New York from Florida, but the price is doubled and the minimum high. Harry encourages Marion to engage in prostitution with her psychiatrist, Arnold, for money. This request, along with their mounting withdrawal, strains their relationship.  \n\nSara's increased dosage distorts her sense of reality and begins to hallucinate, in which she is mocked by a crowd from the television show and attacked by her refrigerator. Sara flees her apartment and goes to the casting agency office in Manhattan to confirm when she will be on television. Sara's disturbed state causes her to be admitted to a psychiatric ward, where she fails to respond to medication. She undergoes [[electroconvulsive therapy]] instead. Harry and Tyrone travel to Miami to buy directly from the wholesaler. However, they are forced to stop at a hospital because of Harry's [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] arm. The shocked doctor realizes Harry and Tyrone's situation and they are arrested. \n\nBack in New York, a desperate Marion sells her body to a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]], Big Tim, in exchange for heroin, and receives even more when she subjects herself to a humiliating sex show at his request. Sara's treatment leaves her in a dissociated and vegetative state, to the horror of her friends. Harry's arm is amputated and he is emotionally distraught by the knowledge that Marion will not visit him. Marion returns home from the show and lies on her sofa, clutching her score of heroin and surrounded by her crumpled and discarded clothing designs. Tyrone is taunted by racist prison guards while enduring a combination of manual labor and withdrawal symptoms. Each of the four characters curl into a fetal position. Sara imagines herself as the beautiful winner of the game show, with Harry\u2014married and successful\u2014arriving as a guest. Sara and Harry lovingly embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ellen Burstyn]] as Sara Goldfarb\n* [[Jared Leto]] as Harry Goldfarb\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Marion Silver\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Tyrone C.

The Harry-Tyrone-Marion story is a very traditional heroin story. But putting it side by side with the Sara story, we suddenly say, 'Oh, my God, what is a drug?' The idea that the same inner monologue goes through a person's head when they're trying to quit drugs, as with cigarettes, as when they're trying to not eat food so they can lose 20 pounds, was really fascinating to me.

He writes the most discordant, angry words that tickle the air with some sweet music around it. It's an unbelievable experience to read his books.

Blocks of data entering these systems get a short ''check value'' attached, based on the remainder of a [[Polynomial long division|polynomial division]] of their contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against data corruption. CRCs can be used for [[Error correcting code|error correction]] (see [[Mathematics of cyclic redundancy checks#Bitfilters|bitfilters]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/an-algorithm-for-error-correcting-cyclic/184401662|title=An Algorithm for Error Correcting Cyclic Redundance Checks|website=drdobbs.com|access-date=28 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720165847/http://www.drdobbs.com/an-algorithm-for-error-correcting-cyclic/184401662|archive-date=20 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCRCs are so called because the ''check'' (data verification) value is a ''redundancy'' (it expands the message without adding [[Entropy (information theory)|information]]) and the [[algorithm]] is based on [[Cyclic code|''cyclic'' codes]]. CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary [[Computer hardware|hardware]], easy to analyze mathematically, and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] in transmission channels.  Because the check value has a fixed length, the function that generates it is occasionally used as a [[hash function]].\n\nThe CRC was invented by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] in 1961; the 32-bit CRC function, used in Ethernet and many other standards, is the work of several researchers and was published in 1975.\n\n== Introduction ==\nCRCs are based on the theory of [[cyclic code|cyclic]] [[error-correcting code]]s. The use of [[systematic code|systematic]] cyclic codes, which encode messages by adding a fixed-length check value, for the purpose of error detection in communication networks, was first proposed by [[W.

This is important because burst errors are common transmission errors in many [[communication channel]]s, including magnetic and optical storage devices. Typically an ''n''-bit CRC applied to a data block of arbitrary length will detect any single error burst not longer than ''n'' bits, and the fraction of all longer error bursts that it will detect is {{nowrap|(1 \u2212 2<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>)}}.\n\nSpecification of a CRC code requires definition of a so-called [[generator polynomial]]. This polynomial becomes the [[divisor]] in a [[polynomial long division]], which takes the message as the [[division (mathematics)|dividend]] and in which the [[quotient]] is discarded and the [[remainder]] becomes the result.  The important caveat is that the polynomial [[coefficient]]s are calculated according to the arithmetic of a [[finite field]], so the addition operation can always be performed bitwise-parallel (there is no carry between digits).\n\nIn practice, all commonly used CRCs employ the [[Galois field]] of two elements, [[GF(2)]]. The two elements are usually called 0 and 1, comfortably matching computer architecture.\n\nA CRC is called an ''n''-bit CRC when its check value is ''n'' bits long. For a given ''n'', multiple CRCs are possible, each with a different polynomial. Such a polynomial has highest degree ''n'', which means it has {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} terms. In other words, the polynomial has a length of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}; its encoding requires {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} bits. Note that most polynomial specifications either drop the [[Most significant bit|MSB]] or [[Least significant bit|LSB]], since they are always 1. The CRC and associated polynomial typically have a name of the form CRC-''n''-XXX as in the [[#table|table]] below.\n\nThe simplest error-detection system, the [[parity bit]], is in fact a 1-bit CRC: it uses the generator polynomial&nbsp;{{nowrap|''x'' + 1}} (two terms), and has the name CRC-1.\n\n== Application ==\nA CRC-enabled device calculates a short, fixed-length binary sequence, known as the ''check value'' or ''CRC'', for each block of data to be sent or stored and appends it to the data, forming a ''codeword''.\n\nWhen a codeword is received or read, the device either compares its check value with one freshly calculated from the data block, or equivalently, performs a CRC on the whole codeword and compares the resulting check value with an expected ''residue'' constant.\n\nIf the CRC values do not match, then the block contains a data error.\n\nThe device may take corrective action, such as rereading the block or requesting that it be sent again. Otherwise, the data is assumed to be error-free (though, with some small probability, it may contain undetected errors; this is inherent in the nature of error-checking).<ref name=\"ritter-1986\">{{Cite journal|first=Terry|last=Ritter|title=The Great CRC Mystery|url=http://www.ciphersbyritter.com/ARTS/CRCMYST.HTM|accessdate=21 May 2009|journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]|date=February 1986|volume=11|issue=2|pages=26\u201334, 76\u201383}}</ref>\n\n== Data integrity ==\nCRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels, where they can provide quick and reasonable assurance of the [[data integrity|integrity]] of messages delivered. However, they are not suitable for protecting against intentional alteration of data.\n\nFirstly, as there is no authentication, an attacker can edit a message and recompute the CRC without the substitution being detected. When stored alongside the data, CRCs and cryptographic hash functions by themselves do not protect against ''intentional'' modification of data. Any application that requires protection against such attacks must use cryptographic authentication mechanisms, such as [[message authentication code]]s or [[digital signatures]] (which are commonly based on [[cryptographic hash]] functions).\n\nSecondly, unlike cryptographic hash functions, CRC is an easily reversible function, which makes it unsuitable for use in digital signatures.<ref name=\"stigge-reversecrc\">{{Cite journal|last=Stigge|first=Martin|last2=Pl\u00f6tz|first2=Henryk|last3=M\u00fcller|first3=Wolf|last4=Redlich|first4=Jens-Peter|title=Reversing CRC \u2013 Theory and Practice|date=May 2006|page=17|location=Berlin|publisher=Humboldt University Berlin|url=http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf|accessdate=4 February 2011|quote=The presented methods offer a very easy and efficient way to modify your data so that it will compute to a CRC you want or at least know in advance.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719042902/http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThirdly, CRC is a [[linear function]] with a property that<ref>{{cite web |title=algorithm design - Why is CRC said to be linear? |url=https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/34013 |website=Cryptography Stack Exchange |accessdate=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{crc}(x \\oplus y \\oplus z) = \\operatorname{crc}(x) \\oplus \\operatorname{crc}(y) \\oplus \\operatorname{crc}(z);</math>\n\nas a result, even if the CRC is encrypted with a [[stream cipher]] that uses [[Exclusive or|XOR]] as its combining operation (or [[Block cipher modes of operation|mode]] of [[block cipher]] which effectively turns it into a stream cipher, such as OFB or CFB), both the message and the associated CRC can be manipulated without knowledge of the encryption key; this was one of the well-known design flaws of the [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) protocol.<ref name=\"wep\">{{Cite journal| last1=Cam-Winget | first1=Nancy | last2=Housley | first2=Russ | last3=Wagner | first3=David | last4=Walker | first4=Jesse | title=Security Flaws in 802.11 Data Link Protocols | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=46 | issue=5 | pages=35\u201339 |date = May 2003| doi=10.1145/769800.769823 | url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/wireless-cacm.pdf | citeseerx=10.1.1.14.8775 }}</ref>\n\n== CRC-32 algorithm ==\nThis is the algorithm for the CRC-32 variant of CRC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd905031.aspx|title=[MS-ABS]: 32-Bit CRC Algorithm|author=|date=|website=msdn.microsoft.com}}</ref> The CRCTable is a [[memoization]] of a calculation that would have to be repeated for each byte of the message.\n\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Function'''</span> CRC32\n    <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Input:'''</span>\n       data:  Bytes     <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Array of bytes'''</span>\n    <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Output:'''</span>\n       crc32: UInt32    <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//32-bit unsigned crc-32 value'''</span><br>\n <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Initialize crc-32 to starting value'''</span>\n crc32 &larr; 0xFFFFFFFF<br>\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''for each'''</span> byte <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''in'''</span> data <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''do'''</span>\n    nLookupIndex &larr; (crc32 xor byte) and 0xFF;\n    crc32 &larr; (crc32 shr 8) xor CRCTable[nLookupIndex] <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//CRCTable is anf array of 256 32-bit constants'''</span><br>\n <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Finalize the CRC-32 value by inverting all the bits'''</span>\n crc32 &larr; crc32 xor 0xFFFFFFFF\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''return'''</span> crc32\n\n== Computation ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n{{Main|Computation of cyclic redundancy checks}}\n\nTo compute an ''n''-bit binary CRC, line the bits representing the input in a row, and position the ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-bit pattern representing the CRC's divisor (called a \"[[polynomial]]\") underneath the left-hand end of the row.\n\nIn this example, we shall encode 14 bits of message with a 3-bit CRC, with a polynomial {{nowrap|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x'' + 1}}. The polynomial is written in binary as the coefficients; a 3rd-degree polynomial has 4 coefficients ({{nowrap|1''x''<sup>3</sup> + 0''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1''x'' + 1}}). In this case, the coefficients are 1, 0, 1 and 1.  The result of the calculation is 3 bits long.\n\nStart with the message to be encoded:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100\n</pre>\n\nThis is first padded with zeros corresponding to the bit length ''n'' of the CRC. This is done so that the resulting code word is in [[systematic code|systematic]] form. Here is the first calculation for computing a 3-bit CRC:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 000 <--- input right padded by 3 bits\n1011               <--- divisor (4 bits) = x\u00b3 + x + 1\n------------------\n01100011101100 000 <--- result\n</pre>\n\nThe algorithm acts on the bits directly above the divisor in each step.  The result for that iteration is the bitwise XOR of the polynomial divisor with the bits above it.  The bits not above the divisor are simply copied directly below for that step.  The divisor is then shifted one bit to the right, and the process is repeated until the divisor reaches the right-hand end of the input row. Here is the entire calculation:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 000 <--- input right padded by 3 bits\n1011               <--- divisor\n01100011101100 000 <--- result (note the first four bits are the XOR with the divisor beneath, the rest of the bits are unchanged)\n 1011              <--- divisor ...\n00111011101100 000\n  1011\n00010111101100 000\n   1011\n00000001101100 000 <--- note that the divisor moves over to align with the next 1 in the dividend (since quotient for that step was zero)\n       1011             (in other words, it doesn't necessarily move one bit per iteration)\n00000000110100 000\n        1011\n00000000011000 000\n         1011\n00000000001110 000\n          1011\n00000000000101 000\n           101 1\n-----------------\n00000000000000 100 <--- remainder (3 bits).

These ''n'' bits are the remainder of the division step, and will also be the value of the CRC function (unless the chosen CRC specification calls for some postprocessing).\n\nThe validity of a received message can easily be verified by performing the above calculation again, this time with the check value added instead of zeroes. The remainder should equal zero if there are no detectable errors.\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 100 <--- input with check value\n1011               <--- divisor\n01100011101100 100 <--- result\n 1011              <--- divisor ...\n00111011101100 100\n\n......\n\n00000000001110 100\n          1011\n00000000000101 100\n           101 1\n------------------\n00000000000000 000 <--- remainder\n</pre>\n\nThe following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code outlines a function which will return the initial CRC remainder for a chosen input and polynomial, with either 1 or 0 as the initial padding.

In this analysis, the digits of the bit strings are taken as the coefficients of a polynomial in some variable ''x''\u2014coefficients that are elements of the finite field [[GF(2)]], instead of more familiar numbers. The set of binary polynomials is a mathematical [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].\n\n=== Designing polynomials ===\nThe selection of the generator polynomial is the most important part of implementing the CRC algorithm. The polynomial must be chosen to maximize the error-detecting capabilities while minimizing overall collision probabilities.\n\nThe most important attribute of the polynomial is its length (largest degree(exponent) +1 of any one term in the polynomial), because of its direct influence on the length of the computed check value.\n\nThe most commonly used polynomial lengths are:\n*9 bits (CRC-8)\n*17 bits (CRC-16)\n*33 bits (CRC-32)\n*65 bits (CRC-64)\n\nA CRC is called an ''n''-bit CRC when its check value is ''n''-bits. For a given ''n'', multiple CRCs are possible, each with a different polynomial. Such a polynomial has highest degree ''n'', and hence {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} terms (the polynomial has a length of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}). The remainder has length ''n''. The CRC has a name of the form CRC-''n''-XXX.\n\nThe design of the CRC polynomial depends on the maximum total length of the block to be protected (data + CRC bits), the desired error protection features, and the type of resources for implementing the CRC, as well as the desired performance. A common misconception is that the \"best\" CRC polynomials are derived from either [[irreducible polynomial]]s or irreducible polynomials times the factor&nbsp;{{nowrap|1 + ''x''}}, which adds to the code the ability to detect all errors affecting an odd number of bits.<ref name=\"williams93\" /> In reality, all the factors described above should enter into the selection of the polynomial and may lead to a reducible polynomial. However, choosing a reducible polynomial will result in a certain proportion of missed errors, due to the quotient ring having [[zero divisor]]s.\n\nThe advantage of choosing a [[Primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive polynomial]] as the generator for a CRC code is that the resulting code has maximal total block length in the sense that all 1-bit errors within that block length have different remainders (also called [[Syndrome decoding|syndromes]]) and therefore, since the remainder is a linear function of the block, the code can detect all 2-bit errors within that block length. If <math>r</math> is the degree of the primitive generator polynomial, then the maximal total block length is <math>2 ^ {r} - 1 </math>, and the associated code is able to detect any single-bit or double-bit errors.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Press | first1=WH | last2=Teukolsky | first2=SA | last3=Vetterling | first3=WT | last4=Flannery | first4=BP | year=2007 | title=Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing | edition=3rd | publisher=Cambridge University Press |  location=New York | isbn=978-0-521-88068-8 | chapter=Section 22.4 Cyclic Redundancy and Other Checksums | chapter-url=http://apps.nrbook.com/empanel/index.html#pg=1168}}</ref> We can improve this situation. If we use the generator polynomial <math>g(x) = p(x)(1 + x)</math>, where <math>p(x)</math> is a primitive polynomial of degree <math>r - 1</math>, then the maximal total block length is <math>2^{r - 1} - 1</math>, and the code is able to detect single, double, triple and any odd number of errors.\n\nA polynomial <math>g(x)</math> that admits other factorizations may be chosen then so as to balance the maximal total blocklength with a desired error detection power. The [[BCH code]]s are a powerful class of such polynomials. They subsume the two examples above. Regardless of the reducibility properties of a generator polynomial of degree&nbsp;''r'', if it includes the \"+1\" term, the code will be able to detect error patterns that are confined to a window of ''r'' contiguous bits. These patterns are called \"error bursts\".\n\n== Specification ==\nThe concept of the CRC as an error-detecting code gets complicated when an implementer or standards committee uses it to design a practical system. Here are some of the complications:\n*Sometimes an implementation '''prefixes a fixed bit pattern''' to the bitstream to be checked. This is useful when clocking errors might insert 0-bits in front of a message, an alteration that would otherwise leave the check value unchanged.\n*Usually, but not always, an implementation '''appends ''n'' 0-bits''' (''n'' being the size of the CRC) to the bitstream to be checked before the polynomial division occurs. Such appending is explicitly demonstrated in the [[Computation of cyclic redundancy checks|Computation of CRC]] article. This has the convenience that the remainder of the original bitstream with the check value appended is exactly zero, so the CRC can be checked simply by performing the polynomial division on the received bitstream and comparing the remainder with zero. Due to the associative and commutative properties of the exclusive-or operation, practical table driven implementations can obtain a result numerically equivalent to zero-appending without explicitly appending any zeroes, by using an equivalent,<ref name=\"williams93\" /> faster algorithm that combines the message bitstream with the stream being shifted out of the CRC register.\n*Sometimes an implementation '''exclusive-ORs a fixed bit pattern''' into the remainder of the polynomial division.\n*'''Bit order:''' Some schemes view the low-order bit of each byte as \"first\", which then during polynomial division means \"leftmost\", which is contrary to our customary understanding of \"low-order\". This convention makes sense when [[serial port|serial-port]] transmissions are CRC-checked in hardware, because some widespread serial-port transmission conventions transmit bytes least-significant bit first.\n*'''[[Byte order]]''': With multi-byte CRCs, there can be confusion over whether the byte transmitted first (or stored in the lowest-addressed byte of memory) is the least-significant byte (LSB) or the most-significant byte (MSB). For example, some 16-bit CRC schemes swap the bytes of the check value.\n*'''Omission of the high-order bit''' of the divisor polynomial: Since the high-order bit is always 1, and since an ''n''-bit CRC must be defined by an ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-bit divisor which [[Arithmetic overflow|overflows]] an ''n''-bit [[processor register|register]], some writers assume that it is unnecessary to mention the divisor's high-order bit.\n*'''Omission of the low-order bit''' of the divisor polynomial: Since the low-order bit is always 1, authors such as Philip Koopman represent polynomials with their high-order bit intact, but without the low-order bit (the <math>x^0</math> or 1 term).  This convention encodes the polynomial complete with its degree in one integer.\n\nThese complications mean that there are three common ways to express a polynomial as an integer: the first two, which are mirror images in binary, are the constants found in code; the third is the number found in Koopman's papers.  ''In each case, one term is omitted.'' So the polynomial <math>x^4 + x + 1</math> may be transcribed as:\n*0x3 = 0b0011, representing <math>x^4 + (0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1 + 1x^0)</math> (MSB-first code)\n*0xC = 0b1100, representing <math>(1x^0 + 1x^1 + 0x^2 + 0x^3) + x^4</math> (LSB-first code)\n*0x9 = 0b1001, representing <math>(1x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1) + x^0</math> (Koopman notation)\nIn the table below they are shown as:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples of CRC representations\n|-\n!

correction|error-detecting code]] commonly used in digital [[Telecommunications network|networks]] and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data.  Blocks of data entering these systems get a short ''check value'' attached, based on the remainder of a [[Polynomial long division|polynomial division]] of their contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against data corruption. CRCs can be used for [[Error correcting code|error correction]] (see [[Mathematics of cyclic redundancy checks#Bitfilters|bitfilters]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/an-algorithm-for-error-correcting-cyclic/184401662|title=An Algorithm for Error Correcting Cyclic Redundance Checks|website=drdobbs.com|access-date=28 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720165847/http://www.drdobbs.com/an-algorithm-for-error-correcting-cyclic/184401662|archive-date=20 July 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCRCs are so called because the ''check'' (data verification) value is a ''redundancy'' (it expands the message without adding [[Entropy (information theory)|information]]) and the [[algorithm]] is based on [[Cyclic code|''cyclic'' codes]]. CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary [[Computer hardware|hardware]], easy to analyze mathematically, and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] in transmission channels.  Because the check value has a fixed length, the [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that generates it is occasionally used as a [[hash function]].\n\nThe CRC was invented by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] in 1961; the 32-bit CRC function, used in Ethernet and many other standards, is the work of several researchers and was published in 1975.\n\n== Introduction ==\nCRCs are based on the theory of [[cyclic code|cyclic]] [[error-correcting code]]s. The use of [[systematic code|systematic]] cyclic codes, which encode messages by adding a fixed-length check value, for the purpose of error detection in communication networks, was first proposed by [[W. Wesley Peterson]] in 1961.<ref name=\"PetersonBrown1961\">{{Cite journal\n|last = Peterson |first=W. W. |last2 =Brown |first2=D. T.\n|date=January 1961\n| title = Cyclic Codes for Error Detection\n| journal = Proceedings of the IRE\n| doi = 10.1109/JRPROC.1961.287814\n| volume = 49\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 228\u2013235\n}}</ref>\nCyclic codes are not only simple to implement but have the benefit of being particularly well suited for the detection of [[burst error]]s: contiguous sequences of erroneous data symbols in messages. This is important because burst errors are common transmission errors in many [[communication channel]]s, including magnetic and optical storage devices. Typically an ''n''-bit CRC applied to a data block of arbitrary length will detect any single error burst not longer than ''n'' bits, and the fraction of all longer error bursts that it will detect is {{nowrap|(1 \u2212 2<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>)}}.\n\nSpecification of a CRC code requires definition of a so-called [[generator polynomial]]. This polynomial becomes the [[divisor]] in a [[polynomial long division]], which takes the message as the [[division (mathematics)|dividend]] and in which the [[quotient]] is discarded and the [[remainder]] becomes the result.  The important caveat is that the polynomial [[coefficient]]s are calculated according to the arithmetic of a [[finite field]], so the addition operation can always be performed bitwise-parallel (there is no carry between digits).\n\nIn practice, all commonly used CRCs employ the [[Galois field]] of two elements, [[GF(2)]]. The two elements are usually called 0 and 1, comfortably matching computer architecture.\n\nA CRC is called an ''n''-bit CRC when its check value is ''n'' bits long. For a given ''n'', multiple CRCs are possible, each with a different polynomial. Such a polynomial has highest degree ''n'', which means it has {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} terms. In other words, the polynomial has a length of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}; its encoding requires {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} bits. Note that most polynomial specifications either drop the [[Most significant bit|MSB]] or [[Least significant bit|LSB]], since they are always 1. The CRC and associated polynomial typically have a name of the form CRC-''n''-XXX as in the [[#table|table]] below.\n\nThe simplest error-detection system, the [[parity bit]], is in fact a 1-bit CRC: it uses the generator polynomial&nbsp;{{nowrap|''x'' + 1}} (two terms), and has the name CRC-1.\n\n== Application ==\nA CRC-enabled device calculates a short, fixed-length binary sequence, known as the ''check value'' or ''CRC'', for each block of data to be sent or stored and appends it to the data, forming a ''codeword''.\n\nWhen a codeword is received or read, the device either compares its check value with one freshly calculated from the data block, or equivalently, performs a CRC on the whole codeword and compares the resulting check value with an expected ''residue'' constant.\n\nIf the CRC values do not match, then the block contains a data error.\n\nThe device may take corrective action, such as rereading the block or requesting that it be sent again. Otherwise, the data is assumed to be error-free (though, with some small probability, it may contain undetected errors; this is inherent in the nature of error-checking).<ref name=\"ritter-1986\">{{Cite journal|first=Terry|last=Ritter|title=The Great CRC Mystery|url=http://www.ciphersbyritter.com/ARTS/CRCMYST.HTM|accessdate=21 May 2009|journal=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]|date=February 1986|volume=11|issue=2|pages=26\u201334, 76\u201383}}</ref>\n\n== Data integrity ==\nCRCs are specifically designed to protect against common types of errors on communication channels, where they can provide quick and reasonable assurance of the [[data integrity|integrity]] of messages delivered. However, they are not suitable for protecting against intentional alteration of data.\n\nFirstly, as there is no authentication, an attacker can edit a message and recompute the CRC without the substitution being detected. When stored alongside the data, CRCs and cryptographic hash functions by themselves do not protect against ''intentional'' modification of data. Any application that requires protection against such attacks must use cryptographic authentication mechanisms, such as [[message authentication code]]s or [[digital signatures]] (which are commonly based on [[cryptographic hash]] functions).\n\nSecondly, unlike cryptographic hash functions, CRC is an easily reversible function, which makes it unsuitable for use in digital signatures.<ref name=\"stigge-reversecrc\">{{Cite journal|last=Stigge|first=Martin|last2=Pl\u00f6tz|first2=Henryk|last3=M\u00fcller|first3=Wolf|last4=Redlich|first4=Jens-Peter|title=Reversing CRC \u2013 Theory and Practice|date=May 2006|page=17|location=Berlin|publisher=Humboldt University Berlin|url=http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf|accessdate=4 February 2011|quote=The presented methods offer a very easy and efficient way to modify your data so that it will compute to a CRC you want or at least know in advance.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719042902/http://sar.informatik.hu-berlin.de/research/publications/SAR-PR-2006-05/SAR-PR-2006-05_.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThirdly, CRC is a [[linear function]] with a property that<ref>{{cite web |title=algorithm design - Why is CRC said to be linear? |url=https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/34013 |website=Cryptography Stack Exchange |accessdate=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{crc}(x \\oplus y \\oplus z) = \\operatorname{crc}(x) \\oplus \\operatorname{crc}(y) \\oplus \\operatorname{crc}(z);</math>\n\nas a result, even if the CRC is encrypted with a [[stream cipher]] that uses [[Exclusive or|XOR]] as its combining operation (or [[Block cipher modes of operation|mode]] of [[block cipher]] which effectively turns it into a stream cipher, such as OFB or CFB), both the message and the associated CRC can be manipulated without knowledge of the encryption key; this was one of the well-known design flaws of the [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) protocol.<ref name=\"wep\">{{Cite journal| last1=Cam-Winget | first1=Nancy | last2=Housley | first2=Russ | last3=Wagner | first3=David | last4=Walker | first4=Jesse | title=Security Flaws in 802.11 Data Link Protocols | journal=Communications of the ACM | volume=46 | issue=5 | pages=35\u201339 |date = May 2003| doi=10.1145/769800.769823 | url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/wireless-cacm.pdf | citeseerx=10.1.1.14.8775 }}</ref>\n\n== CRC-32 algorithm ==\nThis is the algorithm for the CRC-32 variant of CRC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd905031.aspx|title=[MS-ABS]: 32-Bit CRC Algorithm|author=|date=|website=msdn.microsoft.com}}</ref> The CRCTable is a [[memoization]] of a calculation that would have to be repeated for each byte of the message.\n\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Function'''</span> CRC32\n    <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Input:'''</span>\n       data:  Bytes     <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Array of bytes'''</span>\n    <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''Output:'''</span>\n       crc32: UInt32    <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//32-bit unsigned crc-32 value'''</span><br>\n <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Initialize crc-32 to starting value'''</span>\n crc32 &larr; 0xFFFFFFFF<br>\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''for each'''</span> byte <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''in'''</span> data <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''do'''</span>\n    nLookupIndex &larr; (crc32 xor byte) and 0xFF;\n    crc32 &larr; (crc32 shr 8) xor CRCTable[nLookupIndex] <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//CRCTable is an array of 256 32-bit constants'''</span><br>\n <span style=\"color:green;\">'''//Finalize the CRC-32 value by inverting all the bits'''</span>\n crc32 &larr; crc32 xor 0xFFFFFFFF\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">'''return'''</span> crc32\n\n== Computation ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n{{Main|Computation of cyclic redundancy checks}}\n\nTo compute an ''n''-bit binary CRC, line the bits representing the input in a row, and position the ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-bit pattern representing the CRC's divisor (called a \"[[polynomial]]\") underneath the left-hand end of the row.\n\nIn this example, we shall encode 14 bits of message with a 3-bit CRC, with a polynomial {{nowrap|''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x'' + 1}}. The polynomial is written in binary as the coefficients; a 3rd-degree polynomial has 4 coefficients ({{nowrap|1''x''<sup>3</sup> + 0''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1''x'' + 1}}). In this case, the coefficients are 1, 0, 1 and 1.  The result of the calculation is 3 bits long.\n\nStart with the message to be encoded:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100\n</pre>\n\nThis is first padded with zeros corresponding to the bit length ''n'' of the CRC. This is done so that the resulting code word is in [[systematic code|systematic]] form. Here is the first calculation for computing a 3-bit CRC:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 000 <--- input right padded by 3 bits\n1011               <--- divisor (4 bits) = x\u00b3 + x + 1\n------------------\n01100011101100 000 <--- result\n</pre>\n\nThe algorithm acts on the bits directly above the divisor in each step.  The result for that iteration is the bitwise XOR of the polynomial divisor with the bits above it.  The bits not above the divisor are simply copied directly below for that step.  The divisor is then shifted one bit to the right, and the process is repeated until the divisor reaches the right-hand end of the input row. Here is the entire calculation:\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 000 <--- input right padded by 3 bits\n1011               <--- divisor\n01100011101100 000 <--- result (note the first four bits are the XOR with the divisor beneath, the rest of the bits are unchanged)\n 1011              <--- divisor ...\n00111011101100 000\n  1011\n00010111101100 000\n   1011\n00000001101100 000 <--- note that the divisor moves over to align with the next 1 in the dividend (since quotient for that step was zero)\n       1011             (in other words, it doesn't necessarily move one bit per iteration)\n00000000110100 000\n        1011\n00000000011000 000\n         1011\n00000000001110 000\n          1011\n00000000000101 000\n           101 1\n-----------------\n00000000000000 100 <--- remainder (3 bits).

These ''n'' bits are the remainder of the division step, and will also be the value of the CRC function (unless the chosen CRC specification calls for some postprocessing).\n\nThe validity of a received message can easily be verified by performing the above calculation again, this time with the check value added instead of zeroes. The remainder should equal zero if there are no detectable errors.\n\n<pre>\n11010011101100 100 <--- input with check value\n1011               <--- divisor\n01100011101100 100 <--- result\n 1011              <--- divisor ...\n00111011101100 100\n\n......\n\n00000000001110 100\n          1011\n00000000000101 100\n           101 1\n------------------\n00000000000000 000 <--- remainder\n</pre>\n\nThe following [[Python (programming language)|Python]] code outlines a function which will return the initial CRC remainder for a chosen input and polynomial, with either 1 or 0 as the initial padding.

In this analysis, the digits of the bit strings are taken as the coefficients of a polynomial in some variable ''x''\u2014coefficients that are elements of the finite field [[GF(2)]], instead of more familiar numbers. The set of binary polynomials is a mathematical [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].\n\n=== Designing polynomials ===\nThe selection of the generator polynomial is the most important part of implementing the CRC algorithm. The polynomial must be chosen to maximize the error-detecting capabilities while minimizing overall collision probabilities.\n\nThe most important attribute of the polynomial is its length (largest degree(exponent) +1 of any one term in the polynomial), because of its direct influence on the length of the computed check value.\n\nThe most commonly used polynomial lengths are:\n*9 bits (CRC-8)\n*17 bits (CRC-16)\n*33 bits (CRC-32)\n*65 bits (CRC-64)\n\nA CRC is called an ''n''-bit CRC when its check value is ''n''-bits. For a given ''n'', multiple CRCs are possible, each with a different polynomial. Such a polynomial has highest degree ''n'', and hence {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} terms (the polynomial has a length of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}). The remainder has length ''n''. The CRC has a name of the form CRC-''n''-XXX.\n\nThe design of the CRC polynomial depends on the maximum total length of the block to be protected (data + CRC bits), the desired error protection features, and the type of resources for implementing the CRC, as well as the desired performance. A common misconception is that the \"best\" CRC polynomials are derived from either [[irreducible polynomial]]s or irreducible polynomials times the factor&nbsp;{{nowrap|1 + ''x''}}, which adds to the code the ability to detect all errors affecting an odd number of bits.<ref name=\"williams93\" /> In reality, all the factors described above should enter into the selection of the polynomial and may lead to a reducible polynomial. However, choosing a reducible polynomial will result in a certain proportion of missed errors, due to the quotient ring having [[zero divisor]]s.\n\nThe advantage of choosing a [[Primitive polynomial (field theory)|primitive polynomial]] as the generator for a CRC code is that the resulting code has maximal total block length in the sense that all 1-bit errors within that block length have different remainders (also called [[Syndrome decoding|syndromes]]) and therefore, since the remainder is a linear function of the block, the code can detect all 2-bit errors within that block length. If <math>r</math> is the degree of the primitive generator polynomial, then the maximal total block length is <math>2 ^ {r} - 1 </math>, and the associated code is able to detect any single-bit or double-bit errors.<ref>{{Cite book | last1=Press | first1=WH | last2=Teukolsky | first2=SA | last3=Vetterling | first3=WT | last4=Flannery | first4=BP | year=2007 | title=Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing | edition=3rd | publisher=Cambridge University Press |  location=New York | isbn=978-0-521-88068-8 | chapter=Section 22.4 Cyclic Redundancy and Other Checksums | chapter-url=http://apps.nrbook.com/empanel/index.html#pg=1168}}</ref> We can improve this situation. If we use the generator polynomial <math>g(x) = p(x)(1 + x)</math>, where <math>p(x)</math> is a primitive polynomial of degree <math>r - 1</math>, then the maximal total block length is <math>2^{r - 1} - 1</math>, and the code is able to detect single, double, triple and any odd number of errors.\n\nA polynomial <math>g(x)</math> that admits other factorizations may be chosen then so as to balance the maximal total blocklength with a desired error detection power. The [[BCH code]]s are a powerful class of such polynomials. They subsume the two examples above. Regardless of the reducibility properties of a generator polynomial of degree&nbsp;''r'', if it includes the \"+1\" term, the code will be able to detect error patterns that are confined to a window of ''r'' contiguous bits. These patterns are called \"error bursts\".\n\n== Specification ==\nThe concept of the CRC as an error-detecting code gets complicated when an implementer or standards committee uses it to design a practical system. Here are some of the complications:\n*Sometimes an implementation '''prefixes a fixed bit pattern''' to the bitstream to be checked. This is useful when clocking errors might insert 0-bits in front of a message, an alteration that would otherwise leave the check value unchanged.\n*Usually, but not always, an implementation '''appends ''n'' 0-bits''' (''n'' being the size of the CRC) to the bitstream to be checked before the polynomial division occurs. Such appending is explicitly demonstrated in the [[Computation of cyclic redundancy checks|Computation of CRC]] article. This has the convenience that the remainder of the original bitstream with the check value appended is exactly zero, so the CRC can be checked simply by performing the polynomial division on the received bitstream and comparing the remainder with zero. Due to the associative and commutative properties of the exclusive-or operation, practical table driven implementations can obtain a result numerically equivalent to zero-appending without explicitly appending any zeroes, by using an equivalent,<ref name=\"williams93\" /> faster algorithm that combines the message bitstream with the stream being shifted out of the CRC register.\n*Sometimes an implementation '''exclusive-ORs a fixed bit pattern''' into the remainder of the polynomial division.\n*'''Bit order:''' Some schemes view the low-order bit of each byte as \"first\", which then during polynomial division means \"leftmost\", which is contrary to our customary understanding of \"low-order\". This convention makes sense when [[serial port|serial-port]] transmissions are CRC-checked in hardware, because some widespread serial-port transmission conventions transmit bytes least-significant bit first.\n*'''[[Byte order]]''': With multi-byte CRCs, there can be confusion over whether the byte transmitted first (or stored in the lowest-addressed byte of memory) is the least-significant byte (LSB) or the most-significant byte (MSB). For example, some 16-bit CRC schemes swap the bytes of the check value.\n*'''Omission of the high-order bit''' of the divisor polynomial: Since the high-order bit is always 1, and since an ''n''-bit CRC must be defined by an ({{nowrap|''n'' + 1}})-bit divisor which [[Arithmetic overflow|overflows]] an ''n''-bit [[processor register|register]], some writers assume that it is unnecessary to mention the divisor's high-order bit.\n*'''Omission of the low-order bit''' of the divisor polynomial: Since the low-order bit is always 1, authors such as Philip Koopman represent polynomials with their high-order bit intact, but without the low-order bit (the <math>x^0</math> or 1 term).  This convention encodes the polynomial complete with its degree in one integer.\n\nThese complications mean that there are three common ways to express a polynomial as an integer: the first two, which are mirror images in binary, are the constants found in code; the third is the number found in Koopman's papers.  ''In each case, one term is omitted.'' So the polynomial <math>x^4 + x + 1</math> may be transcribed as:\n*0x3 = 0b0011, representing <math>x^4 + (0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1 + 1x^0)</math> (MSB-first code)\n*0xC = 0b1100, representing <math>(1x^0 + 1x^1 + 0x^2 + 0x^3) + x^4</math> (LSB-first code)\n*0x9 = 0b1001, representing <math>(1x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 1x^1) + x^0</math> (Koopman notation)\nIn the table below they are shown as:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples of CRC representations\n|-\n!

It was also to consist of the [[Union Jack]] throughout, as a symbol of royal allegiance. The second colour was to be the colour of the facings (uniform linings) of each Regiment, with the Union flag in the upper canton. When Regiments had red or white facings, this was to be replaced by the red cross of [[St George]] on a white background. Regiments with \"Royal\" designation or named after the members of the royal family, regardless of facings, used blue regimental colours (plus the optional Union Jack canton), Irish regiments green facings.\n\nA second royal warrant was issued in 1747, requiring the Regimental number to be displayed on the colours. As many regiments at that time were known by the name of the Regimental Colonel instead of a number, this requirement was often ignored. On 1 July 1751 a third royal warrant was issued stating ''\"No Colonel is to put his Arms, Crest, Device, or Livery on any part of the Appointments of the Regiment under his Command.\"'' Company colours were phased out altogether, with the battalion colours of the regiment using the designs issued being the only sanctioned ones used.\n\nOver time, these colours have evolved to include the battle honours s awarded to each Regiment, though these have also been limited.\n\n[[File:DWR Regimental Colours RLH.jpg|thumb|600px|Colours of the [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]]]]\nOnly one British Regiment carries more than two colours on parade.

Upper right: Completely exposed developed photo. Lower left: A photo as the opacifiers clear - the photo is already fully developed beneath. Lower right: An undeveloped photo, with chemicals still in the pouch at the bottom.]]\n'''Instant film''' is a type of [[photographic film]] introduced by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] to be used in an [[instant camera]] (and, with accessory hardware, many other professional film cameras). The film contains the chemicals needed for developing and fixing the [[photograph]], and the instant camera exposes and initiates the [[film developing|developing]] process after a photo has been taken.\n\nIn earlier Polaroid instant cameras the film is pulled through rollers which breaks open a pod containing a [[reagent]] that is spread between the exposed [[Negative (photography)|negative]] and receiving [[Positive (photography)|positive sheet]]. This film sandwich develops for some time after which the positive sheet is peeled away from the negative to reveal the developed photo. In 1972, Polaroid introduced ''integral film'', which incorporated timing and receiving layers to automatically develop and fix the photo without any intervention from the photographer.\n\nInstant film is available in sizes from {{convert|24|x|36|mm|in|abbr=on}} (similar to [[135 film]]) up to {{convert|50.8|x|61|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} size, with the most popular film sizes for consumer snapshots being approximately {{convert|83|x|108|mm|in|abbr=on}} (the image itself is smaller as it is surrounded by a border).  Early instant film was distributed on rolls, but later and current films are supplied in packs of 8 or 10 sheets, and single sheet films for use in [[large format]] cameras with a compatible [[Film holder|back]].\n\nThough the quality of integral instant film is not as high as conventional film, peel apart black and white film, and to a lesser extent color film approached the quality of traditional film types. Instant film was used where it was undesirable to have to wait for a roll of conventional film to be finished and processed, e.g., documenting evidence in law enforcement, in health care and scientific applications, and producing photographs for [[passport]]s and other identity documents, or simply for snapshots to be seen immediately. Some photographers use instant film for test shots, to see how a subject or setup looks before using conventional film for the final exposure. Instant film is also used by artists to achieve effects that are impossible to accomplish with traditional photography, by manipulating the emulsion during the developing process, or separating the image emulsion from the film base. Instant film has been supplanted for most purposes by [[digital photography]], which allows the result to be viewed immediately on a display screen or [[digital printing|printed]] with [[dye sublimation]], [[inkjet printer|inkjet]], or [[laser printer|laser]] home or professional printers.\n\nInstant film is notable for having had a wider range of [[film speed]]s available than other negative films of the same era, having been produced in ISO 4 to ISO 20,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Current instant film formats typically have an ISO between 100 and 1000.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nTwo companies manufacture instant film: [[Fujifilm]] ([[Instax]] integral film for its Instax cameras), and [[Polaroid Originals]] (previously named The Impossible Project) for older Polaroid cameras (600, SX-70, Spectra and 8\u00d710) and its I-Type cameras.\n\n==How it works==\nInstant positive film (which produced a print) uses diffusion transfer to move the dyes from the negative to the positive via a reagent. The process varies according to the film type.\n\n===Roll/pack film===\nIn 1947 [[Edwin H. Land]] introduced the Polaroid-Land process.<ref name=RitzenthalerMunoffLong>[[Ritzenthaler, Mary Lynn]], Gerald J. Munoff and Margery S. Long.

The negative develops quickly, after which some of the unexposed [[silver halide]] grains (and the latent image it contains) are solubilized by the reagent and transferred by diffusion from the negative to the positive. After a minute, depending on film type and ambient temperature, the negative is peeled away to reveal the picture which was transferred to the positive receiving sheet.<ref name=\"polaroids.theskeltons.org\">{{cite web |author=Jim Skelton |url=http://polaroids.theskeltons.org/film3.htm |title=Jim's Polaroid Collection: How film works |publisher=Polaroids.theskeltons.org |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085204/http://polaroids.theskeltons.org/film3.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> True black and white films were released in 1950 after problems with chemistry stabilization were overcome.<ref name=\"ACS\"/>With that being said, Photographers and enthusiasts still practice with this limited, special and discontinued film, with both older Polaroid stocks or Fujifilm FP-100C or FP-3000B varieties.

The negative consists of three emulsion layers sensitive to the primary colors ([[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]) each with a layer of developing dye beneath it of the complementary color ([[cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]]). Once light exposed the negative, the reagent is spread between the negative and positive and the developing dye layer migrates to the positive surface where it forms the photo. Emulsion layers exposed to their respective color block the complementary dye below it, reproducing the original color. For example, a photo of a blue sky would expose the blue emulsion, blocking all the yellow dye beneath it and allowing the magenta and cyan dye layers to migrate to the positive to form blue.<ref name=\"polaroids.theskeltons.org\"/>\n\n===Integral film===\nThis process is similar to subtractive color instant film with added timing and receiving layers. Land's solution was to incorporate an opacifier, which would darken when ejected from the camera, and then become clear to reveal the photograph.<ref name=\"ACS\">{{cite web|title=Edwin Land and Polaroid Photography|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/land-instant-photography.html#introduction_of_instant_photography|website=ACS.org|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=18 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118225238/https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/land-instant-photography.html#introduction_of_instant_photography|archivedate=18 January 2017}}</ref> The film itself integrates all the layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo into a plastic envelope and frame commonly associated with a Polaroid photo.\n\n===Additive color film===\nAdditive film (such as [[Polavision]] and Polachrome slide film) uses a color mask of microscopically thin transparent red, green, and blue lines (3000 lines per inch) and a black and white emulsion layer to reproduce color images in transparency film. The resulting dye developers (unexposed emulsion) block the colors not needed and project the color or combination of colors which form in the resulting image. Since the lines are so close to each other, the human eye easily blended the primary colors together to form the correct color, much like an LCD display or television. For instance, a photo of a yellow flower would expose the emulsion beneath the red and green masks and not the blue mask. The developing process removed the exposed emulsion (under the red and green masks) and diffused the unexposed dye developer (under the blue mask) to its receiving layer, blocking light from coming through. This resulted in the projected light shining through the red and green masks but not the blue mask, creating the color yellow. Because of the film density, film speeds were necessarily slow. High precision was required for the production of this film.\n\n==Film brands==\n\n===Polaroid===\n[[File:Polaroid 600 sunflower.jpg|thumb|A sample shot of Polaroid Type 600, ISO 640, color film]]\n[[Polaroid Corporation]] invented and produced the widest range of instant film. Roll film was distributed in two separate negative and positive rolls and developed inside the camera. It was introduced in 1948 and was manufactured until 1992. Sheet film was introduced in 1958 for 4x5\" film holder #500. Each sheet contains a reagent pod, negative and receiving positive, and was loaded separately and developed outside the film holder. In 1973 Polaroid introduced 8x10\" Instant film. Pack film was distributed in a film pack which contained both negative and positive sheets and was developed outside the camera. It was introduced in 1963. Integral film is also distributed in a film pack, but each film envelope contains all the chemical layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo. It was introduced in 1972.\n\n[[Polavision]] was an instant motion picture film. Polavision was introduced by Polaroid in 1978, with an image format similar to [[Super 8 mm film]], and based on an additive color process. Polavision required a specific [[movie camera|camera]] and tabletop viewer, and was not a commercial success, but did lead to the development of an instant 35&nbsp;mm color [[Transparency (photography)|slide film]]. Polavision film has been taken off the market. Polachrome was an easy to develop 35&nbsp;mm film, available in color, monochrome and 'blue' formats (the latter intended for making title cards). Each roll of film came with a cartridge containing developing chemicals which were pressed between the film and a developing strip by a hand-cranked machine called the AutoProcessor. The AutoProcessor was very cheap and did not require a darkroom; the results were somewhat variable, the resolution was not as good as conventional film due to the matrix of tiny red, green and blue filters required to make the monochrome emulsion work in color, and the sensitivity was low, even for slide film; in tungsten light, Polachrome CS is rated at ISO 40. It was introduced in 1983.\n\nPolaroid integral film packs usually contain a flat \"Polapulse\" electrical battery, which powers systems in the camera, including exposure and focusing mechanisms, electronic flash, and a film ejection motor. The inclusion of the battery within the film pack ensures that a fresh battery is available with each new pack of film.\n\nPolaroid no longer produces instant film. It has become an organization which licenses its brand name to other manufacturers. An example of this is the Polaroid 300 camera, which is a Polaroid branded Fuji [[Instax]]. Polaroid PIF-300 film is essentially rebranded Fuji Instax mini film.\n\n====Preservation====\nPolaroids have the same storage standards under ISO 18920:2000 as any other photograph.<ref>Albright, G. & Fischer, M. Care of Photographs.

Cold storage (0 degrees Fahrenheit optimum) is not helpful unless RH can be controlled and cold storage RH is generally drier than required. RH below 30% will create an environment that is too dry and may cause the photograph to curl. A [[Polaroid transfer]] removes the emulsion from the plastic backing and residual chemicals, offering an alternate form of preservation.\n\n====End of production====\nIn February 2008, Polaroid (by then under the control of Thomas J. Petters of [[Petters Group Worldwide]]) announced it would cease production of all instant film; the company shut down three factories and laid off 450 workers.<ref>Associated Press February 8, 2008</ref>  Sales of chemical film by all makers have dropped by at least 25% per year since 2000,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} but a new birth of interest around [[Fujifilm]] and, in particular, The [[Polaroid Originals|Impossible Project]] films fulfilled demand in the market.\n\n====Integral film====\n[[Image:Polaroid 667 IMGP1864 WP.jpg|thumb|upright|Polaroid Type 667 ISO 3000]] \n* [[Polaroid SX-70|SX-70]] cameras (integral film, develops automatically, 3.1 \u00d7 3.1&nbsp;inch)\n* 600 cameras (integral film, develops automatically, 3.1 \u00d7 3.1&nbsp;inch)\n* Spectra / Image / 1200 cameras (integral film, develops automatically, 3.6 \u00d7 2.9&nbsp;inch)\n* Captiva/Vision (integral film, for Captiva and Joycam, 4.4 \u00d7 2.5&nbsp;inch, 11.1 \u00d7 6.4&nbsp;cm)\n* i-Zone (integral film, for i-Zone, Tomy Xiao, 1.5 \u00d7 1&nbsp;inch, 3.6&nbsp;cm \u00d7 2.4&nbsp;cm)\n* i-Zone200 (integral film, for i-Zone200 only, 1.5 \u00d7 1&nbsp;inch, 3.6&nbsp;cm \u00d7 2.4&nbsp;cm)\n* Type 330 series AutoFilm (integral film for use Polaroid CB-33 backs, 3\u00bc \u00d7 4\u00bc inch).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n====Packfilm====\n[[File:Polaroid - Pack 100 - Miniportrait - P1330809.JPG|thumb|A photograph on Type 100 film taken with a Polaroid Miniportrait]]\n* Type 100 series packfilm for Land cameras (timed peel-apart development, sometimes called type 660, 10.8 \u00d7 8.3&nbsp;cm; 4.25 \u00d7 3.25&nbsp;inch)\n* Type 550 series packfilm, 4 \u00d7 5&nbsp;inch, for Polaroid 550 film backs.

Kodak's original plan was to create packfilm type instant products. There were many prototypes and test runs of the film with many private demonstrations to their board. Plans changed when Polaroid in 1972 released the integral type film with the introduction of the SX-70 system. Kodak decided to scrap the plans for packfilm release and focus on an integral type process. A few years later Kodak introduced its own instant film products in 1976, which was different from Polaroid's in several ways:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rwhirled.com/landlist/nonland.htm |title=The Land List - Non-Polaroid Instant Cameras |publisher=Rwhirled.com |date=2004-03-06 |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106163339/http://www.rwhirled.com/landlist/nonland.htm |archivedate=2016-01-06 }}</ref>\n\nKodak instant film was exposed from the back without a mirror, the opposite of Polaroid's film which was exposed from the front with a mirror to reverse the image. Kodak used a matte finish on the front, made possible by exposing the film through the back. The negative and empty pod could be removed by peeling it off of the back of the print. Unlike Polaroid's integral film packs, Kodak's did not contain a battery, and used conventional batteries. Kodak\u2019s PR 10 film was found to have light fading stability issues.<ref>Wilhelm, Henry and Carol Brower. The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs: Traditional and Digital Color Prints, Color Negatives, Slides, and Motion Pictures. Grinnell: Preservation Publishing, 1993.</ref>\n\nPolaroid filed suit against Eastman Kodak in April 1976 for the infringement of ten patents held by Edwin Land and others on his development team relating to instant photography. In September 1985, the United States District Court of Massachusetts ruled that seven patents were valid and infringed, two were invalid but infringed, and one was valid but not infringed by Kodak. Kodak appealed but was denied and an injunction prohibiting production of their instant film and cameras was put into effect. Kodak's appeal to the Supreme Court was denied a few months later, and in January 1986, Kodak announced it would no longer be producing their instant line of products. In 1991, Polaroid was awarded $925 million in damages from Kodak.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Lost Instant Camera: Kodak's CHAMP Kodamatic|url=https://www.lomography.com/magazine/140518-the-lost-instant-camera-kodaks-champ-kodamatic|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Lomogrohpy|date=6 January 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409042554/http://www.lomography.com/magazine/140518-the-lost-instant-camera-kodaks-champ-kodamatic|archivedate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Alternative Kodak instant film====\nWhile Kodak instant films have been discontinued, Fuji's instant film available in Japan since the 1980s is very similar to Kodak's. The pictures are the same size, the cartridge is almost the same, with some easy plastic modifications; the Fuji Fotorama series film can be made to fit. It was closest to the Kodak with the ISO at 160, many of the camera's brightness controls can be adjusted to work with the different ISO; However, the FI-10 series was discontinued in the 1990s. The faster ISO 800 instant films will work as well but would require the use of a filter either on the film cartridge or lens.\n\n===Fujifilm===\n{{see also|Instax}}\n[[File:Fujifilm Instant FP.jpg|thumb|left|Fujifilm equivalents of Polaroid films]]\nIn Japan, [[Fujifilm]] introduced their own line of instant photographic products in 1981 starting with the ''Fotorama'' line of cameras. The name Fotorama came from photograph and panorama, as the film was a wide format compared to the square Polaroid SX-70/600 films. These Integral films developed similar to Kodak's with the back layer first. This presented a major problem for Fujifilm because of the ongoing litigation between Kodak and Polaroid. Polaroid also has a separate suit with Fujifilm and their instant film patents in Japan. When Kodak lost, Fujifilm was able to work with Polaroid to allow their cameras and films to remain in the market,<ref>Los Angeles Times July 25th 1986</ref> provided that they have a technology sharing agreement. Polaroid was interested in branching out to magnetic media in the boom of the [[videotape]] era and had acquired a company called MagMedia Ltd. Fujifilm has a long history in [[magnetic media]] dating to the mid-1950s. This led to Polaroid having access to Fujifilm's extensive electronic, video tape and [[floppy disc]] magnetic products. This allowed Fujifilm access to Polaroid's film technology.\n\nBy the mid-1980s Fujifilm introduced the higher ''ISO System 800'' series, followed by the ''ACE'' series in the mid-1990s. Instant ACE is nearly identical to System 800, the only difference is the design of the plastic cartridge in the ACE do not contain the [[Spring (device)|spring]] mechanism (the spring is in the camera). Most of these products were available only in the Japanese market, until the release of ''[[Instax]]'' series of cameras was released in 1998. Fujifilm originally wanted to release the Instax series worldwide including North America and Europe simultaneously,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/31/business/company-news-fuji-photo-may-enter-us-instant-film-market.html |title=Fuji may enter us instant film market |location=EUROPE |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1998-10-31 |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108181651/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/31/business/company-news-fuji-photo-may-enter-us-instant-film-market.html |archivedate=2016-01-08 }}</ref>  but decided to work with Polaroid on the ''mio camera'' based on the Instax mini 10 for the US market; while Canada did get the Instax Wide 100. Another product was Fujifilm's Digital Instax Pivi film for their battery powered portable printer which was made available for those who wanted to print from their mobile phone via infrared, USB and Bluetooth.\n\n[[File:0484 Fuji FP-14 (7159464264).jpg|thumb|right|A Fuji FP-14, designed for use as a passport camera]]\nFujifilm makes pack film for their passport camera systems, and had been available outside Japan since the mid-1980s. No legal issues arose with Fuji's peel apart instant films as Polaroid's patents had expired. While very popular in [[Australia]] as a cheaper alternative to Polaroid,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} it was generally not too well known elsewhere due to Polaroid's dominance in most countries. In 2000, Fuji decided to change the way they manufacture pack film, making the entire pack out of plastic instead of a metal and plastic combination. Fujifilm announced at PMA 2003{{Vague|date=January 2017}} that pack film would be made available to the North American market.\n\nWith the discontinuation of Polaroid instant film in 2008, Fuji started to export more of their instant film products to overseas markets, starting with making an increased variety of pack films available. In November 2008 the Instax Wide format was available in the US with the Instax 200 camera.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujifilmusa.com/press/news/display_news?newsID=879723 |title=Fujifilm brings Instax 200 instant film camera and film to U.S. market |publisher=Fujifilmusa.com |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108181651/http://www.fujifilmusa.com/press/news/display_news?newsID=879723 |archivedate=2016-01-08 }}</ref> Instax mini series of cameras and films became available in the US during the second half of 2009, with the mini 7s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujifilmusa.com/press/news/display_news?newsID=879790 |title=Fujifilm brings stylish INSTAX mini 7S instant camera to US |publisher=Fujifilmusa.com |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108181650/http://www.fujifilmusa.com/press/news/display_news?newsID=879790 |archivedate=2016-01-08 }}</ref> also an updated Instax 210 replaced the Instax 200.

Upper right: Completely exposed developed photo. Lower left: A photo as the opacifiers clear - the photo is already fully developed beneath. Lower right: An undeveloped photo, with chemicals still in the pouch at the bottom.]]\n'''Instant film''' is a type of [[photographic film]] introduced by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] to be used in an [[instant camera]] (and, with accessory hardware, many other professional film cameras). The film contains the chemicals needed for developing and fixing the [[photograph]], and the instant camera exposes and initiates the [[film developing|developing]] process after a photo has been taken.\n\nIn earlier Polaroid instant cameras the film is pulled through rollers which breaks open a pod containing a [[reagent]] that is spread between the exposed [[Negative (photography)|negative]] and receiving [[Positive (photography)|positive sheet]]. This film sandwich develops for some time after which the positive sheet is peeled away from the negative to reveal the developed photo. In 1972, Polaroid introduced ''integral film'', which incorporated timing and receiving layers to automatically develop and fix the photo without any intervention from the photographer.\n\nInstant film is available in sizes from {{convert|24|x|36|mm|in|abbr=on}} (similar to [[135 film]]) up to {{convert|50.8|x|61|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} size, with the most popular film sizes for consumer snapshots being approximately {{convert|83|x|108|mm|in|abbr=on}} (the image itself is smaller as it is surrounded by a border).  Early instant film was distributed on rolls, but later and current films are supplied in packs of 8 or 10 sheets, and single sheet films for use in [[large format]] cameras with a compatible [[Film holder|back]].\n\nThough the quality of integral instant film is not as high as conventional film, peel apart black and white film, and to a lesser extent color film approached the quality of traditional film types. Instant film was used where it was undesirable to have to wait for a roll of conventional film to be finished and processed, e.g., documenting evidence in law enforcement, in health care and scientific applications, and producing photographs for [[passport]]s and other identity documents, or simply for snapshots to be seen immediately. Some photographers use instant film for test shots, to see how a subject or setup looks before using conventional film for the final exposure. Instant film is also used by artists to achieve effects that are impossible to accomplish with traditional photography, by manipulating the emulsion during the developing process, or separating the image emulsion from the film base. Instant film has been supplanted for most purposes by [[digital photography]], which allows the result to be viewed immediately on a display screen or [[digital printing|printed]] with [[dye sublimation]], [[inkjet printer|inkjet]], or [[laser printer|laser]] home or professional printers.\n\nInstant film is notable for having had a wider range of [[film speed]]s available than other negative films of the same era, having been produced in ISO 4 to ISO 20,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Current instant film formats typically have an ISO between 100 and 1000.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nTwo companies manufacture instant film: [[Fujifilm]] ([[Instax]] integral film for its Instax cameras), and [[Polaroid Originals]] (previously named The Impossible Project) for older Polaroid cameras (600, SX-70, Spectra and 8\u00d710) and its I-Type cameras.\n\n==How it works==\nInstant positive film (which produced a print) uses diffusion transfer to move the dyes from the negative to the positive via a reagent. The process varies according to the film type.\n\n===Roll/pack film===\nIn 1947 [[Edwin H. Land]] introduced the Polaroid-Land process.<ref name=RitzenthalerMunoffLong>[[Ritzenthaler, Mary Lynn]], Gerald J. Munoff and Margery S. Long.

Chicago: Society of American Archivists, 1984.</ref> The first instant films produced [[sepia tone]] photos.<ref name=\"ACS\" /> A negative sheet is exposed inside the camera, then lined up with a positive sheet and squeezed through a set of rollers which spread a reagent between the two layers, creating a developing film \"sandwich\". The negative develops quickly, after which some of the unexposed [[silver halide]] grains (and the latent image it contains) are solubilized by the reagent and transferred by diffusion from the negative to the positive. After a minute, depending on film type and ambient temperature, the negative is peeled away to reveal the picture which was transferred to the positive receiving sheet.<ref name=\"polaroids.theskeltons.org\">{{cite web |author=Jim Skelton |url=http://polaroids.theskeltons.org/film3.htm |title=Jim's Polaroid Collection: How film works |publisher=Polaroids.theskeltons.org |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085204/http://polaroids.theskeltons.org/film3.htm |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> True black and white films were released in 1950 after problems with chemistry stabilization were overcome.<ref name=\"ACS\"/>\n\n===Subtractive color films===\nColor film is much more complex due to multiple layers of emulsion and dye. The negative consists of three emulsion layers sensitive to the primary colors ([[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]]) each with a layer of developing dye beneath it of the complementary color ([[cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]]). Once light exposed the negative, the reagent is spread between the negative and positive and the developing dye layer migrates to the positive surface where it forms the photo. Emulsion layers exposed to their respective color block the complementary dye below it, reproducing the original color. For example, a photo of a blue sky would expose the blue emulsion, blocking all the yellow dye beneath it and allowing the magenta and cyan dye layers to migrate to the positive to form blue.<ref name=\"polaroids.theskeltons.org\"/>\n\n===Integral film===\nThis process is similar to subtractive color instant film with added timing and receiving layers. Land's solution was to incorporate an opacifier, which would darken when ejected from the camera, and then become clear to reveal the photograph.<ref name=\"ACS\">{{cite web|title=Edwin Land and Polaroid Photography|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/land-instant-photography.html#introduction_of_instant_photography|website=ACS.org|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=18 January 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118225238/https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/land-instant-photography.html#introduction_of_instant_photography|archivedate=18 January 2017}}</ref> The film itself integrates all the layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo into a plastic envelope and frame commonly associated with a Polaroid photo.\n\n===Additive color film===\nAdditive film (such as [[Polavision]] and Polachrome slide film) uses a color mask of microscopically thin transparent red, green, and blue lines (3000 lines per inch) and a black and white emulsion layer to reproduce color images in transparency film. The resulting dye developers (unexposed emulsion) block the colors not needed and project the color or combination of colors which form in the resulting image. Since the lines are so close to each other, the human eye easily blended the primary colors together to form the correct color, much like an LCD display or television. For instance, a photo of a yellow flower would expose the emulsion beneath the red and green masks and not the blue mask. The developing process removed the exposed emulsion (under the red and green masks) and diffused the unexposed dye developer (under the blue mask) to its receiving layer, blocking light from coming through. This resulted in the projected light shining through the red and green masks but not the blue mask, creating the color yellow. Because of the film density, film speeds were necessarily slow. High precision was required for the production of this film.\n\n==Film brands==\n\n===Polaroid===\n[[File:Polaroid 600 sunflower.jpg|thumb|A sample shot of Polaroid Type 600, ISO 640, color film]]\n[[Polaroid Corporation]] invented and produced the widest range of instant film. Roll film was distributed in two separate negative and positive rolls and developed inside the camera. It was introduced in 1948 and was manufactured until 1992. Sheet film was introduced in 1958 for 4x5\" film holder #500. Each sheet contains a reagent pod, negative and receiving positive, and was loaded separately and developed outside the film holder. In 1973 Polaroid introduced 8x10\" Instant film. Pack film was distributed in a film pack which contained both negative and positive sheets and was developed outside the camera. It was introduced in 1963. Integral film is also distributed in a film pack, but each film envelope contains all the chemical layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo. It was introduced in 1972.\n\n[[Polavision]] was an instant motion picture film. Polavision was introduced by Polaroid in 1978, with an image format similar to [[Super 8 mm film]], and based on an additive color process. Polavision required a specific [[movie camera|camera]] and tabletop viewer, and was not a commercial success, but did lead to the development of an instant 35&nbsp;mm color [[Transparency (photography)|slide film]]. Polavision film has been taken off the market. Polachrome was an easy to develop 35&nbsp;mm film, available in color, monochrome and 'blue' formats (the latter intended for making title cards). Each roll of film came with a cartridge containing developing chemicals which were pressed between the film and a developing strip by a hand-cranked machine called the AutoProcessor. The AutoProcessor was very cheap and did not require a darkroom; the results were somewhat variable, the resolution was not as good as conventional film due to the matrix of tiny red, green and blue filters required to make the monochrome emulsion work in color, and the sensitivity was low, even for slide film; in tungsten light, Polachrome CS is rated at ISO 40. It was introduced in 1983.\n\nPolaroid integral film packs usually contain a flat \"Polapulse\" electrical battery, which powers systems in the camera, including exposure and focusing mechanisms, electronic flash, and a film ejection motor. The inclusion of the battery within the film pack ensures that a fresh battery is available with each new pack of film.\n\nPolaroid no longer produces instant film. It has become an organization which licenses its brand name to other manufacturers. An example of this is the Polaroid 300 camera, which is a Polaroid branded Fuji [[Instax]]. Polaroid PIF-300 film is essentially rebranded Fuji Instax mini film.\n\n====Preservation====\nPolaroids have the same storage standards under ISO 18920:2000 as any other photograph.<ref>Albright, G. & Fischer, M.

Cold storage (0 degrees Fahrenheit optimum) is not helpful unless RH can be controlled and cold storage RH is generally drier than required. RH below 30% will create an environment that is too dry and may cause the photograph to curl. A [[Polaroid transfer]] removes the emulsion from the plastic backing and residual chemicals, offering an alternate form of preservation.\n\n====End of production====\nIn February 2008, Polaroid (by then under the control of Thomas J.

Kodak's original plan was to create packfilm type instant products. There were many prototypes and test runs of the film with many private demonstrations to their board. Plans changed when Polaroid in 1972 released the integral type film with the introduction of the SX-70 system. Kodak decided to scrap the plans for packfilm release and focus on an integral type process. A few years later Kodak introduced its own instant film products in 1976, which was different from Polaroid's in several ways:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rwhirled.com/landlist/nonland.htm |title=The Land List - Non-Polaroid Instant Cameras |publisher=Rwhirled.com |date=2004-03-06 |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106163339/http://www.rwhirled.com/landlist/nonland.htm |archivedate=2016-01-06 }}</ref>\n\nKodak instant film was exposed from the back without a mirror, the opposite of Polaroid's film which was exposed from the front with a mirror to reverse the image. Kodak used a matte finish on the front, made possible by exposing the film through the back. The negative and empty pod could be removed by peeling it off of the back of the print. Unlike Polaroid's integral film packs, Kodak's did not contain a battery, and used conventional batteries. Kodak\u2019s PR 10 film was found to have light fading stability issues.<ref>Wilhelm, Henry and Carol Brower. The Permanence and Care of Color Photographs: Traditional and Digital Color Prints, Color Negatives, Slides, and Motion Pictures. Grinnell: Preservation Publishing, 1993.</ref>\n\nPolaroid filed suit against Eastman Kodak in April 1976 for the infringement of ten patents held by Edwin Land and others on his development team relating to instant photography. In September 1985, the United States District Court of Massachusetts ruled that seven patents were valid and infringed, two were invalid but infringed, and one was valid but not infringed by Kodak. Kodak appealed but was denied and an injunction prohibiting production of their instant film and cameras was put into effect. Kodak's appeal to the Supreme Court was denied a few months later, and in January 1986, Kodak announced it would no longer be producing their instant line of products. In 1991, Polaroid was awarded $925 million in damages from Kodak.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Lost Instant Camera: Kodak's CHAMP Kodamatic|url=https://www.lomography.com/magazine/140518-the-lost-instant-camera-kodaks-champ-kodamatic|accessdate=29 January 2017|publisher=Lomogrohpy|date=6 January 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409042554/http://www.lomography.com/magazine/140518-the-lost-instant-camera-kodaks-champ-kodamatic|archivedate=9 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Alternative Kodak instant film====\nWhile Kodak instant films have been discontinued, Fuji's instant film available in Japan since the 1980s is very similar to Kodak's. The pictures are the same size, the cartridge is almost the same, with some easy plastic modifications; the Fuji Fotorama series film can be made to fit. It was closest to the Kodak with the ISO at 160, many of the camera's brightness controls can be adjusted to work with the different ISO; However, the FI-10 series was discontinued in the 1990s. The faster ISO 800 instant films will work as well but would require the use of a filter either on the film cartridge or lens.\n\n===Fujifilm===\n{{see also|Instax}}\n[[File:Fujifilm Instant FP.jpg|thumb|left|Fujifilm equivalents of Polaroid films]]\nIn Japan, [[Fujifilm]] introduced their own line of instant photographic products in 1981 starting with the ''Fotorama'' line of cameras. The name Fotorama came from photograph and panorama, as the film was a wide format compared to the square Polaroid SX-70/600 films. These Integral films developed similar to Kodak's with the back layer first. This presented a major problem for Fujifilm because of the ongoing litigation between Kodak and Polaroid. Polaroid also has a separate suit with Fujifilm and their instant film patents in Japan. When Kodak lost, Fujifilm was able to work with Polaroid to allow their cameras and films to remain in the market,<ref>Los Angeles Times July 25th 1986</ref> provided that they have a technology sharing agreement. Polaroid was interested in branching out to magnetic media in the boom of the [[videotape]] era and had acquired a company called MagMedia Ltd. Fujifilm has a long history in [[magnetic media]] dating to the mid-1950s. This led to Polaroid having access to Fujifilm's extensive electronic, video tape and [[floppy disc]] magnetic products. This allowed Fujifilm access to Polaroid's film technology.\n\nBy the mid-1980s Fujifilm introduced the higher ''ISO System 800'' series, followed by the ''ACE'' series in the mid-1990s. Instant ACE is nearly identical to System 800, the only difference is the design of the plastic cartridge in the ACE do not contain the [[Spring (device)|spring]] mechanism (the spring is in the camera). Most of these products were available only in the Japanese market, until the release of ''[[Instax]]'' series of cameras was released in 1998. Fujifilm originally wanted to release the Instax series worldwide including North America and Europe simultaneously,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/31/business/company-news-fuji-photo-may-enter-us-instant-film-market.html |title=Fuji may enter us instant film market |location=EUROPE |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1998-10-31 |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108181651/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/31/business/company-news-fuji-photo-may-enter-us-instant-film-market.html |archivedate=2016-01-08 }}</ref>  but decided to work with Polaroid on the ''mio camera'' based on the Instax mini 10 for the US market; while Canada did get the Instax Wide 100. Another product was Fujifilm's Digital Instax Pivi film for their battery powered portable printer which was made available for those who wanted to print from their mobile phone via infrared, USB and Bluetooth.\n\n[[File:0484 Fuji FP-14 (7159464264).jpg|thumb|right|A Fuji FP-14, designed for use as a passport camera]]\nFujifilm makes pack film for their passport camera systems, and had been available outside Japan since the mid-1980s. No legal issues arose with Fuji's peel apart instant films as Polaroid's patents had expired. While very popular in [[Australia]] as a cheaper alternative to Polaroid,{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} it was generally not too well known elsewhere due to Polaroid's dominance in most countries. In 2000, Fuji decided to change the way they manufacture pack film, making the entire pack out of plastic instead of a metal and plastic combination. Fujifilm announced at PMA 2003{{Vague|date=January 2017}} that pack film would be made available to the North American market.\n\nWith the discontinuation of Polaroid instant film in 2008, Fuji started to export more of their instant film products to overseas markets, starting with making an increased variety of pack films available. In November 2008 the Instax Wide format was available in the US with the Instax 200 camera.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujifilmusa.com/press/news/display_news?newsID=879723 |title=Fujifilm brings Instax 200 instant film camera and film to U.S. market |publisher=Fujifilmusa.com |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108181651/http://www.fujifilmusa.com/press/news/display_news?newsID=879723 |archivedate=2016-01-08 }}</ref> Instax mini series of cameras and films became available in the US during the second half of 2009, with the mini 7s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fujifilmusa.com/press/news/display_news?newsID=879790 |title=Fujifilm brings stylish INSTAX mini 7S instant camera to US |publisher=Fujifilmusa.com |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108181650/http://www.fujifilmusa.com/press/news/display_news?newsID=879790 |archivedate=2016-01-08 }}</ref> also an updated Instax 210 replaced the Instax 200.

The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the [[Middle Ages]] from the king's council of [[bishop]]s and [[earl]]s. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]], when it was described as a \"colloquium\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early 14th century, the attendance of [[knight]]s and [[fee simple|freeholders]] had become important, and from 1326 [[Commissioner (Scottish Parliament)|commissioners]] from the [[royal burgh|burgh]]s attended. Consisting of the \"[[estates of the realm|three estates]]\" of [[clergy]], [[nobility]] and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of [[taxation]] and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \"sister\" institutions, such as [[General Council of Scotland|General Councils]] or [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Convention of Estates]]. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament \u2013 taxation, legislation and policy-making \u2013 but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Brown and Tanner, ''History of the Scottish Parliament'', i, Introduction</ref>\n\nThe Parliament of Scotland met for more than four centuries, until it was prorogued ''[[sine die]]'' at the time of the Acts of Union in 1707. Thereafter the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] operated for both England and Scotland after the creation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] on 1 May 1707. When the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was abolished in 1801, its former members were merged into what was now called the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].<ref>Mann, Alastair, \"A Brief History of an Ancient Institution: The Scottish Parliament\", ''Scottish Parliamentary Review'', Vol. I, No. 1 (June, 2013) [Edinburgh: Blacket Avenue Press]</ref> From January 1801 until 1927, the British state was officially called the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] (even though the [[Irish Free State]] had come into existence in December 1922).\n\nThe pre-Union parliament was long portrayed as a constitutionally defective body<ref>R. Rait, ''Parliaments of Scotland'' (1928)</ref> that acted merely as a [[rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] for royal decisions, but research during the early 21st century has found that it played an active role in [[Politics of Scotland|Scottish affairs]], and was sometimes a thorn in the side of the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish Crown]].<ref>Brown and Tanner, passim; R. Tanner, ''The Late Medieval Scottish Parliament'', ''passim''; K. Brown and A. Mann, ''History of the Scottish Parliament'', ii, ''passim''</ref>\n\n== Three Estates ==\n{{Further information|Estates of the realm}}\n\nThe members were collectively referred to as the '''Three Estates''' ({{lang-sco|Thrie Estaitis}}), or \"community of the realm\" (''tres communitates''), composed of until 1690:\n* the ''first estate'' of [[prelate]]s ([[bishop]]s and [[abbot]]s)\n* the ''second estate'' of the nobility ([[duke]]s, [[marquess|Marquis]], [[earl]]s, [[viscount]]s, [[parliamentary peers]] (after 1437) and [[Laity|lay]] [[tenants-in-chief]])\n* the ''third estate'' of [[Burgh Commissioner]]s (representatives chosen by the [[royal burghs]])<ref>[http://www.rps.ac.uk/ Rait, Parliaments of Scotland, ''passim'';]</ref>\n\nThe bishops and abbots of the First Estate were the thirteen medieval bishops of [[Bishop of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], [[Bishop of Argyll|Argyll]], [[Bishop of Brechin|Brechin]], [[Bishop of Caithness|Caithness]], [[Bishop of Dunblane|Dunblane]], [[Bishop of Dunkeld|Dunkeld]], [[Bishop of Galloway|Galloway]], [[Bishop of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[Bishop of the Isles|Isles (Sodor)]], [[Bishop of Moray|Moray]], [[Bishop of Orkney|Orkney]], [[Bishop of Ross (Scotland)|Ross]] and [[Bishop of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and the mitred abbots of [[Arbroath Abbey|Arbroath]], [[Cambuskenneth Abbey|Cambuskenneth]], [[Coupar Angus Abbey|Coupar Angus]], [[Dunfermline Abbey|Dunfermline]], [[Holyrood Abbey|Holyrood]], [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], [[Kelso Abbey|Kelso]], [[Kilwinning Abbey|Kilwinning]], [[Kinloss Abbey|Kinloss]], [[Lindores Abbey|Lindores]], [[Paisley Abbey|Paisley]], [[Melrose Abbey|Melrose]], [[Scone Abbey|Scone]], [[St Andrews Cathedral Priory|St Andrews Priory]] and [[Sweetheart Abbey|Sweetheart]].<ref>{{citation |last=Cowan |first=Ian B. |last2=Easson |first2=David E. |title=Medieval Religious Houses: Scotland With an Appendix on the Houses in the Isle of Man |edition=2nd |year=1976 |publisher=Longman |location=London and New York |isbn=0-582-12069-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/medievalreligiou0000cowa }} pp. 67\u201397</ref>  Later, the bishops themselves were removed from the [[Church of Scotland]] during the [[Glorious Revolution]] and the accession of [[William III of England|William of Orange]].<ref>Kidd, Colin ''Subverting Scotland's Past: Scottish Whig Historians and the Creation of an Anglo-British Identity 1689\u20131830'' Cambridge University Press (2003) p. 133</ref> The Second Estate was then split into two to retain the division into three.\n\nFrom the 16th century, the ''second estate'' was reorganised by the selection of [[Shire Commissioners]]: this has been argued to have created a ''fourth estate''. During the 17th century, after the [[Union of the Crowns]], a ''fifth estate'' of royal office holders (see [[Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland]]) has also been identified. These latter identifications remain highly controversial among parliamentary historians. Regardless, the term used for the assembled members continued to be \"the Three Estates\".<ref>The \"fourth estate\" argument is primarily favoured by Julian Goodare, and disputed by Keith Brown. A summary of the most recent research can be found in Brown and Mann, ''History of the Scottish Parliament'', ii.</ref>\n\nA ''[[Shire Commissioners|Shire Commissioner]]'' was the closest equivalent of the [[England|English]] office of ''[[Member of Parliament]]'', namely a [[commoner]] or member of the lower nobility. Because the parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same [[Chambers of parliament|chamber]], as opposed to the separate English [[House of Lords]] and [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Scottish parliament evolved during the [[Middle Ages]] from the King's Council. It is perhaps first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, described as a \"colloquium\" and already with a political and judicial role.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In 1296 we have the first mention of burgh representatives taking part in decision making.<ref name=Bryant>Bryant, Chris ''Parliament: The Biography'' Volume 1, chapter 10 ''Ane Auld Sang''</ref>  By the early 14th century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and [[Robert the Bruce]] began regularly calling [[burgh]] commissioners to his Parliament. Consisting of ''The Three Estates'' \u2013 of [[clerics]], lay [[Tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]] and burgh commissioners \u2013 sitting in a single chamber, the Scottish parliament acquired significant powers over particular issues. Most obviously it was needed for consent for taxation (although taxation was only raised irregularly in Scotland in the medieval period), but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation, whether political, [[ecclesiastical]], social or economic. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \"sister\" institutions, before c. 1500 by [[General Council of Scotland|General Council]] and thereafter by the [[Convention of Estates of Scotland|Convention of Estates]]. These could carry out much business also dealt with by Parliament \u2013 taxation, legislation and policy-making \u2013 but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.<ref>Tanner, ''Parliament'', ''passim''</ref> The Scottish parliament met in a number of different locations throughout its history. In addition to [[Edinburgh]], meetings were held in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Stirling]], [[St Andrews]], [[Dundee]], [[Linlithgow]], [[Dunfermline]], [[Glasgow]], [[Aberdeen]], [[Inverness]] and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]].<ref>Brown and Tanner, passim; Brown and Mann, passim</ref>\n\n== Lords of the Articles ==\nFrom the early 1450s until 1690, a great deal of the legislative business of the Scottish Parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the \"Lords of the Articles\". This was a committee chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. In the past, historians have been particularly critical of this body, claiming that it quickly came to be dominated by royal nominees, thus undermining the power of the full assembly.<ref>Typified by Rait, op. cit</ref> Recent research suggests that this was far from always being the case. Indeed, in March 1482, the committee was taken over by men shortly to be involved in a coup d'\u00e9tat against the King and his government. On other occasions the committee was so large that it could hardly have been easier to control than the full assembly. More generally, the committee was a pragmatic means to delegate the complicated drafting of acts to those members of parliament skilled in law and letters \u2013 not unlike a modern [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committee]] of the [[UK Parliament]] \u2013 while the right to confirm the act remained with the full assembly of three estates.<ref>R. Tanner, \"The Lords of the Articles before 1542\", in ''Scottish Historical Review'' (2000)</ref> The Lords of the Articles were abolished in 1690 as part of the revolutionary settlement.<ref>Ferguson, William ''Scotland's relations with England: a survey to 1707'' Saltire Society; New edition (1994) p173</ref>\n\n== Crown ==\nAt various points in its history, the Scottish Parliament was able to exert considerable influence over the Crown. This should not be viewed as a slow rise from parliamentary weakness in 1235 to strength in the 17th century, but rather a situation where in particular decades or sessions between the thirteenth and 17th century, parliament became particularly able to influence the Crown, while at other points that ability was more limited. As early as the reign of [[David II of Scotland|David II]], parliament was able to prevent him pursuing his policy of a union of the crowns with England, while the 15th-century Stewart monarchs were consistently influenced by a prolonged period of parliamentary strength. Reverses to this situation have been argued to have occurred in the late 16th and early 17th centuries under [[James VI and I|James VI]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], but in the 17th century, even after the Restoration, parliament was able to remove the clergy's right to attend in 1689 and abolish the Lords of the Articles in 1690, thereby limiting royal power. Parliament's strength was such that the Crown turned to corruption and political management to undermine its autonomy in the latter period. Nonetheless, the period from 1690 to 1707 was one in which political \"parties\" and alliances were formed within parliament in a maturing atmosphere of rigorous debate. The disputes over the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]], the Scottish [[Act of Security]], and the English [[Alien Act 1705]] showed that both sides were prepared to take considered yet considerable risks in their relationships.<ref>Brown, Mann and Tanner, ''History of the Scottish Parliament'', i, ii, ''passim''.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Before 1400 ===\n[[File:Moot hill.jpg|300px|thumb| [[Scone Abbey|Scone]] and its [[Moot hill]] emerged as a favoured meeting place of the early colloquia and councils in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.]]\nBetween 1235 and 1286, little can be told with certainty about Parliament's function, but it appears to have had a judicial and political role which was well established by the end of the century. With the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], Scotland found itself without an adult monarch, and in this situation, Parliament seems to have become more prominent as a means to give added legitimacy to the Council of Guardians who ran the country. By the reign of [[John Balliol of Scotland|John Balliol]] (1292\u201396), Parliament was well established, and Balliol attempted to use it as a means to withstand the encroachments of his overlord, [[Edward I of England]]. With his deposition in 1296, Parliament temporarily became less prominent, but it was again held frequently by [[Robert I of Scotland|King Robert Bruce]] after 1309. During his reign some of the most important documents made by the King and [[community of the realm]] were made in Parliament\u2014for instance the 1309\u20131310 [[Declaration of the Clergy]].\n\nBy the reign of David II, the \"three estates\" (a phrase that replaced \"community of the realm\" at this time) in Parliament were certainly able to oppose the King when necessary. Most notably, David was repeatedly prevented from accepting an English succession to the throne by Parliament. During the reigns of [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] and [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]], Parliament appears to have been held less often, and royal power in that period also declined, but the institution returned to prominence, and arguably enjoyed its greatest period of power over the Crown after the return of [[James I of Scotland|James I]] from English captivity in 1424.<ref>Brown and Tanner, ''History of Parliament'', i, ''passim''</ref>\n\n=== 15th century ===\n[[File:The Old Tolbooth.jpg|thumb|300px|Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh.

During the 15th century, Parliament was called far more often than, for instance, the [[List of Parliaments of England|English Parliament]] \u2013 on average over once a year \u2013 a fact that both reflected and augmented its influence. It repeatedly opposed [[James I of Scotland|James I's]] (1424\u20131437) requests for taxation to pay an English ransom in the 1420s and was openly hostile to [[James III of Scotland|James III]] (1460\u20131488) in the 1470s and early 1480s. In 1431, Parliament granted a tax to James I for a campaign in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] on the condition that it be kept in a locked chest under the keepership of figures deeply out of favour with the King. In 1436, there was even an attempt made to arrest the King \"in the name of the three estates\". Between October 1479 and March 1482, Parliament was conclusively out of the control of [[James III of Scotland|James III]]. It refused to forfeit his brother, the [[Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]], despite a royal siege of the Duke's castle, tried to prevent the King leading his army against the English (a powerful indication of the estates' lack of faith in their monarch), and appointed men to the Lords of the Articles and important offices who were shortly to remove the King from power. [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] (1488\u20131513) realised that Parliament could often create more problems than it solved, and avoided meetings after 1509. This was a trend seen in other European nations as monarchical power grew stronger \u2013 for instance England under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], as well as France and Spain.<ref>Tanner, ''Late Medieval Scottish Parliament'', passim</ref>\n\n=== 16th century ===\n[[File:St. Giles' Church, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|300px|[[St Giles' Cathedral|St Giles' Kirk]], common meeting place of Parliament from 1563 to 1639.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scotparlhistory.stir.ac.uk/Workshop5.pdf |format=PDF |title=WORKSHOP FIVE: \"Images of Parliament\" |publisher=The Scottish Parliament History Workshop at Stirling University |accessdate=2017-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312042244/http://scotparlhistory.stir.ac.uk/Workshop5.pdf |archive-date=12 March 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\nLike many continental assemblies the Scottish Parliament was being called less frequently by the early sixteenth century and might have been dispensed with by the crown had it not been for the series of minorities and regencies that dominated from 1513.<ref name=\"Wormald1991p21\">J.

It had been used by James V to uphold Catholic orthodoxy<ref name=\"Wormald1991p22\">Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470\u20131625'', p. 22.</ref> and asserted its right to determine the nature of religion in the country, disregarding royal authority in 1560. The 1560 parliament included 100 [[lairds]], who were predominantly Protestant, and who claimed a right to sit in the Parliament under the provision of a failed shire election act of 1428. Their position in the parliament remained uncertain and their presence fluctuated until the 1428 act was revived in 1587 and provision made for the annual election of two commissioners from each shire (except Kinross and Clackmannan, which had one each). The property qualification for voters was for freeholders who held land from the crown of the value of 40s of auld extent. This excluded the growing class of [[Feu (land tenure)|feuars]], who would not gain these rights until 1661.<ref name=\"Wormald1991p157\">Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470\u20131625'', p. 157.</ref> The clerical estate was marginalised in Parliament by the Reformation, with the laymen who had acquired the monasteries sitting as \"abbots\" and \"priors\".

During the reign of James VI, the Lords of the Articles came more under the influence of the crown. By 1612, they sometimes seem to have been appointed by the Crown rather than Parliament, and as a result the independence of parliament was perceived by contemporaries to have been eroded.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nDuring the 16th century, the composition of Parliament underwent a number of significant changes and it found itself sharing the stage with new national bodies. The emergence of the [[Convention of Royal Burghs]] as the \"parliament\" of Scotland's trading towns and the development of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Kirk's General Assembly]] after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] (1560) meant that rival representative assemblies could bring pressure to bear on parliament in specific areas.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation, laymen acquired the monasteries and those sitting as \"abbots\" and \"priors\" were now, effectively, part of the estate of nobles. The bishops continued to sit in Parliament regardless of whether they conformed to [[Protestantism]] or not. This resulted in pressure from the Kirk to reform ecclesiastical representation in Parliament. Catholic clergy were excluded after 1567 but Protestant bishops continued as the clerical estate until their abolition in 1638 when Parliament became an entirely lay assembly. An act of 1587 granted the lairds of each shire the right to send two commissioners to every parliament. These shire commissioners attended from 1592 onwards, although they shared one vote until 1638 when they secured a vote each.<ref name=Bryant/> The number of burghs with the right to send commissioners to parliament increased quite markedly in the late 16th and early 17th centuries until, in the 1640s, they often constituted the largest single estate in Parliament.<ref>Rait, ''Parliaments of Scotland''</ref>\n\nThe first printed edition of the legislation of the Parliament, ''The New Actis and Constitutionis'', was published in Edinburgh in 1542 by the printer [[Thomas Davidson (printer)|Thomas Davidson]] under commission from [[James V of Scotland|James V]].\n\n=== 17th century ===\n[[File:Downsitting of the Scottish Parliament detail.JPG|thumb|300px|The Riding of Parliament (the procession of members to and from the meeting place of Parliament) c. 1685, from Nicholas de Gueudeville's ''Atlas Historique, ou Nouvelle Introduction \u00e0 l'Histoire \u00e0 la Chronologie & \u00e0 la G\u00e9ographie Ancienne & Moderne'' (Amsterdam, 1720)]]\nIn 1639, the legislature was installed in the newly-built [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament Hall]], where it remained  until dissolution in 1707.<ref>R.

The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the [[Middle Ages]] from the king's council of [[bishop]]s and [[earl]]s. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]], when it was described as a \"colloquium\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of [[knight]]s and [[Fee simple|freeholders]] had become important, and from 1326 [[Commissioner (Scottish Parliament)|commissioners]] from the [[royal burgh|burgh]]s attended. Consisting of the \"[[Estates of the realm|three estates]]\" of [[clergy]], [[nobility]] and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of [[taxation]] and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \"sister\" institutions, such as [[General Council of Scotland|General Councils]] or [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Convention of Estates]]. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament \u2013 taxation, legislation and policy-making \u2013 but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Brown and Tanner, ''History of the Scottish Parliament'', i, Introduction</ref>\n\nThe Parliament of Scotland met for more than four centuries, until it was prorogued ''[[sine die]]'' at the time of the Acts of Union in 1707.

During the 17th century, after the [[Union of the Crowns]], a ''fifth estate'' of royal office holders (see [[Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland]]) has also been identified. These latter identifications remain highly controversial among parliamentary historians. Regardless, the term used for the assembled members continued to be \"the Three Estates\".<ref>The \"fourth estate\" argument is primarily favoured by Julian Goodare, and disputed by Keith Brown. A summary of the most recent research can be found in Brown and Mann, ''History of the Scottish Parliament'', ii.</ref>\n\nA ''[[Shire Commissioners|Shire Commissioner]]'' was the closest equivalent of the [[England|English]] office of ''[[Member of Parliament]]'', namely a [[commoner]] or member of the lower nobility. Because the parliament of Scotland was unicameral, all members sat in the same [[Chambers of parliament|chamber]], as opposed to the separate English [[House of Lords]] and [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Scottish parliament evolved during the [[Middle Ages]] from the King's Council. It is perhaps first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, described as a \"colloquium\" and already with a political and judicial role.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In 1296 we have the first mention of burgh representatives taking part in decision making.<ref name=Bryant>Bryant, Chris ''Parliament: The Biography'' Volume 1, chapter 10 ''Ane Auld Sang''</ref>  By the early 14th century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and [[Robert the Bruce]] began regularly calling [[burgh]] commissioners to his Parliament. Consisting of ''The Three Estates'' \u2013 of [[clerics]], lay [[Tenant-in-chief|tenants-in-chief]] and burgh commissioners \u2013 sitting in a single chamber, the Scottish parliament acquired significant powers over particular issues. Most obviously it was needed for consent for taxation (although taxation was only raised irregularly in Scotland in the medieval period), but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation, whether political, [[ecclesiastical]], social or economic. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \"sister\" institutions, before c. 1500 by [[General Council of Scotland|General Council]] and thereafter by the [[Convention of Estates of Scotland|Convention of Estates]]. These could carry out much business also dealt with by Parliament \u2013 taxation, legislation and policy-making \u2013 but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.<ref>Tanner, ''Parliament'', ''passim''</ref> The Scottish parliament met in a number of different locations throughout its history. In addition to [[Edinburgh]], meetings were held in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Stirling]], [[St Andrews]], [[Dundee]], [[Linlithgow]], [[Dunfermline]], [[Glasgow]], [[Aberdeen]], [[Inverness]] and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]].<ref>Brown and Tanner, passim; Brown and Mann, passim</ref>\n\n== Lords of the Articles ==\nFrom the early 1450s until 1690, a great deal of the legislative business of the Scottish Parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the \"Lords of the Articles\". This was a committee chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. In the past, historians have been particularly critical of this body, claiming that it quickly came to be dominated by royal nominees, thus undermining the power of the full assembly.<ref>Typified by Rait, op. cit</ref> Recent research suggests that this was far from always being the case. Indeed, in March 1482, the committee was taken over by men shortly to be involved in a coup d'\u00e9tat against the King and his government. On other occasions the committee was so large that it could hardly have been easier to control than the full assembly. More generally, the committee was a pragmatic means to delegate the complicated drafting of acts to those members of parliament skilled in law and letters \u2013 not unlike a modern [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|select committee]] of the [[UK Parliament]] \u2013 while the right to confirm the act remained with the full assembly of three estates.<ref>R. Tanner, \"The Lords of the Articles before 1542\", in ''Scottish Historical Review'' (2000)</ref> The Lords of the Articles were abolished in 1690 as part of the revolutionary settlement.<ref>Ferguson, William ''Scotland's relations with England: a survey to 1707'' Saltire Society; New edition (1994) p173</ref>\n\n== Crown ==\nAt various points in its history, the Scottish Parliament was able to exert considerable influence over the Crown. This should not be viewed as a slow rise from parliamentary weakness in 1235 to strength in the 17th century, but rather a situation where in particular decades or sessions between the thirteenth and 17th century, parliament became particularly able to influence the Crown, while at other points that ability was more limited. As early as the reign of [[David II of Scotland|David II]], parliament was able to prevent him pursuing his policy of a union of the crowns with England, while the 15th-century Stewart monarchs were consistently influenced by a prolonged period of parliamentary strength. Reverses to this situation have been argued to have occurred in the late 16th and early 17th centuries under [[James VI and I|James VI]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], but in the 17th century, even after the Restoration, parliament was able to remove the clergy's right to attend in 1689 and abolish the Lords of the Articles in 1690, thereby limiting royal power. Parliament's strength was such that the Crown turned to corruption and political management to undermine its autonomy in the latter period. Nonetheless, the period from 1690 to 1707 was one in which political \"parties\" and alliances were formed within parliament in a maturing atmosphere of rigorous debate. The disputes over the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]], the Scottish [[Act of Security]], and the English [[Alien Act 1705]] showed that both sides were prepared to take considered yet considerable risks in their relationships.<ref>Brown, Mann and Tanner, ''History of the Scottish Parliament'', i, ii, ''passim''.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Before 1400 ===\n[[File:Moot hill.jpg|300px|thumb| [[Scone Abbey|Scone]] and its [[Moot hill]] emerged as a favoured meeting place of the early colloquia and councils in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.]]\nBetween 1235 and 1286, little can be told with certainty about Parliament's function, but it appears to have had a judicial and political role which was well established by the end of the century. With the death of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], Scotland found itself without an adult monarch, and in this situation, Parliament seems to have become more prominent as a means to give added legitimacy to the Council of Guardians who ran the country. By the reign of [[John Balliol of Scotland|John Balliol]] (1292\u201396), Parliament was well established, and Balliol attempted to use it as a means to withstand the encroachments of his overlord, [[Edward I of England]]. With his deposition in 1296, Parliament temporarily became less prominent, but it was again held frequently by [[Robert I of Scotland|King Robert Bruce]] after 1309. During his reign some of the most important documents made by the King and [[community of the realm]] were made in Parliament\u2014for instance the 1309\u20131310 [[Declaration of the Clergy]].\n\nBy the reign of David II, the \"three estates\" (a phrase that replaced \"community of the realm\" at this time) in Parliament were certainly able to oppose the King when necessary. Most notably, David was repeatedly prevented from accepting an English succession to the throne by Parliament. During the reigns of [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] and [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]], Parliament appears to have been held less often, and royal power in that period also declined, but the institution returned to prominence, and arguably enjoyed its greatest period of power over the Crown after the return of [[James I of Scotland|James I]] from English captivity in 1424.<ref>Brown and Tanner, ''History of Parliament'', i, ''passim''</ref>\n\n=== 15th century ===\n[[File:The Old Tolbooth.jpg|thumb|300px|Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh.

During the 15th century, Parliament was called far more often than, for instance, the [[List of Parliaments of England|English Parliament]] \u2013 on average over once a year \u2013 a fact that both reflected and augmented its influence. It repeatedly opposed [[James I of Scotland|James I's]] (1424\u20131437) requests for taxation to pay an English ransom in the 1420s and was openly hostile to [[James III of Scotland|James III]] (1460\u20131488) in the 1470s and early 1480s. In 1431, Parliament granted a tax to James I for a campaign in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] on the condition that it be kept in a locked chest under the keepership of figures deeply out of favour with the King. In 1436, there was even an attempt made to arrest the King \"in the name of the three estates\". Between October 1479 and March 1482, Parliament was conclusively out of the control of [[James III of Scotland|James III]]. It refused to forfeit his brother, the [[Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]], despite a royal siege of the Duke's castle, tried to prevent the King leading his army against the English (a powerful indication of the estates' lack of faith in their monarch), and appointed men to the Lords of the Articles and important offices who were shortly to remove the King from power. [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] (1488\u20131513) realised that Parliament could often create more problems than it solved, and avoided meetings after 1509. This was a trend seen in other European nations as monarchical power grew stronger \u2013 for instance England under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], as well as France and Spain.<ref>Tanner, ''Late Medieval Scottish Parliament'', passim</ref>\n\n=== 16th century ===\n[[File:St. Giles' Church, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|300px|[[St Giles' Cathedral|St Giles' Kirk]], common meeting place of Parliament from 1563 to 1639.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scotparlhistory.stir.ac.uk/Workshop5.pdf |format=PDF |title=WORKSHOP FIVE: \"Images of Parliament\" |publisher=The Scottish Parliament History Workshop at Stirling University |accessdate=2017-03-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312042244/http://scotparlhistory.stir.ac.uk/Workshop5.pdf |archive-date=12 March 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\nLike many continental assemblies the Scottish Parliament was being called less frequently by the early sixteenth century and might have been dispensed with by the crown had it not been for the series of minorities and regencies that dominated from 1513.<ref name=\"Wormald1991p21\">J.

The 1560 parliament included 100 [[lairds]], who were predominantly Protestant, and who claimed a right to sit in the Parliament under the provision of a failed shire election act of 1428. Their position in the parliament remained uncertain and their presence fluctuated until the 1428 act was revived in 1587 and provision made for the annual election of two commissioners from each shire (except Kinross and Clackmannan, which had one each). The property qualification for voters was for freeholders who held land from the crown of the value of 40s of auld extent. This excluded the growing class of [[Feu (land tenure)|feuars]], who would not gain these rights until 1661.<ref name=\"Wormald1991p157\">Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470\u20131625'', p. 157.</ref> The clerical estate was marginalised in Parliament by the Reformation, with the laymen who had acquired the monasteries sitting as \"abbots\" and \"priors\".

During the reign of James VI, the Lords of the Articles came more under the influence of the crown. By 1612, they sometimes seem to have been appointed by the Crown rather than Parliament, and as a result the independence of parliament was perceived by contemporaries to have been eroded.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nDuring the 16th century, the composition of Parliament underwent a number of significant changes and it found itself sharing the stage with new national bodies. The emergence of the [[Convention of Royal Burghs]] as the \"parliament\" of Scotland's trading towns and the development of the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Kirk's General Assembly]] after the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] (1560) meant that rival representative assemblies could bring pressure to bear on parliament in specific areas.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation, laymen acquired the monasteries and those sitting as \"abbots\" and \"priors\" were now, effectively, part of the estate of nobles. The bishops continued to sit in Parliament regardless of whether they conformed to [[Protestantism]] or not. This resulted in pressure from the Kirk to reform ecclesiastical representation in Parliament. Catholic clergy were excluded after 1567 but Protestant bishops continued as the clerical estate until their abolition in 1638 when Parliament became an entirely lay assembly. An act of 1587 granted the lairds of each shire the right to send two commissioners to every parliament. These shire commissioners attended from 1592 onwards, although they shared one vote until 1638 when they secured a vote each.<ref name=Bryant/> The number of burghs with the right to send commissioners to parliament increased quite markedly in the late 16th and early 17th centuries until, in the 1640s, they often constituted the largest single estate in Parliament.<ref>Rait, ''Parliaments of Scotland''</ref>\n\nThe first printed edition of the legislation of the Parliament, ''The New Actis and Constitutionis'', was published in Edinburgh in 1542 by the printer [[Thomas Davidson (printer)|Thomas Davidson]] under commission from [[James V of Scotland|James V]].\n\n=== 17th century ===\n[[File:Downsitting of the Scottish Parliament detail.JPG|thumb|300px|The Riding of Parliament (the procession of members to and from the meeting place of Parliament) c. 1685, from Nicholas de Gueudeville's ''Atlas Historique, ou Nouvelle Introduction \u00e0 l'Histoire \u00e0 la Chronologie & \u00e0 la G\u00e9ographie Ancienne & Moderne'' (Amsterdam, 1720)]]\nIn 1639, the legislature was installed in the newly-built [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament Hall]], where it remained  until dissolution in 1707.<ref>R.

After the Restoration, the Lord Chancellor was made ''ex-officio'' president of the parliament (now reflected in the [[Scottish Parliament]] by the election of a [[Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament|presiding officer]]), his functions including the formulation of questions and putting them to the vote.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Parliaments of Scotland]]\n* [[Commissioner (Scottish Parliament)]]\n* ''[[A Satire of the Three Estates|Ane Plesant Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis]]'', by [[David Lyndsay]]\n* [[Estates General (France)|Estates-General of France]]\n* [[General Council of Scotland]]\n* [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland]]\n* [[History of democracy]]\n* [[History of local government in Scotland]]\n* [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707]]\n* [[List of Constituencies in the Parliament of Scotland at the time of the Union]]\n* [[Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh]], meeting place of Parliament until 1560.\n* [[Parliament House, Edinburgh]], meeting place of Parliament from 1639\u20131707.\n* [[Parliament of Ireland]]\n* [[Records of the Parliaments of Scotland]]\n* [[The Estates|The States]]\n* [[Scottish Parliament]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* K.

The film's title ''Pretty Woman'' is based on \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\", written and sung by [[Roy Orbison]]. It is the first film on-screen collaboration between Gere and Roberts. \n\nOriginally intended to be a dark cautionary tale about class and sex work in [[Los Angeles]], the film was re-conceived as a romantic comedy with a large budget.

In addition, screenwriter J. F.

Leaving a business party in the [[Hollywood Hills]], he takes his lawyer's [[Lotus Esprit#X180 (1987) and derivatives|Lotus Esprit]] sports car and accidentally ends up on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] in the city's [[red-light district]], where he encounters prostitute Vivian Ward. As he is having difficulties driving the car, she gets in and guides him to the [[Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel]], where he is staying. It becomes clear that Vivian knows more about the Lotus than he does, and he lets her drive. Vivian charges Lewis $20 for the ride, and they separate. She goes to a bus stop, where he finds her and offers to hire her for the night; the next day, he asks Vivian to play the role his girlfriend has refused, offering her $3000 to stay with him for the next six days as well as to buy her a new, more acceptable wardrobe. That evening, going to a business dinner, Edward is visibly moved by Vivian's transformation brought about by the helpful manager of the hotel and begins seeing Vivian in a different light. He begins to open up to her, revealing details about his personal and business lives.\n\nEdward takes Vivian to a polo match in hopes of networking for his business deal. His attorney, Phillip, suspects Vivian is a corporate spy, and Edward tells him how they truly met. Phillip later approaches Vivian, suggesting they do business once her work with Edward is finished. Insulted, and furious that Edward has revealed their secret, Vivian wants to end the arrangement. Edward apologizes and admits to feeling jealous of a business associate &ndash; whom she had met at the previous night's dinner &ndash; to whom Vivian paid attention at the match. Vivian's straightforward personality is rubbing off on Edward, and he finds himself acting in unaccustomed ways. Clearly growing involved, Edward takes Vivian by private jet to see ''[[La traviata|La Traviata]]'' at the [[San Francisco Opera]]. Vivian is moved to tears by the story of the prostitute who falls in love with a rich man. She breaks her \"no kissing on the mouth\" rule and they have sex; in the afterglow, believing Edward is asleep, Vivian admits she loves him, and as she drifts off, Edward opens his eyes. Edward offers to put her up in an apartment so she can be off the streets. Hurt, she refuses and says this is not the \"fairy tale\" she dreamed of as a child, in which a knight on a white horse rescues her.\n\nMeeting with the tycoon whose shipbuilding company he is in the process of raiding, Edward changes his mind. His time with Vivian has shown him a different way of looking at life, and he suggests he and the tycoon work together to save the company rather than tearing it apart and selling off the pieces. Phillip, furious at losing so much money, goes to the hotel to confront Edward but finds only Vivian. Blaming her for the change in Edward, he attempts to rape her. Edward arrives, wrestles Philip off her, punches him in the face, and throws him out of the room.\n\nWith his business in L.A. complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay one more night with him, but because she wants to, not because he's paying her. She refuses. Edward re-thinks his life, and as he's leaving for the airport to return to New York, he instead has the hotel chauffeur detour to Vivian's apartment building, where he leaps from the white limousine's sun roof and \"rescues her\", overcoming his extreme fear of heights to ascend her fire escape. Edward asks, \"So what happens after he climbed up the tower and rescues her?\" Vivian responds, \"She rescues him right back.\" Vivian and Edward \nkiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Edward Lewis, a rich corporate raider and [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]] from New York. \n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Vivian Ward, a free spirited [[Hollywood]] [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who Edward hires to be his escort for a week.\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as James Morse, owner of a troubled shipbuilding company Edward plans to take over. \n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Phillip Stuckey, Edward's insensitive lawyer. \n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Barney Thompson, the dignified but soft-hearted hotel manager.\n* [[Laura San Giacomo]] as Kit De Luca, Vivian's sarcastic wisecracking [[Greek American]] best friend and roommate, who has taught her the prostitution trade. \n* Julie Paris as Rachel, friend of Vivian and Kit.\n* [[Alex Hyde-White]] as David Morse, James Morse's grandson, who is being groomed to take over the company.\n* [[Amy Yasbeck]] as Elizabeth Stuckey, Phillip's wife.\n* [[Elinor Donahue]] as Bridget, a friend of Barney Thompson who works in a women's clothing store.\n* [[John David Carson]] as Mark Roth, a businessman in Edward's office.\n* [[Judith Baldwin]] as Susan, one of Edward's ex-girlfriends whom he runs into at Phil's party at the beginning of the film.

In addition, screenwriter J. F.

Leaving a business party in the [[Hollywood Hills]], he takes his lawyer's [[Lotus Esprit#X180 (1987) and derivatives|Lotus Esprit]] sports car and accidentally ends up on [[Hollywood Boulevard]] in the city's [[red-light district]], where he encounters prostitute Vivian Ward. As he is having difficulties driving the car, she gets in and guides him to the [[Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel]], where he is staying. It becomes clear that Vivian knows more about the Lotus than he does, and he lets her drive. Vivian charges Lewis $20 for the ride, and they separate. She goes to a bus stop, where he finds her and offers to hire her for the night; the next day, he asks Vivian to play the role his girlfriend has refused, offering her $3000 to stay with him for the next six days as well as to buy her a new, more acceptable wardrobe. That evening, going to a business dinner, Edward is visibly moved by Vivian's transformation brought about by the helpful manager of the hotel and begins seeing Vivian in a different light. He begins to open up to her, revealing details about his personal and business lives.\n\nEdward takes Vivian to a polo match in hopes of networking for his business deal. His attorney, Phillip, suspects Vivian is a corporate spy, and Edward tells him how they truly met. Phillip later approaches Vivian, suggesting they do business once her work with Edward is finished. Insulted, and furious that Edward has revealed their secret, Vivian wants to end the arrangement. Edward apologizes and admits to feeling jealous of a business associate &ndash; whom she had met at the previous night's dinner &ndash; to whom Vivian paid attention at the match. Vivian's straightforward personality is rubbing off on Edward, and he finds himself acting in unaccustomed ways. Clearly growing involved, Edward takes Vivian by private jet to see ''[[La traviata|La Traviata]]'' at the [[San Francisco Opera]]. Vivian is moved to tears by the story of the prostitute who falls in love with a rich man. She breaks her \"no kissing on the mouth\" rule and they have sex; in the afterglow, believing Edward is asleep, Vivian admits she loves him, and as she drifts off, Edward opens his eyes. Edward offers to put her up in an apartment so she can be off the streets. Hurt, she refuses and says this is not the \"fairy tale\" she dreamed of as a child, in which a knight on a white horse rescues her.\n\nMeeting with the tycoon whose shipbuilding company he is in the process of raiding, Edward changes his mind. His time with Vivian has shown him a different way of looking at life, and he suggests he and the tycoon work together to save the company rather than tearing it apart and selling off the pieces. Phillip, furious at losing so much money, goes to the hotel to confront Edward but finds only Vivian. Blaming her for the change in Edward, he attempts to rape her. Edward arrives, wrestles Philip off her, punches him in the face, and throws him out of the room.\n\nWith his business in L.A. complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay one more night with him, but because she wants to, not because he's paying her. She refuses. Edward re-thinks his life, and as he's leaving for the airport to return to New York, he instead has the hotel chauffeur detour to Vivian's apartment building, where he leaps from the white limousine's sun roof and \"rescues her\", overcoming his extreme fear of heights to ascend her fire escape. Edward asks, \"So what happens after he climbed up the tower and rescues her?\" Vivian responds, \"She rescues him right back.\" Vivian and Edward \nkiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Richard Gere]] as Edward Lewis, a rich corporate raider and [[Playboy lifestyle|playboy]] from New York. \n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Vivian Ward, a free spirited [[Hollywood]] [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who Edward hires to be his escort for a week.\n* [[Ralph Bellamy]] as James Morse, owner of a troubled shipbuilding company Edward plans to take over. \n* [[Jason Alexander]] as Phillip Stuckey, Edward's insensitive lawyer. \n* [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]] as Barney Thompson, the dignified but soft-hearted hotel manager.\n* [[Laura San Giacomo]] as Kit De Luca, Vivian's sarcastic wisecracking [[Greek American]] best friend and roommate, who has taught her the prostitution trade. \n* Julie Paris as Rachel, friend of Vivian and Kit.\n* [[Alex Hyde-White]] as David Morse, James Morse's grandson, who is being groomed to take over the company.\n* [[Amy Yasbeck]] as Elizabeth Stuckey, Phillip's wife.\n* [[Elinor Donahue]] as Bridget, a friend of Barney Thompson who works in a women's clothing store.\n* [[John David Carson]] as Mark Roth, a businessman in Edward's office.\n* [[Judith Baldwin]] as Susan, one of Edward's ex-girlfriends whom he runs into at Phil's party at the beginning of the film.
