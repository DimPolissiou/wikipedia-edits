Ordusu}}), is the main branch of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] responsible for [[Army|land-based military]] operations. Official sources trace the army's foundation to [[Modu Chanyu]] of the [[Xiongnu Empire]] in 209 BC, but the modern history of the army began with its formation after the [[collapse of the Ottoman Empire]]. Significant events since the foundation of the army include combat in the [[Korean War]] and in the 1974 [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], and acting as a [[NATO]] bulwark along [[Cold War]] frontiers through 1992. The army holds the preeminent place within the armed forces. It is customary for the [[List of Chiefs of the Turkish General Staff|Chief]] of the [[General Staff of the Republic of Turkey]] to have been the [[List of Commanders of the Turkish Land Forces|Commander of the Turkish Land Forces]] prior to his appointment as Turkey's senior ranking officer. Alongside the other two armed services, the Turkish Army has frequently intervened in [[Politics of Turkey|Turkish politics]], which has now been regulated to an extent with the reform of the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council]].

Ordusu}}), is the main branch of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] responsible for [[Army|land-based military]] operations. Official sources trace the army's foundation to [[Modu Chanyu]] of the [[Xiongnu Empire]] in 209 BC, but the modern history of the army began with its formation after the [[collapse of the Ottoman Empire]]. Significant events since the foundation of the army include combat in the [[Korean War]] and in the 1974 [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]], and acting as a [[NATO]] bulwark along [[Cold War]] frontiers through 1992. The army holds the preeminent place within the armed forces. It is customary for the [[List of Chiefs of the Turkish General Staff|Chief]] of the [[General Staff of the Republic of Turkey]] to have been the [[List of Commanders of the Turkish Land Forces|Commander of the Turkish Land Forces]] prior to his appointment as Turkey's senior ranking officer. Alongside the other two armed services, the Turkish Army has frequently intervened in [[Politics of Turkey|Turkish politics]], which has now been regulated to an extent with the reform of the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council]]. The current commander of the Turkish Land Forces is General Ya\u015far G\u00fcler.<ref>[http://www.kkk.tsk.tr/en/Komutan/KomutanOzgecmis.aspx Autobiography of General Ya\u015far G\u00dcLER] in the official website of the Turkish Land Forces. {{in lang|tr}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2015, reports suggested the Turkish Army (along with the rest of the Armed Forces) saw their personnel strengths increase to similar levels of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]].

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings. The [[Radiata]], animals with radial symmetry, formed one of the four branches of [[Georges Cuvier]]'s classification of the [[animal]] [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=McBirney |first1=Alexander |title=Georges Cuvier.

Typically, this involves repeating a body part 4, 5, 6 or 8 times around the axis - referred to as tetramerism, pentamerism, hexamerism and octomerism, respectively. Such organisms exhibits no left or right sides but do have a top and a bottom surface, or a front and a back.\n\nGeorge Cuvier classified animals with radial symmetry in the taxon Radiata (''Zoophytes''),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Waggoner |first1=Ben M. |title=Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/cuvier.html |publisher=UCMP Berkeley |accessdate=8 March 2018 |quote=Cuvier's insistence on the functional integration of organisms led him to classify animals into four \"branches,\" or embranchements: Vertebrata, Articulata (arthropods and segmented worms), Mollusca (which at the time meant all other soft, bilaterally symmetrical invertebrates), and Radiata (cnidarians and echinoderms).}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cuvier |first1=Georges |author1link=Georges Cuvier |last2=Griffith |first2=Edward |last3=Pidgeon |first3=Edward |title=The Mollusca and Radiata: Arranged by the Baron Cuvier, with Supplementary Additions to Each Order |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mskQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA435 |year=1834 |publisher=Whittaker and Company |pages=435\u2013}}</ref> which is now generally accepted to be an assemblage of different animal phyla that do not share a single common ancestor (a [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]] group).<ref>{{cite book |last=Hadzi |first=J. |title=The Evolution of the Metazoa |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionofmetaz00hadz |year=1963 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0080100791 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/evolutionofmetaz00hadz/page/56 56\u201357]}}</ref> Most radially symmetric animals are symmetrical about an axis extending from the center of the oral surface, which contains the mouth[[Talk:Ancient Greek medicine|,]] to the center of the opposite, {{linktext|aboral}}, end.

This is immediately obvious when looking at the jellyfish due to the presence of four [[gonads]], visible through its [[transparency and translucency|translucent]] body. This radial symmetry is [[ecology | ecologically]] important in allowing the jellyfish to detect and respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (mainly food and danger) from all directions.\n\n[[File:Sterappel dwarsdrsn.jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|Apple cut horizontally showing that pentamerism also occurs in fruit]]\n\n[[Flowering plant]]s show five-fold symmetry, or pentamerism, in many of their flowers and fruits. This is easily seen through the arrangement of five [[carpel]]s (seed pockets) in an [[apple]] when cut [[transverse plane|transversely]]. Among animals, only the echinoderms such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth. Being bilaterian animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.<ref>Stewart, 2001. pp 64-65.</ref>\n\n{{vanchor|Hexamerism}} is found in the [[coral]]s and [[sea anemones]] (class [[Anthozoa]]) that are divided into two groups based on their symmetry. The most common corals in the subclass [[Hexacorallia]] have a hexameric body plan; their [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s have six-fold internal symmetry and a number of [[tentacle]]s that is a multiple of six.\n\n{{vanchor|Octamerism}} is found in corals of the subclass [[Octocorallia]]. These have polyps with eight tentacles and octameric radial symmetry. The [[octopus]], however, has bilateral symmetry, despite its eight arms.\n\n== Icosahedral symmetry ==\n[[File:Gastroenteritis viruses.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|[[Gastroenteritis]] viruses have icosahedral symmetry]]\nIcosahedral symmetry occurs in an organism which contains 60 subunits generated by 20 faces, each an [[equilateral triangle]], and 12 corners. Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of radial symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural proteins (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]]. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in factors of 60. For example, the T=3 ''[[Tomato bushy stunt virus]]'' has 60x3 protein subunits (180 copies of the same structural protein).<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Alan J Cann|title=Virus Structure|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0000439.pub2 |year=2015 |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470015902.a0000439.pub2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url= | title=Symmetry in virus architecture |author1=Horne, R.

This means that spherical symmetry occurs in an organism if it is able to be cut into two identical halves through any cut that runs through the organism's center. True spherical symmetry is not found in animal body plans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> Organisms which show approximate spherical symmetry include the freshwater green alga ''[[Volvox]]''.<ref name=IAS>{{cite web | url=http://www.iaszoology.com/symmetry/ | title=Symmetry | publisher=IAS | accessdate=14 June 2014 | author=Chandra, Girish}}</ref>\n\nBacteria are often referred to as having a 'spherical' shape. Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells. In reality, this is a severe over-simplification as bacterial cells can be curved, bent, flattened, oblong spheriods and many more shapes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=K. D. |title=The Selective Value of Bacterial Shape |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |date=2006 |volume=70 |pages=660\u2013703 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00001-06}}</ref> Due to the huge number of bacteria considered to be cocci (coccus if a single cell), it is unlikely that all of these show true spherical symmetry. It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

All bilaterians have some asymmetrical features, for example the human heart and liver are positioned asymmetrically despite the body having external bilateral symmetry.<ref>{{cite web |last=Valentine |first=James W. |title=Bilateria |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d802620 |publisher=AccessScience |access-date=29 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118213208/http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&referURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accessscience.com%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fid%3D802620 |archive-date=18 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nThe bilateral symmetry of bilaterians is a complex trait which develops due to the [[gene expression|expression]] of many [[genes]]. The bilateria have two axes of [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarity]]. The first is an [[anterior]]-[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (AP) axis which can be visualised as an imaginary axis running from the head or mouth to the tail or other end of an organism. The second is the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]]-[[ventral]] (DV) axis which runs [[perpendicular]] to the AP axis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R |title=Evolution & Development |journal=IJDB |date=2003 |volume=47 |pages=465-705 |url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper/14756328}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> During development the AP axis is always specified before the DV axis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Freeman |first1=Gary |title=The rise of bilaterians |journal=Historical Biology |date=2009 |volume=21 |pages=99\u2013114 |doi=10.1080/08912960903295843}}</ref>\n\nThe AP axis is essential in defining the polarity of bilateria and allowing the development of a front and back to give the organism direction. The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there. This is also the site where a mouth develops since it is the first part of the body to encounter food. Therefore, a distinct head, with sense organs connected to a central nervous system, tends to develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R. |title=Did internal transport, rather than directed locomotion, favor the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals? |journal=BioEssays |date=2005 |volume=27 |pages=1174\u20131180 |doi=10.1002/bies.20299}}</ref> This pattern of development (with a distinct head and tail) is called [[cephalization]]. It is also argued that the development of an AP axis is important in locomotion - bilateral symmetry gives the body an intrinsic direction and allows streamlining to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]].\n\nIn addition to animals, the flowers of some plants also show bilateral symmetry.

This involves changes in the [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of symmetry-related genes throughout time. \n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in plants ===\nEarly flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref> For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] ([[sponge]]s) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures. Whereas, the right side does not express ''PITX2'' and consequently develops right side structures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Raya |first1=Angel |last2=Izpisua Belmonte |first2=Juan Carlos |title=Unveiling the establishment of left\u2013right asymmetry in the chick embryo |journal=Mechanisms of Development |date=2004 |volume=121 |pages=1043\u20131054 |doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.05.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=J. |last2=Feistel |first2=K. |last3=Viebahn |first3=C. |last4=Blum |first4=M. |last5=Tabin |first5=C.

For example the direction of helical growth in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'', the most commonly studied model plant, shows left-handedness. Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role. In the same way as animals, symmetry breaking in plants can occur at a molecular (genes/proteins), subcellular, cellular, tissue and organ level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mu\u00f1oz-Nortes |first1=Tamara |last2=Wilson-S\u00e1nchez |first2=David |last3=Candela |first3=H\u00e9ctor |last4=Micol |first4=Jos\u00e9 Luis |title=Symmetry, asymmetry, and the cell cycle in plants: known knowns and some known unknowns |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |date=2014 |volume=65 |pages=2645\u20132655 |doi=10.1093/jxb/ert476}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n===Biological structures===\n* [[Standard anatomical position]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of motion]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of muscle]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of bone]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy]]\n* [[Glossary of botanical terms]] \n* [[Glossary of plant morphology]] \n* [[Glossary of leaf morphology]]\n* [[Glossary of entomology terms]]\n* [[Plant morphology]]\n\n===Terms of orientation===\n* [[Handedness]]\n* [[Laterality]]\n* [[Proper right and proper left]]\n* [[Reflection symmetry]]\n* [[Sinistral and dextral]]\n* [[Direction (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|28em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [[Philip Ball|Ball, Philip]] (2009).

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings.

Among animals, only the echinoderms such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth.

Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of radial symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]].

This means that spherical symmetry occurs in an organism if it is able to be cut into two identical halves through any cut that runs through the organism's center. True spherical symmetry is not found in animal body plans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> Organisms which show approximate spherical symmetry include the freshwater green alga ''[[Volvox]]''.<ref name=IAS>{{cite web | url=http://www.iaszoology.com/symmetry/ | title=Symmetry | publisher=IAS | accessdate=14 June 2014 | author=Chandra, Girish}}</ref>\n\nBacteria are often referred to as having a 'spherical' shape. Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells. In reality, this is a severe over-simplification as bacterial cells can be curved, bent, flattened, oblong spheriods and many more shapes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=K. D. |title=The Selective Value of Bacterial Shape |journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews |date=2006 |volume=70 |pages=660\u2013703 |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00001-06}}</ref> Due to the huge number of bacteria considered to be cocci (coccus if a single cell), it is unlikely that all of these show true spherical symmetry. It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

All bilaterians have some asymmetrical features, for example the human heart and liver are positioned asymmetrically despite the body having external bilateral symmetry.<ref>{{cite web |last=Valentine |first=James W. |title=Bilateria |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d802620 |publisher=AccessScience |access-date=29 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118213208/http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&referURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accessscience.com%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fid%3D802620 |archive-date=18 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n\nThe bilateral symmetry of bilaterians is a complex trait which develops due to the [[gene expression|expression]] of many [[genes]]. The bilateria have two axes of [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarity]]. The first is an [[anterior]]-[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (AP) axis which can be visualised as an imaginary axis running from the head or mouth to the tail or other end of an organism. The second is the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]]-[[ventral]] (DV) axis which runs [[perpendicular]] to the AP axis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R |title=Evolution & Development |journal=IJDB |date=2003 |volume=47 |pages=465-705 |url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper/14756328}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> During development the AP axis is always specified before the DV axis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Freeman |first1=Gary |title=The rise of bilaterians |journal=Historical Biology |date=2009 |volume=21 |pages=99\u2013114 |doi=10.1080/08912960903295843}}</ref>\n\nThe AP axis is essential in defining the polarity of bilateria and allowing the development of a front and back to give the organism direction. The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there. This is also the site where a mouth develops since it is the first part of the body to encounter food. Therefore, a distinct head, with sense organs connected to a central nervous system, tends to develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R. |title=Did internal transport, rather than directed locomotion, favor the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals? |journal=BioEssays |date=2005 |volume=27 |pages=1174\u20131180 |doi=10.1002/bies.20299}}</ref> This pattern of development (with a distinct head and tail) is called [[cephalization]]. It is also argued that the development of an AP axis is important in locomotion - bilateral symmetry gives the body an intrinsic direction and allows streamlining to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]].\n\nIn addition to animals, the flowers of some plants also show bilateral symmetry. Such plants are referred to as [[zygomorphic]] and include the orchid (''[[Orchidaceae]]'') and pea (''[[Fabaceae]]'') families, and most of the figwort family (''[[Scrophulariaceae]]'').<ref>{{cite web | url=http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/301Manhart/Dicots/Asteridae/Scr/Scr.html | title=SCROPHULARIACEAE - Figwort or Snapdragon Family | publisher=Texas A&M University Bioinformatics Working Group | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/sci/A0847482.html Symmetry, biological], from ''[[The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'' (2007).</ref> The leaves of plants also commonly show approximate bilateral symmetry.\n\n==Biradial symmetry==\nBiradial symmetry is found in organisms which show morphological features (internal or external) of both bilateral and radial symmetry. Unlike radially symmetrical organisms which can be cut divided equally along many planes, biradial organisms can only be cut equally along two planes. This could represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from a radially symmetric ancestor.<ref name=MartindaleHenry>{{cite journal | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/4/672.full.pdf | title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality1 |author1=Martindale, Mark Q. |author2=Henry, Jonathan Q. | journal=American Zoology | year=1998 | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=672\u2013684 | doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nThe animal group with the most obvious biradial symmetry is the [[ctenophores]].

Biradial symmetry, especially when considering both internal and external features, is more common than originally accounted for.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Watanabe |first1=Hiroshi |last2=Schmidt |first2=Heiko A. |last3=Kuhn |first3=Anne |last4=H\u00f6ger |first4=Stefanie K. |last5=Kocag\u00f6z |first5=Yigit |last6=Laumann-Lipp |first6=Nico |last7=\u00d6zbek |first7=Suat |last8=Holstein |first8=Thomas W. |title=Nodal signalling determines biradial asymmetry in Hydra |journal=Nature |date=24 August 2014 |volume=515 |issue=7525 |pages=112\u2013115 |doi=10.1038/nature13666}}</ref>\n\n== Evolution of symmetry == \nLike all the traits of organisms, symmetry (or indeed asymmetry) evolves due to an advantage to the organism - a process of [[natural selection]]. This involves changes in the [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of symmetry-related genes throughout time. \n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in plants ===\nEarly flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref>. For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape. It is believed that the evolution of specialized pollinators may play a part in the transition of radially symmetrical flowers to bilaterally symmetrical flowers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hileman |first1=Lena C |last2=Cubas |first2=Pilar |title=An expanded evolutionary role for flower symmetry genes |journal=Journal of Biology |date=2009 |volume=8 |pages=90 |doi=10.1186/jbiol193}}</ref>\n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in animals ===\nSymmetry is often selected for in the evolution of animals. This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] ([[sponge]]s) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures. Whereas, the right side does not express ''PITX2'' and consequently develops right side structures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Raya |first1=Angel |last2=Izpisua Belmonte |first2=Juan Carlos |title=Unveiling the establishment of left\u2013right asymmetry in the chick embryo |journal=Mechanisms of Development |date=2004 |volume=121 |pages=1043\u20131054 |doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.05.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=J. |last2=Feistel |first2=K. |last3=Viebahn |first3=C. |last4=Blum |first4=M. |last5=Tabin |first5=C.

For example the direction of helical growth in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'', the most commonly studied model plant, shows left-handedness. Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role. In the same way as animals, symmetry breaking in plants can occur at a molecular (genes/proteins), subcellular, cellular, tissue and organ level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mu\u00f1oz-Nortes |first1=Tamara |last2=Wilson-S\u00e1nchez |first2=David |last3=Candela |first3=H\u00e9ctor |last4=Micol |first4=Jos\u00e9 Luis |title=Symmetry, asymmetry, and the cell cycle in plants: known knowns and some known unknowns |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |date=2014 |volume=65 |pages=2645\u20132655 |doi=10.1093/jxb/ert476}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n===Biological structures===\n* [[Standard anatomical position]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of motion]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of muscle]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of bone]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy]]\n* [[Glossary of botanical terms]] \n* [[Glossary of plant morphology]] \n* [[Glossary of leaf morphology]]\n* [[Glossary of entomology terms]]\n* [[Plant morphology]]\n\n===Terms of orientation===\n* [[Handedness]]\n* [[Laterality]]\n* [[Proper right and proper left]]\n* [[Reflection symmetry]]\n* [[Sinistral and dextral]]\n* [[Direction (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|28em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [[Philip Ball|Ball, Philip]] (2009).
