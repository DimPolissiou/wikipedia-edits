All Ras protein family members belong to a class of protein called [[small GTPase]], and are involved in transmitting signals within cells ([[cell (biology)|cellular]] [[signal transduction]]). Ras is the prototypical member of the [[Ras superfamily]] of proteins, which are all related in 3D structure and regulate diverse cell behaviours.\n\nWhen Ras is 'switched on' by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately turn on genes involved in [[cell growth]], [[differentiation (cellular)|differentiation]] and [[apoptosis|survival]]. Mutations in ''ras'' genes can lead to the production of permanently activated Ras proteins. As a result, this can cause unintended and overactive signaling inside the cell, even in the absence of incoming signals.\n\nBecause these signals result in cell growth and division, overactive Ras signaling can ultimately lead to [[cancer]].<ref name=\"pmid10394594\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodsell DS | title = The molecular perspective: the ras oncogene | journal = The Oncologist | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 263\u20134 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10394594 | doi =  | url = http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/cgi/content/full/4/3/263 }}</ref> The 3 Ras genes in humans ([[HRAS|HRas]], [[KRas]], and [[Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog|NRas]]) are the most common [[oncogene]]s in human [[cancer]]; mutations that permanently activate Ras are found in 20% to 25% of all human tumors and up to 90% in certain types of cancer (e.g., [[pancreatic cancer]]).<ref name=\"pmid12509763\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Downward J | title = Targeting RAS signalling pathways in cancer therapy | journal = Nature Reviews.

Specifically, it is a single-subunit [[small GTPase]], which is related in structure to the G<sub>\u03b1</sub> subunit of [[heterotrimeric G proteins]] (large GTPases). G proteins function as binary signaling switches with \"on\" and \"off\" states. In the \"off\" state it is bound to the nucleotide [[guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP), while in the \"on\" state, Ras is bound to [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP), which has an extra [[phosphate]] group as compared to GDP. This extra phosphate holds the two switch regions in a \"loaded-spring\" configuration (specifically the Thr-35 and Gly-60). When released, the switch regions relax which causes a [[conformational change]] into the inactive state. Hence, activation and deactivation of Ras and other small G proteins are controlled by cycling between the active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms.\n\nThe process of exchanging the bound nucleotide is facilitated by [[guanine nucleotide exchange factor]]s (GEFs) and [[GTPase activating proteins]] (GAPs). As per its classification, Ras has an intrinsic [[GTPase]] activity, which means that the protein on its own will [[hydrolyze]] a bound GTP molecule into GDP. However this process is too slow for efficient function, and hence the GAP for Ras, RasGAP, may bind to and stabilize the catalytic machinery of Ras, supplying additional catalytic residues (\"arginine finger\") such that a water molecule is optimally positioned for [[nucleophilic]] attack on the gamma-phosphate of GTP. An inorganic phosphate is released and the Ras molecule is now bound to a GDP. Since the GDP-bound form is \"off\" or \"inactive\" for signaling, GTPase Activating Protein ''inactivates'' Ras by activating its GTPase activity. Thus, GAPs accelerate Ras ''inactivation''.\n\nGEFs catalyze a \"push and pull\" reaction which releases GDP from Ras. They insert close to the P-loop and magnesium [[cation]] binding site and inhibit the interaction of these with the gamma phosphate [[anion]]. Acidic (negative) residues in switch II \"pull\" a lysine in the P-loop away from the GDP which \"pushes\" switch I away from the guanine. The contacts holding GDP in place are broken and it is released into the cytoplasm. Because intracellular GTP is abundant relative to GDP (approximately 10 fold more)<ref name=\"Lodish\"/> GTP predominantly re-enters the nucleotide binding pocket of Ras and reloads the spring. Thus GEFs facilitate Ras ''activation''.<ref name=\"pmid11701921\" /> Well known GEFs include [[Son of Sevenless]] (Sos) and [[cdc25]] which include the [[RasGEF domain]].\n\nThe balance between GEF and GAP activity determines the guanine nucleotide status of Ras, thereby regulating Ras activity.\n\nIn the GTP-bound conformation, Ras has a high affinity for numerous [[Effector (biology)|effectors]] which allow it to carry out its functions. These include [[PI3K]]. Other small GTPases may bind adaptors such as [[arfaptin]] or second messenger systems such as [[adenylyl cyclase]]. The Ras binding domain is found in many effectors and invariably binds to one of the switch regions, because these change conformation between the active and inactive forms. However, they may also bind to the rest of the protein surface.\n\nOther proteins exist that may change the activity of Ras family proteins. One example is GDI (GDP Disassociation Inhibitor). These function by slowing the exchange of GDP for GTP,  thus prolonging the inactive state of Ras family members. Other proteins that augment this cycle may exist.\n\n=== Membrane attachment ===\n\nRas is attached to the [[cell membrane]] owing to its [[prenylation]] and [[palmitoylation]] ([[HRAS]] and [[Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog|NRAS]]) or the combination of [[prenylation]] and a polybasic sequence adjacent to the prenylation site ([[KRAS]]). The C-terminal [[CaaX box]] of Ras first gets farnesylated at its Cys residue in the cytosol, allowing Ras to loosely insert into the membrane of the [[endoplasmatic reticulum]] and other cellular membranes. The Tripeptide (aaX) is then cleaved from the C-terminus by a specific prenyl-protein specific endoprotease and the new C-terminus is methylated by a [[methyltransferase]]. KRas processing is completed at this stage.  Dynamic electrostatic interactions between its positively charged basic sequence with negative charges at the inner leaflet of the [[plasma membrane]] account for its predominant localization at the cell surface at steady-state.

Specifically, it is a single-subunit [[small GTPase]], which is related in structure to the G<sub>\u03b1</sub> subunit of [[heterotrimeric G proteins]] (large GTPases). G proteins function as binary signaling switches with \"on\" and \"off\" states. In the \"off\" state it is bound to the nucleotide [[guanosine diphosphate]] (GDP), while in the \"on\" state, Ras is bound to [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP), which has an extra [[phosphate]] group as compared to GDP. This extra phosphate holds the two switch regions in a \"loaded-spring\" configuration (specifically the Thr-35 and Gly-60). When released, the switch regions relax which causes a [[conformational change]] into the inactive state. Hence, activation and deactivation of Ras and other small G proteins are controlled by cycling between the active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms.\n\nThe process of exchanging the bound nucleotide is facilitated by [[guanine nucleotide exchange factor]]s (GEFs) and [[GTPase activating proteins]] (GAPs). As per its classification, Ras has an intrinsic [[GTPase]] activity, which means that the protein on its own will [[hydrolyze]] a bound GTP molecule into GDP. However this process is too slow for efficient function, and hence the GAP for Ras, RasGAP, may bind to and stabilize the catalytic machinery of Ras, supplying additional catalytic residues (\"arginine finger\") such that a water molecule is optimally positioned for [[nucleophilic]] attack on the gamma-phosphate of GTP. An inorganic phosphate is released and the Ras molecule is now bound to a GDP. Since the GDP-bound form is \"off\" or \"inactive\" for signaling, GTPase Activating Protein ''inactivates'' Ras by activating its GTPase activity. Thus, GAPs accelerate Ras ''inactivation''.\n\nGEFs catalyze a \"push and pull\" reaction which releases GDP from Ras. They insert close to the P-loop and magnesium [[cation]] binding site and inhibit the interaction of these with the gamma phosphate [[anion]]. Acidic (negative) residues in switch II \"pull\" a lysine in the P-loop away from the GDP which \"pushes\" switch I away from the guanine. The contacts holding GDP in place are broken and it is released into the cytoplasm. Because intracellular GTP is abundant relative to GDP (approximately 10 fold more)<ref name=\"Lodish\"/> GTP predominantly re-enters the nucleotide binding pocket of Ras and reloads the spring. Thus GEFs facilitate Ras ''activation''.<ref name=\"pmid11701921\" /> Well known GEFs include [[Son of Sevenless]] (Sos) and [[cdc25]] which include the [[RasGEF domain]].\n\nThe balance between GEF and GAP activity determines the guanine nucleotide status of Ras, thereby regulating Ras activity.\n\nIn the GTP-bound conformation, Ras has a high affinity for numerous [[Effector (biology)|effectors]] which allow it to carry out its functions. These include [[PI3K]]. Other small GTPases may bind adaptors such as [[arfaptin]] or second messenger systems such as [[adenylyl cyclase]]. The Ras binding domain is found in many effectors and invariably binds to one of the switch regions, because these change conformation between the active and inactive forms. However, they may also bind to the rest of the protein surface.\n\nOther proteins exist that may change the activity of Ras family proteins. One example is GDI (GDP Disassociation Inhibitor). These function by slowing the exchange of GDP for GTP,  thus prolonging the inactive state of Ras family members. Other proteins that augment this cycle may exist.\n\n=== Membrane attachment ===\n\nRas is attached to the [[cell membrane]] owing to its [[prenylation]] and [[palmitoylation]] ([[HRAS]] and [[Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog|NRAS]]) or the combination of [[prenylation]] and a polybasic sequence adjacent to the prenylation site ([[KRAS]]). The C-terminal [[CaaX box]] of Ras first gets farnesylated at its Cys residue in the cytosol, allowing Ras to loosely insert into the membrane of the [[endoplasmatic reticulum]] and other cellular membranes. The Tripeptide (aaX) is then cleaved from the C-terminus by a specific prenyl-protein specific endoprotease and the new C-terminus is methylated by a [[methyltransferase]]. KRas processing is completed at this stage.  Dynamic electrostatic interactions between its positively charged basic sequence with negative charges at the inner leaflet of the [[plasma membrane]] account for its predominant localization at the cell surface at steady-state. [[Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog|NRAS]] and [[HRAS]] are further processed on the surface of the [[Golgi apparatus]] by [[palmitoylation]] of one or two Cys residues, respectively, adjacent to the [[CaaX box]]. The proteins thereby become stably membrane anchored (lipid-rafts) and are transported to the [[plasma membrane]] on [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] of the [[secretory pathway]]. Depalmitoylation by [[acyl-protein thioesterase]]s eventually releases the proteins from the membrane, allowing them to enter another cycle of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation.<ref name=\"Rocks\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rocks O, Peyker A, Bastiaens PI | title = Spatio-temporal segregation of Ras signals: one ship, three anchors, many harbors | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 351\u20137 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16781855 | doi = 10.1016/j.ceb.2006.06.007 }}</ref> This cycle is believed to prevent the leakage of [[Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog|NRAS]] and [[HRAS]] to other membranes over time and to maintain their steady-state localization along the [[Golgi apparatus]], [[secretory pathway]], [[plasma membrane]] and inter-linked [[endocytosis]] pathway.\n\n==Members==\nThe clinically most notable members of the Ras subfamily are [[HRAS]], [[KRAS]] and [[Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog|NRAS]], mainly for being implicated in many types of cancer.<ref name=bos/>\n\nHowever, there are many other members of this subfamily as well:<ref name=\"pmid15731001\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wennerberg K, Rossman KL, Der CJ | title = The Ras superfamily at a glance | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 118 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 843\u20136 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15731001 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.01660 }}</ref>\n[[DIRAS1]]; [[DIRAS2]]; [[DIRAS3]]; [[E-Ras|ERAS]]; [[GEM (gene)|GEM]]; [[MRAS]]; [[NKIRAS1]]; [[NKIRAS2]]; [[Neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog|NRAS]]; [[RALA]]; [[RALB]]; [[RAP1A]]; [[RAP1B]]; [[RAP2A]]; [[RAP2B]]; [[RAP2C]]; [[RASD1]]; [[RASD2]]; [[RASL10A]]; [[RASL10B]]; [[RASL11A]]; [[RASL11B]]; [[RASL12]]; [[REM1]]; [[REM2]]; [[RERG]]; [[RERGL]]; [[RRAD]]; [[RRAS]]; [[RRAS2]]\n\n== Ras in cancer ==\n\nMutations in the Ras family of [[proto-oncogene]]s (comprising H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras) are very common, being found in 20% to 30% of all human tumors.<ref name=bos>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bos JL | title = ras oncogenes in human cancer: a review | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 49 | issue = 17 | pages = 4682\u20139 | date = September 1989 | pmid = 2547513 }}</ref> It is reasonable to speculate that a pharmacological approach that curtails Ras activity may represent a possible method to inhibit certain cancer types.

{"title_page": "Thymidine kinase in clinical chemistry", "text_new": "'''Thymidine kinase''' is an [[enzyme]], a [[phosphotransferase]] (a [[kinase]]): 2'-deoxythymidine kinase, ATP-thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21 <ref name=\"Kit_1985\"/><ref name=\"Wintersberger_1997\"/>  that catalyzes the reaction:\n\nThd + ATP \u2192 TMP + ADP\n\nwhere Thd is (deoxy)thymidine, ATP is adenosine 5\u2019-triphosphate, TMP is (deoxy)thymidine 5\u2019-phosphate and ADP is adenosine 5\u2019-diphosphate. In clinical chemistry it has been suggested as a proliferation marker for prognosis, verification of diagnosis, control of treatment (particularly as a companion diagnostic) and follow-up of malignant disease. It is used mainly in relation to hematological malignancies but the developments of more sensitive assays have stimulated investigations for its use in relation to solid tumors.\n\n==History==\nThe incorporation of thymidine in DNA was demonstrated around 1950.<ref name=\"Reichard_1951\"/> Somewhat later, it was shown that this incorporation was preceded by phosphorylation<ref name=\"Bessman_1956\"/> and around 1960, the enzyme responsible was purified and characterized.\n<ref name=\"Bollum_1958\"/><ref name=\"Weissman_1960\"/> The potential use as a tumor marker was suggested by Gronowitz et al.<ref name=\"Gronowitz_1983\"/>\n\n==Biochemistry==\nMammals have two isoenzymes that are chemically very different, Thymidine Kinase 1 (TK1) and Thymidine Kinase 2 (TK2). The former was first found in fetal tissue, the second was found to be more abundant in adult tissue, and so initially they were termed fetal and adult thymidine kinases. Soon it was shown that TK1 is present in the cytoplasm only in anticipation of cell division (cell cycle-dependent)<ref name=\"Blasco_1990\"/><ref name=\"Littlefield_1966\"/> whereas the presence of TK2, which is located in the mitochondria, is cell cycle-independent.<ref name=\"Berk_1973\"/><ref name=\"Berk_1973b\"/>\nTK1 is synthesized by the cell during the S phase of cell division. After cell division is completed, TK1 is degraded intracellularly, so that it does not pass into body fluids after normal cell division.<ref name=\"Zhu_2006\"/> The TK enzyme suggested as a [[tumor marker]] is the [[cytosol]]ic cell cycle dependent TK1. It is present during cell division in much higher concentrations than TK2 and it is released in quantities that completely dominate the thymidine kinase activity in blood and other body fluids.\n\nIn addition to cellular TKs, virus specific thymidine kinases have been identified in Herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus.<ref name=\"Kit_1963\"/><ref name=\"McKnight_1980\"/><ref name=\"Halliburton_1980\"/><ref name=\"McDougall_1980\"/><ref name=\"Kit_1983\"/><ref name=\"Sawyer_1986\"/><ref name=\"Littler_1986\"/> They differ biochemically from thymidine kinase from mammalian cells and are inhibited by specific inhibitors that do not influence the activity of mammalian thymidine kinases. Determination of viral thymidine kinase has been suggested for confirmation of diagnosis and for control of treatment of viral infections.\n\n[[Image:2'-Desoxythymidin.svg|120px]] + ATP ---> [[Image:2'-Desoxythymidinmonophosphat.svg|200px]] + ADP\n\nThymidine reacts with ATP to give thymidine monophosphate and ADP.\n\n==Physiological context==\n[[Thymidine monophosphate]], the product of the reaction catalyzed by thymidine kinase, is in turn [[phosphorylated]] to [[thymidine diphosphate]] by the enzyme [[thymidylate kinase]] and further to [[thymidine triphosphate]] by the enzyme [[nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]. The triphosphate is included in a [[DNA]] molecule, a reaction catalyzed by a [[DNA polymerase]] and a [[complementary DNA]] molecule (or an [[RNA]] molecule in the case of [[reverse transcriptase]], an enzyme present in [[retrovirus]]). Thymidine monophosphate is produced by the cell in two different reactions - either by [[phosphorylation]] of [[thymidine]] as described above or by [[methylation]] of [[deoxyuridine monophosphate]], a product of other metabolic pathways unrelated to thymidine, by the enzyme [[thymidylate synthase]] (De novo synthesis). This second route is used by the cell under normal conditions, and it is sufficient to supply thymidine monophosphate for DNA repair. When a cell prepares to divide, a complete new set-up of DNA is required, and the requirement for building blocks, including thymidine triphosphate, increases. Cells prepare for cell division by making some of the enzymes required during the division. They are not normally present in the cells and are down-regulated and degraded afterwards. Such enzymes are called [[salvage enzymes]]. Thymidine kinase 1 is such a salvage enzyme, whereas thymidine kinase 2 is not cell cycle-dependent.<ref name=\"Schlosser_1981\"/><ref name=\"Coppock_1987\"/><ref name=\"Stewart_1987\"/><ref name=\"Piper_1980\"/><ref name=\"Pelka-Fleischer_1987\"/><ref name=\"Sherley_1988\"/><ref name=\"Gross_1987\"/><ref name=\"Kauffman_1991\"/><ref name=\"Sutterluety_1996\"/>\n\n==Thymidine kinase in serum==\n\n===Background===\nThymidine kinase is a salvage enzyme that is only present in anticipation of cell division. The enzyme is not set free from cells undergoing normal division where the cells have a special mechanism to degrade the proteins no longer needed after cell division is completed.<ref name=\"Littlefield_1966\"/>  In normal subjects, the amount of thymidine kinase in serum or plasma is, therefore, very low. Tumor cells release enzyme to the circulation, probably in connection with the disruption of dead or dying tumor cells. The thymidine kinase level in serum, therefore, serves as a measure of malignant proliferation and, indirectly, as a measure of the aggressivity of the tumor. The form of enzyme present in the circulation does not correspond to the protein as encoded by the gene: the gene corresponds to a protein with molecular weight around 25 kD. It is a dimer with a molecular weight of around 50 kD, if activated by ATP a tetramer with molecular weight around 100 kD.<ref name=\"Welin_2004\"/> The main fraction of the active enzyme in the circulation has a molecular weight of 730 kD and is probably bound in a complex to other proteins.<ref name=\"Karlstrom_1990\"/>\n\n===Measurement===\nThymidine kinase 1 (TK1) levels in [[Serum (blood)|serum]] or [[Blood plasma|plasma]] may be measured based on their enzymatic activity or in terms of mass using immunoassays. In enzyme activity assays, this is done by incubation of a serum sample with a substrate analogue. The oldest commercially available technique uses iodo-deoxyuridine ([[idoxuridine]]) wherein a methyl group in thymidine has been replaced with radioactive iodine.<ref name=\"Gronowitz_1980\"/><ref name=\"Gronowitz_1984\"/><ref name=\"Gronowitz_1983b\"/> This substrate is well accepted by the enzyme. The monophosphate of iodo deoxyuridine is adsorbed on aluminum oxide that is suspended in the incubation medium. After decantation and washing the radioactivity of the aluminum oxide gives a measure of the amount of thymidine kinase in the sample. Kits using this principle are commercially available from the companies Immunotech/Beckman and DiaSorin.\n\n[[File: Idoxuridine - Idoxuridin.svg|thumb|Idoxuridine]]\n\nA non-radioactive assay method has been developed by the company Dia-Sorin. In this technique 3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine ([[Zidovudine]], AZT) is first phosphorylated to AZT 5'-monophosphate (AZTMP) by the TK1 in the sample. AZTMP is measured in an [[immunoassay]] with anti-AZTMP antibodies and AZTMP-labeled [[peroxidase]]. The assay runs in a closed system on the [[Laboratory robotics|laboratory robot]] from DiaSorin.<ref name=\"Euler_2006\"/><ref name=\"Ohrvik_2004\"/> The DiviTum assay from Biovica International uses another thymidine analogue, [[bromodeoxyuridine]], as substrate to the enzyme. The product of the reaction is further phosphorylated to tri-phosphate and incorporated in DNA-strings of polythymidine. The polythymidine binds to strings of polyadenine coupled to the bottom of the wells in microtiter plates. There it is detected with an [[ELISA]] technique: The wells are filled with a solution of a [[monoclonal antibody]] to bromo-deoxyuridine. The monoclonal antibody has been bound (conjugated) to the enzyme [[alkaline phosphatase]]. After the unbound antibody-conjugate has been washed away, a solution of a substrate to the alkaline phosphatase, [[para-nitrophenylphosphate]], is added. The product of the reaction, [[para-nitrophenol]], is yellow at alkaline pH and can be measured by [[spectrophotometry|photometry]].<ref name=\"Gronowitz2006\"/> This method has been evaluated against the previous radioactive technique. It is considerably more sensitive than the previous enzymatic methods and may be, therefore, more suitable for use with solid tumors where lower elevations of TK1 are found in body fluids.

A continuous and homogeneous fluorescent method based on quenching technology has recently been published. This technique utilizes natural thymidine as substrate and can also determine deoxycytidine kinase simultaneously with TK1.<ref name=\"Stalhandske_2013\"/>\n\nImmunoassays enabling the direct determination of TK1 protein have now been developed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alegre |first1=MM |last2=Weyant |first2=MJ |last3=Bennett |first3=DT |last4=Yu |first4=JA |last5=Ramsden |first5=MK |last6=Elnaggar |first6=A |last7=Robison |first7=RA |last8=O'Neill |first8=KL |title=Serum detection of thymidine kinase 1 as a means of early detection of lung cancer. |journal=Anticancer Research |date=May 2014 |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=2145\u201351 |pmid=24778016}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=He |first1=Q |last2=Zhang |first2=P |last3=Zou |first3=L |last4=Li |first4=H |last5=Wang |first5=X |last6=Zhou |first6=S |last7=Fornander |first7=T |last8=Skog |first8=S |title=Concentration of thymidine kinase 1 in serum (S-TK1) is a more sensitive proliferation marker in human solid tumors than its activity. |journal=Oncology Reports |date=October 2005 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=1013\u20139 |pmid=16142366}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jagarlamudi |first1=KK |last2=Hansson |first2=LO |last3=Eriksson |first3=S |title=Breast and prostate cancer patients differ significantly in their serum Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) specific activities compared with those hematological malignancies and blood donors: implications of using serum TK1 as a biomarker. |journal=BMC Cancer |date=18 February 2015 |volume=15 |pages=66 |doi=10.1186/s12885-015-1073-8 |pmid=25881026|pmc=4336758 }}</ref> Immunoassays have advantages over enzymme activity methods in that they can measure TK1 isoforms that are enzymatically inactive plus that they are unaffected by serum TK1 inhibitors.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  The specific activity of serum TK1 differs between cancer types<ref name=\"Jaglarmundi_2015\" /> and using an immunoassay method may aid in comparing TK1 levels between subjects and malignancy types.

In brief, the sample is spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane where the proteins in the sample bind. After blocking, the membrane is incubated with a primary anti-TK1 antibody which binds to the TK1 on the membrane. After washing, a biotinylated second antibody directed against IgY antibodies is added followed by streptavidin labelled HRP and a chemiluminescent substrate. A microtiter ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies directed against the \u201c210\u201d epitope is available from AroCell. The AroCell TK 210 ELISA system uses a pre-treatment buffer to break up the high molecular weight TK1 complexes and expose the TK 210 epitope. The treated samples are added to a microtiter plate coated with anti TK 210 monoclonal antibodies. After incubating and washing, a second anti-TK 210 antibody labeled with biotin is added.

Its function was demonstrated using recombinant TK1. It is claimed to be fast and simple to perform.<ref name=\"Pagaduan_2015\"/>\n\n==Serum thymidine kinase 1 in different malignancies==\n\n===Hematologic malignancies===\nThe most dramatic increases of serum TK1 are seen in [[hematologic malignancies]]. The increases seen in both TK1 activity and concentration are greater in hematologic malignancies compared with solid tumors.<ref name=\"Jaglarmundi_2015\"/><ref name=\"Doi_1990\"/>\n\n====Non-Hodgkin lymphoma====\nThe main use of serum TK1 activity assays is in [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]. This disease has a wide range of aggressivity, from slow-growing indolent disease that hardly requires treatment to highly aggressive, rapidly growing forms that should be treated urgently. This is reflected in the values of serum TK1 activity, that range from close to the normal range for slow-growing tumors to very high levels for rapidly growing forms.<ref name=\"Gronowitz_1983\"/><ref name=\"Ellims_1981\"/><ref name=\"Hagberg_1984\"/><ref name=\"Hallek_1992\"/><ref name=\"Bogni_1994\"/><ref name=\"Rehn_1995\"/><ref name=\"Suki_1995\"/><ref name=\"Suzuki_2012\"/><ref name=\"Prochazka_2012\"/><ref name=\"Suzuki_2013\"/><ref name=\"Tsuji_2015\"/><ref name=\"Gatt_2015\"/>\n\n====Leukemias====\n[[Leukemia]]s normally do not normally present major diagnostic difficulties, as the microscopic analysis of the cells in blood usually provides unequivocal results.  TK1 assays, however, may give supplementary information about the aggressivity and the risk for progression.<ref name=\"Kallander_1984\"/><ref name=\"Kallander_1987\"/><ref name=\"Hallek_1996\"/><ref name=\"Rivkina_2011\"/><ref name=\"Bazargan_2012\"/><ref name=\"Pflug_2014\"/><ref name=\"Hagag_2015\"/><ref name=\"LopezMartinez_2015\"/>\n\n====Myeloma====\nAlso [[myelomas]] often constitute a diagnostic challenge. The malignant cells are often not available for microscopic analysis, and the prognosis is often uncertain. Therefore, information on the prognosis may be essential in the decision of the treatment. Several studies verify the close connection between prognosis and thymidine kinase activity in myelomas.<ref name=\"Bacovsky_2015\"/><ref name=\"Simonsson_1985\"/><ref name=\"Simonsson_1988\"/>\n\n====Myelodysplastic syndrome====\nA very interesting case is the [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]: Some rapidly change to acute leukemia, whereas others remain indolent for very long time. Identification of those tending to change to overt leukemia is important for the treatment. A relationship between the prognosis and the serum TK1 values has been demonstrated in myelodysplastic syndrome .<ref name=\"Musto_1995\"/><ref name=\"Aul_1996\"/>\n\n===Solid tumors===\nIncreased serum TK1 levels may be found in subjects with solid tumors. The increases in serum TK1 activity levels in subjects with solid tumors are not as large as they are for hematologic malignancies. The first methods for determination of serum TK1 activity had a limited sensitivity. In the case of the methods employing radioactivity, one reason was that the quantity of radioactivity allowed by law in normal radioimmunoassay laboratories is strctly limited. The experimental method first developed by Gronowitz et al.<ref name=\"Gronowitz_1980\" /> used quantities of radioisotope much higher than those used in commercial radioassays and, therefore, the sensitivity was sufficient to detect increases in serum TK1 in subjects with solid tumors. With commercial radioassays this was difficult, and the results were not very convincing. Later, more sensitive, non-radioactive techniques enabled the lower increases from solid tumors to be measured accurately. The lower TK1 concentrations and lower TK1 specific activity found in solid tumors may make TK1 immunoassays more suitable.<ref name=\"He_2000\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====Lung cancer====\n[[Lung cancer]] is one of the commonest mlignancies, both by incidence (about 15% for both men and women in USA and in Europe) and by mortality (25% for women and 30% for men). One major reason why the mortality is higher than the incidence is that lung cancer is mostly detected and diagnosed at a late stage. Early detection could reduce the mortality. Another reason is that lung cancer, particularly small cell lung cancer, is very aggressive with very low 5 year survival rates.\n\nThere are several reports of the utility of TK1 activity measurements in serum in lung cancer.<ref name=\"Gronowitz_1986\"/><ref name=\"Gronowitz_1990\"/><ref name=\"Korkmaz_2013\"/><ref name=\"Nisman_2014\"/><ref name=\"Alegre_2014\"/> For diagnosis, combination of TK1 immunoassay with other biomarkers may be especially valuable<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jiang |first1=ZF |last2=Wang |first2=M |last3=Xu |first3=JL |title=Thymidine kinase 1 combined with CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE improved its diagnostic value for lung cancer. |journal=Life Sciences |date=1 February 2018 |volume=194 |pages=1\u20136 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2017.12.020 |pmid=29247745}}</ref> while falls in TK1 concentration following therapy may provide prognostic information.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lou |first1=X |last2=Zhou |first2=J |last3=Ma |first3=H |last4=Xu |first4=S |last5=He |first5=E |last6=Skog |first6=S |last7=Wang |first7=H |title=The Half-Life of Serum Thymidine Kinase 1 Concentration Is an Important Tool for Monitoring Surgical Response in Patients with Lung Cancer: A Meta-Analysis. |journal=Genetic Testing and Molecular Biomarkers |date=August 2017 |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=471\u2013478 |doi=10.1089/gtmb.2017.0003 |pmid=28817340}}</ref>\n\n====Breast cancer====\n[[Breast cancer]] is the commonest cancer in women by incidence (about 25% of cancer cases in USA and Europe) and the second largest by mortality (about 15%). The reason for this difference is the advances during the last decennia in the treatment of breast cancer cases and, above all, the public awareness that has allowed earlier diagnosis. One contributing factor is the widespread use of mammography for early detection, self-examination is another.\n\nMany tumor markers including TK1 are used for the follow-up and detection of recurrences in breast cancer patients.<ref name=\"Nisman_2013\" /><ref name=\"Chen_2013\"/><ref name=\"Nisman_2010\"/><ref name=\"Huang_2012\"/><ref name=\"Nisman_2013b\"/><ref name=\"Bjohle_2013\"/><ref name=\"Bolayirli_2013\"/> Immunoassays may be more sensitive than enzyme activity assays for detecting the TK1 forms found in the serum of subjects with breast cancer.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> For diagnosis, combination of TK1 assays with other biomarkers, e.g. CA 15-3, may be especially valuable.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====Prostate cancer====\nAmong men, [[prostate cancer]] is by far the commonest cancer form, forming about 25% of the total cancer incidence among men in USA and Europe. The mortality is much lower than would be expected from the incidence, around 10% of the total cancer mortality of men in USA and Europe. A major reason for the lower mortality is that many prostate cancers grow slowly so that the patients do not die from this cancer but from other unrelated reasons.\n\nIn the management of prostate cancer, it is, therefore, very important to be able to discriminate between slowly and rapidly growing cancers. Thymidine kinase has been suggested as a supplement to PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen), the tumor marker most frequently used in prostate cancer. Whereas PSA is considered to give an indication of the tumor mass, thymidine kinase activity indicates the rate of proliferation and the markers thus supplement each other.<ref name=\"Larson_1985\"/><ref name=\"Lewenhaupt_1990\"/><ref name=\"Ekman_1991\"/><ref name=\"Letocha_1996\"/>\n\n====Other solid tumors====\nTK1 elevations have also been reported in association with many types of solid tumors including:\n\n[[kidney cancer]],<ref name=\"Nisman_2010b\"/> [[bladder cancer]],<ref name=\"Rausch_2015\"/> [[gastric cancer]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Y |last2=Ling |first2=Y |last3=Qi |first3=Q |last4=Tang |first4=Y |last5=Xu |first5=J |last6=Tong |first6=Z |last7=Sheng |first7=G |last8=Yang |first8=Q |last9=Pan |first9=Y |title=Changes in serum thymidine kinase 1 levels during chemotherapy correlate with objective response in patients with advanced gastric cancer. |journal=Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine |date=November 2011 |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=1177\u20131181 |doi=10.3892/etm.2011.338 |pmid=22977640|pmc=3440839 }}</ref><ref name=\"Liu_2011\"/><ref name=\"Ji_2015\"/> [[liver cancer]],<ref name=\"Zhang_2015\"/> neurological cancers<ref name=\"Kolberg_2015\"/> and [[melanoma]].<ref name=\"Wu_2013\"/> Ovarian, cervical and esophageal cancers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Y |last2=Jiang |first2=X |last3=Dong |first3=S |last4=Shen |first4=J |last5=Yu |first5=H |last6=Zhou |first6=J |last7=Li |first7=J |last8=Ma |first8=H |last9=He |first9=E |last10=Skog |first10=S |title=Serum TK1 is a more reliable marker than CEA and AFP for cancer screening in a study of 56,286 people. |journal=Cancer Biomarkers |date=11 March 2016 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=529\u201336 |doi=10.3233/CBM-160594 |pmid=27002755}}</ref>\n\n===Non-malignant elevations===\nThere are several non-malignant causes for elevation of thymidine kinase in serum including vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to [[pernicious anemia]]<ref name=\"Ellims_1979\"/><ref name=\"Neumuller_1989\"/> viral infections (particularly by virus from the [[herpesviridae|herpes group]]) <ref name=\"Kallander_1983\"/><ref name=\"Tufveson_1988\"/><ref name=\" Neumuller_1989\" /> and wound healing after trauma and operation.\n\n===Thymidine kinase in domestic animals===\nThere are also reports of the use of thymidine kinase as a tumor marker in domestic animals, in horse,<ref name=\"Larsdotter_2015\"/> in dogs<ref name=\"Euler_2006\"/><ref name=\"Euler_2004\"/><ref name=\"Jaglarmundi_2014\"/><ref name=\"Selting_2015\"/><ref name=\"Elliot_2013\"/><ref name=\"Jaglarmundi_2015b\"/> in cats<ref name=\"Taylor_2013\"/> and in cows.<ref name=\"Tawfeeq_2013\"/> Elevations in dogs with bacterial infections have also been reported.<ref name=\"Sharif_2013\"/>\n\n===Thymidine kinase in tissue===\nThymidine kinase has been determined in tissue samples after extraction of the tissue and a relation between the results and disease progression has been shown.

Although most studies do not show this, it seems probable that differences between samples from healthy tissue and samples from tumor tissue primarily represents changes in the levels of TK1, since this enzyme is much more strongly coupled to cell proliferation than TK2.\n\nA method has been developed for specific determination of TK2 in cell extracts using the substrate analogue 5-Bromovinyl 2'-deoxyuridine.<ref name=\"Wang_2008\"/>\n\n==Uses of thymidine kinase determinations==\nTumor markers may be used for the following purposes\n*''Screening'' either for specific cancers or generally for malignant growth. Broad screening for all or most types of cancer was early suggested<ref name=\"Bjorklund_1962\"/><ref name=\"Bjorklund_1978\"/> but has since been shown not to be a realistic goal. Screening for specific cancer types or locations requires a level of specificity and sensitivity that for tumor markers has so far only been reached by PSA.<ref name=\"Vickers_2016\"/> Thymidine kinase neither reaches the clinical sensitivity nor the clinical specificity to be useful for screening purposes, see however Huang et al.,<ref name=\"Huang_2011\"/> Xiang et al.<ref name=\"Xiang_2013\"/> and Cao et al.<ref name=\"Cao_2014\"/>\n*''Monitoring'' of cancer survivors after treatment, detection of [[relapse|recurrent]] disease is the most common use of [[tumor marker]]s including thymidine kinase, that is used as a standard methods for monitoring hematological disorders, particularly lymphoma, but is also studied for monitoring solid tumors.\n*''Diagnosis'' of specific tumor types. The tumor types that are of interest for thymidine kinase are diagnosed by other techniques than measurement of tumor markers.\n*''Confirmation of diagnosis'' to verify the characteristics such as size and aggressivity of a tumor and thereby to help in the evaluation of a suitable treatment schedule has been verified as a suitable application of thymidine kinase determination for several types of tumors. Thymidine kinase has been confirmed as a valuable tool to verify the aggressivity of both hematologic tumors (particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and prostate carcinoma.\n*''Staging'': thymidine kinase has been suggested for inclusion in the staging criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma <ref name=\"Rivkina_2011\" />\n*''Prognosis'': thymidine kinase has been shown to be an important prognostic parameter particularly in hematologic malignancies (lymphoma and leukemia).\n*''Verification of the effect of treatment'' is an important use of thymidine kinase. As this tumor marker reacts to the activity of the tumor rather than to the tumor mass it gives a very early indication of the effect of the treatment. \n*A ''[[companion diagnostic]]'' is used to verify if the treatment is suited for the type or subtype of tumor particularly in [[personalized medicine]]. The strong coupling of TK1 expression to the cell cycle provides a special rationale for investigating thymidine kinase as marker of effect of inhibitors to [[cyclin-dependent kinases]]. These inhibitor compounds constitute promising new cancer therapies. Cyclin-dependent kinases promote transition through the cell cycle and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are intended to stop the transition to the S phase of the cell cycle, where thymidine kinase is synthesized. Serum TK-activity is therefore now included as a biomarker in clinical trials of these inhibitor compounds.<ref name=\"Asghar_2015\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Thymidine kinase]]\n*[[Thymidylate kinase]]\n*[[Nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]\n*[[Thymidylate synthase]]\n*[[Thymidine]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |vauthors= O'Neill KL, Buckwalter M, Murray BK |title= Thymidine kinase: diagnostic and prognostic potential |journal= Expert Rev.

In clinical chemistry it has been suggested as a proliferation marker for prognosis, verification of diagnosis, control of treatment (particularly as a companion diagnostic) and follow-up of malignant disease. It is used mainly in relation to hematological malignancies but the developments of more sensitive assays have stimulated investigations for its use in relation to solid tumors.\n\n==History==\nThe incorporation of thymidine in DNA was demonstrated around 1950.<ref name=\"Reichard_1951\"/> Somewhat later, it was shown that this incorporation was preceded by phosphorylation<ref name=\"Bessman_1956\"/> and around 1960, the enzyme responsible was purified and characterized.\n<ref name=\"Bollum_1958\"/><ref name=\"Weissman_1960\"/> The potential use as a tumor marker was suggested by Gronowitz et al.<ref name=\"Gronowitz_1983\"/>\n\n==Biochemistry==\nMammals have two isoenzymes that are chemically very different, Thymidine Kinase 1 (TK1) and Thymidine Kinase 2 (TK2). The former was first found in fetal tissue, the second was found to be more abundant in adult tissue, and so initially they were termed fetal and adult thymidine kinases. Soon it was shown that TK1 is present in the cytoplasm only in anticipation of cell division (cell cycle-dependent)<ref name=\"Blasco_1990\"/><ref name=\"Littlefield_1966\"/> whereas the presence of TK2, which is located in the mitochondria, is cell cycle-independent.<ref name=\"Berk_1973\"/><ref name=\"Berk_1973b\"/>\nTK1 is synthesized by the cell during the S phase of cell division. After cell division is completed, TK1 is degraded intracellularly, so that it does not pass into body fluids after normal cell division.<ref name=\"Zhu_2006\"/> The TK enzyme suggested as a [[tumor marker]] is the [[cytosol]]ic cell cycle dependent TK1. It is present during cell division in much higher concentrations than TK2 and it is released in quantities that completely dominate the thymidine kinase activity in blood and other body fluids.\n\nIn addition to cellular TKs, virus specific thymidine kinases have been identified in Herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus.<ref name=\"Kit_1963\"/><ref name=\"McKnight_1980\"/><ref name=\"Halliburton_1980\"/><ref name=\"McDougall_1980\"/><ref name=\"Kit_1983\"/><ref name=\"Sawyer_1986\"/><ref name=\"Littler_1986\"/> They differ biochemically from thymidine kinase from mammalian cells and are inhibited by specific inhibitors that do not influence the activity of mammalian thymidine kinases. Determination of viral thymidine kinase has been suggested for confirmation of diagnosis and for control of treatment of viral infections.\n\n[[Image:2'-Desoxythymidin.svg|120px]] + ATP ---> [[Image:2'-Desoxythymidinmonophosphat.svg|200px]] + ADP\n\nThymidine reacts with ATP to give thymidine monophosphate and ADP.\n\n==Physiological context==\n[[Thymidine monophosphate]], the product of the reaction catalyzed by thymidine kinase, is in turn [[phosphorylated]] to [[thymidine diphosphate]] by the enzyme [[thymidylate kinase]] and further to [[thymidine triphosphate]] by the enzyme [[nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]. The triphosphate is included in a [[DNA]] molecule, a reaction catalyzed by a [[DNA polymerase]] and a [[complementary DNA]] molecule (or an [[RNA]] molecule in the case of [[reverse transcriptase]], an enzyme present in [[retrovirus]]). Thymidine monophosphate is produced by the cell in two different reactions - either by [[phosphorylation]] of [[thymidine]] as described above or by [[methylation]] of [[deoxyuridine monophosphate]], a product of other metabolic pathways unrelated to thymidine, by the enzyme [[thymidylate synthase]] (De novo synthesis). This second route is used by the cell under normal conditions, and it is sufficient to supply thymidine monophosphate for DNA repair. When a cell prepares to divide, a complete new set-up of DNA is required, and the requirement for building blocks, including thymidine triphosphate, increases. Cells prepare for cell division by making some of the enzymes required during the division. They are not normally present in the cells and are down-regulated and degraded afterwards. Such enzymes are called [[salvage enzymes]]. Thymidine kinase 1 is such a salvage enzyme, whereas thymidine kinase 2 is not cell cycle-dependent.<ref name=\"Schlosser_1981\"/><ref name=\"Coppock_1987\"/><ref name=\"Stewart_1987\"/><ref name=\"Piper_1980\"/><ref name=\"Pelka-Fleischer_1987\"/><ref name=\"Sherley_1988\"/><ref name=\"Gross_1987\"/><ref name=\"Kauffman_1991\"/><ref name=\"Sutterluety_1996\"/>\n\n==Thymidine kinase in serum==\n\n===Background===\nThymidine kinase is a salvage enzyme that is only present in anticipation of cell division. The enzyme is not set free from cells undergoing normal division where the cells have a special mechanism to degrade the proteins no longer needed after cell division is completed.<ref name=\"Littlefield_1966\"/>  In normal subjects, the amount of thymidine kinase in serum or plasma is, therefore, very low. Tumor cells release enzyme to the circulation, probably in connection with the disruption of dead or dying tumor cells. The thymidine kinase level in serum, therefore, serves as a measure of malignant proliferation and, indirectly, as a measure of the aggressivity of the tumor. The form of enzyme present in the circulation does not correspond to the protein as encoded by the gene: the gene corresponds to a protein with molecular weight around 25 kD. It is a dimer with a molecular weight of around 50 kD, if activated by ATP a tetramer with molecular weight around 100 kD.<ref name=\"Welin_2004\"/> The main fraction of the active enzyme in the circulation has a molecular weight of 730 kD and is probably bound in a complex to other proteins.<ref name=\"Karlstrom_1990\"/>\n\n===Measurement===\nThymidine kinase 1 (TK1) levels in [[Serum (blood)|serum]] or [[Blood plasma|plasma]] may be measured based on their enzymatic activity or in terms of mass using immunoassays. In enzyme activity assays, this is done by incubation of a serum sample with a substrate analogue. The oldest commercially available technique uses iodo-deoxyuridine ([[idoxuridine]]) wherein a methyl group in thymidine has been replaced with radioactive iodine.<ref name=\"Gronowitz_1980\"/><ref name=\"Gronowitz_1984\"/><ref name=\"Gronowitz_1983b\"/> This substrate is well accepted by the enzyme. The monophosphate of iodo deoxyuridine is adsorbed on aluminum oxide that is suspended in the incubation medium. After decantation and washing the radioactivity of the aluminum oxide gives a measure of the amount of thymidine kinase in the sample. Kits using this principle are commercially available from the companies Immunotech/Beckman and DiaSorin.\n\n[[File: Idoxuridine - Idoxuridin.svg|thumb|Idoxuridine]]\n\nA non-radioactive assay method has been developed by the company Dia-Sorin. In this technique 3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine ([[Zidovudine]], AZT) is first phosphorylated to AZT 5'-monophosphate (AZTMP) by the TK1 in the sample. AZTMP is measured in an [[immunoassay]] with anti-AZTMP antibodies and AZTMP-labeled [[peroxidase]]. The assay runs in a closed system on the [[Laboratory robotics|laboratory robot]] from DiaSorin.<ref name=\"Euler_2006\"/><ref name=\"Ohrvik_2004\"/> The DiviTum assay from Biovica International uses another thymidine analogue, [[bromodeoxyuridine]], as substrate to the enzyme. The product of the reaction is further phosphorylated to tri-phosphate and incorporated in DNA-strings of polythymidine. The polythymidine binds to strings of polyadenine coupled to the bottom of the wells in microtiter plates. There it is detected with an [[ELISA]] technique: The wells are filled with a solution of a [[monoclonal antibody]] to bromo-deoxyuridine. The monoclonal antibody has been bound (conjugated) to the enzyme [[alkaline phosphatase]]. After the unbound antibody-conjugate has been washed away, a solution of a substrate to the alkaline phosphatase, [[para-nitrophenylphosphate]], is added. The product of the reaction, [[para-nitrophenol]], is yellow at alkaline pH and can be measured by [[spectrophotometry|photometry]].<ref name=\"Gronowitz2006\"/> This method has been evaluated against the previous radioactive technique. It is considerably more sensitive than the previous enzymatic methods and may be, therefore, more suitable for use with solid tumors where lower elevations of TK1 are found in body fluids. Comparisons of the methods have been published.<ref name=\"Nisman_2013\"/><ref name=\"Bacovsky_2015\"/> In the study by Nisman et al.,<ref name=\"Nisman_2013\"/> while the Divitum was on the whole more sensitive than the Liaison method, the authors suggested that the Liaison method may have been more sensitive for the TK1 forms found in normal subjects. A continuous and homogeneous fluorescent method based on quenching technology has recently been published. This technique utilizes natural thymidine as substrate and can also determine deoxycytidine kinase simultaneously with TK1.<ref name=\"Stalhandske_2013\"/>\n\nImmunoassays enabling the direct determination of TK1 protein have now been developed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alegre |first1=MM |last2=Weyant |first2=MJ |last3=Bennett |first3=DT |last4=Yu |first4=JA |last5=Ramsden |first5=MK |last6=Elnaggar |first6=A |last7=Robison |first7=RA |last8=O'Neill |first8=KL |title=Serum detection of thymidine kinase 1 as a means of early detection of lung cancer. |journal=Anticancer Research |date=May 2014 |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=2145\u201351 |pmid=24778016}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=He |first1=Q |last2=Zhang |first2=P |last3=Zou |first3=L |last4=Li |first4=H |last5=Wang |first5=X |last6=Zhou |first6=S |last7=Fornander |first7=T |last8=Skog |first8=S |title=Concentration of thymidine kinase 1 in serum (S-TK1) is a more sensitive proliferation marker in human solid tumors than its activity. |journal=Oncology Reports |date=October 2005 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=1013\u20139 |pmid=16142366}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jagarlamudi |first1=KK |last2=Hansson |first2=LO |last3=Eriksson |first3=S |title=Breast and prostate cancer patients differ significantly in their serum Thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) specific activities compared with those hematological malignancies and blood donors: implications of using serum TK1 as a biomarker. |journal=BMC Cancer |date=18 February 2015 |volume=15 |pages=66 |doi=10.1186/s12885-015-1073-8 |pmid=25881026|pmc=4336758 }}</ref> Immunoassays have advantages over enzymme activity methods in that they can measure TK1 isoforms that are enzymatically inactive plus that they are unaffected by serum TK1 inhibitors.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  The specific activity of serum TK1 differs between cancer types<ref name=\"Jaglarmundi_2015\" /> and using an immunoassay method may aid in comparing TK1 levels between subjects and malignancy types. Due to the basic differences in assay methods, results obtained with TK1 activity assays and immunoassay may differ, e.g. an ELISA based on antibodies against the TK1 TK 210 epitope was shown to be twice as sensitive as a TK1 activity assay in distinguishing between healthy women and subjects with breast cancer<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last1=Kumar |first1=JK |last2=Aronsson |first2=AC |last3=Pilko |first3=G |last4=Zupan |first4=M |last5=Kumer |first5=K |last6=Fabjan |first6=T |last7=Osredkar |first7=J |last8=Eriksson |first8=S |title=A clinical evaluation of the TK 210 ELISA in sera from breast cancer patients demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in all stages of disease. |journal=Tumour Biology|date=September 2016 |volume=37 |issue=9 |pages=11937\u201311945 |doi=10.1007/s13277-016-5024-z |pmid=27079872|pmc=5080325 }}</ref>\n\nTwo immunoassays have been developed against the exposed \u2018210\u2019 epitope covering the C-terminal amino acid sequence 194-225,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=He |first1=Q |last2=Skog |first2=S |last3=Wang |first3=N |last4=Eriksson |first4=S |last5=Tribukait |first5=B |title=Characterization of a peptide antibody against a C-terminal part of human and mouse cytosolic thymidine kinase, which is a marker for cell proliferation. |journal=European Journal of Cell Biology |date=June 1996 |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=117\u201324 |pmid=8793383}}</ref> a direct dot-blot assay with chemiluminescence end point<ref name=\"He_2000\" /> and a microtiter sandwich ELISA.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The dot-blot assay is a nitrocellulose membrane based assay with a chemiluminsecent substrate utilising a primary chicken IgY antibody and a secondary labeled anti-IgY antibody. In brief, the sample is spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane where the proteins in the sample bind. After blocking, the membrane is incubated with a primary anti-TK1 antibody which binds to the TK1 on the membrane. After washing, a biotinylated second antibody directed against IgY antibodies is added followed by streptavidin labelled HRP and a chemiluminescent substrate. A microtiter ELISA based on monoclonal antibodies directed against the \u201c210\u201d epitope is available from AroCell. The AroCell TK 210 ELISA system uses a pre-treatment buffer to break up the high molecular weight TK1 complexes and expose the TK 210 epitope. The treated samples are added to a microtiter plate coated with anti TK 210 monoclonal antibodies. After incubating and washing, a second anti-TK 210 antibody labeled with biotin is added. After further washing, the color is developed with streptavidin labelled horse radish peroxidase with TMP as substrate.\n\nA microchip electrophoresis immunoaffinity assay for determination of serum thymidine kinase concentration has been described. Its function was demonstrated using recombinant TK1. It is claimed to be fast and simple to perform.<ref name=\"Pagaduan_2015\"/>\n\n==Serum thymidine kinase 1 in different malignancies==\n\n===Hematologic malignancies===\nThe most dramatic increases of serum TK1 are seen in [[hematologic malignancies]]. The increases seen in both TK1 activity and concentration are greater in hematologic malignancies compared with solid tumors.<ref name=\"Jaglarmundi_2015\"/><ref name=\"Doi_1990\"/>\n\n====Non-Hodgkin lymphoma====\nThe main use of serum TK1 activity assays is in [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]. This disease has a wide range of aggressivity, from slow-growing indolent disease that hardly requires treatment to highly aggressive, rapidly growing forms that should be treated urgently. This is reflected in the values of serum TK1 activity, that range from close to the normal range for slow-growing tumors to very high levels for rapidly growing forms.<ref name=\"Gronowitz_1983\"/><ref name=\"Ellims_1981\"/><ref name=\"Hagberg_1984\"/><ref name=\"Hallek_1992\"/><ref name=\"Bogni_1994\"/><ref name=\"Rehn_1995\"/><ref name=\"Suki_1995\"/><ref name=\"Suzuki_2012\"/><ref name=\"Prochazka_2012\"/><ref name=\"Suzuki_2013\"/><ref name=\"Tsuji_2015\"/><ref name=\"Gatt_2015\"/>\n\n====Leukemias====\n[[Leukemia]]s normally do not normally present major diagnostic difficulties, as the microscopic analysis of the cells in blood usually provides unequivocal results.  TK1 assays, however, may give supplementary information about the aggressivity and the risk for progression.<ref name=\"Kallander_1984\"/><ref name=\"Kallander_1987\"/><ref name=\"Hallek_1996\"/><ref name=\"Rivkina_2011\"/><ref name=\"Bazargan_2012\"/><ref name=\"Pflug_2014\"/><ref name=\"Hagag_2015\"/><ref name=\"LopezMartinez_2015\"/>\n\n====Myeloma====\nAlso [[myelomas]] often constitute a diagnostic challenge. The malignant cells are often not available for microscopic analysis, and the prognosis is often uncertain. Therefore, information on the prognosis may be essential in the decision of the treatment. Several studies verify the close connection between prognosis and thymidine kinase activity in myelomas.<ref name=\"Bacovsky_2015\"/><ref name=\"Simonsson_1985\"/><ref name=\"Simonsson_1988\"/>\n\n====Myelodysplastic syndrome====\nA very interesting case is the [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]: Some rapidly change to acute leukemia, whereas others remain indolent for very long time. Identification of those tending to change to overt leukemia is important for the treatment. A relationship between the prognosis and the serum TK1 values has been demonstrated in myelodysplastic syndrome .<ref name=\"Musto_1995\"/><ref name=\"Aul_1996\"/>\n\n===Solid tumors===\nIncreased serum TK1 levels may be found in subjects with solid tumors. The increases in serum TK1 activity levels in subjects with solid tumors are not as large as they are for hematologic malignancies. The first methods for determination of serum TK1 activity had a limited sensitivity. In the case of the methods employing radioactivity, one reason was that the quantity of radioactivity allowed by law in normal radioimmunoassay laboratories is strctly limited. The experimental method first developed by Gronowitz et al.<ref name=\"Gronowitz_1980\" /> used quantities of radioisotope much higher than those used in commercial radioassays and, therefore, the sensitivity was sufficient to detect increases in serum TK1 in subjects with solid tumors. With commercial radioassays this was difficult, and the results were not very convincing. Later, more sensitive, non-radioactive techniques enabled the lower increases from solid tumors to be measured accurately. The lower TK1 concentrations and lower TK1 specific activity found in solid tumors may make TK1 immunoassays more suitable.<ref name=\"He_2000\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====Lung cancer====\n[[Lung cancer]] is one of the commonest mlignancies, both by incidence (about 15% for both men and women in USA and in Europe) and by mortality (25% for women and 30% for men). One major reason why the mortality is higher than the incidence is that lung cancer is mostly detected and diagnosed at a late stage. Early detection could reduce the mortality. Another reason is that lung cancer, particularly small cell lung cancer, is very aggressive with very low 5 year survival rates.\n\nThere are several reports of the utility of TK1 activity measurements in serum in lung cancer.<ref name=\"Gronowitz_1986\"/><ref name=\"Gronowitz_1990\"/><ref name=\"Korkmaz_2013\"/><ref name=\"Nisman_2014\"/><ref name=\"Alegre_2014\"/> For diagnosis, combination of TK1 immunoassay with other biomarkers may be especially valuable<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jiang |first1=ZF |last2=Wang |first2=M |last3=Xu |first3=JL |title=Thymidine kinase 1 combined with CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE improved its diagnostic value for lung cancer. |journal=Life Sciences |date=1 February 2018 |volume=194 |pages=1\u20136 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2017.12.020 |pmid=29247745}}</ref> while falls in TK1 concentration following therapy may provide prognostic information.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lou |first1=X |last2=Zhou |first2=J |last3=Ma |first3=H |last4=Xu |first4=S |last5=He |first5=E |last6=Skog |first6=S |last7=Wang |first7=H |title=The Half-Life of Serum Thymidine Kinase 1 Concentration Is an Important Tool for Monitoring Surgical Response in Patients with Lung Cancer: A Meta-Analysis. |journal=Genetic Testing and Molecular Biomarkers |date=August 2017 |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=471\u2013478 |doi=10.1089/gtmb.2017.0003 |pmid=28817340}}</ref>\n\n====Breast cancer====\n[[Breast cancer]] is the commonest cancer in women by incidence (about 25% of cancer cases in USA and Europe) and the second largest by mortality (about 15%). The reason for this difference is the advances during the last decennia in the treatment of breast cancer cases and, above all, the public awareness that has allowed earlier diagnosis. One contributing factor is the widespread use of mammography for early detection, self-examination is another.\n\nMany tumor markers including TK1 are used for the follow-up and detection of recurrences in breast cancer patients.<ref name=\"Nisman_2013\" /><ref name=\"Chen_2013\"/><ref name=\"Nisman_2010\"/><ref name=\"Huang_2012\"/><ref name=\"Nisman_2013b\"/><ref name=\"Bjohle_2013\"/><ref name=\"Bolayirli_2013\"/> Immunoassays may be more sensitive than enzyme activity assays for detecting the TK1 forms found in the serum of subjects with breast cancer.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> For diagnosis, combination of TK1 assays with other biomarkers, e.g. CA 15-3, may be especially valuable.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====Prostate cancer====\nAmong men, [[prostate cancer]] is by far the commonest cancer form, forming about 25% of the total cancer incidence among men in USA and Europe. The mortality is much lower than would be expected from the incidence, around 10% of the total cancer mortality of men in USA and Europe. A major reason for the lower mortality is that many prostate cancers grow slowly so that the patients do not die from this cancer but from other unrelated reasons.\n\nIn the management of prostate cancer, it is, therefore, very important to be able to discriminate between slowly and rapidly growing cancers. Thymidine kinase has been suggested as a supplement to PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen), the tumor marker most frequently used in prostate cancer. Whereas PSA is considered to give an indication of the tumor mass, thymidine kinase activity indicates the rate of proliferation and the markers thus supplement each other.<ref name=\"Larson_1985\"/><ref name=\"Lewenhaupt_1990\"/><ref name=\"Ekman_1991\"/><ref name=\"Letocha_1996\"/>\n\n====Other solid tumors====\nTK1 elevations have also been reported in association with many types of solid tumors including:\n\n[[kidney cancer]],<ref name=\"Nisman_2010b\"/> [[bladder cancer]],<ref name=\"Rausch_2015\"/> [[gastric cancer]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Y |last2=Ling |first2=Y |last3=Qi |first3=Q |last4=Tang |first4=Y |last5=Xu |first5=J |last6=Tong |first6=Z |last7=Sheng |first7=G |last8=Yang |first8=Q |last9=Pan |first9=Y |title=Changes in serum thymidine kinase 1 levels during chemotherapy correlate with objective response in patients with advanced gastric cancer. |journal=Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine |date=November 2011 |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=1177\u20131181 |doi=10.3892/etm.2011.338 |pmid=22977640|pmc=3440839 }}</ref><ref name=\"Liu_2011\"/><ref name=\"Ji_2015\"/> [[liver cancer]],<ref name=\"Zhang_2015\"/> neurological cancers<ref name=\"Kolberg_2015\"/> and [[melanoma]].<ref name=\"Wu_2013\"/> Ovarian, cervical and esophageal cancers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Y |last2=Jiang |first2=X |last3=Dong |first3=S |last4=Shen |first4=J |last5=Yu |first5=H |last6=Zhou |first6=J |last7=Li |first7=J |last8=Ma |first8=H |last9=He |first9=E |last10=Skog |first10=S |title=Serum TK1 is a more reliable marker than CEA and AFP for cancer screening in a study of 56,286 people. |journal=Cancer Biomarkers |date=11 March 2016 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=529\u201336 |doi=10.3233/CBM-160594 |pmid=27002755}}</ref>\n\n===Non-malignant elevations===\nThere are several non-malignant causes for elevation of thymidine kinase in serum including vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to [[pernicious anemia]]<ref name=\"Ellims_1979\"/><ref name=\"Neumuller_1989\"/> viral infections (particularly by virus from the [[herpesviridae|herpes group]]) <ref name=\"Kallander_1983\"/><ref name=\"Tufveson_1988\"/><ref name=\" Neumuller_1989\" /> and wound healing after trauma and operation.\n\n===Thymidine kinase in domestic animals===\nThere are also reports of the use of thymidine kinase as a tumor marker in domestic animals, in horse,<ref name=\"Larsdotter_2015\"/> in dogs<ref name=\"Euler_2006\"/><ref name=\"Euler_2004\"/><ref name=\"Jaglarmundi_2014\"/><ref name=\"Selting_2015\"/><ref name=\"Elliot_2013\"/><ref name=\"Jaglarmundi_2015b\"/> in cats<ref name=\"Taylor_2013\"/> and in cows.<ref name=\"Tawfeeq_2013\"/> Elevations in dogs with bacterial infections have also been reported.<ref name=\"Sharif_2013\"/>\n\n===Thymidine kinase in tissue===\nThymidine kinase has been determined in tissue samples after extraction of the tissue and a relation between the results and disease progression has been shown. However, no standard method for the extraction or for the assay has been developed and TK determination in extracts from cells and tissues have not been validated in relation to any specific clinical question, see however Arn\u00e9r et al.<ref name=\"Arner_1992\"/> Romain et al.<ref name=\"Romain_1994\"/> and Alegre et al.<ref name=\"Alegre_2012\"/>\n\nIn the studies referred to below the methods used and the way the results are reported are so different that comparisons between different studies are not possible.\n\nThe TK1 levels in fetal tissues during development are higher than those of the corresponding tissues later.<ref name=\"Machovich_1972\"/><ref name=\"Herzfeld_1980\"/><ref name=\"Herzfeld_1980b\"/><ref name=\"Wang_2008\"/>\n\nCertain non-malignant diseases also give rise to dramatic elevation of TK values in cells and tissue: in peripheral lymphocytes during monocytosis<ref name=\"Schollenberger_1972\"/> and in bone marrow during pernicious anemia.<ref name=\"Nakao_1968\"/><ref name=\"Wickramsinghe_1975\"/> As TK1 is present in cells during cell division, it is reasonable to assume that the TK activity in malignant tissue should be higher than in corresponding normal tissue.

Although most studies do not show this, it seems probable that differences between samples from healthy tissue and samples from tumor tissue primarily represents changes in the levels of TK1, since this enzyme is much more strongly coupled to cell proliferation than TK2.\n\nA method has been developed for specific determination of TK2 in cell extracts using the substrate analogue 5-Bromovinyl 2'-deoxyuridine.<ref name=\"Wang_2008\"/>\n\n==Uses of thymidine kinase determinations==\nTumor markers may be used for the following purposes\n*''Screening'' either for specific cancers or generally for malignant growth. Broad screening for all or most types of cancer was early suggested<ref name=\"Bjorklund_1962\"/><ref name=\"Bjorklund_1978\"/> but has since been shown not to be a realistic goal. Screening for specific cancer types or locations requires a level of specificity and sensitivity that for tumor markers has so far only been reached by PSA.<ref name=\"Vickers_2016\"/> Thymidine kinase neither reaches the clinical sensitivity nor the clinical specificity to be useful for screening purposes, see however Huang et al.,<ref name=\"Huang_2011\"/> Xiang et al.<ref name=\"Xiang_2013\"/> and Cao et al.<ref name=\"Cao_2014\"/>\n*''Monitoring'' of cancer survivors after treatment, detection of [[relapse|recurrent]] disease is the most common use of [[tumor marker]]s including thymidine kinase, that is used as a standard methods for monitoring hematological disorders, particularly lymphoma, but is also studied for monitoring solid tumors.\n*''Diagnosis'' of specific tumor types. The tumor types that are of interest for thymidine kinase are diagnosed by other techniques than measurement of tumor markers.\n*''Confirmation of diagnosis'' to verify the characteristics such as size and aggressivity of a tumor and thereby to help in the evaluation of a suitable treatment schedule has been verified as a suitable application of thymidine kinase determination for several types of tumors. Thymidine kinase has been confirmed as a valuable tool to verify the aggressivity of both hematologic tumors (particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) and prostate carcinoma.\n*''Staging'': thymidine kinase has been suggested for inclusion in the staging criteria for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma <ref name=\"Rivkina_2011\" />\n*''Prognosis'': thymidine kinase has been shown to be an important prognostic parameter particularly in hematologic malignancies (lymphoma and leukemia).\n*''Verification of the effect of treatment'' is an important use of thymidine kinase. As this tumor marker reacts to the activity of the tumor rather than to the tumor mass it gives a very early indication of the effect of the treatment. \n*A ''[[companion diagnostic]]'' is used to verify if the treatment is suited for the type or subtype of tumor particularly in [[personalized medicine]]. The strong coupling of TK1 expression to the cell cycle provides a special rationale for investigating thymidine kinase as marker of effect of inhibitors to [[cyclin-dependent kinases]]. These inhibitor compounds constitute promising new cancer therapies. Cyclin-dependent kinases promote transition through the cell cycle and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are intended to stop the transition to the S phase of the cell cycle, where thymidine kinase is synthesized. Serum TK-activity is therefore now included as a biomarker in clinical trials of these inhibitor compounds.<ref name=\"Asghar_2015\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Thymidine kinase]]\n*[[Thymidylate kinase]]\n*[[Nucleoside diphosphate kinase]]\n*[[Thymidylate synthase]]\n*[[Thymidine]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |vauthors= O'Neill KL, Buckwalter M, Murray BK |title= Thymidine kinase: diagnostic and prognostic potential |journal= Expert Rev.
