detailing a woman's exploits while serving as an undercover agent of the [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW), India's [[Espionage|external intelligence]] agency, in [[Pakistan]].\n\nThe story flashes to events preceding the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Hidayat Khan is the son of an Indian freedom fighter and agent posing as an informant for the Pakistani government. He wishes to make his 20-year-old daughter Sehmat an agent and continue the family tradition of being in service to the country as a last wish before his impending death from [[lung cancer]]. Sehmat leaves college against the wishes of her mother Teji Khan, and to prepare her to spy, she is hastily trained by senior RAW officer Khalid Mir and his assistant, a young Bakshi, in various fields, including [[martial arts]] and shooting. She proves to be a fast learner. Sehmat learns of other agents in Pakistan and their contacts, and practices converting text information to [[Morse code]], which she has to use while transmitting information to India.\n\nKhan uses his friendship with Brigadier Syed of the [[Pakistan Army]] to get Sehmat married to his younger son, Iqbal Syed, another military officer. After getting married and migrating to Pakistan, Sehmat quickly settles into her married life, adjusts to a new country, and establishes the trust and confidence of her in-laws. Brigadier Syed is promoted to Major General shortly afterwards, which results in crucial national security documents and senior members of the country's defence forces passing through his house. Sehmat soon establishes communication channels with her [[Agent handling|handlers]] back in India and starts relaying information. Meanwhile, she falls in love with Iqbal and they consummate their marriage.\n\nEventually, Sehmat spots information related to the planning of an offensive against India and, at great risk, is able to gather the necessary details and pass them on. One of the servants, Abdul, discovers the truth about Sehmat and rushes out to inform the others. She chases him and runs him down with a car to avoid exposing her cover. The event takes a heavy emotional toll on her. The information she passed on points to the planned attack on the Indian aircraft carrier [[INS Vikrant (R11)|INS ''Vikrant'']], then deployed in the [[Bay of Bengal]] and provided one of the initial warnings to the threat.\n\nSehmat plots to kill Mehboob Syed, Iqbal's elder brother and an army officer after he begins investigating Abdul's death and finds her suspicious. She succeeds in poisoning him with [[Ricin]] using an umbrella contraption. Pakistani intelligence begins a crackdown on espionage operations in the area, and several of Sehmat's accomplices are arrested, posing an additional challenge. Sehmat is mentally disturbed, having widowed Munira, Mehboob's wife, but quickly recovers. Mir comes to Iqbal's house disguised as a Pakistani commander and tells Sehmat in code what to do next. Sehmat then cleverly saves Munira from the ongoing police investigation and interrogation. Later, Sehmat is eventually discovered as a spy by Iqbal, who is heartbroken by the revelation. Iqbal confronts Sehmat with the police, but dies from a grenade thrown by a member of Mir's team (which has arrived to extract Sehmat), to cause her death should she be caught. Sehmat is alive, having earlier switched places with another [[burqa]]-clad agent who gets killed by the grenade. She realises the insignificance of relationships and humanity in this line of work. Broken by the destruction of a family by her hand and everything she has seen and had to do, Sehmat requests Mir to allow her to return to India. After she does, it is discovered that she is pregnant with Iqbal's child. She says that she will keep him and raise him alone.\n\nWith Sehmat's findings, the [[INS Rajput (D51)|INS ''Rajput'']] [[Sinking of PNS Ghazi|sinks]] the Pakistani submarine [[PNS Ghazi|PNS ''Ghazi'']] off [[Visakhapatnam]]'s coast.{{refn|name=Ghazi|group=N|India officially credits the [[HMS Rotherham (H09)|INS ''Rajput'']] for sinking [[PNS Ghazi|PNS ''Ghazi'']].<ref name=\"Register\">{{cite book| last = Bauer| first = K.

India joined the war on December 3rd 1971, and  after Pakistan launched preemptive air strikes on North India. The subsequent Indo-Pakistani War witnessed engagements on two war fronts. With air supremacy achieved in the eastern theatre and the rapid advance of the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India, Pakistan surrendered in Dhaka, Bangladesh  on 16 December 1971. \n\nBakshi concludes his speech, with Samar Syed, Sehmat's son, among the addressed officers. Meanwhile, an aged Sehmat is seen sitting in her chair and staring out of the window of her house, in the middle of nowhere.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alia Bhatt]] as Sehmat Khan <!-- Please read [[MOS:MULTIPLENAMES]]/edit summary before changing it back to 'nee' -->\n* [[Vicky Kaushal]] as Iqbal Syed\n* [[Jaideep Ahlawat]] as Khalid Mir\n* [[Rajit Kapur]] as Hidayat Khan, Sehmat's father\n* [[Shishir Sharma]] as Brigadier (later, Major-General) Syed\n* [[Soni Razdan]] as Teji Khan\n* [[Amruta Khanvilkar]] as Munira Syed\n* [[Arif Zakaria]] as Abdul\n* [[Ashwath Bhatt]] as Mehboob Syed\n* Aman Vasishth as Nikhil Bakshi\n* Rajvir Chauhan as ISI Officer\n* [[Rajesh Jais]] as Sarwar\n* [[Kanwaljit Singh (actor)|Kanwaljit Singh]] as older Nikhil Bakshi\n* [[Sanjay Suri]] as Samar Syed, Sehmat and Iqbal's son\n*[[Pallavi Batra]] as Mitali\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nSince 2014, Priti Sahani, president of Junglee Pictures, was trying to acquire the film rights to Harinder S.

detailing a woman's exploits while serving as an undercover agent of the [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (RAW), India's [[Espionage|external intelligence]] agency, in [[Pakistan]].\n\nThe story flashes to events preceding the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Hidayat Khan is the son of an Indian freedom fighter and agent posing as an informant for the Pakistani government. He wishes to make his 20-year-old daughter Sehmat an agent and continue the family tradition of being in service to the country as a last wish before his impending death from [[lung cancer]]. Sehmat leaves college against the wishes of her mother Teji Khan, and to prepare her to spy, she is hastily trained by senior RAW officer Khalid Mir and his assistant, a young Bakshi, in various fields, including [[martial arts]] and shooting. She proves to be a fast learner. Sehmat learns of other agents in Pakistan and their contacts, and practices converting text information to [[Morse code]], which she has to use while transmitting information to India.\n\nKhan uses his friendship with Brigadier Syed of the [[Pakistan Army]] to get Sehmat married to his younger son, Iqbal Syed, another military officer. After getting married and migrating to Pakistan, Sehmat quickly settles into her married life, adjusts to a new country, and establishes the trust and confidence of her in-laws. Brigadier Syed is promoted to Major General shortly afterwards, which results in crucial national security documents and senior members of the country's defence forces passing through his house. Sehmat soon establishes communication channels with her [[Agent handling|handlers]] back in India and starts relaying information. Meanwhile, she falls in love with Iqbal and they consummate their marriage.\n\nEventually, Sehmat spots information related to the planning of an offensive against India and, at great risk, is able to gather the necessary details and pass them on. One of the servants, Abdul, discovers the truth about Sehmat and rushes out to inform the others. She chases him and runs him down with a car to avoid exposing her cover. The event takes a heavy emotional toll on her. The information she passed on points to the planned attack on the Indian aircraft carrier [[INS Vikrant (R11)|INS ''Vikrant'']], then deployed in the [[Bay of Bengal]] and provided one of the initial warnings to the threat.\n\nSehmat plots to kill Mehboob Syed, Iqbal's elder brother and an army officer after he begins investigating Abdul's death and finds her suspicious. She succeeds in poisoning him with [[Ricin]] using an umbrella contraption. Pakistani intelligence begins a crackdown on espionage operations in the area, and several of Sehmat's accomplices are arrested, posing an additional challenge. Sehmat is mentally disturbed, having widowed Munira, Mehboob's wife, but quickly recovers. Mir comes to Iqbal's house disguised as a Pakistani commander and tells Sehmat in code what to do next. Sehmat then cleverly saves Munira from the ongoing police investigation and interrogation. Later, Sehmat is eventually discovered as a spy by Iqbal, who is heartbroken by the revelation. Iqbal confronts Sehmat with the police, but dies from a grenade thrown by a member of Mir's team (which has arrived to extract Sehmat), to cause her death should she be caught. Sehmat is alive, having earlier switched places with another [[burqa]]-clad agent who gets killed by the grenade. She realises the insignificance of relationships and humanity in this line of work. Broken by the destruction of a family by her hand and everything she has seen and had to do, Sehmat requests Mir to allow her to return to India. After she does, it is discovered that she is pregnant with Iqbal's child. She says that she will keep him and raise him alone.\n\nWith Sehmat's findings, the [[INS Rajput (D51)|INS ''Rajput'']] [[Sinking of PNS Ghazi|sinks]] the Pakistani submarine [[PNS Ghazi|PNS ''Ghazi'']] off [[Visakhapatnam]]'s coast.{{refn|name=Ghazi|group=N|India officially credits the [[HMS Rotherham (H09)|INS ''Rajput'']] for sinking [[PNS Ghazi|PNS ''Ghazi'']].<ref name=\"Register\">{{cite book| last = Bauer| first = K.

India joined the war on December 3rd 1971, and  after Pakistan launched preemptive air strikes on North India. The subsequent Indo-Pakistani War witnessed engagements on two war fronts. With air supremacy achieved in the eastern theatre and the rapid advance of the Allied Forces of Bangladesh and India, Pakistan surrendered in Dhaka, Bangladesh  on 16 December 1971. \n\nBakshi concludes his speech, with Samar Syed, Sehmat's son, among the addressed officers.
