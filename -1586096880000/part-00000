It is played in [[England]], and is a variant of the classic [[whist]] games. It is played individually, not in pairs like many other whist games.  The rules are easily learnt and the game is very enjoyable for all ages.\n\n== Introduction ==\nAustralian Whist differs from standard whist in that the number of cards dealt for most rounds changes round by round. The [[Trump (card games)|trump suit]] changes every round but is pre-determined : [[Hearts (suit)|Hearts]] is always [[Trump (card games)|trumps]] for round 1, followed by [[Clubs (suit)|Clubs]], [[Diamonds (suit)|Diamonds]], [[Spades (suit)|Spades]] and then back to [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]] and so on.\n\nGame play follows the sequence of \u2018'''Deal \u2013 Bid \u2013 Play - Score'''\u2019. The bidding rules ensure at least one person will \u2018lose\u2019 in every round.\n\n=== Purpose of game ===\n\nTo achieve the highest number of points possible. Points are won when a player wins the exact number of [[Trick-taking game|tricks]] that they have bid, in each round.\n\n=== Equipment needed ===\nA [[Standard 52-card deck|standard 52 card pack]] is used. A scoring sheet is needed, and something to clearly indicate the current trump suit (four aces from a second pack is recommended). Snacks and beverages are permissible.\n\n=== Game set-up ===\n\nThe players seat themselves around a table. One player is nominated to keep the scores. The [[Shuffling|shuffled]] pack is cut to see who will be [[dealer (card game)|dealer]] - highest card nominates the dealer.\n\nOnce the dealer is known the scorer should write the names or initials of the players at the top of each column on the scoring sheet and at the side of each row in the clockwise order of play commencing with the dealer of the first round. The trump suit should be indicated as Hearts for the first round.\n\n== Game play ==\n\nThe pack is always shuffled before each round. Complaining about how a fellow player shuffles the pack is allowable and should be encouraged.\n\n=== Game play - dealing ===\nThe dealer deals [[clockwise]] to all players, dealing the correct number of cards for the round :\n* In round 1 only one card is dealt to each player, in round 2 two cards are dealt and so on, up to ten cards per player\n* When ten cards are dealt to each player a series of special rounds take place (see below)\n* After the special rounds are complete the number of cards is reduced one card per round down to one card per player (i.e. 10 cards, 9 cards, 8 cards etc.)\n\nOnce every player has received their cards the remaining cards are placed face down on the table and form no further part of the round. The dealer moves clockwise at the start of each round.\n\n=== Game play - bidding ===\n\nThe player to the left of the dealer makes a bid of how many tricks they expect to win. This is recorded by the scorer.\n\nEach player bids in turn, clockwise, but the last player to bid '''cannot''' bid a number whereby the total number of tricks bid will equal the number of tricks in the round.   \nFor example, in a round of 4 cards with 4 players the bidding might be \u2013 Player 1 bids 1 trick, Player 2 bids 1 trick and Player 3 bids 0 tricks. The total number of tricks bid so far is 2 thus preventing the fourth player bidding 2 tricks - but they could bid 0, 1, 3 or 4 tricks. Consequently, rounds may be under- or over-bid.\n\n=== Game play - playing ===\n\nPlay commences with the player to the left of the dealer, who lays a card from their hand. Each player plays in turn, clockwise. Players must follow the suit laid by the first player of each hand. If this is not possible a player may choose to lay any card.\n\n[[Trick-taking game|Tricks]] are won in the same way as in standard whist, namely by the player who lays the highest card (either the highest card of the suit led or the highest trump). A trump card '''cannot''' be led at the start of a new trick unless that player has no other choice or a trump card has been played previously during the round.\n\nOn winning a trick play passes to that player who then leads a card from their hand. The round ends when all cards have been played and tricks won.\n\nAt any point in the game it is permissible (and a requirement) for a player to complain to another player regarding any card laid which may be considered not to be to the benefit of the other player.\n\n=== Game play - scoring ===\n\n* A player who has won the exact number of tricks than they bid is awarded 10 points plus 2 points for each trick won\n* A player who has won more or less tricks than they bid is awarded zero points\n* These rules apply to every round apart from the [[Mis\u00e8re]] special round (see below), where 2 points are deducted for each trick won but if a player wins no tricks they score 10 points\n\nThe running total of individual scores are recorded in the \u2018Score\u2019 columns on the scoring sheet. After scoring is complete the next round can begin.\n\n(Note that this scoring is known as Simplified / Montreal progressive scoring in the [[Oh Hell]] whist game.)\n\n=== The special rounds ===\n\nWhen ten cards are dealt to each player a series of five special rounds take place :\n\n# The first special round is played as normal\n# The second special round is played with no trump suit\n# The third special round is bid unseen \u2013 each player must bid before they receive and before they look at their cards. This round has a pre-determined trump suit\n# The fourth special round is \u2018[[Mis\u00e8re]]\u2019 and has no trump suit. There is no bidding because the purpose of this round is to win no tricks at all\n# The fifth special round is played as normal\n\n== Completion of the Game ==\n\nAt the end of the game the player with the highest score is declared the winner and final positions recorded in the boxes at the bottom of each score column on the scoring sheet.\n\n=== Variations on player numbers ===\n\nIt is possible to play with more than five players, but due to the limit of 52 cards in a pack the number of cards in the special rounds is limited to 8 cards for 6 players and 7 cards for 7 players.\n\nIt is also possible to play with 2 or 3 players, but the game is not as enjoyable as with 4 or more players.\n== References ==\n\n[[Australian Whist]] is similar to [[Romanian whist]] and [[Serbian whist]] but with different scoring rules.
