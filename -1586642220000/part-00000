The complex featured a {{1/2}}-mile asphalt tri-oval and a {{1/4}}-mile asphalt oval. \n\nThe complex was built in 1982 by Henry Furr, originally with the big track as a dirt {{frac|4|10}}-mile oval. The track was later paved, and then reconfigured in 1991 as a {{1/2}}-mile tri-oval. The primary divisions for the half-mile shifted between Super Late Models, and Late Model Stock Cars. \n\nThe small track was built first as a {{frac|1|5}}-mile layout for go-kart racing in the mid to late 1980s, the track was reconfigured to add a 1/4-mile asphalt oval layout in the mid '90s \u2013 the bigger layout featured was loosely egg shaped around the {{frac|1|5}}-mile oval \u2013 this layout traditionally hosted INEX Legends & INEX Bandoleros as the primary weekly division. \n\nThe half-mile track was especially known for the Big 10 Series for Super Late Models, and the North-South Shootout event (featuring multiple divisions \u2013 the marquee being a 125-lap Tour-type Modified race). \n\nThe track closed in July 2019, and was sold to [[Copart]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Precursor===\nIn total, there were 3 tracks under the Concord Speedway name, this facility being the third.\n\nThe first track  to use the Concord Speedway moniker was built in the 1950s and was built off of Popular Tent Rd. \u2013 located at the end of Old Speedway Dr. NW, this track held seven [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Grand National]] (now known as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) events between 1956 and 1959. The track was left abandoned after the closure.\n\nThe second track was also built off of Popular Tent Rd. (located near Eva Drive & Channing Circle) \u2013 also in the 1950s. This track was a {{1/2}}-mile dirt oval, and also was named Harris Speedway, Concord International Speedway & New Concord Speedway throughout its history. [[NASCAR]] held five Grand National races between 1962 and 1964. This track ran throughout the 1970s, it hosted the debut season of the National Dirt Racing Association \u2013 which was won by [[Rodney Combs]] on May 26, 1979. The NDRA race was also the final race at the Eva Dr. facility. <ref>https://www.racing-reference.info/comments?trkid=090</ref>\n\nBoth properties of the first 2 tracks are now housing developments. \n\nHowever, it wasn't the first track to be built in Concord or [[Cabarrus County]]. The first track in Concord was called the Concord Fairgrounds, and was located off of Highway 29 at the former Cabarrus District Fairgrounds. This half mile dirt oval facility was originally built for horse racing, and was first used for auto racing in 1925. The track ran until 1934 & also hosted 2 [[AAA Contest Board]] Sprint Car races (1931 & 1934) <ref>http://www.autoracingrecords.com/tracks.php?lid=27311</ref>. Other notable tracks in the county include famed [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] complex, the Midland Dustbowl - which held racing from 1948 to the 1950s <ref>http://www.autoracingrecords.com/tracks.php?lid=27347</ref>, Twin City Speedway (in Kannapolis) - which held stock car racing on a 1/4 mile dirt oval up to 1964 <ref>http://www.webprosolutions.com/ghosts/twin_city_nc.html</ref> and Two Flags Speedway (off of Gold Hill Rd.) - which hosted Micro Sprints & Go-Kart racing from 1976 to 1997 <ref>http://www.autoracingrecords.com/tracks.php?lid=27247</ref>.\n\n====Results====\n\n'''''Fairgrounds (1924-1932)'''''\n\n'''AAA Sprint Cars'''\n*1932 - [[Johnny Sawyer]]\n*1934 - [[Floyd Davis]]\n\n\n'''''Poplar Tent Road location (1949-1959)'''''\n\n'''NASCAR Grand National'''\nNASCAR held 7 Grand National races on the original dirt half mile located on Old Speedway Drive (near Poplar Tent Road) in Concord.<ref name=RacingReferenceTrack>{{cite web|title=NASCAR results|url=http://racing-reference.info/tracks/Concord_Speedway_%281%29|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref> \n*1956 - [[Speedy Thompson]]\n*1957 (race 2) - [[Marvin Panch]]\n*1957 (race 5) - [[Jack Smith (NASCAR driver)|Jack Smith]]\n*1957 (race 51) - [[Fireball Roberts]]\n*1958 - [[Lee Petty]]\n*1959 (race 5) - [[Curtis Turner]]\n*1959 (race 44) - [[Jack Smith (NASCAR driver)|Jack Smith]]\n\n'''NASCAR Convertible Series'''\nNASCAR held one [[NASCAR Convertible Series|Convertible Series]] race on the original dirt half mile.<ref name=\"RacingReferenceTrack\"/> \n*1957 - [[Curtis Turner]]\n\n\n'''''Eva Drive location (1949-1979)'''''\n\n'''NASCAR Grand National'''\n- NASCAR held 5 Grand National races on the second dirt half mile track located off of Eva Drive (near Popular Tent Road) in Concord.

Both races were 200 lap affairs.\n* 1961 - [[Don White (racing driver)|Don White]]\n* 1963 - [[Bill Cheesbourg]]\n\n'''National Dirt Racing Association'''\n- NDRA held a single race on the second dirt 1/2 mile track in 1979.\n*1979 (May 26) - [[Rodney Combs]]\n\n===A new beginning===\n\nThe current track was built by race promoter Henry Furr in 1982, Furr was looking to build a track following the sale of the previous 1/2 mile dirt track that he promoted. The track was originally a four-tenths of a mile oval, it hosted 3 races for the NDRA dirt late model touring series in 1983 - including the season finale, those were won by Larry Moore (July 4), dirt modified ace [[Kenny Brightbill]] (September 3) & [[Mike Duvall]] (October 8th). <ref>https://www.dirtondirt.com/history-defunct.php?id=19</ref>. The first few years, the track featured no walls on the outside corners, those were added in by 1984 or 1985.\n\n===Pavement era===\n\nFurr paved the track in August 1986, the track was reconfigured in 1991, adding a true dog-leg to the backstretch.  The track now is a half-mile with three unique turns, all with unique banking. The shape of the new layout was similar to [[Pocono Raceway]], and [[Sanair Super Speedway]]. Pit road entrance is located in the tri-oval prior to turn three, grandstand seating held over 12,000 fans.\n\nThe track started the Big 10 Series for Super Late Models in 1987, Jack Sprague won the first series title. The series became very popular with the fans, as it was highly competitive.\n\nDavid Laton purchased the track following the 1996 season. The Big 10 Series didn't return in 1997 for the first season under new ownership & Late Model Stock Cars became the main weekly championship of the half-mile. Laton made several capital improvements to the facility including a repave (done in 1999), replaced barriers & fencing, a Hubbell lighting system & several fan amenities. Grandstand seating was also downsized, as most of the Alan Kulwicki Grandstand became a dirt berm, with only the portion near the turn 1 gate staying intact - being replaced with metal bleachers.\n\nThe track brought back the Super Late Models for the Big 10 Series in 2003, the championship lasted until 2005. [[Freddie Query]] is the track's all-time leader in wins and claimed the Big 10 series championship in 2004 and 2005. \n\nLate Model Stock Cars returned as the main track championship, until 2009 when the track added Pro Late Models to the weekly card. \n\nOne of the track's more popular events, the North South Shootout was started in 2003 at the half-mile tri-oval. The event featured a 125-lap race for Tour-type Modifieds, along with several other marquee divisions such as [[Supermodified racing|Supermodifieds]] & the [[CRA Super Series|ARCA/CRA Super Series]]. The event stayed at Concord until 2010, it was originally going to move to Myrtle Beach Speedway for 2011 - however [[Caraway Speedway]] hosted the annual event following the death of original race promoter Charles Kepley. <ref>http://51archive2011.homestead.com/2011_Stories/Mods_Other/NSS_to_Caraway_8_18.html</ref>\n\n===Half Mile uncertainty & revival===\n\nThe track stopped weekly racing on the half-mile tri-oval in 2012, only the quarter-mile oval has hosted weekly racing since. The quarter-mile weekly program features [[Legend car racing|INEX Legends]], INEX Bandoleros, along with Davis Mini Cups, go-karts, and quarter midgets on select nights. The quarter-mile traditionally featured racing from March to May, and August to early October \u2013 with a 2-month break in June and July. Previously, this layout also featured USAC Speed2 Eastern Midgets during the summer months (2008\u20132010).\n\nIn 2015, racing returned to the half-mile tri-oval after not hosting any touring series for the past 2 years, the opening event featured the PASS South Super Late Models and [[Koma Unwind Modified Madness Series]] running on Memorial Day weekend. \n\nThat season also saw the return of the North-South Shootout event in November. Alongside the John Blewett III Memorial 125 for the Tour-type Modifieds, other touring series such as the PASS South Super Late Models were a part of the event. CARS Tour also returned that year \u2013 now in the dual series format for Super Late Models & Late Model Stock Cars. CARS Tour ran for 3 seasons until the end of 2017.\n\nOn May 5, 2018, the track hosted the Minimizer Bandit Big Rig Series. Defending series champion Ricky Rude got the lead on lap #6 & won the A-main feature. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPFk8OYsVMo</ref>\n\n===Closure===\n\nOn January 9, 2019, North-South Shootout promoter Renee Hackett announced that the event would move away from the facility to [[Hickory Motor Speedway]] due to the uncertain future of the Concord Speedway complex. <ref>https://speed51.com/north-south-shootout-moving-to-new-track-in-2019/</ref>\n\nThe track would continue to host the INEX Legend Cars & INEX Bandoleros on the quarter-mile track. \n\nOn July 2, 2019, it was announced that the track would be sold, and that leaders in each of the weekly series point standings would be awarded championship trophies for the year. The buyer was later reported to be [[Copart]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Zach |title=Imminent Sale of Historic North Carolina Track Announced |url=https://speed51.com/imminent-sale-of-historic-north-carolina-track-announced/ |website=Speed51 |accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Notable competitors==\nWinners and competitors at the track include Freddy Query, [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], [[Jack Sprague]], [[Ernie Irvan]], Bobby Labonte, Denny Bennet, [[Justin Labonte]], [[Clay Rogers]], Jimmy Simpson, [[Bobby Gill]], Dale Earnhardt Sr., [[Bobby Measmer Jr.]], Ryan Preece, Buster Bennet, Jeff Melton and Josh Hogan\n\n==Statistics==\nThe park consists of two tracks: a {{1/2}}-mile tri-oval and a {{1/4}}-mile oval. Originally the {{1/4}}-mile oval was a {{frac|1|5}}-mile oval and the {{1/4}}-mile was added later. The {{frac|1|5}}-mile is still there but only used for Davis Mini Cups and quarter midgets. The tri-oval seats 8,500 fans with room for 28 [[Recreational vehicle|RVs]], while the 1/4 mile track seats 2,050.  Additionally, the track has several air-conditioned suites located behind the main grandstand.\n\nThe track is active as a site for the filming of several television commercials, television shows, movies, and music videos.\n\n==Events==\n\n===Former touring series & events (half-mile)===\n*[[NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Southeast Series|ALL PRO Super Series]] (1987)\n*Allison Legacy Race Series (1997, 2004, 2006\u20132008, 2010\u201311, 2017\u201318)\n*[[CRA Super Series|ARCA/CRA Super Series -

Most notably of those is [[iRacing.com]] - which was one of their first tracks that the group laser scanned in 2005. The track is currently a part of iRacing's base content package. It was also featured in the [[CARS Tour|USAR Hooters Pro Cup]] game by [[Infogrames]] (released in 2002 for the PC). \n\nAmong modding circles for various PC racing games, it was also recreated for several [[Papyrus]] [[NASCAR]] games such as [[NASCAR Racing 2003 Season]], and also for [[NASCAR Heat]].\n\nConcord was also used for some inspiration for a fictional track in several [[NASCAR]] console games by [[EA Sports]]. The fictional track - called Levi Strauss Signature Speedway debuted in [[NASCAR 2005: Chase for the Cup]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Plemmons, Mark (July/August 2009) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708110550/http://cabarruslivingmagazine.com/Documents/pdf%20files/Jul-Aug/CLM-JulAug09-final.pdf Family-friendly, \"grassroots racing\" is going on all summer long at Concord Speedway.] ''Cabarrus Living Magazine'', p.&nbsp;12.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://concordspeedway.net/ Official Website]\n*[http://www.racing-reference.info/tracks/Concord_Speedway Concord Speedway archive] at Racing-Reference\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list=\n{{Charlotte sports venues}}\n{{CARS Tour racetracks}}\n{{PASS Super Late Model Series racetracks}}\n{{CRA Super Series racetracks}}\n{{NASCAR Sprint Cup Series racetracks}}\n{{NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour racetracks}}\n{{NASCAR Elite Division Southeast racetracks}}\n{{USAC National Midget Series race venues}}\n{{ASA National Tour racetracks}}\n{{CARS Pro Cup racetracks}}\n{{CARS Tour racetracks}}\n{{ISCARS Dash racetracks}}\n}}\n\n{{coord|35|18|31|N|80|31|17|W|region:US_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Sports venues in Cabarrus County, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Motorsport venues in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Concord, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Cabarrus County, North Carolina]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1982]]\n[[Category:NASCAR tracks]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Former NASCAR track}}\n{{Motorsport venue\n|Name             = Concord Speedway\n|Nicknames        = World's Fastest Half-Mile Tri-Oval<br>The Track Where Grassroots Racing Lives\n|Time             = GMT-5\n|Location         = [[Midland, North Carolina]]\n|Coordinates      =\n|Image            =\n|Image_caption    =\n|Capacity         = 8,500\n|Owner            =\n|Operator         =\n|Broke_ground     =\n|Opened           = {{start date|1982}}\n|Closed           = {{end date|2019}}\n|Construction_cost=\n|Architect        =\n|Former_names     = Concord Motorsports Park (1997 - 2008)\n|Events           = '''PASS South Super Late Models'''<br>'''[[NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour]]'''<br>'''[[USARacing|CARS Super Late Model Tour]]'''<br>'''[[USARacing|CARS Late Model Stock Car Tour]]'''\n|Miles_first      = True \n|Layout1          = Half-mile oval\n|Surface          = Asphalt\n|Length_km        = 0.804\n|Length_mi        = 0.500\n|Turns            = 3\n|Banking          = 8\u00b0 (front straight)<br>14\u00b0 (turn 1)<br>10\u00b0 (dogleg)<br>11\u00b0 (back straight)<br>14\u00b0 (turn 3)\n|Record_time      =\n|Record_driver    =\n|Record_team      =\n|Record_year      =\n|Record_class     =\n|Layout2          = Quarter-mile oval\n|Surface2          = Asphalt\n|Length_mi2        = 0.250\n|Turns2            = 4\n|Banking2          = 5\u00b0 (straightaways)<br> 8\u00b0 (turns)\n|Record_time2      =\n|Record_driver2    =\n|Record_team2      =\n|Record_year2      =\n|Record_class2     =\n}}\n\n'''Concord Speedway''' is a defunct [[motorsports]] facility located in the town of [[Midland, North Carolina]], southeast of [[Concord, North Carolina]]. The complex featured a {{1/2}}-mile asphalt tri-oval and a {{1/4}}-mile asphalt oval. \n\nThe complex was built in 1982 by Henry Furr, originally with the big track as a dirt {{frac|4|10}}-mile oval. The track was later paved, and then reconfigured in 1991 as a {{1/2}}-mile tri-oval. The primary divisions for the half-mile shifted between Super Late Models, and Late Model Stock Cars. \n\nThe small track was built first as a {{frac|1|5}}-mile layout for go-kart racing in the mid to late 1980s, the track was reconfigured to add a 1/4-mile asphalt oval layout in the mid '90s \u2013 the bigger layout featured was loosely egg shaped around the {{frac|1|5}}-mile oval \u2013 this layout traditionally hosted INEX Legends & INEX Bandoleros as the primary weekly division. \n\nThe half-mile track was especially known for the Big 10 Series for Super Late Models, and the North-South Shootout event (featuring multiple divisions \u2013 the marquee being a 125-lap Tour-type Modified race). \n\nThe track closed in July 2019, and was sold to [[Copart]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Precursor===\nIn total, there were 3 tracks under the Concord Speedway name, this facility being the third.\n\nThe first track  to use the Concord Speedway moniker was built in the 1950s and was built off of Popular Tent Rd. \u2013 located at the end of Old Speedway Dr. NW, this track held seven [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Grand National]] (now known as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) events between 1956 and 1959. The track was left abandoned after the closure.\n\nThe second track was also built off of Popular Tent Rd. (located near Eva Drive & Channing Circle) \u2013 also in the 1950s. This track was a {{1/2}}-mile dirt oval, and also was named Harris Speedway, Concord International Speedway & New Concord Speedway throughout its history. [[NASCAR]] held five Grand National races between 1962 and 1964. This track ran throughout the 1970s, it hosted the debut season of the National Dirt Racing Association \u2013 which was won by [[Rodney Combs]] on May 26, 1979. The NDRA race was also the final race at the Eva Dr. facility. <ref>https://www.racing-reference.info/comments?trkid=090</ref>\n\nBoth properties of the first 2 tracks are now housing developments. \n\nHowever, it wasn't the first track to be built in Concord or [[Cabarrus County]]. The first track in Concord was called the Concord Fairgrounds, and was located off of Highway 29 at the former Cabarrus District Fairgrounds. This half mile dirt oval facility was originally built for horse racing, and was first used for auto racing in 1925. The track ran until 1934 & also hosted 2 [[AAA Contest Board]] Sprint Car races (1931 & 1934) <ref>http://www.autoracingrecords.com/tracks.php?lid=27311</ref>. Other notable tracks in the county include famed [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] complex, the Midland Dustbowl - which held racing from 1948 to the 1950s <ref>http://www.autoracingrecords.com/tracks.php?lid=27347</ref>, Twin City Speedway (in Kannapolis) - which held stock car racing on a 1/4 mile dirt oval up to 1964 <ref>http://www.webprosolutions.com/ghosts/twin_city_nc.html</ref> and Two Flags Speedway (off of Gold Hill Rd.) - which hosted Micro Sprints & Go-Kart racing from 1976 to 1997 <ref>http://www.autoracingrecords.com/tracks.php?lid=27247</ref>.\n\n====Results====\n\n'''''Fairgrounds (1924-1932)'''''\n\n'''AAA Sprint Cars'''\n*1932 - [[Johnny Sawyer]]\n*1934 - [[Floyd Davis]]\n\n\n'''''Poplar Tent Road location (1949-1959)'''''\n\n'''NASCAR Grand National'''\nNASCAR held 7 Grand National races on the original dirt half mile located on Old Speedway Drive (near Poplar Tent Road) in Concord.<ref name=RacingReferenceTrack>{{cite web|title=NASCAR results|url=http://racing-reference.info/tracks/Concord_Speedway_%281%29|publisher=Racing Reference|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}</ref> \n*1956 - [[Speedy Thompson]]\n*1957 (race 2) - [[Marvin Panch]]\n*1957 (race 5) - [[Jack Smith (NASCAR driver)|Jack Smith]]\n*1957 (race 51) - [[Fireball Roberts]]\n*1958 - [[Lee Petty]]\n*1959 (race 5) - [[Curtis Turner]]\n*1959 (race 44) - [[Jack Smith (NASCAR driver)|Jack Smith]]\n\n'''NASCAR Convertible Series'''\nNASCAR held one [[NASCAR Convertible Series|Convertible Series]] race on the original dirt half mile.<ref name=\"RacingReferenceTrack\"/> \n*1957 - [[Curtis Turner]]\n\n\n'''''Eva Drive location (1949-1979)'''''\n\n'''NASCAR Grand National'''\n- NASCAR held 5 Grand National races on the second dirt half mile track located off of Eva Drive (near Popular Tent Road) in Concord.

Both races were 200 lap affairs.\n* 1961 - [[Don White (racing driver)|Don White]]\n* 1963 - [[Bill Cheesbourg]]\n\n'''National Dirt Racing Association'''\n- NDRA held a single race on the second dirt 1/2 mile track in 1979.\n*1979 (May 26) - [[Rodney Combs]]\n\n===A new beginning===\n\nThe current track was built by race promoter Henry Furr in 1982, Furr was looking to build a track following the sale of the previous 1/2 mile dirt track that he promoted. The track was originally a four-tenths of a mile oval, it hosted 3 races for the NDRA dirt late model touring series in 1983 - including the season finale, those were won by Larry Moore (July 4), dirt modified ace [[Kenny Brightbill]] (September 3) & [[Mike Duvall]] (October 8th). <ref>https://www.dirtondirt.com/history-defunct.php?id=19</ref>. The first few years, the track featured no walls on the outside corners, those were added in by 1984 or 1985.\n\n===Pavement era===\n\nFurr paved the track in August 1986, the track was reconfigured in 1991, adding a true dog-leg to the backstretch.  The track now is a half-mile with three unique turns, all with unique banking. The shape of the new layout was similar to [[Pocono Raceway]], and [[Sanair Super Speedway]]. Pit road entrance is located in the tri-oval prior to turn three, grandstand seating held over 12,000 fans.\n\nThe track started the Big 10 Series for Super Late Models in 1987, Jack Sprague won the first series title. The series became very popular with the fans, as it was highly competitive.\n\nDavid Laton purchased the track following the 1996 season. The Big 10 Series didn't return in 1997 for the first season under new ownership & Late Model Stock Cars became the main weekly championship of the half-mile. Laton made several capital improvements to the facility including a repave (done in 1999), replaced barriers & fencing, a Hubbell lighting system & several fan amenities. Grandstand seating was also downsized, as most of the Alan Kulwicki Grandstand became a dirt berm, with only the portion near the turn 1 gate staying intact - being replaced with metal bleachers.\n\nThe track brought back the Super Late Models for the Big 10 Series in 2003, the championship lasted until 2005. [[Freddie Query]] is the track's all-time leader in wins and claimed the Big 10 series championship in 2004 and 2005. \n\nLate Model Stock Cars returned as the main track championship, until 2009 when the track added Pro Late Models to the weekly card. \n\nOne of the track's more popular events, the North South Shootout was started in 2003 at the half-mile tri-oval. The event featured a 125-lap race for Tour-type Modifieds, along with several other marquee divisions such as [[Supermodified racing|Supermodifieds]] & the [[CRA Super Series|ARCA/CRA Super Series]]. The event stayed at Concord until 2010, it was originally going to move to Myrtle Beach Speedway for 2011 - however [[Caraway Speedway]] hosted the annual event following the death of original race promoter Charles Kepley. <ref>http://51archive2011.homestead.com/2011_Stories/Mods_Other/NSS_to_Caraway_8_18.html</ref>\n\n===Half Mile uncertainty & revival===\n\nThe track stopped weekly racing on the half-mile tri-oval in 2012, only the quarter-mile oval has hosted weekly racing since. The quarter-mile weekly program features [[Legend car racing|INEX Legends]], INEX Bandoleros, along with Davis Mini Cups, go-karts, and quarter midgets on select nights. The quarter-mile traditionally featured racing from March to May, and August to early October \u2013 with a 2-month break in June and July. Previously, this layout also featured USAC Speed2 Eastern Midgets during the summer months (2008\u20132010).\n\nIn 2015, racing returned to the half-mile tri-oval after not hosting any touring series for the past 2 years, the opening event featured the PASS South Super Late Models and [[Koma Unwind Modified Madness Series]] running on Memorial Day weekend. \n\nThat season also saw the return of the North-South Shootout event in November. Alongside the John Blewett III Memorial 125 for the Tour-type Modifieds, other touring series such as the PASS South Super Late Models were a part of the event. CARS Tour also returned that year \u2013 now in the dual series format for Super Late Models & Late Model Stock Cars. CARS Tour ran for 3 seasons until the end of 2017.\n\nOn May 5, 2018, the track hosted the Minimizer Bandit Big Rig Series. Defending series champion Ricky Rude got the lead on lap #6 & won the A-main feature. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPFk8OYsVMo</ref>\n\n===Closure===\n\nOn January 9, 2019, North-South Shootout promoter Renee Hackett announced that the event would move away from the facility to [[Hickory Motor Speedway]] due to the uncertain future of the Concord Speedway complex. <ref>https://speed51.com/north-south-shootout-moving-to-new-track-in-2019/</ref>\n\nThe track would continue to host the INEX Legend Cars & INEX Bandoleros on the quarter-mile track. \n\nOn July 2, 2019, it was announced that the track would be sold, and that leaders in each of the weekly series point standings would be awarded championship trophies for the year. The buyer was later reported to be [[Copart]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Zach |title=Imminent Sale of Historic North Carolina Track Announced |url=https://speed51.com/imminent-sale-of-historic-north-carolina-track-announced/ |website=Speed51 |accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Notable competitors==\nWinners and competitors at the track include Freddy Query, [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]], [[Jack Sprague]], [[Ernie Irvan]], Bobby Labonte, Denny Bennet, [[Justin Labonte]], [[Clay Rogers]], Jimmy Simpson, [[Bobby Gill]], Dale Earnhardt Sr., [[Bobby Measmer Jr.]], Ryan Preece, Buster Bennet, Jeff Melton and Josh Hogan\n\n==Statistics==\nThe park consists of two tracks: a {{1/2}}-mile tri-oval and a {{1/4}}-mile oval. Originally the {{1/4}}-mile oval was a {{frac|1|5}}-mile oval and the {{1/4}}-mile was added later. The {{frac|1|5}}-mile is still there but only used for Davis Mini Cups and quarter midgets.

Most notably of those is [[iRacing.com]] - which was one of their first tracks that the group laser scanned in 2005. The track is currently a part of iRacing's base content package. It was also featured in the [[CARS Tour|USAR Hooters Pro Cup]] game by [[Infogrames]] (released in 2002 for the PC). \n\nAmong modding circles for various PC racing games, it was also recreated for several [[Papyrus]] [[NASCAR]] games such as [[NASCAR Racing 2003 Season]], and also for [[NASCAR Heat]].\n\nConcord was also used for some inspiration for a fictional track in several [[NASCAR]] console games by [[EA Sports]].

It originally aired on May 11, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nHouse wakes up at his apartment after spending the night with Cuddy. He discovers that she has left her lipstick on his bathroom counter, as well as on his cheek. House pockets the lipstick, and goes to work in a cheerful mood and a remarkable lack of pain.\n\nHouse and the team are intrigued by Scott ([[Ashton Holmes]]), a man who has undergone a [[corpus callosotomy]] procedure to treat [[epilepsy]]. The procedure left him with independently functioning left and right [[brain hemisphere]]s and two distinct personalities, resulting in loss of conscious control over some of his actions, including those of his left hand, a condition known as [[alien hand syndrome]].\n\nAs the two sides of Scott's brain struggle for dominance, his warring personalities make it increasingly difficult for the team to figure out what is causing the problem. The team is forced to use some unusual methods to get him to cooperate with their  testing.\n\nMeanwhile, Cuddy tells House that their relationship must be that of employer and employee. House tells Wilson that he kicked his drug habit and had sex with Cuddy; Wilson advises that he talk to her, advice which House ignores. Instead he begins a campaign to annoy and provoke her, an attempt to break through her composure.\n\nWhen, as part of this plan, House refuses to make his scheduled appearances in the clinic, Cuddy begins referring patients to see House in his private office, specifically an annoying elderly man named Eugene Schwartz (guest star [[Carl Reiner]]) whose wife is bothered by the odd \"squawking\" noises he makes.\n\nTo Chase's complaints about his relationship crisis with Cameron, Taub responds by talking about toxic chemicals of male fruit flies. Meanwhile, Cameron turns to House for advice, who convinces her to concede to Chase. Chase gets a new point of view of her motives and concedes to her in turn. Their wedding plans are revived.\n\nIn a final attempt to provoke Cuddy into examining her true feelings for him, House announces to everyone in the main lobby of the hospital that the two had sex. Cuddy responds by confronting him and then firing him after he suggests that they move in together. Cuddy storms off but before House can do anything else, Eugene Schwartz approaches to inquire about his squawking condition again.\n\nHouse initially diagnoses it as acid reflux causing his vocal cords to tense, but when Schwartz adjusts his belt due to soreness, House realizes Schwartz has [[pancreatic cancer]], which was the root cause of the acid reflux. At the same time, it is reported that the patient with alien hand syndrome, Scott, is really suffering from a reaction to an ingredient in the industrial-strength antiperspirant he uses.\n\nHouse then goes to talk to Cuddy in her office, and asks her if she could possibly be overreacting to the previous night. She finally admits that maybe she is, since he's \"said plenty of lousy things to [her] before.\" House seems confused, as he assumed that she was overreacting to her and House having sex and what it could mean to their employer-employee relationship.\n\nBut he realizes that Cuddy's reactions all day have been consistent, and in fact it is his own memory of the situation that is faulty. He turns his attention to the lipstick Cuddy left at his apartment, which he has been playing with all day, and is troubled that Cuddy's coffee cup shows no lipstick smears; his memory of the prior evening included smears of lipstick on his face from kissing Cuddy, so he expects her lipstick is the sort that smears. He asks Cuddy whether she has another type of lipstick, one with a \"sealing agent\", that might explain the discrepancy between his memory of the smeared kiss and the reality that now confronts him of the unsmeared coffee cup.\n\nHouse then has a flashback to the night (from the episode \"[[Under My Skin (House)|Under My Skin]]\") before when he thought he told Cuddy that he needed her help with his addiction. He suddenly sees the reality of what has happened: he never told Cuddy he was having hallucinations that night. His final words of the evening were: \"You can go suckle the little bastard child if that makes you feel good about yourself.\" Upset by this remark, she left the office and went home, never accompanying him to his apartment.\n\nHouse snaps back to reality and tries to explain to Cuddy that that's not what actually happened, saying \"I told you I needed you, and you helped me.\" He reaches into his pocket to remove the lipstick, but, to his shock, he discovers that it is actually a bottle of Vicodin. He drops the bottle on the floor and gingerly backs away from it. Cuddy, now realizing House is not joking, rushes to him and asks if he is okay.  He doesn't respond, but then has another flashback, and realizes what happened. The whole previous night was a complete hallucination, beginning from him telling Cuddy that he needed her to help him detox and her accompanying him home. His memory of Cuddy staying by his side at his apartment was not real, and, in fact, he spent the night popping pills by himself. Hallucinations of [[List of House characters#Amber Volakis|Amber]] and [[Lawrence Kutner (House)|Kutner]] then appear and tell House that while the story he invented about himself is nice, it's not true. House finally looks at Cuddy and is able to fearfully tell her that he is not okay.\n\nCuddy goes to Wilson's office, and looks troubled upon entering.

It originally aired on May 11, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nHouse wakes up at his apartment after spending the night with Cuddy. He discovers that she has left her lipstick on his bathroom counter, as well as on his cheek. House pockets the lipstick, and goes to work in a cheerful mood and a remarkable lack of pain.\n\nHouse and the team are intrigued by Scott ([[Ashton Holmes]]), a man who has undergone a [[corpus callosotomy]] procedure to treat [[epilepsy]]. The procedure left him with independently functioning left and right [[brain hemisphere]]s and two distinct personalities, resulting in loss of conscious control over some of his actions, including those of his left hand, a condition known as [[alien hand syndrome]].\n\nAs the two sides of Scott's brain struggle for dominance, his warring personalities make it increasingly difficult for the team to figure out what is causing the problem. The team is forced to use some unusual methods to get him to cooperate with their  testing.\n\nMeanwhile, Cuddy tells House that their relationship must be that of employer and employee. House tells Wilson that he kicked his drug habit and had sex with Cuddy; Wilson advises that he talk to her, advice which House ignores. Instead he begins a campaign to annoy and provoke her, an attempt to break through her composure.\n\nWhen, as part of this plan, House refuses to make his scheduled appearances in the clinic, Cuddy begins referring patients to see House in his private office, specifically an annoying elderly man named Eugene Schwartz (guest star [[Carl Reiner]]) whose wife is bothered by the odd \"squawking\" noises he makes.\n\nTo Chase's complaints about his relationship crisis with Cameron, Taub responds by talking about toxic chemicals of male fruit flies.

H\u00e9risson de Porc-Epic, an ambassador, and his wife, Alo\u00e8s, arrive, accompanied by his secretary, Tapioca, and Laoula, the daughter of a neighboring monarch. They are traveling incognito, and the princess is being passed off as H\u00e9risson's wife. Their mission, of which Laoula is unaware, is to marry her to Ouf. Complications arise when Laoula and a poor pedlar, Lazuli, fall in love at first sight. Scolded for flirting, Lazuli insults the disguised king and thus becomes a desired candidate for death by impalement. But Siroco, the king's astrologer, reveals that the fates of the king and the pedlar are inextricably linked; the stars predict that they will die within 24 hours of each other. Fortunes change again, and Lazuli is escorted with honors into the palace.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nLazuli, feted and well fed, grows bored with luxury and longs for Laoula. Ouf, still unaware of the disguises, furthers the lovers' hopes of marriage by imprisoning the supposed husband, H\u00e9risson. The lovers depart but H\u00e9risson escapes and orders the pedlar to be shot. Gunfire is heard, but although Laoula is brought in there is no sign of Lazuli. Ouf bemoans his impending death.\n\n=== Act 3 ===\nLazuli, having escaped harm, overhears Ouf, Siroco and H\u00e9risson discussing the situation, and eventually reveals himself to Laoula. They plan a second elopement. The king and Siroco try to raise their spirits with a large glass of [[Chartreuse (liqueur)|green chartreuse]]. Ouf, desperate to produce an heir to the throne, plans to marry Laoula, even if for an hour, but finds that he has run out of time. However, when the clocks strike five and nothing happens, Ouf declares that the astrologer's predictions must have been wrong. The Chief of Police then appears with Lazuli, who was caught on his way out of the country. The King blesses Lazuli and Laoula's marriage. In a general final chorus Lazuli and Laoula address the audience to a reprise of act 1 finale.\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n*Delage, Roger, ''Emmanuel Chabrier''.

H\u00e9risson de Porc-Epic, an ambassador, and his wife, Alo\u00e8s, arrive, accompanied by his secretary, Tapioca, and Laoula, the daughter of a neighboring monarch. They are traveling incognito, and the princess is being passed off as H\u00e9risson's wife. Their mission, of which Laoula is unaware, is to marry her to Ouf. Complications arise when Laoula and a poor pedlar, Lazuli, fall in love at first sight. Scolded for flirting, Lazuli insults the disguised king and thus becomes a desired candidate for death by impalement. But Siroco, the king's astrologer, reveals that the fates of the king and the pedlar are inextricably linked; the stars predict that they will die within 24 hours of each other. Fortunes change again, and Lazuli is escorted with honors into the palace.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nLazuli, feted and well fed, grows bored with luxury and longs for Laoula. Ouf, still unaware of the disguises, furthers the lovers' hopes of marriage by imprisoning the supposed husband, H\u00e9risson. The lovers depart but H\u00e9risson escapes and orders the pedlar to be shot. Gunfire is heard, but although Laoula is brought in there is no sign of Lazuli. Ouf bemoans his impending death.\n\n=== Act 3 ===\nLazuli, having escaped harm, overhears Ouf, Siroco and H\u00e9risson discussing the situation, and eventually reveals himself to Laoula. They plan a second elopement. The king and Siroco try to raise their spirits with a large glass of [[Chartreuse (liqueur)|green chartreuse]]. Ouf, desperate to produce an heir to the throne, plans to marry Laoula, even if for an hour, but finds that he has run out of time. However, when the clocks strike five and nothing happens, Ouf declares that the astrologer's predictions must have been wrong. The Chief of Police then appears with Lazuli, who was caught on his way out of the country. The King blesses Lazuli and Laoula's marriage. In a general final chorus Lazuli and Laoula address the audience to a reprise of act 1 finale.\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n*Delage, Roger, ''Emmanuel Chabrier''.

The series premiered on October 13, 2014 on [[The CW]] and concluded on July 31, 2019. It is a loose adaptation of the Venezuelan telenovela ''[[Juana la virgen|Juana la Virgen]]'' created by [[Perla Far\u00edas]].
