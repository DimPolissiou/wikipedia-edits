(October 1967), 60.</ref> He commanded successfully during the [[World War I|First World War]] and became one of the [[German Empire]]'s most prominent and competent military leaders. After the Armistice, Mackensen was interned for a year. He retired from the army in 1920 and was made a [[Prussia]]n state councillor in 1933 by [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]. During the [[Nazi era]], Mackensen remained a committed [[monarchism|monarchist]] and sometimes appeared at official functions in his First World War uniform. He was suspected of disloyalty to the [[Third Reich]], although nothing was proven against him.\n\n==Early years==\n\nMackensen was born in Haus Leipnitz, near the village of Dahlenberg (today part of [[Trossin]]) in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Saxony]], to Ludwig and Marie Louise Mackensen. His father, an administrator of agricultural enterprises, sent him to a ''[[Gymnasium (Germany)|Realgymnasium]]'' in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in 1865, seemingly in the hope that his eldest son  would follow him in his profession.<ref>Theo Schwarzm\u00fcller, ''Zwischen Kaiser und \"F\u00fchrer\".

Her father {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl von Horn|de|3=Karl von Horn (K\u00f6nigsberg)}} was the influential ''[[Oberpr\u00e4sident]]'' of [[East Prussia]]; they had two daughters and three sons.  In 1891 Mackensen was appointed to the [[German General Staff|General Staff]] in Berlin, bypassing the usual three-year preparation in the War Academy.  His chief, [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmuth von Moltke]], found him a \"lovable character\"<ref>Schwarzm\u00fcller, 1997, p. 49.</ref> He was recalled from the regiment to serve as an adjutant to the next chief, [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] (in office 1891-1906), whom he regarded as a great instructor on how to lead armies of millions.<ref>Schwarzm\u00fcller, 1997, p.65.</ref>[[File:Von Mackensen coat.png|100px|thumbnail|right|Mackensen's coat of arms (uncoloured)]] He impressed Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who ordered that Mackensen be given command from 17 June 1893 of the 1st Life Hussars Regiment (''[[:de:1.

For the next three and a half years he shadowed  the Kaiser, meeting the high and mighty of Germany, the rest of Europe, and the Middle East. His sons shared gymnastics classes with the Kaiser's.   He was ennobled on the Kaiser's 40th birthday, 27 January 1899, becoming ''August von Mackensen''.<ref>Schwarzm\u00fcller, 1997, p.6 5.</ref>  Next he received the  command of the newly created Life Hussar Brigade (''Leib-Husaren-Brigade'') from 1901 to 1903, and from 1903 to 1908 commanded the [[36th Division (German Empire)|36th Division]] in [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]].<ref>Wegner, 1993, p. 131 and p. 463.</ref> He became a widower in 1905, and two years later married Leonie von der Osten, who was 22 years old.

In response to desperate pleas the German supreme commander [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] agreed to an offensive against the Russian flank by an Austro-German Army under a German commander.  The reluctant Austro-Hungarian supreme command agreed that the tactful Mackensen was the best choice for  commanding the coalition army. [[Army Group Mackensen (Poland)|Army Group Mackensen]] (''Heeresgruppe Mackensen'') was established containing a new German Eleventh Army, also under his command, and the Austro-Hungarian Fourth Army.

The campaign crushed effective military resistance in Serbia but failed to destroy the Serbian army, half of which  managed to withdraw to Entente-held ports in Albania and, after recuperation and rearmament by the French and the Italians, reentered fighting on the [[Macedonian front]]. When Mackensen returned to  Vienna he was honored by a dinner and a personal audience with the [[Emperor Franz Joseph]], and was decorated with the magnificently jeweled [[Military Merit Cross (Austria-Hungary)|Military Merit Cross 1st Class]] with Diamonds, a unique award for a foreigner.\n\nVon Mackensen appears to have had great respect for the Serbian army and Serbians generally.  Before departing to the Serbian front in 1915, he spoke to his men:\n\n\"You are not going to the Italian, Russian, or French front.  You are going into battle against a new enemy - dangerous, tough, fearless and sharp.  You are going to the Serbian front and Serbia. Serbs are people who love their freedom, and who will fight to the last man.

By 8 September they had taken the two major forts on the right bank of the Danube, [[Battle of Turtucaia|the first in a single day]] by a force that was outnumbered by the besieged, who were overwhelmed by Mackensen's artillery.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Norman|title=The Eastern Front 1914-1917|url=https://archive.org/details/easternfront191400norm|url-access=registration|date=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/easternfront191400norm/page/277 277\u2013281]|origyear=1971}}</ref> Then a German and Austro-Hungarian army group, commanded by Falkenhayn [[Second Battle of the Jiu Valley|broke into Wallachia]] through the [[Vulcan Pass|Vulkan Pass]] in the Transylvanian Carpathian mountains, while Mackensen crossed the Danube by seizing bridgeheads on the left bank to shield the Austro-Hungarian engineers who built the long pontoon bridge.

Since now he wore every Prussian medal, the Kaiser decided to name a battlecruiser after him, which became the first in a new [[Mackensen-class battlecruiser|class]].<ref>G. M\u00fcller, ''The Kaiser and his court'', London, Macdonald, 1951 p. 222</ref> Mackensen became the military governor of the large part of Romania (mainly [[Wallachia]]) occupied by the Central Powers. He proposed making a German prince King of Romania but the initiative fell through. His last campaign was an attempt to destroy the Romanian Army, which had been reorganized after the [[Kerensky Offensive]]. At M\u0103r\u0103\u015fe\u015fti both sides took heavy losses, but with the Romanian army emerging victorious (see [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u015fe\u015fti]]). Mackensen maintained that he had never been defeated in battle, and surely was the most consistently successful senior general on either side in World War I. By December 1917, the Russian Army had collapsed and Romania was forced to sign the [[Armistice of Foc\u0219ani]], followed by the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Bucharest Peace Treaty]]. After the armistice, he and the 200,000 men he was leading back home were rounded up in Hungary by General [[Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]]'s Allied army (namely by the Serbian units) and held as a military prisoner in Futog (Serbia), until November 1919.<ref>Schwartzm\u00fcller, 1997, p. 170 and p. 178.</ref> He was one of the 896 Germans on the Allied list of accused war criminals, which eventually was allowed to lapse.\n\n==Post-war career==\nBy 1920, Mackensen retired from the army. Although standing in opposition to the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the newly established [[parliamentary system]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], he initially avoided public campaigns. Around 1924 he changed his mind and began to use his image as a war hero to support right-wing [[Monarchism|monarchist]] and [[German nationalism|nationalist]] groups. He routinely appeared in his old Life Hussars uniform and became very active in pro-military [[Conservative Revolutionary movement|conservative]] organisations, particularly ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' and the Schlieffen Society, advocating the [[Stab-in-the-back myth]] and openly endorsing the murder of Minister [[Matthias Erzberger]] in 1921.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F051618-0053, Berlin, Heldengedenktag, Mackensen, Hitler, Blomberg.jpg|thumb|left|Mackensen and Hitler in 1935 during the Heldengedenktag in Berlin]] \nDuring the [[1932 German presidential election|German presidential election of 1932]], Mackensen supported [[Paul von Hindenburg]] against [[Adolf Hitler]], whose political skills he nevertheless admired; after Hitler gained power in January 1933, Mackensen became a visible, if only symbolic, supporter of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime. One of his ceremonial visits brought him to Passau, where he received a hero's welcome.<ref>Anna Rosmus ''Hitlers Nibelungen'', Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 111f.</ref> Occasionally mocked as \"Reich Centrepiece\", Mackensen's distinctive public profile, in his black Life Hussars uniform, was even recognized by the Hausser-Elastolin company, which produced a 7-cm figure of him in its line of [[Elastolin]] composition soldiers.<ref>(Figure #651/1)[See: ''Hausser Elastolin Spielzeug 1939-40'' (toy catalog)]</ref> His fame and familiar uniform gave rise to two separate Third Reich units adopting black dress with ''Totenkopf'' badges: the ''[[Panzerwaffe]]'', which claimed the tradition of the Imperial cavalry; and the [[Schutzstaffel]]. In October 1935, the government vested Mackensen with the [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] demesne of [[Br\u00fcssow]] in recognition of his merits.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L19106, Doorn, Beisetzung Kaiser Wilhelm II..jpg|thumb|Mackensen at the Kaiser's funeral]]\nMackensen's relationship to the Nazis remained ambiguous: embodying the [[Prussia]]n traditions adopted by Hitler's regime, he appeared in his black uniform at public events organized by the German government or the [[Nazi Party]], such as the [[Day of Potsdam]] on 21 March 1933. On the other hand, he objected to the killing of Generals [[Ferdinand von Bredow]] and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] during [[The Night of the Long Knives]] purge of July 1934, the Nazi ''[[Kirchenkampf]]'' measures against the [[Confessing Church]], and also to the atrocities committed during the [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939. By the early 1940s, Hitler and [[Joseph Goebbels]] suspected Mackensen of disloyalty, but refrained from taking action.<ref>[[Norman J.W. Goda|Norman J. W.

Upon the arrival of the British, apparently not commenting whatsoever on the general rout, the 95-year-old Mackensen merely asked the new powers-that-be that \"freed foreign workers\" be prevented \"from stealing his chicken\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/1945RadioNews 1945 Radio News], \"1945-04-15 CBS World News Today\" at around 14:25, at archive.org.</ref>\n\nMackensen died on 8 November 1945 at the age of 95, his life having spanned the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[North German Confederation]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]], [[The Third Reich]], and the post-war [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied occupation of Germany]].

Many turn to me, sometimes with wishes, but more often with their concerns.\n:During these weeks our concern is with the spirit of our unique and successful Army. The concern results from the crimes committed in Poland, looting and murder that take place before the eyes of our troops, who appear unable to put an end to them. An apparent indifference has serious consequences for the morale of our soldiers and it is damaging to the esteem of our Army and our whole nation.\n:I am sure that you are aware of these events and that you certainly condemn them. These lines intend to convey my daily growing concern at the reports that constantly reach me, and I have to ask you to take up this matter with the highest authority. The messages I receive are so numerous, many come from high ranking persons and from witnesses. As the most senior officer I cannot keep them to myself. In transmitting them to you, I fulfil my duty to the Army. The honour of the Army and the esteem in which it is held must not be jeopardised by the actions of hired subhumans and criminals.

Mackensen had his corps moving out on a twenty-five kilometer march to the [[Krasnaya River|Rominte River]] within fifty minutes of receiving his orders on the afternoon of 19 August 1914 when the [[Imperial Russian Army]] [[Russian invasion of East Prussia (1914)|invaded East Prussia]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Showalter|first1=Denis.

On 27 November 1914 Mackensen was awarded the ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'', Prussia's highest military order, for successful battles around [[Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (1914)|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] and [[Warsaw]].\n\nBy April 1915 the Russians had conquered  all of western [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], the  Austro-Hungarian slice of  partitioned Poland, and were pushing toward Hungary.  In response to desperate pleas the German supreme commander [[Erich von Falkenhayn]] agreed to an offensive against the Russian flank by an Austro-German Army under a German commander.  The reluctant Austro-Hungarian supreme command agreed that the tactful Mackensen was the best choice for  commanding the coalition army. [[Army Group Mackensen (Poland)|Army Group Mackensen]] (''Heeresgruppe Mackensen'') was established containing a new German Eleventh Army, also under his command, and the Austro-Hungarian Fourth Army.  As chief of staff  he was assigned  [[Hans von Seeckt]], who described Mackensen as an amiable, \"hands-on commander with the instincts of a hunter.\u201d <ref>Schwarzm\u00fcller, 1997, p. 105.</ref>   His army group, which had an overwhelming advantage in artillery,  smashed through the Russian lines between [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|Gorlice and Tarnow]] and then continued eastward, never giving the Russians time to establish an effective defense, retaking most of eastern Galicia by recapturing [[Przemy\u015bl]] and [[Lemberg]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=DiNardo|first1=Robert L.|title=The Gorlice-Tarnow campaign, 1915|date=2010|publisher=Praeger}}</ref>  The joint operation was a great victory for the Central Powers; they had advanced 310&nbsp;km (186&nbsp;mi), and soon thereafter the Russians [[Great Retreat (Russian)|pulled out of all of Poland]].\n \nMackensen was awarded oak leaves to his ''[[Pour le M\u00e9rite]]'' on 3 June 1915 and promoted to [[Generalfeldmarschall|field marshal]] on 22 June. He also received the  [[Order of the Black Eagle]], Prussia's highest-ranking order of knighthood, as well as  numerous honors from other German states and Germany's allies, including the Grand Cross of the [[Military Order of Max Joseph]], the highest military honor of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], on 4 June 1915.\n\n===Serbian campaign===\n{{main|Serbian Campaign (World War I)}}\n[[File:WW1-Belgrade-Kosutnjak-Monument.jpg|World War I monument erected by Mackensen{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} to the Serbian defenders of Belgrade.

The campaign crushed effective military resistance in Serbia but failed to destroy the Serbian army, half of which  managed to withdraw to Entente-held ports in Albania and, after recuperation and rearmament by the French and the Italians, reentered fighting on the [[Macedonian front]]. When Mackensen returned to  Vienna he was honored by a dinner and a personal audience with the [[Emperor Franz Joseph]], and was decorated with the magnificently jeweled [[Military Merit Cross (Austria-Hungary)|Military Merit Cross 1st Class]] with Diamonds, a unique award for a foreigner.\n\nVon Mackensen appears to have had great respect for the Serbian army and Serbians generally.  Before departing to the Serbian front in 1915, he spoke to his men:\n\n\"You are not going to the Italian, Russian, or French front.  You are going into battle against a new enemy - dangerous, tough, fearless and sharp.  You are going to the Serbian front and Serbia. Serbs are people who love their freedom, and who will fight to the last man.

Since now he wore every Prussian medal, the Kaiser decided to name a battlecruiser after him, which became the first in a new [[Mackensen-class battlecruiser|class]].<ref>G. M\u00fcller, ''The Kaiser and his court'', London, Macdonald, 1951 p. 222</ref> Mackensen became the military governor of the large part of Romania (mainly [[Wallachia]]) occupied by the Central Powers. He proposed making a German prince King of Romania but the initiative fell through. His last campaign was an attempt to destroy the Romanian Army, which had been reorganized after the [[Kerensky Offensive]]. At M\u0103r\u0103\u015fe\u015fti both sides took heavy losses, but with the Romanian army emerging victorious (see [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u015fe\u015fti]]). Mackensen maintained that he had never been defeated in battle, and surely was the most consistently successful senior general on either side in World War I. By December 1917, the Russian Army had collapsed and Romania was forced to sign the [[Armistice of Foc\u0219ani]], followed by the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Bucharest Peace Treaty]]. After the armistice, he and the 200,000 men he was leading back home were rounded up in Hungary by General [[Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey]]'s Allied army (namely by the Serbian units) and held as a military prisoner in Futog (Serbia), until November 1919.<ref>Schwartzm\u00fcller, 1997, p. 170 and p. 178.</ref> He was one of the 896 Germans on the Allied list of accused war criminals, which eventually was allowed to lapse.\n\n==Post-war career==\nBy 1920, Mackensen retired from the army. Although standing in opposition to the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the newly established [[parliamentary system]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], he initially avoided public campaigns. Around 1924 he changed his mind and began to use his image as a war hero to support right-wing [[Monarchism|monarchist]] and [[German nationalism|nationalist]] groups. He routinely appeared in his old Life Hussars uniform and became very active in pro-military [[Conservative Revolutionary movement|conservative]] organisations, particularly ''[[Der Stahlhelm, Bund der Frontsoldaten|Der Stahlhelm]]'' and the Schlieffen Society, advocating the [[Stab-in-the-back myth]] and openly endorsing the murder of Minister [[Matthias Erzberger]] in 1921.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F051618-0053, Berlin, Heldengedenktag, Mackensen, Hitler, Blomberg.jpg|thumb|left|Mackensen and Hitler in 1935 during the Heldengedenktag in Berlin]] \nDuring the [[1932 German presidential election|German presidential election of 1932]], Mackensen supported [[Paul von Hindenburg]] against [[Adolf Hitler]], whose political skills he nevertheless admired; after Hitler gained power in January 1933, Mackensen became a visible, if only symbolic, supporter of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime. One of his ceremonial visits brought him to Passau, where he received a hero's welcome.<ref>Anna Rosmus ''Hitlers Nibelungen'', Samples Grafenau 2015, pp. 111f.</ref> Occasionally mocked as \"Reich Centrepiece\", Mackensen's distinctive public profile, in his black Life Hussars uniform, was even recognized by the Hausser-Elastolin company, which produced a 7-cm figure of him in its line of [[Elastolin]] composition soldiers.<ref>(Figure #651/1)[See: ''Hausser Elastolin Spielzeug 1939-40'' (toy catalog)]</ref> His fame and familiar uniform gave rise to two separate Third Reich units adopting black dress with ''Totenkopf'' badges: the ''[[Panzerwaffe]]'', which claimed the tradition of the Imperial cavalry; and the [[Schutzstaffel]]. In October 1935, the government vested Mackensen with the [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] demesne of [[Br\u00fcssow]] in recognition of his merits.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L19106, Doorn, Beisetzung Kaiser Wilhelm II..jpg|thumb|Mackensen at the Kaiser's funeral]]\nMackensen's relationship to the Nazis remained ambiguous: embodying the [[Prussia]]n traditions adopted by Hitler's regime, he appeared in his black uniform at public events organized by the German government or the [[Nazi Party]], such as the [[Day of Potsdam]] on 21 March 1933. On the other hand, he objected to the killing of Generals [[Ferdinand von Bredow]] and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] during [[The Night of the Long Knives]] purge of July 1934, the Nazi ''[[Kirchenkampf]]'' measures against the [[Confessing Church]], and also to the atrocities committed during the [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939. By the early 1940s, Hitler and [[Joseph Goebbels]] suspected Mackensen of disloyalty, but refrained from taking action.<ref>[[Norman J.W. Goda|Norman J. W.

Upon the arrival of the British, apparently not commenting whatsoever on the general rout, the 95-year-old Mackensen merely asked the new powers-that-be that \"freed foreign workers\" be prevented \"from stealing his chicken\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/1945RadioNews 1945 Radio News], \"1945-04-15 CBS World News Today\" at around 14:25, at archive.org.</ref>\n\nMackensen died on 8 November 1945 at the age of 95, his life having spanned the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[North German Confederation]], the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]], [[The Third Reich]], and the post-war [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied occupation of Germany]].

Many turn to me, sometimes with wishes, but more often with their concerns.\n:During these weeks our concern is with the spirit of our unique and successful Army. The concern results from the crimes committed in Poland, looting and murder that take place before the eyes of our troops, who appear unable to put an end to them. An apparent indifference has serious consequences for the morale of our soldiers and it is damaging to the esteem of our Army and our whole nation.\n:I am sure that you are aware of these events and that you certainly condemn them. These lines intend to convey my daily growing concern at the reports that constantly reach me, and I have to ask you to take up this matter with the highest authority. The messages I receive are so numerous, many come from high ranking persons and from witnesses. As the most senior officer I cannot keep them to myself. In transmitting them to you, I fulfil my duty to the Army. The honour of the Army and the esteem in which it is held must not be jeopardised by the actions of hired subhumans and criminals.

It was released in a [[Product bundling|bundle]], ''[[The Orange Box]],'' for [[Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], and has been since ported to other systems, including [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (via [[Nvidia Shield]]).\n\n''Portal'' consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using \"the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], is challenged and taunted by an [[artificial intelligence]] named [[GLaDOS]] (Genetic Lifeform and [[Disk Operating System]]) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows kinetic energy to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game ''[[Narbacular Drop]]''; many of the team members from the [[DigiPen Institute of Technology]] who worked on ''Narbacular Drop'' were hired by Valve for the creation of ''Portal'', making it a [[spiritual successor]] to the game.\n\n''Portal'' was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007, despite criticisms of its short duration and limited story. The game received praise for its originality, unique gameplay and dark story with a humorous series of dialogue. GLaDOS, voiced by [[Ellen McLain]] in the English-language version, received acclaim for her unique characterization, and the end credits song \"[[Still Alive]]\", written by [[Jonathan Coulton]] for the game, was praised for its original composition and humorous twist. ''Portal'' is often cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. Excluding Steam download sales, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release, spawning official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of the cake and portal gun. A standalone version, titled ''[[Portal: Still Alive]]'', was released on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service in October 2008, which added 14 puzzles to the gameplay, and a sequel, ''[[Portal 2]]'', which was released in 2011, adding several new gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer mode.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 150\n| image1 = Portal physics-2.svg\n| caption1 = A representation of how the ([[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of) [[linear momentum]] is conserved through portals. By jumping into the blue portal, the character is launched out of the orange portal and onto the platform on the right.\n| image2 = Portal physics-3.svg\n| caption2 = A more advanced portal technique. The character builds up speed using two blue portals, to reach an otherwise unreachable area. The second blue portal is carefully created in mid-air, after exiting the orange portal for the first time, destroying the first blue portal in the process.\n}}\n\nIn ''Portal'', the player controls the protagonist, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] as she is challenged to navigate through a series of rooms using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or portal gun, under the watchful supervision of the artificial intelligence [[GLaDOS]]. The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. The portals create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in [[three-dimensional space]]. Neither end is specifically an entrance or exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. An important aspect of the game's physics is momentum redirection.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video game|title = Portal|developer = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|date = October 9, 2007|level = In-game developer commentary}}</ref> As moving objects pass through portals, they come through the exit portal at the same direction that the exit portal is facing and with the same speed with which they passed through the entrance portal.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3770/games_demystified_portal.php | title = Games Demystified: Portal | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | first = Jeremy | last = Alessi | date = August 26, 2008 | accessdate = August 28, 2008}}</ref> For example, a common maneuver is to jump down to a portal on the floor and emerge through a wall, flying over a gap or another obstacle. This allows the player to launch objects or Chell over great distances, both vertically and horizontally, referred to as 'flinging' by Valve.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> As GLaDOS puts it, \"In layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.\" If portal ends are not on parallel planes, the character passing through is reoriented to be upright with respect to gravity after leaving a portal end.\n\nChell and all other objects in the game that can fit into the portal ends will pass through the portal. However, a portal shot cannot pass through an open portal; it will simply deactivate or create a new portal in an offset position. Creating a portal end instantly deactivates an existing portal end of the same color. Moving objects, glass, special wall surfaces, liquids, or areas that are too small will not be able to anchor portals. Chell is sometimes provided with cubes that she can pick up and use to climb on or to hold down large buttons that open doors or activate mechanisms. Particle fields, known as \"Emancipation Grills\", occasionally called \"Fizzlers\" in the developer commentary, exist at the end of all and within some test chambers; when passed through, they will deactivate any active portals and disintegrate any object carried through. These fields also block attempts to fire portals through them.<ref name=\"360 manual\">{{cite book | title = The Orange Box manual (Xbox 360 version) | publisher = Valve | year = 2007 | pages = 12\u201317}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Chell is equipped with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling,<ref name=\"commentary\" /> she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and by a series of crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no [[Health (gaming)|health]] indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.\n\n[[GameSpot]] noted, in its initial review of ''Portal'', that many solutions exist for completing each puzzle, and that the gameplay \"gets even crazier, and the diagrams shown in the trailer showed some incredibly crazy things that you can attempt\".<ref name=\"gamespotarticle1\">{{cite web |url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-episode-two-the-return-of-team-fortress-2-and-other-surprises/1100-6154006/|title = Half-Life 2: Episode Two&nbsp;\u2014 The Return of Team Fortress 2 and Other Surprises |accessdate = July 21, 2006 |author = Ocampo |date = July 13, 2006 |publisher = [[GameSpot]] |first = Jason}}</ref> Two additional modes are unlocked upon the completion of the game that challenge the player to work out alternative methods of solving each test chamber.

However, after becoming mentally unstable from \"moon rock poisoning\" in 1978, Johnson created a three-tier [[research and development]] plan to make his organization successful. The first two tiers, the [[Abdominal thrusts|Counter-Heimlich Maneuver]] (a maneuver designed to ensure choking) and the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Take-A-Wish Foundation]] (a program to give the wishes of terminally ill children to adults in need of dreams), were commercial failures and led to an investigation of the company by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].

Chell enters into distinct chambers that introduce players to the game's mechanics, sequentially. GLaDOS's announcements serve as instructions to Chell and help the player progress through the game, but also develops the atmosphere and characterizes the AI as a person.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> Chell is promised [[cake]] as her reward if she completes all test chambers.<ref name=\"gamespy pc review\">{{cite web | url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/portal/826434p1.html |title=Portal (PC) |first=Sal | last = Accardo | date = October 9, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = GameSpy}}</ref>\n\nChell proceeds through the empty Enrichment Center, with GLaDOS as her only interaction. As the player nears completion, GLaDOS's motives and behavior turn more sinister; although she is designed to appear encouraging, GLaDOS's actions and speech suggest insincerity and callous disregard for the safety and well-being of the test subjects. The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test. However, GLaDOS declares it must be [[Euthanasia|euthanized]] in an \"emergency intelligence [[incinerator]]\" before Chell can continue.<ref name=\"1up pc review\" /> Some later chambers include automated turrets with childlike voices (also voiced by McLain) that fire at Chell, only to sympathize with her after being destroyed or disabled.<ref name=\"eurogamer pc review\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=85005 |title=Portal |first=Tom |last = Bradwell |date=October 10, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = Eurogamer}}</ref><ref name=\"ign pc review\">{{cite web | url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/825/825987p1.html | title = Portal Review | first = Dan | last = Adams | date = October 9, 2007 | accessdate = February 25, 2008 | publisher = IGN}}</ref>\n\nAfter Chell completes the final test chamber, GLaDOS maneuvers Chell into an incinerator in an attempt to kill her.

GLaDOS then asks Chell to assume the \"party escort submission position\", lying face-first on the ground, so that a \"party associate\" can take her to her reward, but Chell continues her escape. In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.<ref name=\"labrat part 1\" /><ref name=\"labrat part 2\" /> Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and [[pastiche]]s of [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poem \"The Chariot\", [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and [[Emily Bront\u00eb]]'s \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with  taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of ''[[Portal 2]]'', the ending was expanded in a later update.

It was released in a [[Product bundling|bundle]], ''[[The Orange Box]],'' for [[Windows]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]], and has been since ported to other systems, including [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (via [[Nvidia Shield]]).\n\n''Portal'' consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using \"the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\", a device that can create inter-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], is challenged and taunted by an [[artificial intelligence]] named [[GLaDOS]] (Genetic Lifeform and [[Disk Operating System]]) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The game's unique physics allows kinetic energy to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers. This gameplay element is based on a similar concept from the game ''[[Narbacular Drop]]''; many of the team members from the [[DigiPen Institute of Technology]] who worked on ''Narbacular Drop'' were hired by Valve for the creation of ''Portal'', making it a [[spiritual successor]] to the game.\n\n''Portal'' was acclaimed as one of the most original games of 2007, despite criticisms of its short duration and limited story. The game received praise for its originality, unique gameplay and dark story with a humorous series of dialogue. GLaDOS, voiced by [[Ellen McLain]] in the English-language version, received acclaim for her unique characterization, and the end credits song \"[[Still Alive]]\", written by [[Jonathan Coulton]] for the game, was praised for its original composition and humorous twist. ''Portal'' is often cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. Excluding Steam download sales, over four million copies of the game have been sold since its release, spawning official merchandise from Valve including plush Companion Cubes, as well as fan recreations of the cake and portal gun. A standalone version, titled ''[[Portal: Still Alive]]'', was released on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service in October 2008, which added 14 puzzles to the gameplay, and a sequel, ''[[Portal 2]]'', which was released in 2011, adding several new gameplay mechanics and a cooperative multiplayer mode.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 150\n| image1 = Portal physics-2.svg\n| caption1 = A representation of how the ([[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of) [[linear momentum]] is conserved through portals.

The character builds up speed using two blue portals, to reach an otherwise unreachable area. The second blue portal is carefully created in mid-air, after exiting the orange portal for the first time, destroying the first blue portal in the process.\n}}\n\nIn ''Portal'', the player controls the protagonist, [[Chell (Portal)|Chell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]] as she is challenged to navigate through a series of rooms using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or portal gun, under the watchful supervision of the artificial intelligence [[GLaDOS]]. The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. The portals create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in [[three-dimensional space]]. Neither end is specifically an entrance or exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. An important aspect of the game's physics is momentum redirection.<ref name=\"commentary\">{{Cite video game|title = Portal|developer = [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|date = October 9, 2007|level = In-game developer commentary}}</ref> As moving objects pass through portals, they come through the exit portal at the same direction that the exit portal is facing and with the same speed with which they passed through the entrance portal.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3770/games_demystified_portal.php | title = Games Demystified: Portal | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | first = Jeremy | last = Alessi | date = August 26, 2008 | accessdate = August 28, 2008}}</ref> For example, a common maneuver is to jump down to a portal on the floor and emerge through a wall, flying over a gap or another obstacle. This allows the player to launch objects or Chell over great distances, both vertically and horizontally, referred to as 'flinging' by Valve.<ref name=\"commentary\" /> As GLaDOS puts it, \"In layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.\" If portal ends are not on parallel planes, the character passing through is reoriented to be upright with respect to gravity after leaving a portal end.\n\nChell and all other objects in the game that can fit into the portal ends will pass through the portal. However, a portal shot cannot pass through an open portal; it will simply deactivate or create a new portal in an offset position. Creating a portal end instantly deactivates an existing portal end of the same color. Moving objects, glass, special wall surfaces, liquids, or areas that are too small will not be able to anchor portals. Chell is sometimes provided with cubes that she can pick up and use to climb on or to hold down large buttons that open doors or activate mechanisms. Particle fields, known as \"Emancipation Grills\", occasionally called \"Fizzlers\" in the developer commentary, exist at the end of all and within some test chambers; when passed through, they will deactivate any active portals and disintegrate any object carried through. These fields also block attempts to fire portals through them.<ref name=\"360 manual\">{{cite book | title = The Orange Box manual (Xbox 360 version) | publisher = Valve | year = 2007 | pages = 12\u201317}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Chell is equipped with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling,<ref name=\"commentary\" /> she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and by a series of crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no [[Health (gaming)|health]] indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.\n\n[[GameSpot]] noted, in its initial review of ''Portal'', that many solutions exist for completing each puzzle, and that the gameplay \"gets even crazier, and the diagrams shown in the trailer showed some incredibly crazy things that you can attempt\".<ref name=\"gamespotarticle1\">{{cite web |url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-episode-two-the-return-of-team-fortress-2-and-other-surprises/1100-6154006/|title = Half-Life 2: Episode Two&nbsp;\u2014 The Return of Team Fortress 2 and Other Surprises |accessdate = July 21, 2006 |author = Ocampo |date = July 13, 2006 |publisher = [[GameSpot]] |first = Jason}}</ref> Two additional modes are unlocked upon the completion of the game that challenge the player to work out alternative methods of solving each test chamber.

The test chambers become increasingly dangerous as Chell proceeds, tests including a live-fire course designed for military androids, as well as some chambers flooded with a hazardous liquid. In another chamber, GLaDOS notes the importance of the Weighted Companion Cube, a waist-high crate with a single large pink heart on each face, for helping Chell to complete the test.

In this section, GLaDOS communes with Chell as it becomes clear the AI had killed everyone else in the center.<ref name=\"labrat part 1\" /><ref name=\"labrat part 2\" /> Chell makes her way through the maintenance areas and empty office spaces behind the chambers, sometimes following graffiti messages which point in the right direction. These backstage areas, which are in an extremely dilapidated state, stand in stark contrast to the pristine test chambers. The graffiti includes statements such as \"the cake is a lie\", and [[pastiche]]s of [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poem \"The Chariot\", [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s \"The Reaper and the Flowers\", and [[Emily Bront\u00eb]]'s \"No Coward Soul Is Mine\", referring to and mourning the death of the Companion Cube.<ref name=\"commentary\" />\n\nGLaDOS attempts to dissuade Chell with threats of physical harm and misleading statements as Chell makes her way deeper into the maintenance areas. Chell reaches a large chamber where GLaDOS's hardware hangs overhead. GLaDOS continues to threaten Chell, but during the exchange, a sphere falls off of GLaDOS and Chell drops it in an incinerator. GLaDOS reveals that Chell has just destroyed the morality core or her conscience, one of the multiple \"personality cores\" that Aperture Science employees installed after the AI flooded the enrichment center with neurotoxin gas. With it removed, she can access its emitters again. A six-minute countdown starts as Chell dislodges and incinerates more of GLaDOS' personality cores, while GLaDOS discourages her both verbally, with  taunts and juvenile insults, and physically by firing rockets at her. After Chell destroys the last personality core, a malfunction tears the room apart and transports everything to the surface. Chell is then seen lying outside the facility's gates amid the remains of GLaDOS. Following the announcement of ''[[Portal 2]]'', the ending was expanded in a later update.

The first estimate of the timing of magnetic reversals was made by [[Motonori Matuyama]] in the 1920s; he observed that rocks with reversed fields were all of early [[Pleistocene]] age or older. At the time, the Earth's polarity was poorly understood, and the possibility of reversal aroused little interest.<ref name=Cox1973>{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Allan|authorlink=Allan V.

Most paleomagnetic research in the late 1950s included an examination of the wandering of the poles and [[continental drift]]. Although it was discovered that some rocks would reverse their magnetic field while cooling, it became apparent that most magnetized volcanic rocks preserved traces of the Earth's magnetic field at the time the rocks had cooled. In the absence of reliable methods for obtaining absolute ages for rocks, it was thought that reversals occurred approximately every million years.<ref name=Cox1973 /><ref name=Glen/>\n\nThe next major advance in understanding reversals came when techniques for [[radiometric dating]] were improved in the 1950s. [[Allan V. Cox|Allan Cox]] and [[Richard Doell]], at the [[United States Geological Survey]], wanted to know whether reversals occurred at regular intervals, and invited the geochronologist [[Brent Dalrymple]] to join their group. They produced the first magnetic-polarity time scale in 1959. As they accumulated data, they continued to refine this scale in competition with Don Tarling and [[Ian McDougall (geologist)|Ian McDougall]] at the [[Australian National University]]. A group led by [[Neil D. Opdyke|Neil Opdyke]] at the [[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory]] showed that the same pattern of reversals was recorded in sediments from deep-sea cores.<ref name=Glen/>\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s information about variations in the Earth's magnetic field was gathered largely by means of research vessels, but the complex routes of ocean cruises rendered the association of navigational data with [[magnetometer]] readings difficult. Only when data were plotted on a map did it become apparent that remarkably regular and continuous magnetic stripes appeared on the ocean floors.<ref name=Cox1973 /><ref name=Glen/>\n\nIn 1963, [[Frederick Vine]] and [[Drummond Matthews]] provided a simple explanation by combining the [[seafloor spreading]] theory of [[Harry Hammond Hess|Harry Hess]] with the known time scale of reversals: new sea floor is magnetized in the direction of the then-current field. Thus, sea floor spreading from a central ridge will produce pairs of magnetic stripes parallel to the ridge.<ref name=vine1963>{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Anomalies over Oceanic Ridges|journal= Nature|date=1963|first=Frederick J.|last=Vine|author2=Drummond H.

The same magnetic anomalies were found over most of the world's oceans, which permitted estimates for when most of the oceanic crust had developed.<ref name=Cox1973 /><ref name=Glen/>\n\n==Observing past fields==\n[[File:Geomagnetic polarity 0-169 Ma.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Geomagnetic polarity since the middle [[Jurassic]].

[[Lawrence Morley|Lawrence W. Morley]], [[Fred Vine|Frederick John Vine]] and [[Drummond Matthews|Drummond Hoyle Matthews]] made the connection to seafloor spreading in the [[Morley\u2013Vine\u2013Matthews hypothesis]]<ref name= vine1963/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Morley|first=Lawrence W.|author2=A.

The relatively constant rate at which the [[Seafloor spreading|sea floor]] spreads results in substrate \"stripes\" from which past magnetic field polarity can be inferred from data gathered from towing a [[magnetometer]] along the sea floor.\n\nBecause no existing unsubducted sea floor (or [[ophiolites|sea floor thrust onto continental plates]]) is more than about {{mya|180|million years}} ([[Ma (unit)|Ma]]) old, other methods are necessary for detecting older reversals. Most [[sedimentary rock]]s incorporate tiny amounts of iron rich [[mineral]]s, whose orientation is influenced by the ambient magnetic field at the time at which they formed. These rocks can preserve a record of the field if it is not later erased by [[Diagenesis|chemical, physical or biological change]].\n\nBecause the magnetic field is global, similar patterns of magnetic variations at different sites may be used to correlate age in different locations. In the past four decades much paleomagnetic data about seafloor ages (up to ~{{mya|250| Ma}}) has been collected and is useful in estimating the age of geologic sections. Not an independent dating method, it depends on \"absolute\" age dating methods like radioisotopic systems to derive numeric ages. It has become especially useful to metamorphic and igneous geologists where [[index fossil]]s are seldom available.\n\n==Geomagnetic polarity time scale==\n{{further|Magnetostratigraphy}}\n\nThrough analysis of seafloor magnetic anomalies and dating of reversal sequences on land, paleomagnetists have been developing a ''Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale'' (GPTS). The current time scale contains 184 polarity intervals in the last 83{{nbsp}}million years (and therefore 183 reversals).<ref name=Cande>{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/94JB03098|last=Cande|first=S.

The first estimate of the timing of magnetic reversals was made by [[Motonori Matuyama]] in the 1920s; he observed that rocks with reversed fields were all of early [[Pleistocene]] age or older. At the time, the Earth's polarity was poorly understood, and the possibility of reversal aroused little interest.<ref name=Cox1973>{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Allan|authorlink=Allan V.

Most paleomagnetic research in the late 1950s included an examination of the wandering of the poles and [[continental drift]]. Although it was discovered that some rocks would reverse their magnetic field while cooling, it became apparent that most magnetized volcanic rocks preserved traces of the Earth's magnetic field at the time the rocks had cooled. In the absence of reliable methods for obtaining absolute ages for rocks, it was thought that reversals occurred approximately every million years.<ref name=Cox1973 /><ref name=Glen/>\n\nThe next major advance in understanding reversals came when techniques for [[radiometric dating]] were improved in the 1950s. [[Allan V. Cox|Allan Cox]] and [[Richard Doell]], at the [[United States Geological Survey]], wanted to know whether reversals occurred at regular intervals, and invited the geochronologist [[Brent Dalrymple]] to join their group. They produced the first magnetic-polarity time scale in 1959. As they accumulated data, they continued to refine this scale in competition with Don Tarling and [[Ian McDougall (geologist)|Ian McDougall]] at the [[Australian National University]]. A group led by [[Neil D. Opdyke|Neil Opdyke]] at the [[Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory]] showed that the same pattern of reversals was recorded in sediments from deep-sea cores.<ref name=Glen/>\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s information about variations in the Earth's magnetic field was gathered largely by means of research vessels, but the complex routes of ocean cruises rendered the association of navigational data with [[magnetometer]] readings difficult. Only when data were plotted on a map did it become apparent that remarkably regular and continuous magnetic stripes appeared on the ocean floors.<ref name=Cox1973 /><ref name=Glen/>\n\nIn 1963, [[Frederick Vine]] and [[Drummond Matthews]] provided a simple explanation by combining the [[seafloor spreading]] theory of [[Harry Hammond Hess|Harry Hess]] with the known time scale of reversals: new sea floor is magnetized in the direction of the then-current field. Thus, sea floor spreading from a central ridge will produce pairs of magnetic stripes parallel to the ridge.<ref name=vine1963>{{cite journal|title=Magnetic Anomalies over Oceanic Ridges|journal= Nature|date=1963|first=Frederick J.|last=Vine|author2=Drummond H.

The same magnetic anomalies were found over most of the world's oceans, which permitted estimates for when most of the oceanic crust had developed.<ref name=Cox1973 /><ref name=Glen/>\n\n==Observing past fields==\n[[File:Geomagnetic polarity 0-169 Ma.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Geomagnetic polarity since the middle [[Jurassic]].

[[Lawrence Morley|Lawrence W.

The relatively constant rate at which the [[Seafloor spreading|sea floor]] spreads results in substrate \"stripes\" from which past magnetic field polarity can be inferred from data gathered from towing a [[magnetometer]] along the sea floor.\n\nBecause no existing unsubducted sea floor (or [[ophiolites|sea floor thrust onto continental plates]]) is more than about {{mya|180|million years}} ([[Ma (unit)|Ma]]) old, other methods are necessary for detecting older reversals. Most [[sedimentary rock]]s incorporate tiny amounts of iron rich [[mineral]]s, whose orientation is influenced by the ambient magnetic field at the time at which they formed. These rocks can preserve a record of the field if it is not later erased by [[Diagenesis|chemical, physical or biological change]].\n\nBecause the magnetic field is global, similar patterns of magnetic variations at different sites may be used to correlate age in different locations. In the past four decades much paleomagnetic data about seafloor ages (up to ~{{mya|250| Ma}}) has been collected and is useful in estimating the age of geologic sections. Not an independent dating method, it depends on \"absolute\" age dating methods like radioisotopic systems to derive numeric ages. It has become especially useful to metamorphic and igneous geologists where [[index fossil]]s are seldom available.\n\n==Geomagnetic polarity time scale==\n{{further|Magnetostratigraphy}}\n\nThrough analysis of seafloor magnetic anomalies and dating of reversal sequences on land, paleomagnetists have been developing a ''Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale'' (GPTS).

The Jurassic Quiet Zone in ocean magnetic anomalies was once thought to represent a superchron, but is now attributed to other causes.\n\nThe ''Cretaceous Normal'' (also called the ''Cretaceous Superchron'' or C34) lasted for almost 40{{nbsp}}million years, from about {{mya|120|83}}, including stages of the [[Cretaceous]] period from the [[Aptian]] through the [[Santonian]].

A Poisson process would have, on average, a constant reversal rate, so it is common to use a non-stationary Poisson process. However, compared to a Poisson process, there is a reduced probability of reversal for tens of thousands of years after a reversal. This could be due to an inhibition in the underlying mechanism, or it could just mean that some shorter polarity intervals have been missed.<ref name=Merrill/> A random reversal pattern with inhibition can be represented by a [[gamma process]].

Because the magnetic field is stable in either the present North-South orientation or a reversed orientation, they propose that when the field recovers from such a disruption it spontaneously chooses one state or the other, such that half the recoveries become reversals. However, the proposed mechanism does not appear to work in a quantitative model, and the evidence from [[stratigraphy]] for a correlation between reversals and impact events is weak.

By the turn of the 21st century, OLN became better known for its extensive coverage of the [[Tour de France]] but eventually began covering more \"mainstream\" sporting events, resulting in its relaunch as '''Versus''' in September 2006.\n\nIn 2011, [[Comcast]], the original owner of the network, acquired a majority stake in [[NBCUniversal]]. As a result, Comcast merged the operations of its pay channels with those of NBC. In particular, it aligned the operation of its sports channels with [[NBC]]'s sports division, [[NBC Sports]]. On January 1, 2012, Versus was rebranded as the '''NBC Sports Network''' (on-air branding later shortened to NBCSN) to reflect these changes. As of September 15, 2014, the majority of NBC Sports' operations, including NBCSN, is based in facilities in [[Stamford, Connecticut]].\n\nAs of September 2018, NBCSN is available to approximately 83.3 million households (90.2% of households with cable) in the United States.<ref>https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===As the Outdoor Life Network===\nThe channel originally launched as the '''Outdoor Life Network''' (or OLN) on July 1, 1995; the name was licensed from ''[[Outdoor Life]]'' magazine.

It originally launched on July 1, 1995, as the '''Outdoor Life Network''' (OLN), which was dedicated to programming primarily involving fishing, hunting, outdoor adventure programs, and outdoor sports. By the turn of the 21st century, OLN became better known for its extensive coverage of the [[Tour de France]] but eventually began covering more \"mainstream\" sporting events, resulting in its relaunch as '''Versus''' in September 2006.\n\nIn 2011, [[Comcast]], the original owner of the network, acquired a majority stake in [[NBCUniversal]]. As a result, Comcast merged the operations of its pay channels with those of NBC. In particular, it aligned the operation of its sports channels with [[NBC]]'s sports division, [[NBC Sports]]. On January 1, 2012, Versus was rebranded as the '''NBC Sports Network''' (on-air branding later shortened to NBCSN) to reflect these changes. As of September 15, 2014, the majority of NBC Sports' operations, including NBCSN, is based in facilities in [[Stamford, Connecticut]].\n\nAs of September 2018, NBCSN is available to approximately 83.3 million households (90.2% of households with cable) in the United States.<ref>https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===As the Outdoor Life Network===\nThe channel originally launched as the '''Outdoor Life Network''' (or OLN) on July 1, 1995; the name was licensed from ''[[Outdoor Life]]'' magazine. Its programming consisted of hunting, fishing, and outdoor adventure shows. In its early days, the channel reached around one million homes and found most of its carriage via the then-infant platforms of [[direct broadcast satellite]] services and [[digital cable]].<ref name=cnnsi-lance/>\n\nIn 1999, OLN acquired the U.S. broadcast rights to the [[Tour de France]] for US$3 million. Coverage of the ''Tour'' on OLN brought substantially greater viewership to the then fledgling channel, due in part to the then-growing popularity of American rider [[Lance Armstrong]]. In [[2004 Tour de France|2004]], where Armstrong would aim for a record-breaking sixth straight Tour de France title, OLN would devote over 344 hours in July to coverage of the ''Tour'', along with documentaries and other original programming surrounding the event \u2013 which was promoted through a $20 million advertising campaign.<ref name=sbd-oln-tdf>{{cite web|last=Bernstien|first=Andy|title=No word could describe the Tour de France, so OLN made one up|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2004/05/20040531/Media/No-Word-Could-Describe-The-Tour-De-France-So-OLN-Made-One-Up.aspx?hl=YES%20Network&sc=0|publisher=Sports Business Journal|accessdate=January 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOverall, while its coverage of the Tour de France helped OLN expand its carriage to over 60 million homes, critics became concerned that OLN's coverage had placed too much of its focus on Armstrong as its main attraction for viewers, and doubted if OLN could sustain itself without the viewership that Lance Armstrong's presence had brought to its coverage.<ref name=cnnsi-lance>{{cite news|last=Deitsch|first=Richard|title=Life after Lance: What happens to OLN once Armstrong finally retires from cycling?|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/writers/richard_deitsch/07/30/media.0730/|publisher=[[CNNSI]]|accessdate=January 2, 2012|date=July 30, 2004}}</ref> Some critics had jokingly referred to OLN as the \"Only Lance Network\" due to its overemphasis on the American rider.<ref name=nyt-sizingup>{{cite news|title=OLN Sizing Up Impact of the Post-Lance Era|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/sports/othersports/07sandomir.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=May 7, 2012|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|date=July 7, 2006}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[2005 Tour de France|2005]] ''Tour'' (where Armstrong captured his seventh victory in the race, and announced his retirement from cycling afterward), OLN debuted a new lineup of programming \u2013 anchored by repeats of the popular [[reality television|reality television series]] ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]''. OLN's executives believed that bringing ''Survivor'' into its lineup would fit well with the new direction it had planned for OLN, and could attract viewership from fans of the show who had watched it on [[CBS]].<ref name=oln-nhl-nyt/> Around the same period, OLN also acquired the rights to the [[Dakar Rally]], [[America's Cup]], the [[Boston Marathon]], and the [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race|Iditarod]]. OLN planned to cover these multi-day events in a similar style to how it covered the ''Tour'', hoping that its coverage might bring \"surprise\" results for the channel.<ref name=oln-nhl-nyt/> Due in part to Lance's absence from the ''Tour'' in 2006, its ratings for live coverage of the first four stages of the race drew in 49% fewer viewers than previous years.<ref name=nyt-sizingup/>\n\n====OLN and the NHL====\n[[File:John Lieswyn 341.jpg|thumb|OLN interview with [[John Lieswyn]] after him winning the [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater MN]] Criterion in 2005]]\nIn May 2005, [[ESPN]] rejected a $60 million offer to renew its [[ESPN National Hockey Night|broadcasting contract]] with the [[National Hockey League]] into the [[2005-06 NHL season]], and the league rejected its alternate proposal for a revenue sharing agreement similar to the one it had established with [[NHL on NBC|NBC]].

Because many veterans were trained to fly these planes, this led the way for many people to develop a business around aerial applications. Today professionals use planes powered by turboprop engines and are navigated by GPS for better accuracy.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/>\n\n== Major advantage ==\n\nThe major advantage of aerial seeding is the efficient coverage of a large area in the least amount of time. Aerial seeding facilitates seeding in areas that otherwise would be impossible to seed with traditional methods, such as land that is too hard to reach by non aircraft or ground conditions being far too wet. Aerial seeding may be used when existing crops are already planted. This is important when living in an area where there is a small window between harvesting the crop and the end of the growing season, because seeding cover crops after harvest can cause poor stand establishment due to cold temperatures or moisture.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nIt can also do consistency seeding which in an unaccessible area like hilly slopes.\n\n== Soil conditions ==\n\nSoil moisture plays a large role in the success of aerial seeding. Adequate soil moisture for germination and establishment of seed requires that the top 0.5 -1 inch be moist. These conditions should be at the time of the seeding or within 10 days of the seeding. If the required soil moisture is not present at these times, the seeds may become the target of predation by insects and other animals. Along with soil moisture, surface conditions also play a key role in the success of aerial seeding and establishment of seed.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n \nThe best soil surface conditions are those that are moist and friable. A loose and rough soil surface with cracks or residue cover is also very conducive to seed germination. These conditions allow for the seed to make the best contact with moist soil while adequately allowing the seed to settle into the ground. Another important factor besides soil surface conditions are that of timing of aerial seeding and seeding rates.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n== Timing and seeding rates==\n\nWhen aerial seeding a cover crop one must seed them at least 7 to 10 days before drilled cover crops. The reason for this is because the aerial seeding method is slower than that of the drilled method. Seeding rates for most plants should be 25% to 50% higher with aerial seeding when compared to other more conventional methods like drilling. These higher seeding rates are needed to establish same yields as other methods. This is mostly because with aerial seeding the seed can be often on the soil surface longer making the seed more susceptible to predation by birds, insects and other animals.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n== Helicopter vs. plane ==\n\nThere has been much debate with regards to which type of aircraft is better for aerial seeding. There is some evidence that shows helicopters may be best at the job when seeding in fields that are already established. This is because the wind from the blades of the helicopter causes the canopy of the already established crop to shake and open. This allows for more seed to reach the soil below. Another advantage for the helicopter is they are more maneuverable and can handle irregular shape fields while a plane has a harder time with such fields. The real advantage of the plane is it is faster than a helicopter and has the ability to carry a much heavier load. This allows the plane to finish the job much faster which equals less money spent in the air.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Agricultural drone]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051211124920/http://fire.r9.fws.gov/ifcc/Esr/Treatments/areal-seedingi.htm US Fish & Wildlife on aerial seeding]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20030803023438/http://ohioline.osu.edu/agf-fact/pdf/0105.pdf Ohio State University paper on aerial wheat seeding]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=0N4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA165 \"Bombing The Desert With Seed.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1947, p.&nbsp;165\u2013168, detailed article on post WW2 aerial seeding.\n\n[[Category:Seeds]]\n[[Category:Aviation]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Sowing seeds through aerial machinery}}\n'''Aerial seeding''' is a technique of sowing [[seed]]s by spraying them through aerial mechanical means such as a [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]], [[airplane|plane]] or [[helicopter]].\n \nAerial seeding is considered a [[broadcast seeding|broadcast method]] of seeding.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/agf-fact/pdf/0105.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030803023438/http://ohioline.osu.edu/agf-fact/pdf/0105.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-08-03 |title=Jeffers, D.
