It is the longest line on the \"L\" system and second busiest, with an average of 186,796 passengers boarding each weekday in September 2012.\n\nThe Blue Line and [[Red Line (CTA)|Red Line]] are the only two \"L\" lines to provide 24-hour service year-round, and the \"L\" is one of only five rapid transit systems in the United States to do so (the others are the [[PATCO Speedline]], [[Staten Island Railway]], the [[PATH (rail system)|PATH]] system, and the [[New York City Subway]]; the [[Metro Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]] of the [[Metro (Minnesota)|Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Metro]], a light rail system, also operates 24/7). The Blue Line is also one of only two lines with more than one station with the same name, with the [[Green Line (CTA)|Green Line]] being the other. (It has two stations at Harlem Avenue: one in the Kennedy Expressway on the Northwest side and one on the south side of the Eisenhower Expressway in [[Forest Park, Illinois]]. It also has two stations on Western Avenue: one on the Milwaukee Elevated and one on the Congress branch.) The Blue Line also has only two in-system transfers (all in the Loop), contains a combination of both the oldest and newest portions of 'L' tracks, and does not share tracks with any other 'L' line.\n\nBefore the adoption of color-coded names, the Blue Line was referred to as the '''West-Northwest''' Route (which it is still sometimes referred to as today) or more commonly, the '''O'Hare-Congress-Douglas''' route for its three branches. The Congress and Douglas branches were renamed for their terminals, '''Forest Park''' and '''54th/Cermak''', when the current color naming system was adopted in 1993. Blue Line service on the Douglas Branch was discontinued in April 2008 and replaced by the [[Pink Line (CTA)|Pink Line]].<ref name=\"CTAnews\">[http://www.transitchicago.com/blueline/ Chicago Transit Authority - Blue Line service]</ref>\n\nThe Blue Line is one of five 'L' lines that run into Chicago suburbs, with the others being the [[Green Line (CTA)|Green]], [[Purple Line (CTA)|Purple]], [[Pink Line (CTA)|Pink]], and [[Yellow Line (CTA)|Yellow]] lines. The Blue Line actually runs through three, making it the rail line that runs through the most suburbs on the Chicago 'L' system.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Logan Square branch|Cermak branch}}\nThe Blue Line is the successor to the [[Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad]], which built a series of 'L' lines servicing the West Side of Chicago beginning in 1895. The first section to be built by the Metropolitan extended west in the vicinity of Van Buren Street from an independent terminal at Canal and Jackson Streets to Marshfield Avenue, and then northward in the vicinity of Paulina Street to Damen and Milwaukee Avenues. Service on this section began on May 6, 1895.<ref>{{cite news|title=New \"L\" Road Opens|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=May 7, 1895|page=12}}</ref> The structure was completed from Damen Avenue to Logan Square on May 25, 1895.<ref>{{cite web |title=Logan Square |url=http://www.chicago-l.org/stations/logan_sq.html |website=chicago-l.org |publisher=Chicago-L.org |accessdate=16 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe next stage in the development of the West Side 'L' came on June 19, 1895, when the [[Garfield Park branch (CTA)|Garfield Park Branch]] was added, extending west in the vicinity of Van Buren Street and Harrison Street from Marshfield Avenue to Cicero Avenue.<ref>{{cite news|title=First Train on Garfield Park Division|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=June 18, 1895|page=2}}</ref> <!--June 17 was the first day of TESTING. \"Wednesday\" (June 19) was the day the line entered service.--> An extension of service over the tracks of the [[Aurora, Elgin and Chicago Railroad]] to [[Forest Park station|a new terminal at Desplaines Avenue]] was established on March 11, 1905. A subsequent extension to [[Westchester, Illinois|Westchester]] opened on October 1, 1926 over tracks that had originally been built by the CA&E with the intentions of building a bypass route.<ref name=Westchester>{{cite web |url=http://chicago-l.org/operations/lines/westchester.html |title=Westchester branch |accessdate=2009-02-21 |publisher=Chicago-L.org}}</ref> (Low ridership would prompt the CTA to discontinue service on the [[Westchester branch (CTA)|Westchester extension]] on December 9, 1951.<ref name=Westchester />)\n\nAnother branch line was added to the rapidly growing Metropolitan on July 29, 1895, when trains began operating over the [[Humboldt Park Branch]], splitting off from the Logan Square Branch at {{cta|Damen|Blue}} and running west alongside North Avenue to a terminal at Lawndale Avenue.<ref name=Humboldt>{{cite web |url=http://chicago-l.org/operations/lines/humboldt.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030228223318/http://chicago-l.org/operations/lines/humboldt.html |url-status=live |archive-date=2003-02-28 |title=Humboldt Park branch |accessdate=2009-02-21 |publisher=Chicago-L.org }}</ref> This was followed by still another addition when the Douglas Park Branch was placed in operation as far south as 18th Street on April 28, 1896.<ref name=Douglas>{{cite web |url=http://chicago-l.org/operations/lines/douglas.html |title=Douglas branch |accessdate=2009-02-21 |publisher=Chicago-L.org}}</ref>\n\nAs the southwest area of the city developed, the Douglas Park Branch was extended from 18th Street to Western Avenue in September 1896; to Pulaski Road in June 1902; to Cicero Avenue in December 1907; to Central Avenue in August 1912; to 62nd Avenue in August 1915, and to Oak Park Avenue in [[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]] on March 16, 1924. The [[Douglas Park (Chicago)|Douglas Park]] branch was later cut back to 54th Avenue in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]].\n\nThe Metropolitan West Side Elevated began service onto the Loop on October 11, 1897,<ref>{{cite news|title=Polly \"L\" on the Loop|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=October 11, 1897|page=11}}</ref> and a rush period [[Wells Street Terminal|stub terminal at Wells Street]] was added October 3, 1904. For much of the early 20th century and through the 1940s, service on the West Side Elevated lines went unchanged until 1947, when the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] took control of the 'L', initiating a series of massive service cuts and station closings (that would last until the 1980s).{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nThe Metropolitan lines began to be reshaped into the current Blue Line on February 25, 1951, when the CTA opened the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway, connecting the Logan Square Branch with the Loop on a fast, efficient and more direct routing to downtown, rather than the previous circuitous route that saw these trains entering the Loop at the southwest corner.<ref>{{cite news|last=Buck|first=Thomas|title=New Subway to Northwest Side Opened|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=February 25, 1951|page=1}}</ref> With opening of the Dearborn Subway, the old elevated alignment between Evergreen Portal and Marshfield Junction was decommissioned, used only for moving out-of-service rail cars. The northern section of the connection between Evergreen Avenue and Lake Street was demolished in the 1960s, leaving the Lake Street to Douglas Branch section\u2014better known as the Paulina Connector\u2014the only section still in operation. The Humboldt Park Branch was cut back to a full-time shuttle between Damen and Lawndale, and discontinued a year later on May 3, 1952.\n\nThe Garfield Park elevated was replaced by the Congress line on June 22, 1958,<ref>{{cite news|title=12,000 Ride CTA Congress Line on First Day|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=June 23, 1958|page=4}}</ref> pioneering the world's first use of rail rapid transit and a multi-lane automobile expressway in the same grade-separated right-of-way.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hail New Era of Transit in Congress Way|last=Thompson|first=John H.|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=June 21, 1958|page=7}}</ref> ([[Pacific Electric Railway]] \"Red Car\" tracks ran in the median of the Cahuenga Parkway in [[Los Angeles]] from 1944 until its expansion into the [[Hollywood Freeway]] in 1952, but the Pacific Electric service was an [[interurban streetcar]] rather than true rapid transit.) The new line connected with the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway at the [[Chicago River]] and extended westward to Des Plaines Avenue in Forest Park. Loomis Ramp, built at this same time, permitted Douglas trains to be rerouted through the subway as well combining the Logan Square, Garfield Park (now Congress) and Douglas routes into the second through service in Chicago, the Congress/Douglas-Milwaukee Line.<ref>{{cite news|last=Freeburg|first=Russel|title=It's Free! So 20,000 Ride on New CTA Line|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=June 22, 1958|page=3}}</ref>\n\nA five-mile (8&nbsp;km) extension of the route via a short subway connection and the [[Kennedy Expressway]] median from [[Logan Square, Chicago|Logan Square]] to [[Jefferson Park, Chicago|Jefferson]] [[Jefferson Park Transit Center|Park]] opened on February 1, 1970. It was also built by the City of Chicago using federal money. Just before Logan Square, trains diverted off of the old elevated structure and entered the subway under Milwaukee and Kedzie Avenues to a portal just south of Addison Street, then emerged in the median of the Kennedy Expressway to the temporary terminal at Jefferson Park. The increased ridership that resulted from the extension prompted the CTA to build the second phase of the project, and extend the line the rest of the way to O'Hare. In March 1980, construction began on the O'Hare Airport extension, with the first section between Jefferson Park and Rosemont opening on February 27, 1983,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and the final section to O'Hare on September 3, 1984.<ref>{{cite news|last=Papajohn|first=George|title=O'Hare's 'L' Service Gets Inaugural Cheer|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=September 4, 1984|page=A1}}</ref>\n[[File:Cta3200 1987 luggage rack 386-87 -10 CTA.jpg|alt=luggage|left|thumb|Blue Line train with luggage racks in the 1980s.]]\nOn February 21, 1993, the CTA adopted a color-coded naming system to the rapid transit system, and the West-Northwest route (O'Hare-Congress/Douglas) became the Blue Line. On April 26, 1998, the Douglas Branch lost its overnight (owl) and weekend service and began operating between 4 a.m. and 1 a.m. on weekdays only as a result of budget cuts that also eliminated owl service on several other lines. Congress (Forest Park) service was effectively doubled through much of the day since service frequency from O'Hare required shorter headways than what would have been left.\n\nWhile the CTA claimed Douglas branch reductions were due to low ridership, community activists also pointed to badly deteriorated infrastructure and funding shortfalls, as well as a perception that the CTA was uninterested in serving the West Side. On September 10, 2001, the CTA began a historic reconstruction of the Douglas Branch to repair its aging stations and tracks.<ref>https://www.transitchicago.com/renew-the-blue-cta-breaks-ground-on-the-blue-line-renovation/?Month=9&Year=2001</ref> The work was officially completed on January 8, 2005 with new elevated structures, tracks, rebuilt stations, new communication networks and an upgraded power system along the route.<ref>https://www.transitchicago.com/mayor-daley--cta-celebrate-completion-of-54th-cermak-branch-of-blue-line/?CategoryId=2&Year=2005&Month=18pg=2</ref> On January 1, 2005, weekend service was restored.\n\nIn January 2005, the CTA held hearings on a proposal to reroute Douglas Branch service via the recently rebuilt Paulina Connector to the Lake Street [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green Line]], carrying Douglas trains to and around the elevated Loop for the first time since 1958. It was the first stage of what became the [[Pink Line (CTA)|Pink Line]]. This would have allowed a doubling of Blue Line trains to Forest Park on the Congress Branch, since service would no longer be divided between the Forest Park and 54th/Cermak terminals. Due to community fears that the Pink Line would not be enough, however, the CTA decided to retain limited Douglas Branch Blue Line service during weekday rush hours.\n\nOn February 15, 2006, the CTA approved the separate operation of the Douglas Branch plan.<ref>https://www.transitchicago.com/cta-board-approves-west-side-corridor-service-recommendations/?Month=2&Year=2006</ref> All non-rush hour trains would all be routed via the Loop, [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green Line]] and Paulina Connector. During rush hour, service was available on the new route as well as the existing route via the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway. These changes were scheduled to be implemented for a 180-day trial period beginning June 25, 2006 and after their evaluation in early 2007, the Pink Line remained in service.\n\nBeginning April 28, 2008, the CTA began a six-month experimental ceasing of Blue Line operations on the Douglas.<ref name=\"hilkevitch\"/> Despite maintaining that the service cut was an experiment, the CTA immediately covered Blue Line stations' directional signage for trains to {{cta|54th/Cermak}} with paint rather than temporary covering, suggesting it was a permanent discontinuation instead of a temporary one.

The line starts at {{cta|O'Hare}} in an underground station below the main parking garage, with direct pedestrian access to Terminals 1, 2 and 3.  The line emerges in the median of the O'Hare main access road ([[Interstate 190 (Illinois)|Interstate 190]]) just northwest of Terminal 5, about a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west of Mannheim Road. The line runs in the median of [[Interstate 190 (Illinois)|Interstate 190]] east through [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]]. The line has a station at River Road in {{cta|Rosemont}}, which is also the location of the northern storage yard and served as a temporary terminal from 1983 to 1984 while the O'Hare station was being completed. The tracks then tunnel beneath the [[Kennedy Expressway]]/[[Northwest Tollway]] interchange near the [[Des Plaines River]]. The line runs in the median of the Kennedy Expressway ([[Interstate 90 in Illinois|Interstate 90]]) until a point southeast of Addison Street, making stops at {{cta|Cumberland}}, {{cta|Harlem|Blue|O'Hare}}, {{cta|Jefferson Park}}, {{cta|Montrose|Blue}}, {{cta|Irving Park|Blue}} and {{cta|Addison|Blue}}. Between Montrose and Irving Park, the line tunnels beneath an express lane exit. South of Addison Street, the line descends into a subway and turns south under Kimball Avenue. The line travels under Kimball Avenue and [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee Avenues]] through [[Logan Square, Chicago|Logan Square]], making stops at {{cta|Belmont|Blue}} and {{cta|Logan Square}}. South of Logan Square, the line emerges above ground onto an elevated structure parallel to Milwaukee Avenue. This section of structure, built in 1895 as part of the Metropolitan Elevated's [[Logan Square branch]], is the oldest portion of the Blue Line, and the sole section of the line on an elevated viaduct. The three stations on this section ({{cta|California|Blue}}, {{cta|Western|Blue|O'Hare}}, and {{cta|Damen|Blue}}) are also the only three stations on the line to use side platforms instead of island platforms.\n\n===Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway===\n{{main|Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway (CTA)}}\nAt the intersection of Ashland and Milwaukee Avenues, the Blue Line descends underground, swings over to Milwaukee Avenue, and continues southeast towards downtown under Milwaukee Avenue (with stops at {{cta|Division|Blue}}, {{cta|Chicago|Blue}} and {{cta|Grand|Blue}}. The line then turns east under Lake Street, crossing beneath the [[Chicago River]], and makes a stop at {{cta|Clark/Lake}}, where in-system transfers are provided to 'L' trains on the Loop. East of Clark/Lake, the tracks swing south under Dearborn Street, and stop three times along a continuous platform similar to that used in the adjacent [[State Street Subway]], with stops at {{cta|Washington|Blue}}, {{cta|Monroe|Blue}}, and {{cta|Jackson|Blue}}. Jackson provides a transfer tunnel to the [[Red Line (CTA)|Red Line]]. Until October 2006, a transfer tunnel existed at Washington as well.\n\nSouth of Jackson, the line turns west under [[Ida B. Wells Drive]] (with stops at {{cta|LaSalle}} and {{cta|Clinton|Blue}}). The tracks then emerge from a portal near {{cta|UIC-Halsted}} in the median of the [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|Eisenhower Expressway]] (Interstate 290) and continue west.\n\n===Congress Branch===\n[[File:Eisenhower Expressway.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Blue Line tracks in the median of the [[Eisenhower Expressway]]]]\nAfter exiting the subway, the tracks continue west in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway generally known as the '''Congress Branch''', successor to the Garfield Park Branch.\n\nImmediately west of {{cta|Racine|Blue}}, the Congress tracks diverge to permit a ramp up to the Douglas Branch elevated structure. This ramp was formerly used in revenue service from 1958 to 2008 when the Blue Line operated over the Douglas branch as well as the Congress branch. With the replacement of Douglas branch Blue Line service with the Pink Line, the ramp is now [[non-revenue track]]age used primarily for the transfer of 5000 series trains that the Blue Line borrows from the Pink Line for rush hour service. The Congress Branch remains in the median of the expressway through the west side of Chicago until it reaches a portal at Lotus Avenue. At this point the tracks tunnel beneath the eastbound expressway lanes and before emerging on the south side of the expressway next to the [[Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad]] (CSX) tracks. The route passes through [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] and into [[Forest Park, Illinois|Forest Park]]. In the vicinity of Desplaines Avenue the tracks rise and make an S-curve north over the expressway before terminating at the {{cta|Forest Park}} station.\n\n==Former routings==\n\n===Cermak branch===\n{{main|Cermak branch|Pink Line (CTA)}}\n[[File:19980223 26 CTA Blue Line L near Paulina St..jpg|thumb|right|The former Blue Line Douglas Branch near Paulina Street, now the [[Pink Line (CTA)|Pink Line]], in February 1998]]\nThe [[Cermak branch]], formerly known as the Douglas branch, previously was operated as part of the Blue Line.

Most trains run between O'Hare and Forest Park stations, but others terminate at a different station along the line.  On weekdays, service runs very frequently (10-20 tph (trains per hour)) during rush hour (with some trains running short-turn services between UIC-Halsted and Jefferson Park or Rosemont), and 6-8tph during the midday and nighttime.  On Saturdays, service runs 8tph in the early morning, then increase to 10tph during the day, then 8tph at night.  On Sundays, service runs 6-8tph early morning, then increase to 10tph all day, then 6tph at night.  On the weekends, every other Blue Line train operates between O'Hare and UIC-Halsted only during the daytime, doubling the headways up to 5tph.  Between approximately midnight and 5:30&nbsp;a.m., night owl service on the Blue Line ranges between 2-4tph.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blue Line Trains schedule|url=https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/rail-tt_blue.pdf|work=Chicago Transit Authority|publisher=transitchicago.com|access-date=December 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Rolling stock==\nThe Blue Line is operated with the [[2600-series (CTA)|2600-series]] and [[3200-series (CTA)|3200-series]] railcars. Trains operate using eight cars on weekdays, and four cars during weekends, late nights and early mornings. The 2600-series cars are to remain in service on the line until the early [[2020s]] when the new [[7000-series (CTA)|7000-series]] cars enter service to replace the 2600-series cars.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The 3200-series cars are to remain in service on the line until at least the late [[2020s]], where they will be replaced by the new 7000-series cars if all options are exercised (if all options are unexercised, then the 3200-series cars may remain in service on the line until the [[2030s]]). Beginning in 2018, some of the 2600-series cars from the Blue Line fleet were replaced with the recently rehabbed [[3200-series (CTA)|3200-series]] cars from the [[Brown Line (CTA)|Brown]] and [[Orange Line (CTA)|Orange Lines]], with some of the 2600-series cars being reassigned to the Orange Line to replace them. These cars entered service on the Blue Line on September 17, 2018. In addition to the mix of the 2600-series and 3200-series cars, two 5000-series trainsets assigned to the [[Pink Line (CTA)|Pink Line]] make trips on the Blue Line during weekday rush hours, although these cars remain officially assigned to the Pink Line and are operated by Pink Line operators.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nOn July 11, 2006, a derailment caused a smoky fire in the Blue Line's Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway. There were injuries from [[smoke inhalation]], but no fatalities. The comparatively minor incident prompted heavy news coverage and a temporary stoppage of Chicago subway service because it occurred hours after [[2006 Mumbai train bombings|train bombings in Mumbai]] earlier the same day.<ref>https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/RAR0702.pdf</ref>\n\nOn September 30, 2013, two Blue Line trains collided at {{cta|Harlem|Blue|Congress}} (Congress branch), injuring 33 people, after an outbound train was hit by an out-of-service train going the opposite direction on the same track. Earlier, the train had arrived at Forest Park, and went out of service. However, after the train pulled into the Desplaines Yard, it was left on.

It is the longest line on the \"L\" system and second busiest, with an average of 186,796 passengers boarding each weekday in September 2012.\n\nThe Blue Line and [[Red Line (CTA)|Red Line]] are the only two \"L\" lines to provide 24-hour service year-round, and the \"L\" is one of only five rapid transit systems in the United States to do so (the others are the [[PATCO Speedline]], [[Staten Island Railway]], the [[PATH (rail system)|PATH]] system, and the [[New York City Subway]]; the [[Metro Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]] of the [[Metro (Minnesota)|Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Metro]], a light rail system, also operates 24/7. The Blue Line is also one of only two lines with more than one station with the same name, with the [[Green Line (CTA)|Green Line]] being the other. (It has two stations at Harlem Avenue: one in the Kennedy Expressway on the Northwest side and one on the south side of the Eisenhower Expressway in [[Forest Park, Illinois]]. It also has two stations on Western Avenue: one on the Milwaukee Elevated and one on the Congress branch.) The Blue Line also has only two in-system transfers (all in the Loop), contains a combination of both the oldest and newest portions of 'L' tracks, and does not share tracks with any other 'L' line.\n\nBefore the adoption of color-coded names, the Blue Line was referred to as the '''West-Northwest''' Route (which it is still sometimes referred to as today) or more commonly, the '''O'Hare-Congress-Douglas''' route for its three branches. The Congress and Douglas branches were renamed for their terminals, '''Forest Park''' and '''54th/Cermak''', when the current color naming system was adopted in 1993. Blue Line service on the Douglas Branch was discontinued in April 2008 and replaced by the [[Pink Line (CTA)|Pink Line]].<ref name=\"CTAnews\">[http://www.transitchicago.com/blueline/ Chicago Transit Authority - Blue Line service]</ref>\n\nThe Blue Line is one of five 'L' lines that run into Chicago suburbs, with the others being the [[Green Line (CTA)|Green]], [[Purple Line (CTA)|Purple]], [[Pink Line (CTA)|Pink]], and [[Yellow Line (CTA)|Yellow]] lines. The Blue Line actually runs through three, making it the rail line that runs through the most suburbs on the Chicago 'L' system.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Logan Square branch|Cermak branch}}\nThe Blue Line is the successor to the [[Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad]], which built a series of 'L' lines servicing the West Side of Chicago beginning in 1895.

The Humboldt Park Branch was cut back to a full-time shuttle between Damen and Lawndale, and discontinued a year later on May 3, 1952.\n\nThe Garfield Park elevated was replaced by the Congress line on June 22, 1958,<ref>{{cite news|title=12,000 Ride CTA Congress Line on First Day|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=June 23, 1958|page=4}}</ref> pioneering the world's first use of rail rapid transit and a multi-lane automobile expressway in the same grade-separated right-of-way.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hail New Era of Transit in Congress Way|last=Thompson|first=John H.|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=June 21, 1958|page=7}}</ref> ([[Pacific Electric Railway]] \"Red Car\" tracks ran in the median of the Cahuenga Parkway in [[Los Angeles]] from 1944 until its expansion into the [[Hollywood Freeway]] in 1952, but the Pacific Electric service was an [[interurban streetcar]] rather than true rapid transit.) The new line connected with the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway at the [[Chicago River]] and extended westward to Des Plaines Avenue in Forest Park. Loomis Ramp, built at this same time, permitted Douglas trains to be rerouted through the subway as well combining the Logan Square, Garfield Park (now Congress) and Douglas routes into the second through service in Chicago, the Congress/Douglas-Milwaukee Line.<ref>{{cite news|last=Freeburg|first=Russel|title=It's Free!

It was also built by the City of Chicago using federal money. Just before Logan Square, trains diverted off of the old elevated structure and entered the subway under Milwaukee and Kedzie Avenues to a portal just south of Addison Street, then emerged in the median of the Kennedy Expressway to the temporary terminal at Jefferson Park. The increased ridership that resulted from the extension prompted the CTA to build the second phase of the project, and extend the line the rest of the way to O'Hare. In March 1980, construction began on the O'Hare Airport extension, with the first section between Jefferson Park and Rosemont opening on February 27, 1983,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and the final section to O'Hare on September 3, 1984.<ref>{{cite news|last=Papajohn|first=George|title=O'Hare's 'L' Service Gets Inaugural Cheer|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=September 4, 1984|page=A1}}</ref>\n[[File:Cta3200 1987 luggage rack 386-87 -10 CTA.jpg|alt=luggage|left|thumb|Blue Line train with luggage racks in the 1980s.]]\nOn February 21, 1993, the CTA adopted a color-coded naming system to the rapid transit system, and the West-Northwest route (O'Hare-Congress/Douglas) became the Blue Line. On April 26, 1998, the Douglas Branch lost its overnight (owl) and weekend service and began operating between 4 a.m. and 1 a.m. on weekdays only as a result of budget cuts that also eliminated owl service on several other lines. Congress (Forest Park) service was effectively doubled through much of the day since service frequency from O'Hare required shorter headways than what would have been left.\n\nWhile the CTA claimed Douglas branch reductions were due to low ridership, community activists also pointed to badly deteriorated infrastructure and funding shortfalls, as well as a perception that the CTA was uninterested in serving the West Side. On September 10, 2001, the CTA began a historic reconstruction of the Douglas Branch to repair its aging stations and tracks.<ref>https://www.transitchicago.com/renew-the-blue-cta-breaks-ground-on-the-blue-line-renovation/?Month=9&Year=2001</ref> The work was officially completed on January 8, 2005 with new elevated structures, tracks, rebuilt stations, new communication networks and an upgraded power system along the route.<ref>https://www.transitchicago.com/mayor-daley--cta-celebrate-completion-of-54th-cermak-branch-of-blue-line/?CategoryId=2&Year=2005&Month=18pg=2</ref> On January 1, 2005, weekend service was restored.\n\nIn January 2005, the CTA held hearings on a proposal to reroute Douglas Branch service via the recently rebuilt Paulina Connector to the Lake Street [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green Line]], carrying Douglas trains to and around the elevated Loop for the first time since 1958. It was the first stage of what became the [[Pink Line (CTA)|Pink Line]]. This would have allowed a doubling of Blue Line trains to Forest Park on the Congress Branch, since service would no longer be divided between the Forest Park and 54th/Cermak terminals. Due to community fears that the Pink Line would not be enough, however, the CTA decided to retain limited Douglas Branch Blue Line service during weekday rush hours.\n\nOn February 15, 2006, the CTA approved the separate operation of the Douglas Branch plan.<ref>https://www.transitchicago.com/cta-board-approves-west-side-corridor-service-recommendations/?Month=2&Year=2006</ref> All non-rush hour trains would all be routed via the Loop, [[Green Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Green Line]] and Paulina Connector. During rush hour, service was available on the new route as well as the existing route via the Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway. These changes were scheduled to be implemented for a 180-day trial period beginning June 25, 2006 and after their evaluation in early 2007, the Pink Line remained in service.\n\nBeginning April 28, 2008, the CTA began a six-month experimental ceasing of Blue Line operations on the Douglas.<ref name=\"hilkevitch\"/> Despite maintaining that the service cut was an experiment, the CTA immediately covered Blue Line stations' directional signage for trains to {{cta|54th/Cermak}} with paint rather than temporary covering, suggesting it was a permanent discontinuation instead of a temporary one.

The line starts at {{cta|O'Hare}} in an underground station below the main parking garage, with direct pedestrian access to Terminals 1, 2 and 3.  The line emerges in the median of the O'Hare main access road ([[Interstate 190 (Illinois)|Interstate 190]]) just northwest of Terminal 5, about a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) west of Mannheim Road. The line runs in the median of [[Interstate 190 (Illinois)|Interstate 190]] east through [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]]. The line has a station at River Road in {{cta|Rosemont}}, which is also the location of the northern storage yard and served as a temporary terminal from 1983 to 1984 while the O'Hare station was being completed. The tracks then tunnel beneath the [[Kennedy Expressway]]/[[Northwest Tollway]] interchange near the [[Des Plaines River]]. The line runs in the median of the Kennedy Expressway ([[Interstate 90 in Illinois|Interstate 90]]) until a point southeast of Addison Street, making stops at {{cta|Cumberland}}, {{cta|Harlem|Blue|O'Hare}}, {{cta|Jefferson Park}}, {{cta|Montrose|Blue}}, {{cta|Irving Park|Blue}} and {{cta|Addison|Blue}}. Between Montrose and Irving Park, the line tunnels beneath an express lane exit. South of Addison Street, the line descends into a subway and turns south under Kimball Avenue. The line travels under Kimball Avenue and [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee Avenues]] through [[Logan Square, Chicago|Logan Square]], making stops at {{cta|Belmont|Blue}} and {{cta|Logan Square}}. South of Logan Square, the line emerges above ground onto an elevated structure parallel to Milwaukee Avenue. This section of structure, built in 1895 as part of the Metropolitan Elevated's [[Logan Square branch]], is the oldest portion of the Blue Line, and the sole section of the line on an elevated viaduct. The three stations on this section ({{cta|California|Blue}}, {{cta|Western|Blue|O'Hare}}, and {{cta|Damen|Blue}}) are also the only three stations on the line to use side platforms instead of island platforms.\n\n===Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway===\n{{main|Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway (CTA)}}\nAt the intersection of Ashland and Milwaukee Avenues, the Blue Line descends underground, swings over to Milwaukee Avenue, and continues southeast towards downtown under Milwaukee Avenue (with stops at {{cta|Division|Blue}}, {{cta|Chicago|Blue}} and {{cta|Grand|Blue}}. The line then turns east under Lake Street, crossing beneath the [[Chicago River]], and makes a stop at {{cta|Clark/Lake}}, where in-system transfers are provided to 'L' trains on the Loop. East of Clark/Lake, the tracks swing south under Dearborn Street, and stop three times along a continuous platform similar to that used in the adjacent [[State Street Subway]], with stops at {{cta|Washington|Blue}}, {{cta|Monroe|Blue}}, and {{cta|Jackson|Blue}}. Jackson provides a transfer tunnel to the [[Red Line (CTA)|Red Line]]. Until October 2006, a transfer tunnel existed at Washington as well.\n\nSouth of Jackson, the line turns west under [[Ida B. Wells Drive]] (with stops at {{cta|LaSalle}} and {{cta|Clinton|Blue}}). The tracks then emerge from a portal near {{cta|UIC-Halsted}} in the median of the [[Interstate 290 (Illinois)|Eisenhower Expressway]] (Interstate 290) and continue west.\n\n===Congress Branch===\n[[File:Eisenhower Expressway.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Blue Line tracks in the median of the [[Eisenhower Expressway]]]]\nAfter exiting the subway, the tracks continue west in the median of the Eisenhower Expressway generally known as the '''Congress Branch''', successor to the Garfield Park Branch.\n\nImmediately west of {{cta|Racine|Blue}}, the Congress tracks diverge to permit a ramp up to the Douglas Branch elevated structure. This ramp was formerly used in revenue service from 1958 to 2008 when the Blue Line operated over the Douglas branch as well as the Congress branch. With the replacement of Douglas branch Blue Line service with the Pink Line, the ramp is now [[non-revenue track]]age used primarily for the transfer of 5000 series trains that the Blue Line borrows from the Pink Line for rush hour service. The Congress Branch remains in the median of the expressway through the west side of Chicago until it reaches a portal at Lotus Avenue. At this point the tracks tunnel beneath the eastbound expressway lanes and before emerging on the south side of the expressway next to the [[Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad]] (CSX) tracks. The route passes through [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]] and into [[Forest Park, Illinois|Forest Park]]. In the vicinity of Desplaines Avenue the tracks rise and make an S-curve north over the expressway before terminating at the {{cta|Forest Park}} station.\n\n==Former routings==\n\n===Cermak branch===\n{{main|Cermak branch|Pink Line (CTA)}}\n[[File:19980223 26 CTA Blue Line L near Paulina St..jpg|thumb|right|The former Blue Line Douglas Branch near Paulina Street, now the [[Pink Line (CTA)|Pink Line]], in February 1998]]\nThe [[Cermak branch]], formerly known as the Douglas branch, previously was operated as part of the Blue Line.

Most trains run between O'Hare and Forest Park stations, but others terminate at a different station along the line.  On weekdays, service runs very frequently (10-20 tph (trains per hour)) during rush hour (with some trains running short-turn services between UIC-Halsted and Jefferson Park or Rosemont), and 6-8tph during the midday and nighttime.  On Saturdays, service runs 8tph in the early morning, then increase to 10tph during the day, then 8tph at night.  On Sundays, service runs 6-8tph early morning, then increase to 10tph all day, then 6tph at night.  On the weekends, every other Blue Line train operates between O'Hare and UIC-Halsted only during the daytime, doubling the headways up to 5tph.  Between approximately midnight and 5:30&nbsp;a.m., night owl service on the Blue Line ranges between 2-4tph.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blue Line Trains schedule|url=https://www.transitchicago.com/assets/1/6/rail-tt_blue.pdf|work=Chicago Transit Authority|publisher=transitchicago.com|access-date=December 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Rolling stock==\nThe Blue Line is operated with the [[2600-series (CTA)|2600-series]] and [[3200-series (CTA)|3200-series]] railcars. Trains operate using eight cars on weekdays, and four cars during weekends, late nights and early mornings. The 2600-series cars are to remain in service on the line until the early [[2020s]] when the new [[7000-series (CTA)|7000-series]] cars enter service to replace the 2600-series cars.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} The 3200-series cars are to remain in service on the line until at least the late [[2020s]], where they will be replaced by the new 7000-series cars if all options are exercised (if all options are unexercised, then the 3200-series cars may remain in service on the line until the [[2030s]]). Beginning in 2018, some of the 2600-series cars from the Blue Line fleet were replaced with the recently rehabbed [[3200-series (CTA)|3200-series]] cars from the [[Brown Line (CTA)|Brown]] and [[Orange Line (CTA)|Orange Lines]], with some of the 2600-series cars being reassigned to the Orange Line to replace them. These cars entered service on the Blue Line on September 17, 2018. In addition to the mix of the 2600-series and 3200-series cars, two 5000-series trainsets assigned to the [[Pink Line (CTA)|Pink Line]] make trips on the Blue Line during weekday rush hours, although these cars remain officially assigned to the Pink Line and are operated by Pink Line operators.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nOn July 11, 2006, a derailment caused a smoky fire in the Blue Line's Milwaukee-Dearborn Subway. There were injuries from [[smoke inhalation]], but no fatalities. The comparatively minor incident prompted heavy news coverage and a temporary stoppage of Chicago subway service because it occurred hours after [[2006 Mumbai train bombings|train bombings in Mumbai]] earlier the same day.<ref>https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/RAR0702.pdf</ref>\n\nOn September 30, 2013, two Blue Line trains collided at {{cta|Harlem|Blue|Congress}} (Congress branch), injuring 33 people, after an outbound train was hit by an out-of-service train going the opposite direction on the same track. Earlier, the train had arrived at Forest Park, and went out of service. However, after the train pulled into the Desplaines Yard, it was left on. There were no passengers on the out-of-service train; the number of workers on it at the time of the crash was also an unknown. Also unknown was the total number of passengers on the outbound, in-service train. The investigation started shortly thereafter. Though service soon went back to normal, trains did not stop at the Harlem station until the late evening on Tuesday, October 1, 2013, to avoid interference with the scene and congestion.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-two-cta-trains-crash-on-blue-line-in-forest-park-20130930,0,1375440.story | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Jon | last=Hilkevitch | title=CTA: Video shows no one at controls of train before collision - chicagotribune.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/30/cta-blue-line-trains-coll_n_4016371.html</ref> The [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]] concluded that the probable cause was water in the control cables and insufficient securing of unattended equipment.<ref>{{cite web |title=Railroad Accident Brief: Collision of Two Chicago Transit Authority Trains |url=https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/RAB1502.aspx |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn the early morning of March 24, 2014, a Blue Line train [[O'Hare CTA station train crash|derailed at O'Hare]] at the end of its run.

The Italian inaion of [[British Somaliland]] was to be based on mobility and speed but was hampered by the terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked, until the remaining fortified hilltops were vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route at th same time and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was not needed. The rainy weather continued to slow the Italian advance and when the airstrip near Berbera was found still to be garrisoned, an Italian {{lang|fr|coup de main}} was impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East African Empire), formed from Ethiopia and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. During the First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895\u20131896), Italy had been thwarted in its colonial ambitions but in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936) the Italians again invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain, ([[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]). The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy [[Egypt]] in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine, of a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall its use by the Allies, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter British interference. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar by occupying British Somaliland and defeating the garrison.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\nThe direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, to cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary. De Simone, with the central column would establish a base at Hargeisa and Adalek then carry the main weight of the attack through the Mirgo Pass towards Berbera. The western column (Lieutenant-General [[Sisto Bertoldi]]) was to advance towards [[Zeila]] to seal the border with French Somaliland and then move eastwards along the coast road towards Berbera.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===3\u201310 August===\n\n[[File:GeneraleGuglielmo Nasi.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|left|{{centre|General Guglielmo Nasi}}]]\nOn 3 August 1940, British air reconnaissance discovered that about 400 Italians had crossed the frontier at Biyad; early on 4 August the Italian central column was seen advancing on Hargeisa.

Aosta urged haste but Nasi refused to rush because the road was deteriorating under the heavy traffic and rain. The Italian advance resumed on 8 August and for two days closed up to the British defences as the Italians made preparations to attack. The defenders reported the presence of Italian medium tanks and the captain of {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} donated the ship's [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss]] saluting gun, a three-man crew and thirty rounds of ammunition.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=173\u2013175}}{{efn|PO H.

The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major-General [[Reade Godwin-Austen]] was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary. Godwin-Austen reached Berbera on 11 July and took over command that evening; the reinforcements were too late and were diverted to Sudan.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=175}}\n\n===Tug Argan position===\n\n[[File:Tug Argan Gap.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Photograph of the Tug Argan Gap (1954)}}]]\nFrom 7 to 8 August, the defenders had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch; by 10 August, De Simone had closed up on the British positions behind the Tug Argan and prepared the Italian attack. The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Karrim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about {{convert|2000|to|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Mill Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\nThe positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery, the advantage was of dubious advantage. The defenders were too few in number to cover the gap and the hills were far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackenzie|1y=1951|1p=22|2a1=Playfair|2y=1959|1pp=175\u2013176}}\n\n===Battle of Tug Argan===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Tug Argan}}\n\nThe Australians from ''Hobart'' with their Hotchkiss gun arrived at dawn on 10 August but the gun had to be dismantled for loading, which reduced its rate of fire to once every five minutes, while its 32 HE rounds and 32 solid shot lasted.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}} On 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed. On 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery [[howitzer]]s were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill. Next day, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed. Mussolini signalled to Aosta,\n\n{{quote|Pour all available reserves into Somaliland to stimulate the operation. Order the entire Imperial air force to co-operate.|Mussolini{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}}}}\n\nA counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass, by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. On 14 August, Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}} Withdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin-Austen to withdraw from the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=176\u2013177}} Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about {{convert|33|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, {{convert|17|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the port. Over three nights, civilians then troops would be embarked, the time taken being determined by the monsoon, which usually made it difficult to reach ships by boat at night and before midday.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Air operations===\n[[File:3inch20cwtAAgunHayesCommonMay1940.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Example of a 3-inch 20 cwt Anti-Aircraft gun (UK, May1940}}]]\nThe British airfields at Berbera and [[Laferug]] had only small arms for defence, two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch anti-aircraft guns]] being reserved for the defence of the port. The landing grounds had been quickly made untenable by {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} bombing, two [[No. 94 Squadron RAF|94 Squadron]] [[Gloster Gladiator]] fighters being destroyed on the ground. Bombers were withdrawn to Aden, which meant a {{convert|400|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} round-trip without fighter escort. It was most difficult to influence the tactical situation but the bombers attacked troops and their transport, bases and Addis Ababa, to try to divert Italian fighters. Blenheim Mk Is of 8, 11 and 39 squadrons and 203 squadron with Blenheim IVF fighters and 223 Squadron from Sudan, which arrived at Aden on 14 August and a flight of 84 Squadron from Iraq with Blenheim Mk Is flew standing patrols over Berbera for thirteen days, which limited the ability of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} to interfere with the evacuation.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=178}} Blenheims from 11 Squadron left Aden at {{nowrap|5:35 p.m.}} on 18 August and carried out a high-level bombing attack on Italian vehicles near Laferug but lost a bomber to CR.42s from 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}}, one crew member surviving. While the Italian fighters were attacking the 11 Squadron aircraft, Wellesley bombers from 223 Squadron took off from [[Perim Island]] to attack the airfield at [[Addis Ababa]] and destroyed Aosta's personal aircraft. One SM.79, a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]] and three Ca.133 aircraft were destroyed according to Italian records and a SM.79 and SM.81 were badly damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\n===Retreat to Berbera===\n\n[[File:C coy 7th bn KAR.png|thumb|{{centre|[[Kenya]]n troops from the 7th Battalion, [[King's African Rifles]] parading in Mogadishu, 1941}}]]\nAfter a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night of 15 August, the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh. The retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the attackers but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked. The evacuation at Berbera went more smoothly than expected and Godwin-Austen was able to withdraw the rearguard at Nasiyeh and once night fell, bring back the rearguard from Barkasan.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nThe [[Royal Navy]] had built an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials and on 16 August, the British started to embark troops.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=19}} Attacks by the ''Regia Aeronautica'' on the British vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Berbera had begun on 8 August to little effect; {{HMAS|Hobart|1939|6}} was slightly damaged in two attacks and the auxiliary vessel ''Chakdina'' suffered splinter damage.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=39\u201340}} On 17 August, the Italian western column at Bulhar, about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera, was engaged by the light cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and halted by gunfire.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}} After dark, the rearguard was withdrawn to Berbera with minimal losses and loading was complete by the early hours of 18 August. Before sailing for Aden early on 19 August, ''Hobart'', with the force headquarters aboard, stayed behind to collect stragglers and complete the destruction of buildings, vehicles, fuel and stores. The tug ''Queen'' was the only British ship lost in the operation.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=205\u2013206}} The Navy embarked {{nowrap|7,140 people,}} {{nowrap|5,690 of}} them being front-line troops, {{nowrap|1,266 civilians}} and {{nowrap|184 sick;}} Most of the Somalis of the SCC were sent home to wait for the British to return, earlier plans for them to fight a guerrilla war being scrapped.

British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa and Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory the size of [[England]], British Somaliland, the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and [[Kassala]] in Sudan and [[Moyale]] and [[Buna, Kenya|Buna]] in Kenya. News of the evacuation came as a shock to British public opinion but Wavell backed Godwin-Austen, saying that he had judged the situation correctly.{{sfn|Mockler|1984|pp=245\u2013249}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=179}} The British had to immobilise and abandon 350 vehicles and most of their stores because of the need to ferry everything to the ships offshore.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=87}}\n\nWinston Churchill criticised Wavell for the loss of British Somaliland; because of the few casualties, Churchill thought that the colony had not been vigorously defended and proposed a [[court of enquiry]]. Wavell refused to co-operate and said that Godwin-Austen and Wilson had conducted a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. Wavell sent a telegram to Churchill which included the passage\n\n{{quote|...a big butcher\u2019s bill was not necessarily evidence of good tactics.|Wavell{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}}}}\n\nChurchill was said by General [[John Dill]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), to have been moved to \"greater anger than he had ever seen him in before\"; the incident was the beginning of the end for Wavell.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart wrote that given the exiguous nature of the British force in the colony, the defenders had done well to resist for as long as they had. The defence of British Somaliland took place during the [[Battle of Britain]] and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to the defeated generals. Adolf Hitler called the evacuation of the colony a \"hard blow\" but\n\n{{quote|...all the British had lost was the privilege of maintaining an expensive garrison in their least valuable colony.|Cowie ''War for Britain'' (1941){{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=93}}}}\n\nThe capture of the colony was the greatest success of the Italians in the East African campaign but they had not been able to exploit the opportunities that they had created and delays caused by the terrain, weather and the cancellation of a ''coup de main'' by 300 infantry on the port, enabled the British to get away despite the improvised nature of the embarkation.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n===Casualties===\n\nIn 1954, [[I. S. O. Playfair|Ian Playfair]], the British official historian, wrote that the British suffered 260 casualties and estimated Italian losses of 2,052 men.

The Somalis supporting the British suffered about 2,000 casualties during the invasion and occupation; about 1,000 Somalis became casualties fighting on the Italian side.{{sfnm|1a1=Maravigna|1y=1949|1p=453|2a1=Rovighi|2y=1988|2p=188}} In 1993, Harold Raugh wrote that 38 of the British casualties had been killed and 222 wounded.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=82}} In a 1996 publication, Christopher Shores gave the same figures for Italian casualties as Maravigna and wrote that the RAF lost seven aircraft and ten were damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}} In 2007, Andrea Molinari recorded 1,995 Italian casualties and four aircraft destroyed.{{sfn|Molinari|2007|p=117}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n{{main|Operation Appearance}}\n\nOn 16 March 1941, the British executed Operation Appearance from [[Aden]]; the two [[Sikh]] battalions of the [[Indian Army]], that had been part of the defence force in August 1940 and a Somali commando detachment, were landed on either side of Berbera from transports escorted by HMS ''Glasgow'', ''Caledon'', ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston''.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=417}}{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=54}} The invasion by the Sikhs was the first successful [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landing on an occupied beach of the war; few men of the Italian 70th Colonial Brigade offered resistance.

The Italian inaion of [[British Somaliland]] was to be based on mobility and speed but was hampered by the terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked, until the remaining fortified hilltops were vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route at th same time and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was not needed. The rainy weather continued to slow the Italian advance and when the airstrip near Berbera was found still to be garrisoned, an Italian {{lang|fr|coup de main}} was impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East African Empire), formed from Ethiopia and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. During the First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895\u20131896), Italy had been thwarted in its colonial ambitions but in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936) the Italians again invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain, ([[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]). The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy [[Egypt]] in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine, of a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall its use by the Allies, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter British interference. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar by occupying British Somaliland and defeating the garrison.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\nThe direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, to cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary.

The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major-General [[Reade Godwin-Austen]] was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary. Godwin-Austen reached Berbera on 11 July and took over command that evening; the reinforcements were too late and were diverted to Sudan.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=175}}\n\n===Tug Argan position===\n\n[[File:Tug Argan Gap.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Photograph of the Tug Argan Gap (1954)}}]]\nFrom 7 to 8 August, the defenders had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch; by 10 August, De Simone had closed up on the British positions behind the Tug Argan and prepared the Italian attack. The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Karrim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about {{convert|2000|to|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Mill Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\nThe positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery, the advantage was of dubious advantage. The defenders were too few in number to cover the gap and the hills were far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackenzie|1y=1951|1p=22|2a1=Playfair|2y=1959|1pp=175\u2013176}}\n\n===Battle of Tug Argan===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Tug Argan}}\n\nThe Australians from ''Hobart'' with their Hotchkiss gun arrived at dawn on 10 August but the gun had to be dismantled for loading, which reduced its rate of fire to once every five minutes, while its 32 HE rounds and 32 solid shot lasted.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}} On 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed. On 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery [[howitzer]]s were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill. Next day, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed. Mussolini signalled to Aosta,\n\n{{quote|Pour all available reserves into Somaliland to stimulate the operation. Order the entire Imperial air force to co-operate.|Mussolini{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}}}}\n\nA counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass, by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. On 14 August, Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}} Withdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin-Austen to withdraw from the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=176\u2013177}} Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about {{convert|33|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, {{convert|17|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the port. Over three nights, civilians then troops would be embarked, the time taken being determined by the monsoon, which usually made it difficult to reach ships by boat at night and before midday.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Air operations===\n[[File:3inch20cwtAAgunHayesCommonMay1940.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Example of a 3-inch 20 cwt Anti-Aircraft gun (UK, May1940}}]]\nThe British airfields at Berbera and [[Laferug]] had only small arms for defence, two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch anti-aircraft guns]] being reserved for the defence of the port.

Bombers were withdrawn to Aden, which meant a {{convert|400|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} round-trip without fighter escort. It was most difficult to influence the tactical situation but the bombers attacked troops and their transport, bases and Addis Ababa, to try to divert Italian fighters. Blenheim Mk Is of 8, 11 and 39 squadrons and 203 squadron with Blenheim IVF fighters and 223 Squadron from Sudan, which arrived at Aden on 14 August and a flight of 84 Squadron from Iraq with Blenheim Mk Is flew standing patrols over Berbera for thirteen days, which limited the ability of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} to interfere with the evacuation.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=178}} Blenheims from 11 Squadron left Aden at {{nowrap|5:35 p.m.}} on 18 August and carried out a high-level bombing attack on Italian vehicles near Laferug but lost a bomber to CR.42s from 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}}, one crew member surviving. While the Italian fighters were attacking the 11 Squadron aircraft, Wellesley bombers from 223 Squadron took off from [[Perim Island]] to attack the airfield at [[Addis Ababa]] and destroyed Aosta's personal aircraft. One SM.79, a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]] and three Ca.133 aircraft were destroyed according to Italian records and a SM.79 and SM.81 were badly damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\n===Retreat to Berbera===\n\n[[File:C coy 7th bn KAR.png|thumb|{{centre|[[Kenya]]n troops from the 7th Battalion, [[King's African Rifles]] parading in Mogadishu, 1941}}]]\nAfter a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night of 15 August, the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh. The retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the attackers but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked. The evacuation at Berbera went more smoothly than expected and Godwin-Austen was able to withdraw the rearguard at Nasiyeh and once night fell, bring back the rearguard from Barkasan.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nThe [[Royal Navy]] had built an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials and on 16 August, the British started to embark troops.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=19}} Attacks by the ''Regia Aeronautica'' on the British vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Berbera had begun on 8 August to little effect; {{HMAS|Hobart|1939|6}} was slightly damaged in two attacks and the auxiliary vessel ''Chakdina'' suffered splinter damage.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=39\u201340}} On 17 August, the Italian western column at Bulhar, about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera, was engaged by the light cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and halted by gunfire.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}} After dark, the rearguard was withdrawn to Berbera with minimal losses and loading was complete by the early hours of 18 August. Before sailing for Aden early on 19 August, ''Hobart'', with the force headquarters aboard, stayed behind to collect stragglers and complete the destruction of buildings, vehicles, fuel and stores. The tug ''Queen'' was the only British ship lost in the operation.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=205\u2013206}} The Navy embarked {{nowrap|7,140 people,}} {{nowrap|5,690 of}} them being front-line troops, {{nowrap|1,266 civilians}} and {{nowrap|184 sick;}} Most of the Somalis of the SCC were sent home to wait for the British to return, earlier plans for them to fight a guerrilla war being scrapped.

British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa and Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory the size of [[England]], British Somaliland, the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and [[Kassala]] in Sudan and [[Moyale]] and [[Buna, Kenya|Buna]] in Kenya.

Wavell refused to co-operate and said that Godwin-Austen and Wilson had conducted a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. Wavell sent a telegram to Churchill which included the passage\n\n{{quote|...a big butcher\u2019s bill was not necessarily evidence of good tactics.|Wavell{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}}}}\n\nChurchill was said by General [[John Dill]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), to have been moved to \"greater anger than he had ever seen him in before\"; the incident was the beginning of the end for Wavell.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart wrote that given the exiguous nature of the British force in the colony, the defenders had done well to resist for as long as they had. The defence of British Somaliland took place during the [[Battle of Britain]] and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to the defeated generals.
