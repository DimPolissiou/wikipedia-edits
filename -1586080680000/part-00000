While the term ''Katipunan'' remained, Bonifacio's government was also known as the [[Tagalog Republic]] (Spanish: ''Rep\u00fablica Tagala''; Filipino: ''Republikang Tagalog''). Although the word ''Tagalog'' refers to the [[Tagalog people]], a specific ethno-linguistic group, Bonifacio used it to denote all non-Spanish peoples of the Philippines in place of ''[[Filipinos]]'', which had colonial origins.<ref>{{Harvnb|Borromeo|Borromeo-Buehler|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RJnMSmXLvr4C&pg=PA25#PPA25,M1 25]}} (Item 3 in the list, referring to Note 41 at p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=RJnMSmXLvr4C&pg=PA61#PPA61,M1 61], citing {{cite journal|journal=Sulyap Kultura|volume=1|issue=2|year=1996|publisher=National Commission of Culture and the Arts, Philippines|title=This article underscores the existence of a de facto revolutionary government (with Bonifacio as its president) that antedated the revolutionary government in Cavite based upon the controversial [[Tejeros Convention]].

On January 23, 1899, he was then elected President of the [[First Philippine Republic]], a government constituted by the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]] under the [[Malolos Constitution]]. Consequently, this government is also called the [[Malolos Republic]].\n\nThe First Philippine Republic was short-lived and never internationally recognized.

Quezon]] was elected the first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], which had been established, still under United States sovereignty, under a [[Constitution of the Philippines#Commonwealth and Third Republic (1935)|constitution]] ratified on 14 May of that year. During its first five years, the president could serve for an unrenewable six-year term. It was later amended in 1940 to limit a president to serving no more than two four-year terms. When President Quezon exiled himself to the United States after the Philippines fell to the [[Empire of Japan]] in [[World War II in the Philippines|World War II]], he appointed [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]] as Acting President and as Acting Commander-in Chief of the Armed Forces. Abad Santos was subsequently executed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] on May 2, 1942.\n\n=== The Second Republic under the Japanese ===\nOn October 14, 1943, [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] became President under [[Constitution of the Philippines#Second Republic (1943)|a constitution imposed]] by the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]]. Laurel, an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], had been instructed to remain in the City of Manila by President Quezon, who withdrew to [[Corregidor]] and then to the United States to establish a [[government in exile]] in the United States. The General Headquarters and Military Camp Base of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] was a military station are moved in the province.\n\nAfter the combined American and Filipino forces liberated the islands in 1945, Laurel officially dissolved the republic on August 17, 1945.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nThe 1935 Constitution was restored after the Japanese surrender ended World War II, with Vice President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] becoming President due to Quezon's death on August 1, 1944. It remained in effect after the United States recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines as a separate self-governing nation on July 4, 1946.\n\n=== 1973 Constitution ===\nA new [[Constitution of the Philippines#The New Society and the Fourth Republic (1973)|Constitution]] ratified on January 17, 1973 under the rule of [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] introduced a parliamentary-style government. Marcos instituted himself as [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] while serving as President in 1978. He later appointed [[Cesar Virata|C\u00e9sar Virata]] as Prime Minister in 1981.\n\nThis Constitution was in effect until the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 toppled Marcos's 21-year authoritarian regime and replaced him with [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]].\n\n===Fifth Republic===\nRuling by decree during the early part of her tenure and as a president installed by revolutionary means, President Corazon Aquino issued [[Constitution of the Philippines|Proclamation No. 3]] on March 25, 1986 which abrogated many of the provisions of the then 1973 Constitution, including the provisions associated with the Marcos regime which gave the president legislative powers, as well as the unicameral legislature called the Batasang Pambansa (literally ''National Legislature'' in Filipino). Often called the \"Freedom Constitution,\" the proclamation retained only parts of the 1973 Constitution that were essential for a return to democratic rule, such as the bill of rights. This constitution was superseded on February 2, 1987 by the present constitution.\n\n=== Other issues ===\nBoth Bonifacio and Aguinaldo might be considered to have been an inaugural president of an insurgent government. Quezon was the inaugural president of a predecessor state to the current one, while Aquino, ''m\u00e8re'', was the inaugural president of the currently-constituted government.\n\nThe government considers Aguinaldo to have been the first president of the Philippines, followed by Quezon and his successors.<ref name=tucker2009p8>{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C. |title=The encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars: a political, social, and military history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-951-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&pg=PA8 8]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200029&Itemid=26|title=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Despite the differences in [[Constitution of the Philippines|constitutions]] and government, the line of presidents is considered to be continuous. For instance, the current president, Rodrigo R. Duterte, is considered to be the 16th president.\n\nWhile the government may consider Aguinaldo as the first president, the First Republic fell under the United States' jurisdiction due to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]; the United States thus does not consider his tenure to have been legitimate.<ref name=tucker2009p8 /><ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/aguinaldo.html Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy], U.S. Library of Congress.</ref> [[Manuel L. Quezon]] is considered to be the first president by the United States.  He is also the first to win a popular election and a nationwide election.\n\n==== Laurel's position ====\n[[File:Jose P. Laurel giving a speech.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] giving a speech after his inauguration as President of the [[Second Philippine Republic]]]]\nAs with many other [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-occupied countries in the Second World War, the Philippines had at one point two presidents heading two governments. One was Quezon and the Commonwealth [[Government in exile|government-in-exile]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the other was Manila-based Laurel heading the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic. Notably, Laurel was himself instructed to remain in Manila by President Quezon.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Laurel was not formally recognized as a president until the rule of [[Diosdado Macapagal]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=some reliable source reporting that recognition should be easy to find}} His inclusion in the official list coincided with the transfer of the official date of Independence Day from July 4 (the anniversary of the Philippines' independence from the United States) to June 12 (the anniversary of the 1898 Declaration of Independence).\n\nThe inclusion of Laurel thus causes some problems in determining the order of presidents. It is inaccurate to call Laurel the successor of Osme\u00f1a or vice versa, since Laurel's Second Republic was formally repudiated after World War II, its actions not considered legal or binding. Quezon, Osme\u00f1a, and Roxas were seen as being in a contiguous line according to the 1935 Constitution, while Laurel was the only president of the Second Republic, which had a separate charter. Thus, Laurel had neither predecessor nor successor, while Osme\u00f1a succeeded Quezon after the latter's death, and was in turn succeeded by Roxas as President of the Third Republic.\n\n==Powers and roles==\n\n===Chief Executive===\nThe president of the Philippines, being the chief executive, serves as both the head of state and head of government of the Philippines. The constitution vests the executive power with the president who consequently heads the government's executive branch, including the Cabinet and all executive departments.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 1</ref>\n\nThe president has power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures after conviction by final judgment, except in cases of impeachment. The president can grant amnesty with the concurrence of the majority of all the members of the Congress.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 19</ref> The president has authority to contract or guarantee foreign loans on behalf of the Republic but only with the prior concurrence of the Monetary Board and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 20.</ref>\n\nThe president also exercises general supervision over local government units.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 10, sec. 4.</ref>\n\n===Commander-in-Chief===\nThe president also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 18.</ref> This includes the power to suspend the [[writ of habeas corpus]] and to declare [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial law]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Power of appointment===\nWith the consent of the Commission on Appointments, the president also appoints the heads of the executive departments, board of members and its leaders from any national government-related institutions, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, high-ranking officers of the armed forces, and other officials.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 16.</ref> The members of the Supreme Court and lower courts are also appointed by the president, but only from the list of nominees prepared by the Judicial and Bar Council.

These include important agencies such as the [[National Security Council (Philippines)|National Security Council]],  Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]], [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]], Climate Change Commission, Commission on Population, Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]], [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]], Authority of the [[Freeport Area of Bataan]], [[Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority]], and many more.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.pcoo.gov.ph/dir-executiveoffices.htm|title = Agencies/Offices under the Office of the President|date = |accessdate = Jan 6, 2016|website = Presidential Communications Operations Office|publisher = Government of the Philippines|last = |first = }}</ref> The [[Presidential Security Group]], which is composed mostly of members from the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine National Police]], is directly under the Office of the President.\n\n== Election process ==\n\n=== Eligibility ===\nArticle 7, Section 2 of the Constitution reads:\n\"No person may be elected President unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election.\" <ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 2</ref>\nThe Constitution also provides term limits where the president is ineligible for reelection and a person who has succeeded as President and has served as such for more than four years will be ineligible to be elected for a second term. However, with the case of [[Joseph Estrada]] who [[1998 Philippine presidential election|was elected president in 1998]], [[2001 EDSA Revolution|deposed in 2001]], and again [[2010 Philippine presidential election|ran for the presidency in 2010]], the Constitution's wording where \"[the] President shall not be eligible for any re-election\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 4</ref> remains unclear as his case was never brought to the Supreme Court. It remains unclear whether the term limit of no re-election applies only to the incumbent president or for any person who has been elected as President.\n\n=== Election ===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential election}}\n[[File:Home provinces of Philippine Presidents.PNG|thumb|Home [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] (blue and purple) of the presidents.]]\nThe president is elected by direct vote every six years, usually on the second Monday of May.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe returns of every election for President and Vice President, duly certified by the board of canvassers of each province or city, shall be transmitted to Congress, directed to the president of the Senate. Upon receipt of the certificates of canvass, the president of the Senate shall open all the certificates in the presence of a joint public session of Congress not later than 30 days after election day. Congress then canvasses the votes upon determining that the polls are authentic and were done in the manner provided by law.\n\nThe person with the highest number of votes is declared the winner, but in case two or more have the highest number of votes, the president is elected by a majority of all members of both Houses, voting separately on each.\n\n===Inauguration===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential inauguration}}\n{{Further|List of Philippine presidential inaugurations}}\n[[File:Carlos P Garcia second inauguration, 1957.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos P.

This is for two reasons: first, according to protocol, no one follows the president (who is last due to his supremacy), and second, to establish a constitutionally valid successor before the president-elect accedes. During the [[Manuel L. Quezon|Quezon]] inauguration, however, the vice president and the Legislature were sworn in after the president, to symbolise a new start.\n\nAs soon as the president takes the Oath of Office, a [[21-gun salute]] is fired to salute the new head of state, and the [[honors music|Presidential Anthem]] ''Mabuhay'' is played. The president delivers his inaugural address, and then proceeds to [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] to climb the Grand Staircase, a ritual which symbolises the formal possession of the Palace. The president then inducts the newly formed cabinet into office in one of the state rooms.\n\nCustom has enshrined three places as the traditional venue for the inauguration ceremony: [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos City]], [[Bulacan]]; in front of the old Legislative Building (now part of the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]]) in Manila; or at [[Quirino Grandstand]], where most have been held. In 2004, [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] delivered her pre-inaugural address at Quirino Grandstand, took the Oath of Office in [[Cebu City]] before Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr.]], and the next day held the first cabinet meeting in [[Butuan City]]. She broke with precedent, reasoning that she wanted to celebrate her inauguration in each of the three main island groups of the Philippines: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. Her first inauguration also broke precedent as she was sworn in at the [[EDSA Shrine]] on January 20, 2001, during the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001]] that removed [[Joseph Estrada]] from office.\n\nIn the past, elections were held in November and the president's inauguration was held on December 30 ([[Rizal Day]]). This ensured that when the inauguration was usually held at [[Quirino Grandstand]], the new president could see the [[Rizal Monument]] on the anniversary of his death. [[Ferdinand Marcos]] transferred the dates of both the elections and the inauguration to May and June, respectively, and it remains so to this day.\n\nThe dress code at the modern inaugural ceremony is traditional, formal Filipino clothing, which is otherwise loosely termed ''Filipiniana''. Ladies must wear [[terno]], [[baro't saya]] (the formal wear of other indigenous groups is permissible), while men don the [[Barong Tagalog]]. Non-Filipinos at the ceremony may wear their respective versions of formal dress, but foreign diplomats have often been seen donning ''Filipiniana'' as a mark of cultural respect.\n\n===Oath of Office===\nThe Constitution provides the following oath or affirmation for the president and vice president-elect which must be taken before they enter into office:<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/ Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 5]</ref>\n\n{{quotation|\"I, (name), do solemnly swear [or affirm], that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President [or Vice-President or Acting President] of the Philippines.

The [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], one of the houses of the bicameral Congress, has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment against the president, [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]], members of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], members of the Constitutional Commissions and the [[Philippine Ombudsman|ombudsman]].<ref>Constitution of the Philippines, art. 11, sec. 2</ref> When a third of its membership has endorsed the impeachment articles, it is then transmitted to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] which tries and decide, as impeachment tribunal, the impeachment case.<ref name=\"Article XI\">{{cite web|url= http://www.chanrobles.com/article11.htm|title= The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines \u2013 Article XI|accessdate= July 25, 2008|author= Chan-Robles Virtual Law Library|date= }}</ref> A main difference from US proceedings however is that only a third of House members are required to approve the motion to impeach the president (as opposed to the majority required in the United States). In the Senate, selected members of the House of Representatives act as the prosecutors and the senators act as judges with the Senate president and chief justice of the Supreme Court jointly presiding over the proceedings. Like the United States, to convict the official in question requires that a minimum of two-thirds (i.e., 16 of 24 members) of the senate vote in favour of conviction. If an impeachment attempt is unsuccessful or the official is acquitted, no new cases can be filed against that impeachable official for at least one full year.\n\n=== Impeachable offenses ===\nThe Constitution enumerates the culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, and betrayal of public trust as grounds for the impeachment of the president.<ref>Constitution of the Philippines, art. 11, sec. 2.</ref> The same also applies for the vice president, the members of the Supreme Court, the members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the ombudsman.\n\n=== Impeachment attempts and proceedings ===\n\n==== Joseph Ejercito Estrada ====\nJoseph Ejercito Estrada was the first president to undergo impeachment when the House of Representatives voted to raise the impeachment proceedings to the Senate in 2000. However, the trial ended prematurely where anti-Estrada senators walked out of the impeachment sessions when Estrada's allies in the Senate voted narrowly to block the opening of an envelope which allegedly contained critical evidence on Estrada's wealth. Estrada was later ousted from office when the [[Second EDSA Revolution|2001 EDSA Revolution]] forced him out of the presidential palace and when the Supreme Court confirmed that his leaving the palace was his ''de facto'' resignation from office.\n\n==== Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ====\nSeveral impeachment complaints were filed against Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo but none reached the required endorsement of a third of the House of Representatives.\n\n== Title ==\nThe official title of the Philippine head of state and government is \"President of the Philippines.\"<ref name=\"Const\">{{cite journal|title = 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher = Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|url = http://www.chanrobles.com/article7.htm|accessdate = January 7, 2008|ref = harv}}</ref> The title in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] is ''Pangulo'' ([[cognate]] of [[Malay language|Malay]] ''penghulu'' \"leader\", \"chieftain\").

The Spanish Governor-General, the highest-ranking official in the Philippines during the Spanish Era, resided in the Palacio del Gobernador inside the walled city of [[Intramuros]]. However, after an earthquake in 1863, the Palacio del Gobernador was destroyed, and the residence and office of the Governor-General transferred to Malaca\u00f1ang Palace. During the [[Philippine Revolution]], President Aguinaldo resided in his own home in [[Kawit, Cavite]]. After his defeat in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], Aguinaldo transferred the [[Capital of the Philippines]] to different areas while he struggled in the pursuit of American Forces. When the Americans occupied the Philippines, they also used the Palace as an official residence. During the [[Japanese Occupation of the Philippines]], the governmental offices and the presidential residence transferred to Baguio, and the [[The Mansion, Baguio|Mansion House]] was used as the official residence. Meanwhile, President Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth resided in the [[Omni Shoreham Hotel]] in Washington D.C. After the restoration of independence, plans were made for the construction of the new presidential residence which would replacing Malaca\u00f1ang in [[Quezon City|a new capital city]].

For trips outside of the Philippines, the Air Force employs a [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] [[Global Express]] or charters appropriate aircraft from the country's flag carrier, [[Philippine Airlines]]. In 1962, the Air Force chartered aircraft from [[Pan American World Airways]] as the international services of Philippine Airlines were suspended. Pan Am later went defunct in 1991. For short-haul flights, PAL used the [[Boeing 737]] until they were replaced by [[Airbus A320]] and [[Airbus A321]] aircraft. For medium to long-haul flights, the airline's [[Boeing 747-400]]'s were used until their retirement in September 2014. The [[Airbus A330-300]], [[Airbus A350-900]] and [[Boeing 777-300ER]] have since fulfilled these roles. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number '''PR/PAL 001''' and callsign '''PHILIPPINE 001''' is a special plane operated by [[Philippine Airlines]] to transport the president of the Philippines.

While the term ''Katipunan'' remained, Bonifacio's government was also known as the [[Tagalog Republic]] (Spanish: ''Rep\u00fablica Tagala''; Filipino: ''Republikang Tagalog''). Although the word ''Tagalog'' refers to the [[Tagalog people]], a specific ethno-linguistic group, Bonifacio used it to denote all non-Spanish peoples of the Philippines in place of ''[[Filipinos]]'', which had colonial origins.<ref>{{Harvnb|Borromeo|Borromeo-Buehler|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RJnMSmXLvr4C&pg=PA25#PPA25,M1 25]}} (Item 3 in the list, referring to Note 41 at p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=RJnMSmXLvr4C&pg=PA61#PPA61,M1 61], citing {{cite journal|journal=Sulyap Kultura|volume=1|issue=2|year=1996|publisher=National Commission of Culture and the Arts, Philippines|title=This article underscores the existence of a de facto revolutionary government (with Bonifacio as its president) that antedated the revolutionary government in Cavite based upon the controversial [[Tejeros Convention]].

He formed a dictatorial government on May 24, 1898 and issued the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] on June 12, 1898. On June 23, 1898, Aguinaldo transformed his dictatorial government into a revolutionary government. On January 23, 1899, he was then elected President of the [[First Philippine Republic]], a government constituted by the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]] under the [[Malolos Constitution]]. Consequently, this government is also called the [[Malolos Republic]].\n\nThe First Philippine Republic was short-lived and never internationally recognized. The Philippines was transferred from Spanish to American control by the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1898, signed in December of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/AmStudies/lewis/2010/usoccupy.htm|title=The U.S. Occupation of the Philippines|publisher=University of Colorado American Studies|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> The [[Philippine\u2013American War]] broke out between the United States and Aguinaldo's government.

Quezon]] was elected the first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], which had been established, still under United States sovereignty, under a [[Constitution of the Philippines#Commonwealth and Third Republic (1935)|constitution]] ratified on 14 May of that year. During its first five years, the president could serve for an unrenewable six-year term. It was later amended in 1940 to limit a president to serving no more than two four-year terms. When President Quezon exiled himself to the United States after the Philippines fell to the [[Empire of Japan]] in [[World War II in the Philippines|World War II]], he appointed [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]] as Acting President and as Acting Commander-in Chief of the Armed Forces. Abad Santos was subsequently executed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] on May 2, 1942.\n\n=== The Second Republic under the Japanese ===\nOn October 14, 1943, [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] became President under [[Constitution of the Philippines#Second Republic (1943)|a constitution imposed]] by the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]]. Laurel, an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], had been instructed to remain in the City of Manila by President Quezon, who withdrew to [[Corregidor]] and then to the United States to establish a [[government in exile]] in the United States. The General Headquarters and Military Camp Base of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] was a military station are moved in the province.\n\nAfter the combined American and Filipino forces liberated the islands in 1945, Laurel officially dissolved the republic on August 17, 1945.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nThe 1935 Constitution was restored after the Japanese surrender ended World War II, with Vice President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] becoming President due to Quezon's death on August 1, 1944. It remained in effect after the United States recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines as a separate self-governing nation on July 4, 1946.\n\n=== 1973 Constitution ===\nA new [[Constitution of the Philippines#The New Society and the Fourth Republic (1973)|Constitution]] ratified on January 17, 1973 under the rule of [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] introduced a parliamentary-style government. Marcos instituted himself as [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] while serving as President in 1978. He later appointed [[Cesar Virata|C\u00e9sar Virata]] as Prime Minister in 1981.\n\nThis Constitution was in effect until the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 toppled Marcos's 21-year authoritarian regime and replaced him with [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]].\n\n===Fifth Republic===\nRuling by decree during the early part of her tenure and as a president installed by revolutionary means, President Corazon Aquino issued [[Constitution of the Philippines|Proclamation No. 3]] on March 25, 1986 which abrogated many of the provisions of the then 1973 Constitution, including the provisions associated with the Marcos regime which gave the president legislative powers, as well as the unicameral legislature called the Batasang Pambansa (literally ''National Legislature'' in Filipino). Often called the \"Freedom Constitution,\" the proclamation retained only parts of the 1973 Constitution that were essential for a return to democratic rule, such as the bill of rights. This constitution was superseded on February 2, 1987 by the present constitution.\n\n=== Other issues ===\nBoth Bonifacio and Aguinaldo might be considered to have been an inaugural president of an insurgent government. Quezon was the inaugural president of a predecessor state to the current one, while Aquino, ''m\u00e8re'', was the inaugural president of the currently-constituted government.\n\nThe government considers Aguinaldo to have been the first president of the Philippines, followed by Quezon and his successors.<ref name=tucker2009p8>{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C. |title=The encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars: a political, social, and military history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-951-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&pg=PA8 8]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200029&Itemid=26|title=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Despite the differences in [[Constitution of the Philippines|constitutions]] and government, the line of presidents is considered to be continuous. For instance, the current president, Rodrigo R. Duterte, is considered to be the 16th president.\n\nWhile the government may consider Aguinaldo as the first president, the First Republic fell under the United States' jurisdiction due to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]; the United States thus does not consider his tenure to have been legitimate.<ref name=tucker2009p8 /><ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/aguinaldo.html Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy], U.S. Library of Congress.</ref> [[Manuel L. Quezon]] is considered to be the first president by the United States.  He is also the first to win a popular election and a nationwide election.\n\n==== Laurel's position ====\n[[File:Jose P. Laurel giving a speech.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] giving a speech after his inauguration as President of the [[Second Philippine Republic]]]]\nAs with many other [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-occupied countries in the Second World War, the Philippines had at one point two presidents heading two governments. One was Quezon and the Commonwealth [[Government in exile|government-in-exile]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the other was Manila-based Laurel heading the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic. Notably, Laurel was himself instructed to remain in Manila by President Quezon.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Laurel was not formally recognized as a president until the rule of [[Diosdado Macapagal]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=some reliable source reporting that recognition should be easy to find}} His inclusion in the official list coincided with the transfer of the official date of Independence Day from July 4 (the anniversary of the Philippines' independence from the United States) to June 12 (the anniversary of the 1898 Declaration of Independence).\n\nThe inclusion of Laurel thus causes some problems in determining the order of presidents. It is inaccurate to call Laurel the successor of Osme\u00f1a or vice versa, since Laurel's Second Republic was formally repudiated after World War II, its actions not considered legal or binding. Quezon, Osme\u00f1a, and Roxas were seen as being in a contiguous line according to the 1935 Constitution, while Laurel was the only president of the Second Republic, which had a separate charter. Thus, Laurel had neither predecessor nor successor, while Osme\u00f1a succeeded Quezon after the latter's death, and was in turn succeeded by Roxas as President of the Third Republic.\n\n==Powers and roles==\n\n===Chief Executive===\nThe president of the Philippines, being the chief executive, serves as both the head of state and head of government of the Philippines. The constitution vests the executive power with the president who consequently heads the government's executive branch, including the Cabinet and all executive departments.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 1</ref>\n\nThe president has power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures after conviction by final judgment, except in cases of impeachment. The president can grant amnesty with the concurrence of the majority of all the members of the Congress.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 19</ref> The president has authority to contract or guarantee foreign loans on behalf of the Republic but only with the prior concurrence of the Monetary Board and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 20.</ref>\n\nThe president also exercises general supervision over local government units.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 10, sec. 4.</ref>\n\n===Commander-in-Chief===\nThe president also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 18.</ref> This includes the power to suspend the [[writ of habeas corpus]] and to declare [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial law]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Power of appointment===\nWith the consent of the Commission on Appointments, the president also appoints the heads of the executive departments, board of members and its leaders from any national government-related institutions, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, high-ranking officers of the armed forces, and other officials.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 16.</ref> The members of the Supreme Court and lower courts are also appointed by the president, but only from the list of nominees prepared by the Judicial and Bar Council. Such appointments do not need the approval of the Commission on Appointments.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 8, sec. 9.</ref>\n\n===Government agencies===\n{{main|Office of the President of the Philippines}}\nSome government agencies report to no specific department but are instead under the Office of the President. These include important agencies such as the [[National Security Council (Philippines)|National Security Council]],  Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]], [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]], Climate Change Commission, Commission on Population, Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]], [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]], Authority of the [[Freeport Area of Bataan]], [[Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority]], and many more.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.pcoo.gov.ph/dir-executiveoffices.htm|title = Agencies/Offices under the Office of the President|date = |accessdate = Jan 6, 2016|website = Presidential Communications Operations Office|publisher = Government of the Philippines|last = |first = }}</ref> The [[Presidential Security Group]], which is composed mostly of members from the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine National Police]], is directly under the Office of the President.\n\n== Election process ==\n\n=== Eligibility ===\nArticle 7, Section 2 of the Constitution reads:\n\"No person may be elected President unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election.\" <ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 2</ref>\nThe Constitution also provides term limits where the president is ineligible for reelection and a person who has succeeded as President and has served as such for more than four years will be ineligible to be elected for a second term. However, with the case of [[Joseph Estrada]] who [[1998 Philippine presidential election|was elected president in 1998]], [[2001 EDSA Revolution|deposed in 2001]], and again [[2010 Philippine presidential election|ran for the presidency in 2010]], the Constitution's wording where \"[the] President shall not be eligible for any re-election\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 4</ref> remains unclear as his case was never brought to the Supreme Court. It remains unclear whether the term limit of no re-election applies only to the incumbent president or for any person who has been elected as President.\n\n=== Election ===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential election}}\n[[File:Home provinces of Philippine Presidents.PNG|thumb|Home [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] (blue and purple) of the presidents.]]\nThe president is elected by direct vote every six years, usually on the second Monday of May.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe returns of every election for President and Vice President, duly certified by the board of canvassers of each province or city, shall be transmitted to Congress, directed to the president of the Senate. Upon receipt of the certificates of canvass, the president of the Senate shall open all the certificates in the presence of a joint public session of Congress not later than 30 days after election day. Congress then canvasses the votes upon determining that the polls are authentic and were done in the manner provided by law.\n\nThe person with the highest number of votes is declared the winner, but in case two or more have the highest number of votes, the president is elected by a majority of all members of both Houses, voting separately on each.\n\n===Inauguration===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential inauguration}}\n{{Further|List of Philippine presidential inaugurations}}\n[[File:Carlos P Garcia second inauguration, 1957.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos P. Garcia]] is sworn in as the 8th president of the Philippines after winning the election of 1957]]\n[[File:Rodrigo Duterte oath taking 6.30.16.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodrigo Duterte]] during his [[Inauguration of Rodrigo Duterte|inauguration]]]]\n\nThe president of the Philippines usually takes the Oath of Office at noon of June 30 following the presidential election\n\nTraditionally, the [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]] takes the oath first, a little before noon. This is for two reasons: first, according to protocol, no one follows the president (who is last due to his supremacy), and second, to establish a constitutionally valid successor before the president-elect accedes. During the [[Manuel L. Quezon|Quezon]] inauguration, however, the vice president and the Legislature were sworn in after the president, to symbolise a new start.\n\nAs soon as the president takes the Oath of Office, a [[21-gun salute]] is fired to salute the new head of state, and the [[honors music|Presidential Anthem]] ''Mabuhay'' is played. The president delivers his inaugural address, and then proceeds to [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] to climb the Grand Staircase, a ritual which symbolises the formal possession of the Palace. The president then inducts the newly formed cabinet into office in one of the state rooms.\n\nCustom has enshrined three places as the traditional venue for the inauguration ceremony: [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos City]], [[Bulacan]]; in front of the old Legislative Building (now part of the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]]) in Manila; or at [[Quirino Grandstand]], where most have been held. In 2004, [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] delivered her pre-inaugural address at Quirino Grandstand, took the Oath of Office in [[Cebu City]] before Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr.]], and the next day held the first cabinet meeting in [[Butuan City]]. She broke with precedent, reasoning that she wanted to celebrate her inauguration in each of the three main island groups of the Philippines: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. Her first inauguration also broke precedent as she was sworn in at the [[EDSA Shrine]] on January 20, 2001, during the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001]] that removed [[Joseph Estrada]] from office.\n\nIn the past, elections were held in November and the president's inauguration was held on December 30 ([[Rizal Day]]). This ensured that when the inauguration was usually held at [[Quirino Grandstand]], the new president could see the [[Rizal Monument]] on the anniversary of his death. [[Ferdinand Marcos]] transferred the dates of both the elections and the inauguration to May and June, respectively, and it remains so to this day.\n\nThe dress code at the modern inaugural ceremony is traditional, formal Filipino clothing, which is otherwise loosely termed ''Filipiniana''. Ladies must wear [[terno]], [[baro't saya]] (the formal wear of other indigenous groups is permissible), while men don the [[Barong Tagalog]]. Non-Filipinos at the ceremony may wear their respective versions of formal dress, but foreign diplomats have often been seen donning ''Filipiniana'' as a mark of cultural respect.\n\n===Oath of Office===\nThe Constitution provides the following oath or affirmation for the president and vice president-elect which must be taken before they enter into office:<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/ Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 5]</ref>\n\n{{quotation|\"I, (name), do solemnly swear [or affirm], that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President [or Vice-President or Acting President] of the Philippines.

So help me God.\" [In case of affirmation, last sentence will be omitted.]|4 = Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 5}}\n\nThe Filipino text of the oath used for the inaugurations of [[Fidel V.

In the Senate, selected members of the House of Representatives act as the prosecutors and the senators act as judges with the Senate president and chief justice of the Supreme Court jointly presiding over the proceedings. Like the United States, to convict the official in question requires that a minimum of two-thirds (i.e., 16 of 24 members) of the senate vote in favour of conviction. If an impeachment attempt is unsuccessful or the official is acquitted, no new cases can be filed against that impeachable official for at least one full year.\n\n=== Impeachable offenses ===\nThe Constitution enumerates the culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, and betrayal of public trust as grounds for the impeachment of the president.<ref>Constitution of the Philippines, art. 11, sec. 2.</ref> The same also applies for the vice president, the members of the Supreme Court, the members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the ombudsman.\n\n=== Impeachment attempts and proceedings ===\n\n==== Joseph Ejercito Estrada ====\nJoseph Ejercito Estrada was the first president to undergo impeachment when the House of Representatives voted to raise the impeachment proceedings to the Senate in 2000.

After his defeat in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], Aguinaldo transferred the [[Capital of the Philippines]] to different areas while he struggled in the pursuit of American Forces. When the Americans occupied the Philippines, they also used the Palace as an official residence. During the [[Japanese Occupation of the Philippines]], the governmental offices and the presidential residence transferred to Baguio, and the [[The Mansion, Baguio|Mansion House]] was used as the official residence. Meanwhile, President Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth resided in the [[Omni Shoreham Hotel]] in Washington D.C.
