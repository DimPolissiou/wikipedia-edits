It became [[extinct in the wild]] in 1987 (all remaining wild individuals were captured), but has since been reintroduced to northern Arizona and southern Utah (including the [[Grand Canyon]] area and [[Zion National Park]]), the coastal mountains of central and southern California, and northern [[Baja California]]. Although other [[#Evolutionary history|fossil members]] are known, it is the only surviving member of the [[genus]] ''Gymnogyps''. The species is listed by the [[IUCN]] as critically endangered.\n\nThe [[plumage]] is black with patches of white on the underside of the wings; the head is largely bald, with skin color ranging from gray on young birds to yellow and bright orange on breeding adults. Its {{convert|3.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[wingspan]] is the widest of any North American bird, and its weight of up to {{convert|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}} nearly equals that of the [[trumpeter swan]], the heaviest among native North American bird species.

condor''' (''Gymnogyps californianus'') is a [[New World vulture]], the largest North American land bird. It became [[extinct in the wild]] in 1987 (all remaining wild individuals were captured), but has since been reintroduced to northern Arizona and southern Utah (including the [[Grand Canyon]] area and [[Zion National Park]]), the coastal mountains of central and southern California, and northern [[Baja California]]. Although other [[#Evolutionary history|fossil members]] are known, it is the only surviving member of the [[genus]] ''Gymnogyps''. The species is listed by the [[IUCN]] as critically endangered.\n\nThe [[plumage]] is black with patches of white on the underside of the wings; the head is largely bald, with skin color ranging from gray on young birds to yellow and bright orange on breeding adults. Its {{convert|3.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[wingspan]] is the widest of any North American bird, and its weight of up to {{convert|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}} nearly equals that of the [[trumpeter swan]], the heaviest among native North American bird species. The condor is a [[scavenger]] and eats large amounts of [[carrion]]. It is one of the world's [[List of long-living organisms|longest-living]] birds, with a lifespan of up to 60 years.<ref name=\"cnn.com\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/04/26/california.condor/index.html?hpt=C2|work=CNN|title=Once nearly extinct, the California condor nears new milestones|date=April 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Condor]] numbers dramatically declined in the 20th century due to [[poaching]], [[lead poisoning]], and [[habitat destruction]].<ref name=\"SDPop\">{{cite web| title= San Diego Zoo's Animal Bytes: California Condor| publisher=The Zoological Society of San Diego's Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species| url = http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-condor.html| accessdate= April 18, 2012}}</ref>  A [[conservation movement|conservation]] plan was put in place by the United States government that led to the capture of all the remaining wild condors which was completed in 1987, with a total population of 27 individuals.<ref>{{cite web | title=Last Wild California Condor Capture for Breeding Program | work=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (press release) | url=https://www.fws.gov/news/Historic/NewsReleases/1987/19870421.pdf | accessdate=2009-05-06 }}</ref><!-- Please see [[Talk:California_condor#22_vs_27_captive_individuals]] for some info regarding conflicting estimates here --> These surviving birds were bred at the [[San Diego Wild Animal Park]] and the [[Los Angeles Zoo]].

The S8 and S8+ were unveiled on 29 March 2017 and directly succeeded the [[Samsung Galaxy S7|Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge]], with a North American release on 21 April 2017 and international rollout throughout April and May. The S8 Active was announced on 8 August 2017 and is exclusive to certain U.S. cellular carriers.\n\nThe S8 and S8+ contain upgraded hardware and major design changes over the S7 line, including larger screens with a taller [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and curved sides on both the smaller and larger models, [[iris recognition|iris]] and [[face recognition]], a new suite of [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistant]] features known as [[Bixby (voice assistant)|Bixby]] (along with a new dedicated physical button for launching the assistant), a shift from [[MicroUSB]] to [[USB-C]] charging, and [[Samsung DeX]], a [[docking station]] accessory that allows the phones to be used with a [[desktop environment|desktop interface]] with keyboard and mouse input support. The S8 Active features tougher materials designed for protection against shock, shatter, water and dust, with a metal frame and a tough texture for improved grip that makes the S8 Active have a [[Rugged computer|rugged]] design. The Active's screen measures the same size as the standard S8 model but loses the curved edges in favor of a metal frame.\n\nThe S8 and S8+ received mostly positive reviews. Their design and form factor received praise, while critics also liked the updated software and camera optimizations. They received criticism for duplicate software apps, lackluster Bixby features at launch, and for the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the rear next to the camera. A video published after the phones' release proved that the devices' facial and iris scanners can be fooled by suitable photographs of the user.\n\nThe S8 and S8+ were in high demand at release. During the pre-order period, a record one million units were booked in South Korea, and overall sales numbers were 30% higher than the Galaxy S7. However, subsequent reports in May announced sales of over five million units, a notably lower first-month sales number than previous Galaxy S series models.\n\nOn March 11, 2018, Samsung launched the successor to the S8, the [[Samsung Galaxy S9]].\n\n== History ==\nPrior to its official announcement, [http://efetunes.com media] outlets reported on rumors and information from industry insiders.

The hardware of the device was described as \"practically flawless\". Seifert also liked the new software, writing that \"Samsung is known less for polish and more for clumsiness.

However, he criticized the Bixby assistant, writing that \"in its current state, it doesn\u2019t do much at all\", and also criticized the number of duplicate apps. Regarding performance, he wrote that the S8 was \"fast and responsive, but so is virtually every other premium phone you can buy, and the S8 isn\u2019t noticeably faster or quicker than a [[Pixel (smartphone)|Google Pixel]], [[LG G6]], or [[iPhone 7]]\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Seifert |title=Samsung Galaxy S8 review: Ahead of the curve |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=18 April 2017 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> Fellow ''Verge'' reporter Vlad Savov felt that the placement of the fingerprint sensor was \"a perplexing decision if we consider it as a deliberate design choice\", but noted reports from Korea claiming that Samsung had originally intended for the fingerprint reader to be built directly into the screen, but was unable to reach a desirable implementation in time for release.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vlad |last=Savov |title=The Galaxy S8's misplaced fingerprint scanner was probably a last-minute change |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/1/15147998/samsung-galaxy-s8-fingerprint-reader-location |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Verge]]'' wrote that \"Samsung\u2019s six-month-old S8 has cutting edge features and design with fewer issues than other Android phones\" like the [[Google Pixel 2]] and [[LG V30]], and that the \"OLED screen stretches to the edges of the device and curves on its sides in an almost liquid fashion.

Velazco also praised the software, calling Samsung's added interface \"subtle and thoughtful in its design choices\". While noting that the Bixby assistant wasn't ready yet, he did compliment the promised voice features as being more granular than those offered through [[Siri]] or [[Google Assistant]], and wrote that \"With that kind of complexity involved, maybe it's no surprise this stuff isn't done yet\". Also praising performance and the camera, though noting that \"The 12-megapixel sensors on the back haven't changed much since last year.

For the top-tier premium price tag, we'd prefer Samsung to put in the extra work and use a metal back\". He criticized the biometric options for unlocking the phones, writing that \"There's an iris scanner, a fingerprint reader, and face unlock. The problem is none of them are any good\", and also criticized duplicate apps, writing that \"most of which can't be removed and aren't very compelling\".

The S8 and S8+ were unveiled on 29 March 2017 and directly succeeded the [[Samsung Galaxy S7|Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge]], released the previous year, with a North American release on 21 April 2017 and international rollout throughout April and May. The S8 Active was announced on 8 August 2017 and is exclusive to certain U.S. cellular carriers.\n\nThe S8 and S8+ contain upgraded hardware and major design changes over the S7 line, including larger screens with a taller [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] and curved sides on both the smaller and larger models, [[iris recognition|iris]] and [[face recognition]], a new suite of [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual assistant]] features known as [[Bixby (voice assistant)|Bixby]] (along with a new dedicated physical button for launching the assistant), a shift from [[MicroUSB]] to [[USB-C]] charging, and [[Samsung DeX]], a [[docking station]] accessory that allows the phones to be used with a [[desktop environment|desktop interface]] with keyboard and mouse input support. The S8 Active features tougher materials designed for protection against shock, shatter, water and dust, with a metal frame and a tough texture for improved grip that makes the S8 Active have a [[Rugged computer|rugged]] design. The Active's screen measures the same size as the standard S8 model but loses the curved edges in favor of a metal frame.\n\nThe S8 and S8+ received mostly positive reviews. Their design and form factor received praise, while critics also liked the updated software and camera optimizations. They received criticism for duplicate software apps, lackluster Bixby features at launch, and for the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the rear next to the camera. A video published after the phones' release proved that the devices' facial and iris scanners can be fooled by suitable photographs of the user.\n\nThe S8 and S8+ added Brofist by Roomie ([[2019]]), the official ringtone that S8 and S8+ were the alarms and phone calls.\n\nThe S8 and S8+ were in high demand at release. During the pre-order period, a record one million units were booked in South Korea, and overall sales numbers were 30% higher than the Galaxy S7. However, subsequent reports in May announced sales of over five million units, a notably lower first-month sales number than previous Galaxy S series models.\n\nOn March 11, 2018, Samsung launched the successor to the S8, the [[Samsung Galaxy S9]].\n\n== History ==\nPrior to its official announcement, [http://efetunes.com media] outlets reported on rumors and information from industry insiders.

The hardware of the device was described as \"practically flawless\". Seifert also liked the new software, writing that \"Samsung is known less for polish and more for clumsiness. In a refreshing change of pace, the software on the S8 is, dare I say, {{sic|''good''}}\". However, he criticized the Bixby assistant, writing that \"in its current state, it doesn\u2019t do much at all\", and also criticized the number of duplicate apps. Regarding performance, he wrote that the S8 was \"fast and responsive, but so is virtually every other premium phone you can buy, and the S8 isn\u2019t noticeably faster or quicker than a [[Pixel (smartphone)|Google Pixel]], [[LG G6]], or [[iPhone 7]]\".<ref>{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Seifert |title=Samsung Galaxy S8 review: Ahead of the curve |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=18 April 2017 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> Fellow ''Verge'' reporter Vlad Savov felt that the placement of the fingerprint sensor was \"a perplexing decision if we consider it as a deliberate design choice\", but noted reports from Korea claiming that Samsung had originally intended for the fingerprint reader to be built directly into the screen, but was unable to reach a desirable implementation in time for release.<ref>{{cite web |first=Vlad |last=Savov |title=The Galaxy S8's misplaced fingerprint scanner was probably a last-minute change |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/1/15147998/samsung-galaxy-s8-fingerprint-reader-location |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=1 April 2017 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[The Verge]]'' wrote that \"Samsung\u2019s six-month-old S8 has cutting edge features and design with fewer issues than other Android phones\" like the [[Google Pixel 2]] and [[LG V30]], and that the \"OLED screen stretches to the edges of the device and curves on its sides in an almost liquid fashion.

Velazco also praised the software, calling Samsung's added interface \"subtle and thoughtful in its design choices\". While noting that the Bixby assistant wasn't ready yet, he did compliment the promised voice features as being more granular than those offered through [[Siri]] or [[Google Assistant]], and wrote that \"With that kind of complexity involved, maybe it's no surprise this stuff isn't done yet\". Also praising performance and the camera, though noting that \"The 12-megapixel sensors on the back haven't changed much since last year.

For the top-tier premium price tag, we'd prefer Samsung to put in the extra work and use a metal back\". He criticized the biometric options for unlocking the phones, writing that \"There's an iris scanner, a fingerprint reader, and face unlock. The problem is none of them are any good\", and also criticized duplicate apps, writing that \"most of which can't be removed and aren't very compelling\".

Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977.

Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his [[Friar Park]] home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to [[Ganga in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] in a private ceremony in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India.

1943&nbsp;\u2013 29 November 2001) was an English musician, singer-songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of [[the Beatles]]. Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of [[popular music]] through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and [[Hinduism|Hindu]]-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.{{sfn|Gilmore|2002|pp=34, 36}} Although the majority of the band's songs were written by [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|John Lennon and Paul McCartney]], most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"[[Taxman]]\", \"[[Within You Without You]]\", \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included [[George Formby]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]; [[Carl Perkins]], [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Chuck Berry]] were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into [[folk rock]] through his interest in [[Bob Dylan]] and [[the Byrds]], and towards [[Indian classical music]] through his use of the [[sitar]] on \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\". Having initiated the band's embracing of [[Transcendental Meditation]] in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna movement]]. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the band's break-up]] in 1970, Harrison released the triple album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the [[slide guitar]]. He also organised the 1971 [[The Concert for Bangladesh|Concert for Bangladesh]] with Indian musician [[Ravi Shankar]], a precursor to later [[benefit concert]]s such as [[Live Aid]]. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] record label before founding [[Dark Horse Records]] in 1974 and co-founding [[HandMade Films]] in 1978.\n\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the [[RIAA certification|platinum-selling]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] the [[Traveling Wilburys]]. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by [[Badfinger]], [[Ronnie Wood]] and [[Billy Preston]], and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Tom Petty]], among others. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\". He is a two-time [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee \u2013 as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees|title=2015 Rock Hall inductees|publisher=Radio.com|accessdate=16 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217154623/http://radio.com/2014/12/16/green-day-joan-jett-ringo-starr-lead-rock-hall-2015-inductees/|archivedate=17 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nHarrison's first marriage, to model [[Pattie Boyd]] in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married [[Olivia Harrison|Olivia Arias]], with whom he had a son, [[Dhani Harrison|Dhani]]. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his [[Friar Park]] home. His remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered according to [[Ganga in Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] in a private ceremony in the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers in India.

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. While she is there, \u00c1ngel calls her phone, asking to speak with her in person. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. The police arrest her at the hospital moments after she tells \u00c1ngel that she knows where the Professor's hideout is, but will not tell them because she \"does not know who the good guys are\". \u00c1ngel is asked by Colonel Prieto where the Professor's hideout is, but he withholds the information. When Colonel Prieto threatens Raquel with several charges that would ensure her daughter taken away from her, she finally gives him the address of the hideout. The police race to the hideout. With the police inside the Mint, Berlin fights them off so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, although the Professor urges him to come. Berlin insistently continues and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape successfully from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police show up. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force, the robbers got away with about \u20ac1 billion and their whereabouts are still unknown.

Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this.

After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged.

Raquel is discovered in the barn by a farmer and his wife, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]] and a negotiation between Raquel and the farmers. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Afterwards, Sierra plans to use Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Su\u00e1rez and his men close in on Raquel's position as Raquel bargains with the farmers for her freedom by offering a reward greater than that of the police.

The robbers then rush to finish their escape tunnel. The Professor walks out of the villa at gunpoint by Raquel, but she is emotionally unable and unwilling to stop him from escaping. Colonel Prieto, Su\u00e1rez, and Alberto confront Raquel and remove her from the case after they identify the Professor as Salva (Sergio), who they believe Raquel is co-operating with due to signals made from local cell towers by calls from the Professor to Raquel. With her gun and badge taken away, she takes \u00c1ngel's [[badge]] and starts to conduct her own investigation by looking through surveillance footage of restaurants to determine the route the Professor had taken from his hideout.

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. While she is there, \u00c1ngel calls her phone, asking to speak with her in person. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. The police arrest her at the hospital moments after she tells \u00c1ngel that she knows where the Professor's hideout is, but will not tell them because she \"does not know who the good guys are\". \u00c1ngel is asked by Colonel Prieto where the Professor's hideout is, but he withholds the information. When Colonel Prieto threatens Raquel with several charges that would ensure her daughter taken away from her, she finally gives him the address of the hideout. The police race to the hideout. With the police inside the Mint, Berlin fights them off so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, although the Professor urges him to come. Berlin insistently continues and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape successfully from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police show up. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force, the robbers got away with about \u20ac1 billion and their whereabouts are still unknown. Raquel looks at some postcards given to her previously by the Professor, which she notices has coordinates on them, and when pieced together give a location in [[Palawan]], Philippines.

Meanwhile, Tokyo and Rio have relocated to [[Guna Yala]], Panama, Nairobi and Helsinki to [[La Pampa Province|La Pampa]], Argentina, and Denver, M\u00f3nica and her baby to [[Java]], Indonesia. Wanting a change of scenery, Tokyo leaves Rio in Guna Yala for the city. As she leaves, Rio gives her one of two phones so they can still communicate, phones which he bought on the [[black market]] in [[Casablanca]] from a Libyan claiming to be unregistered. Three days later, the two use the phones, and their signal is immediately detected by [[Europol]]. The Panamanian police trap and arrest Rio, but Tokyo escapes. She calls the Professor using a secure line, and is transported to Thailand where they meet. Meanwhile, Rio is tortured. The Professor, alongside Raquel, gets the gang back together to rescue Rio.

In flashbacks, the Professor recruits Mart\u00edn, an experienced thief and former associate to replace Berlin (Andr\u00e9s). The Professor and Mart\u00edn (now code named \"Palermo\") explain that their strategy for this robbery is based on ''[[Aikido]]'', a martial art that uses an enemy's force to create an advantage.

Andr\u00e9s defends her, stating that he is in love, but the Professor vehemently disagrees, arguing that the first rule of the heist must be to forego personal attachments. In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this. Having relied on mobile transportation and broadcasting, they become stuck when a tree breaks their antenna and the wheels sink in mud. They narrowly escape detection with the help of some sympathetic local farmers. They then manage to inform the team of the breach 10 minutes before it happens, who defeat, capture, unclothe, and humiliate the breaching team by forcing them sing \"[[Bella ciao]]\" on video.

In flashbacks, the Professor instructs the team, preparing them to detect and remove these devices surgically from Rio, if the time comes. After speaking with Rio, the Professor says that he deserves, \"a little vacation\", the code phrase that confirms he is bugged. He instructs Tokyo to act normal in spite of the listening device, as he hopes to use their sexual intimacy to convince the police that the listening device is working. Privately, Rio breaks up with Tokyo, believing that she will be better off with someone else. Nairobi surgically removes the listening device.

In the forest, a massive manhunt begins for the Professor and Raquel. Raquel is discovered in the barn by a farmer and his wife, which begins a [[Mexican Standoff]] and a negotiation between Raquel and the farmers. The robbers create a diversion to make the police think they are escaping, drawing resources away from the manhunt. Afterwards, Sierra plans to use Nairobi's son, whom she had lost custody as a result of using him as a [[Mule (smuggling)|mule]], as a pawn to psychologically destabilise Nairobi while the police prepare a full assault on the bank using an [[Armored car (military)|armoured car]]. Su\u00e1rez and his men close in on Raquel's position as Raquel bargains with the farmers for her freedom by offering a reward greater than that of the police. Sierra brings Nairobi's son, Axel, in front of the bank, luring Nairobi to a window. Sierra gives the green light for a police sniper to shoot; Nairobi is shot in the chest. As the robbers scramble to aid an [[Exsanguination|exsanguinating]] Nairobi, the police begin the assault. In the forest, Su\u00e1rez and the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] find Raquel and remove the farmers from the barn.

Palermo radios the Professor to inform him of the incoming assault and the Professor declares [[DEFCON]] 2, meaning war. Tokyo and Rio rush into firing position with [[RPG-7]]s and fire on the approaching armoured car, destroying it. It is revealed that Raquel is alive and in custody, with Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for his own trap, that Sierra had ordered Su\u00e1rez to fake an execution to elicit a drastic response, stating that \"the war had begun.\"\n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n<!--{{Episode table/part|p=2|c=#2C6576}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 24\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = \n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 25\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = \n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 26\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = \n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 27\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = \n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = \n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 29\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = \n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 30\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = \n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 31\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = \n| AltTitle        = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 000000\n}}-->\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n", "name_user": "41.90.59.24", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Money_Heist_episodes"}

These follow from the more [[Stirling's approximation#Speed of convergence and error estimates|precise error bounds]] discussed below.\n\n== Derivation ==\nRoughly speaking, the simplest version of Stirling's formula can be quickly obtained by approximating the sum\n\n:<math>\\ln n! = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln j</math>\n\nwith an [[integral]]:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln j \\approx \\int_1^n \\ln x \\,{\\rm d}x = n\\ln n - n + 1.</math>\n\nThe full formula, together with precise estimates of its error, can be derived as follows.

Instead of approximating {{math|''n''!}}, one considers its [[natural logarithm]] as this is a [[slowly varying function]]:\n\n:<math>\\ln n! = \\ln 1 + \\ln 2 + \\cdots + \\ln n.</math>\n\nThe right-hand side of this equation minus\n\n:<math>\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\ln 1 + \\ln n) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n</math>\n\nis the approximation by the [[trapezoid rule]] of the integral\n\n:<math>\\ln n! - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n \\approx \\int_1^n \\ln x\\,{\\rm d}x = n \\ln n - n + 1,</math>\n\nand the error in this approximation is given by the [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula]]:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\ln n! - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n & = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln 1 + \\ln 2 + \\ln 3 + \\cdots + \\ln(n-1) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n\\\\\n& = n \\ln n - n + 1 + \\sum_{k=2}^{m} \\frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)} \\left( \\frac{1}{n^{k-1}} - 1 \\right) + R_{m,n},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|B<sub>k</sub>}} is a [[Bernoulli number]], and {{math|''R''<sub>''m'',''n''</sub>}} is the remainder term in the Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula. Take limits to find that\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\ln n! - n \\ln n + n - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n \\right) = 1 - \\sum_{k=2}^{m} \\frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)} + \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} R_{m,n}.</math>\n\nDenote this limit as {{mvar|y}}.  Because the remainder {{math|''R''<sub>''m'',''n''</sub>}} in the [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula]] satisfies\n\n:<math>R_{m,n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} R_{m,n} + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n^m} \\right),</math>\n\nwhere we use [[big-O notation]], combining the equations above yields the approximation formula in its logarithmic form:\n\n:<math>\\ln n! = n \\ln \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\ln n + y + \\sum_{k=2}^{m} \\frac{(-1)^k B_k}{k(k-1)n^{k-1}} + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n^m} \\right).</math>\n\nTaking the exponential of both sides and choosing any positive integer {{mvar|m}}, we get a formula involving an unknown quantity {{mvar|e<sup>y</sup>}}. For {{math|''m'' {{=}} 1}}, the formula is\n\n:<math>n! = e^y \\sqrt{n} \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^n \\left( 1 + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right) \\right).</math>\n\nThe quantity {{mvar|e<sup>y</sup>}} can be found by taking the limit on both sides as {{mvar|n}} tends to infinity and using [[Wallis product|Wallis' product]], which shows that {{math|''e<sup>y</sup>'' {{=}} {{sqrt|2''\u03c0''}}}}. Therefore, we get Stirling's formula:\n\n:<math>n! = \\sqrt{2 \\pi n} \\left( \\frac{n}{e} \\right)^n \\left( 1 + O \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right) \\right).</math>\n\n== An alternative derivation ==\nAn alternative formula for {{math|''n''!}} using the [[gamma function]] is\n:<math> n! = \\int_0^\\infty x^n e^{-x}\\,{\\rm d}x.</math>\n(as can be seen by repeated integration by parts). Rewriting and changing variables {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''ny''}}, one gets\n:<math> n! = \\int_0^\\infty e^{n\\ln x-x}\\,{\\rm d}x = e^{n \\ln n} n \\int_0^\\infty e^{n(\\ln y -y)}\\,{\\rm d}y.</math>\nApplying [[Laplace's method]] we have\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty e^{n(\\ln y -y)}\\,{\\rm d}y \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n},</math>\nwhich recovers Stirling's formula:\n:<math>n! \\sim e^{n \\ln n} n \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n}\n= \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n.\n</math>\nIn fact, further corrections can also be obtained using Laplace's method. For example, computing two-order expansion using Laplace's method yields\n:<math>\\int_0^\\infty e^{n(\\ln y-y)}\\,{\\rm d}y \\sim  \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n}\n\\left(1+\\frac{1}{12 n}\\right)</math>\nand gives Stirling's formula to two orders:\n:<math> n! \\sim e^{n \\ln n} n \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{n}} e^{-n}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{12 n}\\right)\n= \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{12 n}\\right).\n</math>\n\nA complex-analysis version of this method<ref>Phillipe Flajolet and Robert Sedgewick, ''[[Analytic Combinatorics]]'', p.\u00a0555.</ref> is to consider <math>\\frac{1}{n!}</math> as a [[Taylor series|Taylor coefficient]] of the exponential function <math>e^z = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{z^n}{n!}</math>, computed by [[Cauchy's integral formula]] as\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{n!} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\oint\\limits_{|z|=r} \\frac{e^z}{z^{n+1}} \\, \\mathrm dz. </math>\n\nThis line integral can then be approximated using the [[Method of steepest descent|saddle-point method]] with an appropriate choice of countour radius <math>r = r_n</math>. The dominant portion of the integral near the saddle point is then approximated by a real integral and Laplace's method, while the remaining portion of the integral can be bounded above to give an error term.\n\n== Speed of convergence and error estimates ==\n[[File:Stirling series relative error.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The relative error in a truncated Stirling series vs. {{mvar|n}}, for 0 to 5 terms.
