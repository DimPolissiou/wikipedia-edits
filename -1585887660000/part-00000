The first in the [[Robert Langdon (film series)|''Robert Langdon'' film series]], the film stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Audrey Tautou]], [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]], [[Jean Reno]] and [[Paul Bettany]]. In the movie, [[Robert Langdon]], a professor of religious symbology from [[Harvard University]], is the prime suspect in the grisly and unusual murder of Louvre curator Jacques Sauni\u00e8re. In the body, the police find a disconcerting cipher and start an investigation.<ref name=\"Dan Brown \u00bb The Da Vinci Code\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.danbrown.com/the-davinci-code/|title=Dan Brown \u00bb The Da Vinci Code|website=www.danbrown.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref> A noted British Grail historian named Sir Leigh Teabing tells them that the actual Holy Grail is explicitly encoded in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s wall painting, ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''. Also searching for the Grail is a secret cabal within [[Opus Dei]], an actual [[prelature]] of the [[Holy See]], who wish to keep the true Grail a secret to prevent the destruction of Christianity.\n\nThe film, like the book, was considered controversial. It was met with especially harsh criticism by the [[Catholic Church]] for the accusation that it is behind a two-thousand-year-old cover-up concerning what the Holy Grail really is and the concept that Jesus Christ and [[Mary Magdalene]] were married and that the union produced a daughter, as well as its treatment of the organizations [[Priory of Sion]] and Opus Dei. Many members urged the [[laity]] to boycott the film. In the book, Dan Brown states that the Priory of Sion and \"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\"  The book furthermore inspired Eva and Ariel to sneak bread into all the paintings in the sistine chapel.\n\nThe film grossed $224 million in its worldwide opening weekend and a total of $758 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 2006, as well as Howard\u2019s highest-grossing film to date. However, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Angels & Demons (film)|Angels & Demons]]'' (2009) and ''[[Inferno (2016 film)|Inferno]]'' (2016).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->\nJacques Sauni\u00e8re, a [[Louvre]] curator, is pursued through the Grand Gallery by an [[albino]] [[Catholic]] [[monk]] named Silas, who demands the location of the Priory's \"keystone\" to find and destroy the [[Holy Grail]]. Sauni\u00e8re gives him a false lead and is murdered. The police find his body posed like Da Vinci's [[Vitruvian Man]]. Police captain Bezu Fache has his lieutenant, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Collet, summon American [[symbologist]] [[Robert Langdon]], who is in Paris for a lecture on the interpretation of symbols, to examine Sauni\u00e8re's body.\n\nLangdon is shown the body and a secret message, readable only by [[blacklight]]. It contains an out-of-order [[Fibonacci number| Fibonacci]] sequence. Sophie Neveu, a police [[cryptographer]] and Sauni\u00e8re's granddaughter, tells Langdon that Fache planted a tracker on him after finding the words, \"P.S. Find Robert Langdon\" at the end of Sauni\u00e8re's secret message. Fache believes Langdon murdered Sauni\u00e8re. Sophie throws away the tracker, distracting the police while they sneak around the Louvre, finding more clues in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s works. Langdon deduces that Sauni\u00e8re was the grand master of the [[Priory of Sion]].\n\nSilas works for an anonymous person referred to as \"the Teacher\", along with members of [[Opus Dei]], led by Bishop Aringarosa. Langdon and Sophie travel to the Depository Bank of Zurich and access Sauni\u00e8re's [[safe deposit box]] by using the [[Fibonacci sequence]]. Inside is a [[cryptex]], a cylindrical container that  contains a message on [[papyrus]]. It can only be opened without destroying the contents by turning dials to spell a code word. As police arrive, bank manager Andre Vernet helps Langdon and Sophie escape, then attempts to steal the cryptex and murder them. Langdon and Sophie escape with the cryptex.\n\nThey visit Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail expert. Teabing claims the Grail is not a cup but instead is [[Mary Magdalene]]. He says she was not a prostitute but the wife of [[Jesus Christ]]. Teabing argues that Mary was pregnant during His crucifixion, and the Priory formed to protect their descendants. The [[Opus Dei]] have been trying to destroy the Grail to preserve the credibility of the [[Holy See| Vatican]]. Later, Silas breaks into Teabing's house, but Teabing, who uses crutches, uses one to disable him. The group escapes to [[London]] via Teabing's private plane, along with his butler, Remy Jean. They travel to the [[Temple Church]], but the clue to unlocking the cryptex is a [[red herring]]. Remy, who claims to be the Teacher, frees Silas. Remy takes Teabing hostage, dumping him in the car trunk, and taking Silas to hide out in an Opus Dei [[safe house]]. Teabing, who is revealed as the Teacher, later poisons Remy and sends the police after Silas. Police shoot Silas after accidentally wounding Aringarosa, who is promptly arrested by Fache, who resents being used to hunt Langdon.\n\nTeabing, who wants to bring down the Church for centuries of persecution and deceit, confronts Langdon and Sophie. The trio goes to [[Westminster Abbey]] to the tomb of [[Isaac Newton]], a former grand master of the Priory. Teabing demands that the pair open the cryptex. Langdon tries and then tosses the cryptex into the air. Teabing dives for it, catches it, but vinegar dribbles, and the papyrus is thought destroyed. The police arrive to arrest Teabing, who realizes Langdon must have solved the cryptex's code and removed the papyrus. The code is revealed to be \"APPLE\", after the [[Isaac Newton#Apple incident| apocryphal myth]] of the apple which led Newton to discover his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation |law of universal gravitation]]. The clue inside the cryptex, which tells of the Grail hiding {{\" '}}neath the rose,\" leads Langdon and Sophie to [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in [[Scotland]].\n\nInside the chapel, they discover Magdalene's tomb has been removed. Langdon, after searching through documents, realizes that Sophie's family died in a car crash, that Sauni\u00e8re was not her grandfather but her protector, and that she is the last descendant of Jesus Christ. The two are greeted by several members of the Priory, including Sophie's grandmother, who promises to protect her. Langdon and Sophie part ways, the former returning to Paris. While shaving, he cuts himself and has an epiphany when his blood curves down the sink, reminding him of the [[Rose Line]]. Realizing the true meaning of the cryptex clue, he follows the line to the Louvre, concluding the Holy Grail, the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, is hidden below the [[Pyramide Invers\u00e9e]]. Langdon kneels above it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Robert Langdon]]\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] as Sophie Neveu\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as Sir Leigh Teabing\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Bishop Aringarosa\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Andr\u00e9 Vernet\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Police Captain Bezu Fache\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Silas\n* [[\u00c9tienne Chicot]] as Lieutenant J\u00e9r\u00f4me Collet\n* [[Jean-Yves Berteloot]] as Remy Jean\n* [[Jean-Pierre Marielle]] as Jacques Sauni\u00e8re\n* Charlotte Graham as Mary Magdalene\n* [[Hugh Mitchell (actor)|Hugh Mitchell]] as young Silas\n* [[Seth Gabel]] as Michael the Cleric\n* [[Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Audollent]] as Sister Sandrine\n* [[Francesco Carnelutti (actor)|Francesco Carnelutti]] as Prefect\n* Rita Davies as Elegant Woman at Rosslyn\n* [[Denis Podalyd\u00e8s]] as Flight Controller\n* Author [[Dan Brown]] and his wife make cameos (forefront) in the first scene of the book signing scene.\n* ''[[The Templar Revelation]]'' authors [[Lynn Picknett]] and Clive Prince make a brief appearance as passengers on a bus.\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Bill Paxton]] was director Ron Howard's first choice for the role of Robert Langdon, but had to decline as he was beginning filming for the television series ''[[Big Love]]''.<ref>[https://www.straight.com/movies/873866/twister-titanic-apollo-13-and-aliens-star-bill-paxton-dies Twister, Titanic, Apollo 13, and Aliens star Bill Paxton dies]</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film rights were purchased from [[Dan Brown]] for $6 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://au.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_100/114_special_feature.html|title = Ask Men|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming had been scheduled to start in May 2005; however, some delays caused filming to begin on June 30, 2005.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Location===\nThe [[Louvre]] gave permission to film relevant scenes at their premises.

The first in the [[Robert Langdon (film series)|''Robert Langdon'' film series]], the film stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Audrey Tautou]], [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], [[Alfred Molina]], [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]], [[Jean Reno]] and [[Paul Bettany]]. In the movie, [[Robert Langdon]], a professor of religious symbology from [[Harvard University]], is the prime suspect in the grisly and unusual murder of Louvre curator Jacques Sauni\u00e8re. In the body, the police find a disconcerting cipher and start an investigation.<ref name=\"Dan Brown \u00bb The Da Vinci Code\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.danbrown.com/the-davinci-code/|title=Dan Brown \u00bb The Da Vinci Code|website=www.danbrown.com|access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref> A noted British Grail historian named Sir Leigh Teabing tells them that the actual Holy Grail is explicitly encoded in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s wall painting, ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|The Last Supper]]''. Also searching for the Grail is a secret cabal within [[Opus Dei]], an actual [[prelature]] of the [[Holy See]], who wish to keep the true Grail a secret to prevent the destruction of Christianity.\n\nThe film, like the book, was considered controversial. It was met with especially harsh criticism by the [[Catholic Church]] for the accusation that it is behind a two-thousand-year-old cover-up concerning what the Holy Grail really is and the concept that Jesus Christ and [[Mary Magdalene]] were married and that the union produced a daughter, as well as its treatment of the organizations [[Priory of Sion]] and Opus Dei. Many members urged the [[laity]] to boycott the film. In the book, Dan Brown states that the Priory of Sion and \"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\"\n\nThe film grossed $224 million in its worldwide opening weekend and a total of $758 million worldwide, becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 2006, as well as Howard\u2019s highest-grossing film to date. However, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Angels & Demons (film)|Angels & Demons]]'' (2009) and ''[[Inferno (2016 film)|Inferno]]'' (2016).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->\nJacques Sauni\u00e8re, a [[Louvre]] curator, is pursued through the Grand Gallery by an [[albino]] [[Catholic]] [[monk]] named Silas, who demands the location of the Priory's \"keystone\" to find and destroy the [[Holy Grail]]. Sauni\u00e8re gives him a false lead and is murdered. The police find his body posed like Da Vinci's [[Vitruvian Man]]. Police captain Bezu Fache has his lieutenant, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Collet, summon American [[symbologist]] [[Robert Langdon]], who is in Paris for a lecture on the interpretation of symbols, to examine Sauni\u00e8re's body.\n\nLangdon is shown the body and a secret message, readable only by [[blacklight]]. It contains an out-of-order [[Fibonacci number| Fibonacci]] sequence. Sophie Neveu, a police [[cryptographer]] and Sauni\u00e8re's granddaughter, tells Langdon that Fache planted a tracker on him after finding the words, \"P.S. Find Robert Langdon\" at the end of Sauni\u00e8re's secret message. Fache believes Langdon murdered Sauni\u00e8re. Sophie throws away the tracker, distracting the police while they sneak around the Louvre, finding more clues in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s works. Langdon deduces that Sauni\u00e8re was the grand master of the [[Priory of Sion]].\n\nSilas works for an anonymous person referred to as \"the Teacher\", along with members of [[Opus Dei]], led by Bishop Aringarosa. Langdon and Sophie travel to the Depository Bank of Zurich and access Sauni\u00e8re's [[safe deposit box]] by using the [[Fibonacci sequence]]. Inside is a [[cryptex]], a cylindrical container that  contains a message on [[papyrus]]. It can only be opened without destroying the contents by turning dials to spell a code word. As police arrive, bank manager Andre Vernet helps Langdon and Sophie escape, then attempts to steal the cryptex and murder them. Langdon and Sophie escape with the cryptex.\n\nThey visit Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, a Holy Grail expert. Teabing claims the Grail is not a cup but instead is [[Mary Magdalene]]. He says she was not a prostitute but the wife of [[Jesus Christ]]. Teabing argues that Mary was pregnant during His crucifixion, and the Priory formed to protect their descendants. The [[Opus Dei]] have been trying to destroy the Grail to preserve the credibility of the [[Holy See| Vatican]]. Later, Silas breaks into Teabing's house, but Teabing, who uses crutches, uses one to disable him. The group escapes to [[London]] via Teabing's private plane, along with his butler, Remy Jean. They travel to the [[Temple Church]], but the clue to unlocking the cryptex is a [[red herring]]. Remy, who claims to be the Teacher, frees Silas. Remy takes Teabing hostage, dumping him in the car trunk, and taking Silas to hide out in an Opus Dei [[safe house]]. Teabing, who is revealed as the Teacher, later poisons Remy and sends the police after Silas. Police shoot Silas after accidentally wounding Aringarosa, who is promptly arrested by Fache, who resents being used to hunt Langdon.\n\nTeabing, who wants to bring down the Church for centuries of persecution and deceit, confronts Langdon and Sophie. The trio goes to [[Westminster Abbey]] to the tomb of [[Isaac Newton]], a former grand master of the Priory. Teabing demands that the pair open the cryptex. Langdon tries and then tosses the cryptex into the air. Teabing dives for it, catches it, but vinegar dribbles, and the papyrus is thought destroyed. The police arrive to arrest Teabing, who realizes Langdon must have solved the cryptex's code and removed the papyrus. The code is revealed to be \"APPLE\", after the [[Isaac Newton#Apple incident| apocryphal myth]] of the apple which led Newton to discover his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation |law of universal gravitation]]. The clue inside the cryptex, which tells of the Grail hiding {{\" '}}neath the rose,\" leads Langdon and Sophie to [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in [[Scotland]].\n\nInside the chapel, they discover Magdalene's tomb has been removed. Langdon, after searching through documents, realizes that Sophie's family died in a car crash, that Sauni\u00e8re was not her grandfather but her protector, and that she is the last descendant of Jesus Christ. The two are greeted by several members of the Priory, including Sophie's grandmother, who promises to protect her. Langdon and Sophie part ways, the former returning to Paris. While shaving, he cuts himself and has an epiphany when his blood curves down the sink, reminding him of the [[Rose Line]]. Realizing the true meaning of the cryptex clue, he follows the line to the Louvre, concluding the Holy Grail, the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, is hidden below the [[Pyramide Invers\u00e9e]]. Langdon kneels above it.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Tom Hanks]] as [[Robert Langdon]]\n* [[Audrey Tautou]] as Sophie Neveu\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as Sir Leigh Teabing\n* [[Alfred Molina]] as Bishop Aringarosa\n* [[J\u00fcrgen Prochnow]] as Andr\u00e9 Vernet\n* [[Jean Reno]] as Police Captain Bezu Fache\n* [[Paul Bettany]] as Silas\n* [[\u00c9tienne Chicot]] as Lieutenant J\u00e9r\u00f4me Collet\n* [[Jean-Yves Berteloot]] as Remy Jean\n* [[Jean-Pierre Marielle]] as Jacques Sauni\u00e8re\n* Charlotte Graham as Mary Magdalene\n* [[Hugh Mitchell (actor)|Hugh Mitchell]] as young Silas\n* [[Seth Gabel]] as Michael the Cleric\n* [[Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Audollent]] as Sister Sandrine\n* [[Francesco Carnelutti (actor)|Francesco Carnelutti]] as Prefect\n* Rita Davies as Elegant Woman at Rosslyn\n* [[Denis Podalyd\u00e8s]] as Flight Controller\n* Author [[Dan Brown]] and his wife make cameos (forefront) in the first scene of the book signing scene.\n* ''[[The Templar Revelation]]'' authors [[Lynn Picknett]] and Clive Prince make a brief appearance as passengers on a bus.\n{{div col end}}\n\n[[Bill Paxton]] was director Ron Howard's first choice for the role of Robert Langdon, but had to decline as he was beginning filming for the television series ''[[Big Love]]''.<ref>[https://www.straight.com/movies/873866/twister-titanic-apollo-13-and-aliens-star-bill-paxton-dies Twister, Titanic, Apollo 13, and Aliens star Bill Paxton dies]</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nThe film rights were purchased from [[Dan Brown]] for $6 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://au.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_100/114_special_feature.html|title = Ask Men|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming had been scheduled to start in May 2005; however, some delays caused filming to begin on June 30, 2005.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Location===\nThe [[Louvre]] gave permission to film relevant scenes at their premises.

(Westminster Abbey is a [[Royal Peculiar]], a church or chapel under the direct jurisdiction of the monarch; whereas Saint-Sulpice is a Roman Catholic institution.)\n\nDue to the denial of a location permit for Saint-Sulpice,<ref name=\"SulpicePermit\"/> the entire scene had to be recreated virtually by post-production company Rainmaker U.K. and though the set had been partially built, the co-ordinates were centimeters out from what the compositors had expected and so the entire process was extremely difficult to complete.<ref name=\"SulpiceSecret\"/>\n\nLincoln Cathedral reportedly received \u00a3100,000 in exchange for the right to film there, with photography occurring between August 15 and 19, 2005, mainly within the cloisters of the cathedral. The cathedral's bell, which strikes the hour, was silent for the first time since [[World War II]] during that time. Although it remained a closed set, protesters led by a 61-year-old woman named Sister Mary Michael demonstrated against the filming. Sister Mary Michael spent 12 hours praying on her knees outside the cathedral in protest against what she saw as the blasphemous use of a holy place to film a book containing [[heresy]].<ref name=\"NunProtest\"/>\n\nWinchester Cathedral answered criticism by using its location fee to fund an exhibition, lecture series, and campaign to debunk the book.<ref name=\"WinchesterFee\"/> The scenes for the Pope's summer residence, [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo|Castel Gandolfo]], were filmed on location at [[Belvoir Castle]] in Leicestershire, England.\n\n[[Shoreham Airport]] in West Sussex, England, was used as a filming location, with its [[art-deco]] terminal building utilized in a night shoot for the scenes at 'Le Bourget' Airport.<ref name=\"Airport\"/>\n\nFilming also took place elsewhere in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"LocationsUK\"/> Locations included the [[King's College London]] campus, [[Fairfield Halls]] ([[Croydon]]), the [[Temple Church]] (London), [[Burghley House]] ([[Lincolnshire]]), and [[Rosslyn Chapel]] and Rosslyn Castle ([[Midlothian]], Scotland) make an appearance at the final part of the film.\n\n===Studio shoots===\nThe filmmakers shot many of the inside scenes at [[Pinewood Studios]];<ref name=\"PinewoodOne\"/> the opening sequence in the cavernous [[007 Stage]] at Pinewood Shepperton, where the interior of the Louvre was recreated.<ref name=\"LouvreRecreated\"/> In this sequence, Hanks' character is taken by French police to the Louvre, where a dead body has been discovered.

Lighting effects were utilized to obscure the body's genitalia; a technique also used on television programs such as ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]''.<ref name=\"NCIS\"/>\n\nPinewood's state-of-the-art [[Underwater Stage]] was used to film underwater sequences.<ref name=\"PinewoodTwo\"/> The stage opened in 2005 after four years of planning and development.
