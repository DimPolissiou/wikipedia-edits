In Paramapadam (Sri Vaikuntham) Sri Devi is seated to the left of the Lord (and therefore in Kausthubham, heart of Lord,in his left side), and Bhu Devi and Nila Devi to His right as Bhu Devi is first wife and Sri Devi the second wife. First wife always occupies Dakshina/Right-hand side of husband. Younger wife occupies the Vama/left hand side. The misconception of Sri Devi to right, and Bhu Devi and Nila Devi to the left arises from a common wrong equating of Sri Devi with \"Mahalakshmi\". Mahalakshmi is singular form of all three wives mixed together. She obviously is to the right while only two forms Bhu Devi and Sri Devi are seated to his left. In such pictures, Nila is absent or indirectly present unified with Bhu Devi. Nila Devi is older than Lord and is sometimes therefore called Jestha Devi, when Vishnu is called Lord Shani. So even though she is third wife, being older in age occupies right side of Lord along with Bhu Devi. Nila is basically Bhu Devi modified and both are symbol for patience and burden. Nila Devi is embodiment of simplicity of Lord Vishnu. Bhu Devi is embodiment of the rule of the lord on earth. While Sri Devi is embodiment of Grandeur of the lord. The Veda sings the glory of Goddess Nila in Nila Suktam.\n\n==Nappinnai==\n\nWhat Bhu Devi ([[Bh\u016bmi]] devi, Goddess of earth) is to [[Varaha]] [[avatara]] and Sri Devi (Sita) to [[Rama]] avatara, is Neela devi to [[Krishna]] avatara. Neela devi took avatar as Nappinnai, daughter of Kumbagan (brother of [[Yashoda]]) and [[Krishna]] won her hand after conquering the seven ferocious bulls of her father. Nappinnai's brother is Sudama. Sri [[Parasara Bhattar]] describes Krishna, intoxicated by her beauty, as \"Neela thunga sthana giri thati suptham\". \n\nNappinnai \u2013 Krishna cult is mainly limited to the Tamil-speaking world.

She in her Thiruppavai, wakes up Nappinai before waking up Lord Krishna. As per [[Srivaishnavism]], [[saranagati]] (complete surrender to the Lord) is performed through His consort and in Sri Krishnaavatharam specifically it is performed through Nappinai.\n\nVelukkudi Swamy, a proponent of [[Vishishtadvaita]] Philosophy says that [[Andal]], singing Nachiar Tirumozhi as the daughter of [[Periyalvar]], mentions about [[Rukmini]]. But singing as a Gopika in [[Thiruppavai]] she mentions only Nappinnai. Alvar mentions the three nachiars (consorts) as Pon mangai(Sri devi), nila mangai (Bhudevi) and pula mangai (Neela Devi) the consort of senses. It is Neela devi who keeps Bhagavan under control by her bhogam. Swami [[Vedanta Desika]] says in Daya satakam - \"nisAmayatu mAm nIla yat bhOga patalai: druvam\". Lord Krishna was a [[Yadava]] kshatriya varna by birth, thus he married Rukmini according to that. He was brought up as a [[Yadava]] vaishya by varna ([[gopa]]), hence he married Nappinnai according to that. Neela suuktam also says - ghruNAhi - ghrutavai - payasvati, etc., mentioning the characteristics of a gopika.\n\nThe name Nappinnai is found in [[Divya Prabandha]] of Alvars and [[Silappadikaram]].\n\n==Krishna\u2019s wedding to Nappinnai==\n\nAfter waking up Nanda Gopalan and Yashoda, the gopis proceeded to wake Goddess Nappinnai who is the consort of Lord Krishna and the incarnation of Neela Devi Nachiar.\u2018Oh daughter in law of Nanda Gopalan,\u2019 addressed the girls. We know that Lord Krishna was only a child while residing in Vrindavan. Yashoda and Nanda Gopan hadn\u2019t even performed the Upanayanam ceremony for Him. Then how did the Lord marry Nappinnai while at Vrindavan? After lord Krishna\u2019s incarnation Neela Devi Nachiar incarnated as the daughter of Yashoda\u2019s brother Kumban near Nepal. As she incarnated after the Lord, she came to be called as \u201cPinnai\u201d and as she is always good, the prefix \u201cnal\u201d was added to her name thus changing her name to Nappinnai. As soon as Nappinnai incarnated the happy Kumban purchased seven identical male calves from the market. \u2018I am going to raise these seven bulls with my daughter. The young man who controls these seven when my daughter comes off age will get her hand in marriage!\u2019The next day when Kumban visited the barn, he was surprised to see that the calves had grown into adult bulls overnight as they were Asuras in disguise. The bulls started to torment the people and Kumban was unable to find a person who could control them. Soon Nappinnai turned three years old when Yashoda visited her brother along with a five year old Krishna.\n\u2018Your son is very beautiful! I can see that He will turn into a handsome youth. I wish I can promise Nappinnai to Him but I made a foolish vow that I will give her hand in marriage only to the man who can control all seven bulls tied in my barn,\u2019 said Kumban.\u2018Uncle, don\u2019t worry,\u2019 said Krishna, \u2018I will subdue those bulls this very second!\u2019Kumban laughed at the sweet child but was terrified when Krishna went in search of the bulls. \u2018Yashoda stop your son!

They have issued calls through their online radio broadcast station called \"Radio Biafra\" for a peaceful settlement of their grievances through a referendum in the Nigerian states that were part of the old Eastern Region.\n\nSupporters of Biafran independence are from the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Anang]], [[Igbanke]], [[Igala Kingdom|Igala]], [[Idoma people|Idoma]]  and other ethnic groups within the map of  defunct Biafran state<ref name=\":2\" />.

The IPOB rose to prominence after previous Biafran independence organizations got weakened. The Nigerian government has been cracking down on IPOB members who peacefully protested  due to Kanu's arrest and incarceration despite various courts rulings for his release. \n\nToday, IPOB has metamorphosed from a group to a movement of the Indigenous Biafran population who are fed up with the Nigerian depleting state. Biafrans all over the world have identified with the movement, thereby making IPOB to be a face of Biafra restoration movement.\n\n== Background ==\nBiafra had previously existed as an Independent Republic declared by Lieutenant Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu for three years, 1967 through 1970. The federal government fought hard to preserve the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and did not like the idea of an independent state of [[Biafra]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Biafra |title= Biafra: Secessonist State, Nigeria|author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref>. The result of tensions between Biafra and the federal government resulted in the [[Nigerian Civil War|Nigerian civil war]] that went on for three years. There were an estimated one to 3.5 million deaths that were heavily civilian casualties caused by starvation and death on the side of Biafra<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/blog/whats-name-nigerian-civil-war-everything|title=What's in a Name? For the Nigerian Civil War, Everything|website=Council on Foreign Relations|language=en|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. In 1970, the Biafran forces surrendered through the armistice brokered by the defunct OAU <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Peaceful Settlement of Disputes: Unsolved Problem for the OAU (A Case Study of the Nigeria-Biafra Conflict)|journal = Africa Today|volume = 24|issue = 4|pages = 39\u201358|jstor = 4185729|last1 = Akuchu|first1 = Gemuh E.|year = 1977}}</ref>. From 1970 onwards, Nigeria remained a united nation. \n\n== Leadership ==\nThe leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra is [[Nnamdi Kanu|Nnamdi kanu]] who is a dual British and Biafran citizen. He created IPOB after he initially gained fame from his broadcasts on [[Radio Biafra]], which was established in 2009. This was a radio station from London that broadcast messages that called for \"freedom of Biafrans\" and criticised corruption in the government of Nigeria. Radio Biafra catalyzed Kanu\u2019s rise to the public scene, as he was previously an unknown figure.<ref name=\":0\" /> Kanu was arrested by Nigerian security forces on 19 October 2015, on charges of \"sedition, ethnic incitement and treasonable felony.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=IBEANU, ORJI, IWUAMADI|first=OKECHUKWU, NKWACHUKWU, CHIJIOKE|date=2016|title=Biafra Separatism: Causes, Consequences and Remedies|url=|journal=Institute for Innovations in Development|volume=|pages=1\u201371|via=Research Gate}}</ref>\n\n== Links with other groups ==\nThere have been many other pro-Biafran groups that have come into existence. The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra ([[Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra|MASSOB]]) began gaining attention in the early 2000s, along with the Biafra Zionist Movement (BZM) which rose to the spotlight in 2012. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) emerged in 2012 as well after these other groups<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bybee|first=Ashley|date=November 9, 2017|title=The Indigenous People of Biafra: Another Stab at Biafran Independence|url=https://www.ida.org/idamedia/Corporate/Files/Publications/AfricaWatch/africawatch-November-9-2017-vol17.pdf|journal=Institute for Defense Analyses|volume=17|pages=1\u20135|via=}}</ref>. \n\nIPOB emerged to continue the movement that had been championed by MASSOB. MASSOB was formed in 1999 by its national leader [[Ralph Uwazuruike]]. However, the organization was severely weakened due to alleged state repression and disagreement within the group about leadership. MASSOB accused \u00a0Uwazuruike of associating himself with \u201cmainstream Nigerian politics\u201d instead of furthering the cause of Biafra<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenationonlineng.net/massob-expels-uwazuruike-picks-new-leadership/|title=MASSOB expels Uwazuruike, picks new leadership|date=2015-11-30|website=The Nation Newspaper|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. These conflicts contributed to the formation of another faction named BZM. BZM leader Benjamin Igwe Onwuka and many members of the group were arrested for treason by the Nigerian government at a rally that took place on 5 November, 2012 in the region of Enugu. BZM\u2019s activities were scaled down because of arrests and trials of many lead members of the organization. Both of these pro-Biafran groups set up the rise of IPOB which would continue championing the same causes<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\n== Protest ==\nThere has been recent peaceful protest in the country regarding IPOB. The organizations leader and a prominent activist named Nnamdi Kanu has been arrested by Nigeria\u2019s Department of State Services on 19 October, 2015. In response to his arrest there has been a group of pro-Biafran protesters who have been leading marches in eastern parts of Nigeria to push for his release. His arrest has pushed IPOB supporters into gaining further traction, as their mobilization grew<ref name=\":0\" />. There have been many protesters and police clashes; on 2 December, 2015, nine protesters and two policemen were killed at a protest in Onitsha, Anambra state<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/investigationspecial-reports/204902-special-report-inside-massive-extrajudicial-killings-nigerias-south-east.html|title=SPECIAL REPORT: Inside the massive extrajudicial killings in Nigeria's South-East|last=Maya|first=Emmanuel|date=2016-06-08|website=Premium Times Nigeria|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>.

The cause in rising protests are attributed to the claimed political disenfranchisement among the Igbo people and much trauma that continues as an effect of the Nigerian civil war.\n\nIPOB supporters have cited historical events such as the 2016 election of [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]], and Britain's vote to exit the [[European Union]] as proof of international support for \u201cself-determination.<ref name=\":0\" />\u201d According to many sources, Donald Trump\u2019s victory provides hope for the IPOB group in their ability to secede from Nigeria. Trump\u2019s political interests are in line with supporting Biafra, because of oil pursuits. U.S oil company outputs in Nigeria have been cut by militants in the [[Niger Delta]] who have been continually attacking pipelines<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0Therefore, IPOB figures contend that it is within the United State\u2019s economic interest to support the Biafran secessionist movement due to agitations in the region<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/nigeria-biafra-separatists-are-celebrating-donald-trumps-election-519550|title=In Nigeria, secessionists are celebrating Donald Trump's election|last=EST|first=Conor Gaffey On 11/10/16 at 1:39 PM|date=2016-11-10|website=Newsweek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. However, as of yet Trump has made no public statement in support of Biafran self-determination.\n\nThe pro-Biafran protesters are calling for the immediate release of Nnamdi Kanu and other Biafran activists that have been jailed. Most importantly they want an independence referendum to have a date set by the government. The editor of pro-Biafran media outlet \u2018Voice of Biafra\u2019 Nnabuike Nnadede stated that the Igbo people suffer from a lack of resources and investment from the Nigerian government.

The IPOB rose to prominence after previous Biafran independence organizations got weakened. The Nigerian government has been cracking down on IPOB members who peacefully protested  due to Kanu's arrest and incarceration despite various courts rulings for his release. \n\nToday, IPOB has metamorphosed from a group to a movement of the Indigenous Biafran population who are fed up with the Nigerian depleting state.  Biafrans all over the world have identified with the movement, thereby making IPOB to be a face of Biafra restoration movement.\n\n== Background ==\nBiafra had previously existed as an Independent Republic declared by Lieutenant Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu for three years, 1967 through 1970. The federal government fought hard to preserve the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and did not like the idea of an independent state of [[Biafra]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Biafra |title= Biafra: Secessonist State, Nigeria|author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref>. The result of tensions between Biafra and the federal government resulted in the [[Nigerian Civil War|Nigerian civil war]] that went on for three years. There were an estimated one to 3.5 million deaths that were heavily civilian casualties caused by starvation and death on the side of Biafra<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfr.org/blog/whats-name-nigerian-civil-war-everything|title=What's in a Name? For the Nigerian Civil War, Everything|website=Council on Foreign Relations|language=en|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. In 1970, the Biafran forces surrendered through the armistice brokered by the defunct OAU <ref>{{Cite journal|title=Peaceful Settlement of Disputes: Unsolved Problem for the OAU (A Case Study of the Nigeria-Biafra Conflict)|journal = Africa Today|volume = 24|issue = 4|pages = 39\u201358|jstor = 4185729|last1 = Akuchu|first1 = Gemuh E.|year = 1977}}</ref>. From 1970 onwards, Nigeria remained a united nation. \n\n== Leadership ==\nThe leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra is [[Nnamdi Kanu|Nnamdi kanu]] who is a dual British and Biafran citizen. He created IPOB after he initially gained fame from his broadcasts on [[Radio Biafra]], which was established in 2009. This was a radio station from London that broadcast messages that called for \"freedom of Biafrans\" and criticised corruption in the government of Nigeria. Radio Biafra catalyzed Kanu\u2019s rise to the public scene, as he was previously an unknown figure.<ref name=\":0\" /> Kanu was arrested by Nigerian security forces on 19 October 2015, on charges of \"sedition, ethnic incitement and treasonable felony.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=IBEANU, ORJI, IWUAMADI|first=OKECHUKWU, NKWACHUKWU, CHIJIOKE|date=2016|title=Biafra Separatism: Causes, Consequences and Remedies|url=|journal=Institute for Innovations in Development|volume=|pages=1\u201371|via=Research Gate}}</ref>\n\n== Links with other groups ==\nThere have been many other pro-Biafran groups that have come into existence. The Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra ([[Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra|MASSOB]]) began gaining attention in the early 2000s, along with the Biafra Zionist Movement (BZM) which rose to the spotlight in 2012. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) emerged in 2012 as well after these other groups<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bybee|first=Ashley|date=November 9, 2017|title=The Indigenous People of Biafra: Another Stab at Biafran Independence|url=https://www.ida.org/idamedia/Corporate/Files/Publications/AfricaWatch/africawatch-November-9-2017-vol17.pdf|journal=Institute for Defense Analyses|volume=17|pages=1\u20135|via=}}</ref>. \n\nIPOB emerged to continue the movement that had been championed by MASSOB. MASSOB was formed in 1999 by its national leader [[Ralph Uwazuruike]]. However, the organization was severely weakened due to alleged state repression and disagreement within the group about leadership. MASSOB accused \u00a0Uwazuruike of associating himself with \u201cmainstream Nigerian politics\u201d instead of furthering the cause of Biafra<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thenationonlineng.net/massob-expels-uwazuruike-picks-new-leadership/|title=MASSOB expels Uwazuruike, picks new leadership|date=2015-11-30|website=The Nation Newspaper|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. These conflicts contributed to the formation of another faction named BZM. BZM leader Benjamin Igwe Onwuka and many members of the group were arrested for treason by the Nigerian government at a rally that took place on 5 November, 2012 in the region of Enugu. BZM\u2019s activities were scaled down because of arrests and trials of many lead members of the organization. Both of these pro-Biafran groups set up the rise of IPOB which would continue championing the same causes<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\n== Protest ==\nThere has been recent peaceful protest in the country regarding IPOB. The organizations leader and a prominent activist named Nnamdi Kanu has been arrested by Nigeria\u2019s Department of State Services on 19 October, 2015. In response to his arrest there has been a group of pro-Biafran protesters who have been leading marches in eastern parts of Nigeria to push for his release. His arrest has pushed IPOB supporters into gaining further traction, as their mobilization grew<ref name=\":0\" />. There have been many protesters and police clashes; on 2 December, 2015, nine protesters and two policemen were killed at a protest in Onitsha, Anambra state<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/investigationspecial-reports/204902-special-report-inside-massive-extrajudicial-killings-nigerias-south-east.html|title=SPECIAL REPORT: Inside the massive extrajudicial killings in Nigeria's South-East|last=Maya|first=Emmanuel|date=2016-06-08|website=Premium Times Nigeria|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>.

The cause in rising protests are attributed to the claimed political disenfranchisement among the Igbo people and much trauma that continues as an effect of the Nigerian civil war.\n\nIPOB supporters have cited historical events such as the 2016 election of [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]], and Britain's vote to exit the [[European Union]] as proof of international support for \u201cself-determination.<ref name=\":0\" />\u201d According to many sources, Donald Trump\u2019s victory provides hope for the IPOB group in their ability to secede from Nigeria. Trump\u2019s political interests are in line with supporting Biafra, because of oil pursuits. U.S oil company outputs in Nigeria have been cut by militants in the [[Niger Delta]] who have been continually attacking pipelines<ref name=\":0\" />. \u00a0Therefore, IPOB figures contend that it is within the United State\u2019s economic interest to support the Biafran secessionist movement due to agitations in the region<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/nigeria-biafra-separatists-are-celebrating-donald-trumps-election-519550|title=In Nigeria, secessionists are celebrating Donald Trump's election|last=EST|first=Conor Gaffey On 11/10/16 at 1:39 PM|date=2016-11-10|website=Newsweek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref>. However, as of yet Trump has made no public statement in support of Biafran self-determination.\n\nThe pro-Biafran protesters are calling for the immediate release of Nnamdi Kanu and other Biafran activists that have been jailed. Most importantly they want an independence referendum to have a date set by the government. The editor of pro-Biafran media outlet \u2018Voice of Biafra\u2019 Nnabuike Nnadede stated that the Igbo people suffer from a lack of resources and investment from the Nigerian government.

This allows the desired rail profile to be compared to the actual rail profile. GQI software makes use of laser-based hardware mounted to the front and rear of the rail grinder. The use of laser-based hardware on maintenance of way vehicles such as rail grinders allow workers and contractors take precise measurements of the rail profile before and after grinding. The GQI is rated from 0 (low priority) to 100 (high priority). Grinding Quality Software is able to record and document measurements independently and provide a GQI rating for each rail on the track for before and after each pass on the grinder. The advantage of using GQI software is the ability to produce post-grinding reports for later usage by planners to help further prioritize and monitor grinding profiles in the future. GQI reports also provide analysis on the consistency of profiling to determine if grinding operations are consistently improving or deteriorating the rail profile. The usage of GQI software also provides the ability to produce accurate assessments of rail grinder effectiveness in real-time which allows for work to be prioritized more efficiently and be executed in a timely manner.<ref>Zarembski, Palese and Euston.

A common risk factor is prolonged exposure to excessive [[whole body vibration]] and shock exposure to the vertical and horizontal axes of the [[lumbar]] spine and [[vertebra]]l endplate, which can lead to spinal injury and or long-term damage to the vertebral bone [[structure]]. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists has in the past proposed threshold limit values for whole-body vibration with certain guidelines also being based on ISO-2631 standards, but no official exposure threshold limits for maintenance of way vehicles have seen widespread publication or enforcement. The ACGIH-TLV limits worker whole-body vibration exposure to no more than 8&nbsp;hours in duration. In the European Union a new risk assessment model (VibRisk model) for structural failure of the lumbar spine in the lower back was proposed as a result of vibration risk research. The VibRisk model provides more specific risk assessments of vertebral endplate failure on individual lumbar levels taking into account driver posture. When compared the risk assessment proposed using the VibRisk Model posed a higher risk of vertebral endplate failure at different lumbar levels than ISO-2631 Part&nbsp;5 standards suggested. The main contributing factor that VibRisk incorporates that the ISO-2631 Part&nbsp;5 standards are lacking is the recognition of operator posture as an additional stress factor when exposed to vibration and multiple shocks.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Eckardt J | year = 2011 | title = Vibration and shock exposure of maintenance-of-way vehicles in the railroad industry | url = | journal = Applied Ergonomics | volume = 42 | issue = 4| pages = 555\u2013562 }}</ref>\n\n==Rail corrugation==\n{{For|the 1924 Harry Carey movie|Roaring Rails}}\nRail corrugation or '''roaring rails''' is a type of track wear that develops from track and train [[Wheelset (rail transport)|wheel set]] contact over time. Once this process has started, it will begin to grow exponentially worse as time progresses. The wear that develops due to the wheel set contact between railways takes its form in the many troughs and crests it leaves behind over time, which may or may not develop into rail corrugation, depending on the circumstances. Rails that are heavily used and put under continual and constant wear will develop rail corrugation. Rail corrugation is represented in wavelength.<ref name=\":0\" /> Typically, heavily corrugated rails experience a concave deformation on the top of the railroad track in 20&nbsp;mm to 200&nbsp;mm intervals.<ref name=\":2\" /> Significant rail corrugation can decrease the service life of tracks and make the replacement of the affected track necessary. Rail corrugation is caused by the friction between the rail and the train wheels tangentially, vertically, and axially.<ref name=\":2\" /> Wear corrugation is a result of friction on the lower rail, which comes in contact with the train wheel. Excessive corrugation can be identified by the wavelength found on the higher, or outer, rail.<ref name=\":2\" /> Rail corrugation may be limited or lessened with the use of heat treated or [[alloy]]ed rails, as opposed to the traditional carbon composite rail.<ref name=\":2\" /> The estimated tendency for wear is calculated by taking into account fluctuations in track and wheel set contact which causes the amount of wear to vary. The dynamic properties of different lines of the track can lead to varied degrees of rail corrugation through the use of high-speed wheel sets. In a study of [[high-speed rail]]road tracks, four types of tracks were studied for their tendency to develop corrugation (RHEDA 200, AFTRAV, STEDEF, and high performance [[Track ballast|ballasted track]]) and of the four considered the ballasted track was the one least prone to rail corrugation with the AFTRAV track being the second most reliable as well.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Correa N. |author2=Oyarzabal O. |author3=Vadillo E.G. |author4=Santamaria J. |author5=Gomez J. | year = 2011 | title = Rail corrugation development in high speed lines | doi = 10.1016/j.wear.2010.12.028 | journal = Wear | volume = 271 | issue = 9\u201310| pages = 2438\u20132447 }}</ref>\n\n===Causes===\nIt is generally accepted that a few distinct causes lie behind different wavelengths of railroad corrugation.<ref> Stuart Grassie, John Edwards, James Shepherd.

Heat-treated alloy steel rails with relative hardness are the most resistant, as opposed to [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] steels, due to a greater relative hardness.

He was reported to be a proficient milliner, but was known to proselytize frequently and stop work to pray and sing for co-workers who used profanity in his presence.

Corbett's eccentric behavior quickly got him into trouble. He carried a Bible with him at all times and read passages aloud from it regularly, held unauthorized prayer meetings and argued with his superior officers.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|pp=160\u2013161}}</ref> Corbett also condemned officers and superiors for what he perceived as violations of [[Religious texts|God's word]].

On April 26, the regiment surrounded Booth and one of his accomplices, [[David Herold]], in a tobacco barn on the [[Virginia]] farm of Richard Garrett.

The bullet wound prevented him from swallowing any of the liquid.

Conger thought it a bad idea. Then at least turn me on my side, the assassin pleaded. They did, but Conger saw that the move did not relieve Booth\u2019s suffering. Baker noticed it, too: \"He seemed to suffer extreme pain whenever he was moved...and would several times repeat, \u2018Kill me.\u2019\"<ref>Swanson, p. 139.</ref> At sunrise, Booth remained in agonising pain. His pulse weakening as his breathing became more laboured and irregular. In agony, unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered as he gazed at them, \"Useless ... Useless.\" These were his last words. A few minutes later, Booth began gasping for air as his throat continued to swell, then there was a shiver and a gurgle and his body shuddered, before Booth died from asphyxia - he literally choked to death. He died two hours after Corbett shot him.\n\n[[File:boston corbett.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Boston Corbett]]\n[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]] [[Everton Conger]] initially thought Booth had shot himself. After realizing Booth had been shot by someone else, Conger and Lt. Doherty asked which officer had shot Booth. Corbett stepped forward and admitted he was the shooter.<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|p=135}}</ref> When asked why he had violated orders, Corbett replied, \"[[Divine providence|Providence]] directed me\".<ref name=\"Swanson340\">{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=340}}</ref> \n\n====Court-martial====\nHe was immediately arrested and was accompanied by Lt. Doherty to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to be court-martialed. When questioned by Edwin Stanton about Booth's capture and shooting, both Doherty and Corbett agreed that Corbett had in fact disobeyed orders not to shoot. However, Corbett maintained that he believed Booth had intended to shoot his way out of the barn and that he acted in self-defense. He told Stanton, \"...Booth would have killed me if I had not shot first. I think I did right.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=227}}</ref> Corbett maintained that he didn't intend to kill Booth, but merely wanted to inflict a disabling wound, but either his aim slipped or Booth moved at the moment Corbett pulled the trigger.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=104}}</ref> Stanton paused and then stated, \"The rebel is dead. The patriot lives; he has spared the country expense, continued excitement and trouble. Discharge the patriot.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\"/> Upon leaving the War Department, Corbett was greeted by a cheering crowd. As he made his way to [[Mathew Brady]]'s studio to have his official portrait taken, the crowd followed him asking for autographs and requesting that he tell them about shooting Booth. Corbett told the crowd:\n\n{{quote|I aimed at his body. I did not want to kill him....I think he stooped to pick up something just as I fired. That may probably account for his receiving the ball in the head. [W]hen the assassin lay at my feet, a wounded man, and I saw the [[bullet]] had taken effect about an inch back of the ear, and I remembered that Mr. Lincoln was wounded about the same part of the head, I said: \"What a God we have...God avenged Abraham Lincoln.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref>}}\n\n====Contradictions====\nEyewitnesses to Booth's shooting contradicted Corbett's version of events and expressed doubts that Corbett was responsible for shooting Booth. Officers who were near Corbett at the time claimed that they never saw him fire his gun (Corbett's gun was never inspected and was eventually lost). They claimed that Corbett came forward only after Lt. Colonel Conger asked who had shot Booth. Richard Garrett, the owner of the farm on which Booth was found, and his 12-year-old son Robert also contradicted Corbett's testimony that he acted in self-defense. Both maintained that Booth had never reached for his gun.<ref>{{harvnb|Nottingham|1997|p=148}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was some criticism of Corbett's actions, he was largely considered a hero by the public and press. One newspaper editor declared that Corbett would, \"live as one of the World's great avengers.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=228}}</ref> For his part in Booth's capture, Corbett received a portion of the $100,000 reward money, amounting to $1,653.84 ({{Inflation|US|1653.84|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"goodrich291\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=291}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=358}}</ref> His annual salary as a U.S. sergeant was $204 ({{Inflation|US|204|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).

When the hatting business in Boston slowed, Corbett moved to [[Danbury, Connecticut]], to continue his work and also \"preached in the country round about.\" By 1870, he had relocated once again to [[Camden, New Jersey]], where he was known as a \"Methodist lay preacher\". Corbett's inability to hold a job was attributed to his fanatical behavior; he was routinely fired after continuing his habit of stopping work to pray for his co-workers.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19670103&id=BqpVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=J-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7151,566580|title=The Strange Fate Of Boston Corbett|last=Frazier|first=Robert B.|date=January 3, 1967|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=5|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> In an effort to earn money, Corbett capitalized on his role as \"Lincoln's Avenger\".<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\"/> He gave lectures about the shooting of Booth accompanied by illustrated [[lantern slide]]s at Sunday schools, women's groups and tent meetings. Corbett was never asked back due to his increasingly erratic behavior and incoherent speeches.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\"/>\n\nR.B. Hoover, a man who later befriended Corbett, recalled that Corbett believed \"men who were high in authority at Washington at the time of the assassination\" were hounding him. Corbett said the men were angry because he had deprived them of prosecuting and executing John Wilkes Booth themselves. He also believed the same men had gotten him fired from various jobs.<ref name=\"sparks\">{{harvnb|Sparks|Everett|Lowell|Lodge|1889|p=382}}</ref> Corbett's paranoia was furthered by [[hate mail]] he received for killing Booth. He became fearful that \"Booth's Avengers\" or organizations like the \"Secret Order\" were planning to seek revenge upon him and took to carrying a pistol with him at all times. As his paranoia increased, Corbett began brandishing his pistol at friends or strangers he deemed suspicious.<ref name=\"goodrich291\"/>\n\nWhile attending the Soldiers' Reunion of the Blue and Gray in [[Caldwell, Ohio]], in 1875, Corbett got into an argument with several men over the death of John Wilkes Booth. The men questioned if Booth had really been killed at all which enraged Corbett. He then drew his pistol on the men but was removed from the reunion before he could fire it.<ref name=\"sparks\"/> In 1878, Corbett moved to [[Concordia, Kansas]], where he acquired a plot of land through [[Homestead principle|homesteading]] upon which he constructed a [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] home. He continued working as a preacher and attended [[revival meeting]]s frequently.<ref name=\"johnson51\">{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=51}}</ref>\n\n==Presumed fate==\nDue to his fame as \"Lincoln's Avenger\", Corbett was appointed assistant doorkeeper of the [[Kansas House of Representatives]] in [[Topeka]] in January 1887. On February 15, he became convinced that \nofficers of the House were discriminating against him. He jumped to his feet, brandished a revolver and began chasing the officers out of the building. No one was hurt and Corbett was arrested. The following day, a judge declared Corbett insane and sent him to the [[Topeka State Hospital|Topeka Asylum for the Insane]]. On May 26, 1888, he escaped from the asylum on horseback.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Dale|date=September 2005|title=The Mad Hatter|journal=American Cowboy|volume=12|issue=3|page=82|issn=1079-3690|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-oCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> He then rode to [[Neodesha, Kansas]], where he briefly stayed with Richard Thatcher, a man he had met while they were [[prisoners of war]]. When Corbett left, he told Thatcher he was going to Mexico.<ref name=\"johnson51\"/>\n\nRather than going to Mexico, Corbett is believed to have settled in a cabin he built in the forests near [[Hinckley, Minnesota|Hinckley]], in [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine County]] in eastern [[Minnesota]].

A few years after Corbett was last seen in Neodesha, Kansas, a [[patent medicine]] salesman in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] filed an application using Corbett's name to receive pension benefits. After an investigation proved that the man was not Boston Corbett, he was sent to prison. In September 1905, a man arrested in [[Dallas]] also claimed to be Corbett. He too was proven to be an imposter and was sent to prison for perjury, and then to the [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|Government Hospital for the Insane]].<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Memorials===\nIn 1958, Boy Scout Troop 31, of [[Concordia, Kansas]], built a roadside monument to Corbett located on Key Road.

He was reported to be a proficient milliner, but was known to proselytize frequently and stop work to pray and sing for co-workers who used profanity in his presence. He also began working as a [[street preacher]] and would sermonize and distribute religious literature in [[North Square (Boston, Massachusetts)|North Square]].<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|pp=45\u201346}}</ref> Corbett soon earned a reputation around Boston for being a \"local eccentric\" and religious fanatic.<ref name=\"jameson128\"/><ref name=\"walker159\"/> On July&nbsp;16, 1858, Corbett was propositioned by two [[prostitution|prostitutes]] while walking home from a church meeting.

Corbett's eccentric behavior quickly got him into trouble. He carried a Bible with him at all times and read passages aloud from it regularly, held unauthorized prayer meetings and argued with his superior officers.<ref>{{harvnb|Walker|Jakes|1998|pp=160\u2013161}}</ref> Corbett also condemned officers and superiors for what he perceived as violations of [[Religious texts|God's word]].

On April 26, the regiment surrounded Booth and one of his accomplices, [[David Herold]], in a tobacco barn on the [[Virginia]] farm of Richard Garrett.

The bullet wound prevented him from swallowing any of the liquid. In a weak voice, Booth asked for water and Conger and Baker gave it to him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=104}}</ref> He asked them to roll him over and turn him facedown. Conger thought it a bad idea. Then at least turn me on my side, the assassin pleaded. They did, but Conger saw that the move did not relieve Booth\u2019s suffering. Baker noticed it, too: \"He seemed to suffer extreme pain whenever he was moved...and would several times repeat, \u2018Kill me.\u2019\"<ref>Swanson, p. 139.</ref> At sunrise, Booth remained in agonising pain. His pulse weakening as his breathing became more laboured and irregular. In agony, unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered as he gazed at them, \"Useless ... Useless.\" These were his last words. A few minutes later, Booth began gasping for air as his throat continued to swell, then there was a shiver and a gurgle and his body shuddered, before Booth died from asphyxia - he literally choked to death. He died two hours after Corbett shot him.\n\n[[File:boston corbett.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Boston Corbett]]\n[[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]] [[Everton Conger]] initially thought Booth had shot himself. After realizing Booth had been shot by someone else, Conger and Lt. Doherty asked which officer had shot Booth. Corbett stepped forward and admitted he was the shooter.<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|2013|p=135}}</ref> When asked why he had violated orders, Corbett replied, \"[[Divine providence|Providence]] directed me\".<ref name=\"Swanson340\">{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=340}}</ref> \n\n====Court-martial====\nHe was immediately arrested and was accompanied by Lt. Doherty to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] to be court martialed. When questioned by Edwin Stanton about Booth's capture and shooting, both Doherty and Corbett agreed that Corbett had in fact disobeyed orders not to shoot. However, Corbett maintained that he believed Booth had intended to shoot his way out of the barn and that he acted in self-defense. He told Stanton, \"...Booth would have killed me if I had not shot first. I think I did right.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=227}}</ref> Corbett maintained that he didn't intend to kill Booth, but merely wanted to inflict a disabling wound, but either his aim slipped or Booth moved at the moment Corbett pulled the trigger.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Martelle|first1=Scott|title=The Madman and the Assassin: The Strange Life of Boston Corbett, the Man Who Killed John Wilkes Booth|date=2015|publisher=Chicago Review Press|page=104}}</ref> Stanton paused and then stated, \"The rebel is dead. The patriot lives; he has spared the country expense, continued excitement and trouble. Discharge the patriot.\"<ref name=\"goodrich227\"/> Upon leaving the War Department, Corbett was greeted by a cheering crowd. As he made his way to [[Mathew Brady]]'s studio to have his official portrait taken, the crowd followed him asking for autographs and requesting that he tell them about shooting Booth. Corbett told the crowd:\n\n{{quote|I aimed at his body. I did not want to kill him....I think he stooped to pick up something just as I fired. That may probably account for his receiving the ball in the head. [W]hen the assassin lay at my feet, a wounded man, and I saw the [[bullet]] had taken effect about an inch back of the ear, and I remembered that Mr. Lincoln was wounded about the same part of the head, I said: \"What a God we have...God avenged Abraham Lincoln.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|pp=227\u2013228}}</ref>}}\n\n====Contradictions====\nEyewitnesses to Booth's shooting contradicted Corbett's version of events and expressed doubts that Corbett was responsible for shooting Booth. Officers who were near Corbett at the time claimed that they never saw him fire his gun (Corbett's gun was never inspected and was eventually lost). They claimed that Corbett came forward only after Lt. Colonel Conger asked who had shot Booth. Richard Garrett, the owner of the farm on which Booth was found, and his 12-year-old son Robert also contradicted Corbett's testimony that he acted in self-defense. Both maintained that Booth had never reached for his gun.<ref>{{harvnb|Nottingham|1997|p=148}}</ref>\n\nWhile there was some criticism of Corbett's actions, he was largely considered a hero by the public and press. One newspaper editor declared that Corbett would, \"live as one of the World's great avengers.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=228}}</ref> For his part in Booth's capture, Corbett received a portion of the $100,000 reward money, amounting to $1,653.84 ({{Inflation|US|1653.84|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=\"goodrich291\">{{harvnb|Goodrich|2005|p=291}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|2007|p=358}}</ref> His annual salary as a U.S. sergeant was $204 ({{Inflation|US|204|1865|r=-3|fmt=eq}}). Corbett received offers to purchase the gun he used to shoot Booth. He refused stating, \"That is not mine-it belongs to the Government, and I would not sell it for any price.\"<ref name=\"basler\">{{harvnb|Basler|1965|pp=57\u201358}}</ref>  Corbett also declined an offer for one of Booth's pistols as he did not want a reminder of shooting Booth.<ref name=\"basler\"/>\n\n==Post-war life==\nAfter his discharge from the army in August 1865, Corbett went back to work as a hatter in Boston and frequently attended the Bromfield Street Church. When the hatting business in Boston slowed, Corbett moved to [[Danbury, Connecticut]], to continue his work and also \"preached in the country round about.\" By 1870, he had relocated once again to [[Camden, New Jersey]], where he was known as a \"Methodist lay preacher\". Corbett's inability to hold a job was attributed to his fanatical behavior; he was routinely fired after continuing his habit of stopping work to pray for his co-workers.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19670103&id=BqpVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=J-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7151,566580|title=The Strange Fate Of Boston Corbett|last=Frazier|first=Robert B.|date=January 3, 1967|work=Eugene Register-Guard|page=5|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}</ref> In an effort to earn money, Corbett capitalized on his role as \"Lincoln's Avenger\".<ref name=\"Walker 1998 161\"/> He gave lectures about the shooting of Booth accompanied by illustrated [[lantern slide]]s at Sunday schools, women's groups and tent meetings. Corbett was never asked back due to his increasingly erratic behavior and incoherent speeches.<ref name=\"Frazier 5\"/>\n\nR.B. Hoover, a man who later befriended Corbett, recalled that Corbett believed \"men who were high in authority at Washington at the time of the assassination\" were hounding him. Corbett said the men were angry because he had deprived them of prosecuting and executing John Wilkes Booth themselves. He also believed the same men had gotten him fired from various jobs.<ref name=\"sparks\">{{harvnb|Sparks|Everett|Lowell|Lodge|1889|p=382}}</ref> Corbett's paranoia was furthered by [[hate mail]] he received for killing Booth. He became fearful that \"Booth's Avengers\" or organizations like the \"Secret Order\" were planning to seek revenge upon him and took to carrying a pistol with him at all times. As his paranoia increased, Corbett began brandishing his pistol at friends or strangers he deemed suspicious.<ref name=\"goodrich291\"/>\n\nWhile attending the Soldiers' Reunion of the Blue and Gray in [[Caldwell, Ohio]], in 1875, Corbett got into an argument with several men over the death of John Wilkes Booth. The men questioned if Booth had really been killed at all which enraged Corbett. He then drew his pistol on the men but was removed from the reunion before he could fire it.<ref name=\"sparks\"/> In 1878, Corbett moved to [[Concordia, Kansas]], where he acquired a plot of land through [[Homestead principle|homesteading]] upon which he constructed a [[Dugout (shelter)|dugout]] home. He continued working as a preacher and attended [[revival meeting]]s frequently.<ref name=\"johnson51\">{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|p=51}}</ref>\n\n==Presumed fate==\nDue to his fame as \"Lincoln's Avenger\", Corbett was appointed assistant doorkeeper of the [[Kansas House of Representatives]] in [[Topeka]] in January 1887. On February 15, he became convinced that \nofficers of the House were discriminating against him. He jumped to his feet, brandished a revolver and began chasing the officers out of the building. No one was hurt and Corbett was arrested. The following day, a judge declared Corbett insane and sent him to the [[Topeka State Hospital|Topeka Asylum for the Insane]]. On May 26, 1888, he escaped from the asylum on horseback.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Dale|date=September 2005|title=The Mad Hatter|journal=American Cowboy|volume=12|issue=3|page=82|issn=1079-3690|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c-oCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA82|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}</ref> He then rode to [[Neodesha, Kansas]], where he briefly stayed with Richard Thatcher, a man he had met while they were [[prisoners of war]]. When Corbett left, he told Thatcher he was going to Mexico.<ref name=\"johnson51\"/>\n\nRather than going to Mexico, Corbett is believed to have settled in a cabin he built in the forests near [[Hinckley, Minnesota|Hinckley]], in [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine County]] in eastern [[Minnesota]]. He is believed to have died in the [[Great Hinckley Fire]] on September&nbsp;1, 1894.

A few years after Corbett was last seen in Neodesha, Kansas, a [[patent medicine]] salesman in [[Enid, Oklahoma]] filed an application using Corbett's name to receive pension benefits. After an investigation proved that the man was not Boston Corbett, he was sent to prison. In September 1905, a man arrested in [[Dallas]] also claimed to be Corbett. He too was proven to be an imposter and was sent to prison for perjury, and then to the [[St. Elizabeths Hospital|Government Hospital for the Insane]].<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1914|pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Memorials===\nIn 1958, Boy Scout Troop 31, of [[Concordia, Kansas]], built a roadside monument to Corbett located on Key Road.

In later life, he was a [[House of Commons of Canada|Member of the Canadian Parliament]], [[cabinet minister]], academic, soldier and diplomat.\n\n==Early life==\nGregg was born in 1892 in Mountain Dale, [[Kings County, New Brunswick]], the son of Elizabeth Celia (Myles) and George Lord Gregg. During the early stages of [[World War I]] he enlisted in the [[Canadian Army]] with [[The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada]] in September 1914 while still studying at [[Acadia University]]. He graduated with a [[Master of Arts]] in 1916.\n\n===Victoria Cross===\nAt the age of eighteen Gregg joined the [[8th New Brunswick Hussars]] militia regiment.

Then rejoining his party, which by this time was much reduced in numbers, and in spite of a second wound, he reorganized his men and led them with the greatest determination against the enemy trenches, which he finally cleared. He personally killed or wounded 11 of the enemy and took 25 prisoners, in addition to 12 machine guns captured in the trench. Remaining with his company in spite of wounds he again on the 30th September led his men in attack until severely wounded.

The medal set which had been placed on permanent loan to the museum by his widow [[Erica Deichmann Gregg]] included the Victoria Cross, the [[Order of Canada]] in the grade of Officer and the [[Military Cross]] with one [[Medal bar|Bar]].\n\n==Later career==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\nFrom 1934 until 1939, Gregg was the [[Sergeant at Arms]] of the House of Commons. Following the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in September 1939, Gregg served overseas for two years with the [[West Nova Scotia Regiment]] and then commanded officer training centres at various military facilities in Canada and retired with the rank of [[brigadier]] in 1943.\n\nIn 1944, Gregg was appointed President of the [[University of New Brunswick]], serving in that position until 1947 when he was elected to [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] as [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] member for the [[York-Sunbury]] riding. Gregg served in the cabinets of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]]s [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and [[Louis St. Laurent]] for almost 10 years as the [[Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Canada)|Minister of Fisheries]], [[Minister of Veterans Affairs (Canada)|Minister of Veterans Affairs]], and [[Minister of Labour (Canada)|Minister of Labour]].\n\nDefeated in the [[1957 Canadian federal election|1957 election]], Gregg went on to become the [[United Nations]] representative in [[Iraq]], the [[UNICEF]] administrator in [[Indonesia]], and the Canadian High Commissioner in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[British Guiana]]. He retired in 1968. He died on 13 March 1978 and is buried at Snider Mountain Baptist Church Cemetery <ref>WikiMapia latitude/longitude 45\u00b0 50.402'N 65\u00b0 37.950'W</ref> in [[Snider Mountain]], New Brunswick.\n\n==Honours==\n* In 1951 Gregg was awarded an [[Honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from the [[University of British Columbia]].\n* Gregg was sworn into the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Privy Council for Canada]] on 2 September 1947 by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]. \n* He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Canada]] on 22 December 1967 and accepted the award in a ceremony performed on 26 April 1968.<ref>{{OCC|2012}}</ref>\n* He was awarded the [[Honorary degree]] of Doctor of Military Science from the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] on 20 May 1977.<ref>https://www.rmcc-cmrc.ca/en/royal-military-college-canada-honorary-degree-recipients</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter his death, the Milton Fowler Gregg VC Memorial Trust Fund Bursary was created in his name. It is offered annually to students entering the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] Division of Graduate Studies and Research.\n\nThe Mons Box Trophy was created by then Brigadier, The Honourable Milton F. Gregg, VC, CBE, OC, MC, ED, CD. It is awarded to the platoon commander who has exhibited the highest qualities of leadership and who is therefore, the junior officer most fit to command the men who have been placed in his charge. The Mons Box, a ceremonial cigar box, was presented to then Lieutenant Gregg by the Burgomaster of Mons, Belgium in November 1918. In addition, all members of the Canadian Corps who had reached the Mons area by Armistice Day were presented with a souvenir medallion of the City of Mons. Duplicates of this medallion are affixed to the box. Brigadier Gregg presented the Mons Box to 2 RCR on 1 June 1973. It has been presented annually since then to the winning platoon commander on the first appropriate battalion function after 1 June. The winner of the Mons Box is determined by a selection committee consisting of the Commanding Officer, the Adjutant, Company Commanders and any previous winners of the Mons Box serving in 2 RCR. These previous winners are no longer eligible to compete. All Subalterns, who have spent at least eight consecutive months of the previous year as a platoon commander, are eligible for the award. \nThe Mons Box is displayed in the silver cabinet of the Saint Andrew's Barracks Officers' Mess in [[CFB Gagetown]]. It is placed in front of the current winner during all Mess Dinners and it contains the after dinner cigars. Each winner of the Mons Box receives a souvenir trophy.\n\nThe Brigadier Milton F. Gregg, VC, Centre for the Study of War and Society was created at the [[University of New Brunswick]] in 2006 to further Canadians' knowledge about conflict, and is devoted to excellence in the study of war as a complex social phenomenon. [[Marc Milner]] is the first Director. The centre incorporates the UNB History and UNB Military and Strategic Studies Programs.\n\nHis Victoria Cross was donated to [[The Royal Canadian Regiment Museum]] in [[London, Ontario]], shortly after his death in 1978, but it was stolen from the museum on 24 December 1978 and has not yet been recovered.<ref>{{cite news|last=Staples|first=Michael|title=Hero's medal needs to be displayed here \u2013 soldier|newspaper=[[The Daily Gleaner]]|date=3 November 2012|pages=A1-A2}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/milton-fowler-gregg/ Canadian Encyclopedia \u2013 Milton Fowler]\n* [http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/military-heritage/first-world-war/personnel-records/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=430345 Milton Fowler Gregg's digitized service file]\n* [http://regimentalrogue.com/rcr_great_war/the_rcr_great_war.html The Royal Canadian Regiment and The First World War \u2013 1914\u20131919] \u2013 [http://regimentalrogue.com/rcr_great_war_officers/rcr_offr_gregg_mf.html Lieut.

The medal set which had been placed on permanent loan to the museum by his widow [[Erica Deichmann Gregg]] included the Victoria Cross, the [[Order of Canada]] in the grade of Officer and the [[Military Cross]] with one [[Medal bar|Bar]].\n\n==Later career==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\nFrom 1934 until 1939, Gregg was the [[Sergeant at Arms]] of the House of Commons. Following the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in September 1939, Gregg served overseas for two years with the [[West Nova Scotia Regiment]] and then commanded officer training centres at various military facilities in Canada and retired with the rank of [[brigadier]] in 1943.\n\nIn 1944, Gregg was appointed President of the [[University of New Brunswick]], serving in that position until 1947 when he was elected to [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] as [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] member for the [[York-Sunbury]] riding. Gregg served in the cabinets of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]]s [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and [[Louis St. Laurent]] for almost 10 years as the [[Minister of Fisheries and Oceans (Canada)|Minister of Fisheries]], [[Minister of Veterans Affairs (Canada)|Minister of Veterans Affairs]], and [[Minister of Labour (Canada)|Minister of Labour]].\n\nDefeated in the [[1957 Canadian federal election|1957 election]], Gregg went on to become the [[United Nations]] representative in [[Iraq]], the [[UNICEF]] administrator in [[Indonesia]], and the Canadian High Commissioner in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], [[British Guiana]]. He retired in 1968. He died on 13 March 1978 and is buried at Snider Mountain Baptist Church Cemetery <ref>WikiMapia latitude/longitude 45\u00b0 50.402'N 65\u00b0 37.950'W</ref> in [[Snider Mountain]], New Brunswick.\n\n==Honours==\n* In 1951 Gregg was awarded an [[Honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] degree from the [[University of British Columbia]].\n* Gregg was sworn into the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada|Privy Council for Canada]] on 2 September 1947 by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]. \n* He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of Canada]] on 22 December 1967 and accepted the award in a ceremony performed on 26 April 1968.<ref>{{OCC|2012}}</ref>\n* He was awarded the [[Honorary degree]] of Doctor of Military Science from the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] on 20 May 1977.<ref>https://www.rmcc-cmrc.ca/en/royal-military-college-canada-honorary-degree-recipients</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter his death, the Milton Fowler Gregg VC Memorial Trust Fund Bursary was created in his name. It is offered annually to students entering the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] Division of Graduate Studies and Research.\n\nThe Mons Box Trophy was created by then Brigadier, The Honourable Milton F. Gregg, VC, CBE, OC, MC, ED, CD. It is awarded to the platoon commander who has exhibited the highest qualities of leadership and who is therefore, the junior officer most fit to command the men who have been placed in his charge. The Mons Box, a ceremonial cigar box, was presented to then Lieutenant Gregg by the Burgomaster of Mons, Belgium in November 1918. In addition, all members of the Canadian Corps who had reached the Mons area by Armistice Day were presented with a souvenir medallion of the City of Mons. Duplicates of this medallion are affixed to the box. Brigadier Gregg presented the Mons Box to 2 RCR on 1 June 1973. It has been presented annually since then to the winning platoon commander on the first appropriate battalion function after 1 June. The winner of the Mons Box is determined by a selection committee consisting of the Commanding Officer, the Adjutant, Company Commanders and any previous winners of the Mons Box serving in 2 RCR. These previous winners are no longer eligible to compete. All Subalterns, who have spent at least eight consecutive months of the previous year as a platoon commander, are eligible for the award. \nThe Mons Box is displayed in the silver cabinet of the Saint Andrew's Barracks Officers' Mess in [[CFB Gagetown]]. It is placed in front of the current winner during all Mess Dinners and it contains the after dinner cigars. Each winner of the Mons Box receives a souvenir trophy.\n\nThe Brigadier Milton F. Gregg, VC, Centre for the Study of War and Society was created at the [[University of New Brunswick]] in 2006 to further Canadians' knowledge about conflict, and is devoted to excellence in the study of war as a complex social phenomenon. [[Marc Milner]] is the first Director. The centre incorporates the UNB History and UNB Military and Strategic Studies Programs.\n\nHis Victoria Cross was donated to [[The Royal Canadian Regiment Museum]] in [[London, Ontario]], shortly after his death in 1978, but it was stolen from the museum on 24 December 1978 and has not yet been recovered.<ref>{{cite news|last=Staples|first=Michael|title=Hero's medal needs to be displayed here \u2013 soldier|newspaper=[[The Daily Gleaner]]|date=3 November 2012|pages=A1-A2}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/milton-fowler-gregg/ Canadian Encyclopedia \u2013 Milton Fowler]\n* [http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/military-heritage/first-world-war/personnel-records/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=430345 Milton Fowler Gregg's digitized service file]\n* [http://regimentalrogue.com/rcr_great_war/the_rcr_great_war.html The Royal Canadian Regiment and The First World War \u2013 1914\u20131919] \u2013 [http://regimentalrogue.com/rcr_great_war_officers/rcr_offr_gregg_mf.html Lieut.

[[Ireland]] was particularly badly affected. A cure was later discovered, and 75% of those infected who could be captured have been treated and cured of the virus. The remaining 25% have proven resistant to the cure. The two groups are known as the Cured and the Infected. The Infected are held in captivity, despite public fears that keeping them alive could lead to another outbreak.\n\nSenan and Conor are Cured patients who have been interned together. Their 'Rehabilitation Officer', Sergeant Cantor, has little faith that the Cured can integrate back into society without further violence, and treats them with hostility. Senan reunites with his sister-in-law, Abbie, who has a young son, Cillian. Abbie asks Senan what became of her husband, Luke, Senan's brother, who is still missing. Senan claims ignorance of his fate, though it is revealed in one of Senan's many flashbacks that Conor infected Senan, who then killed Luke, in the flat that Abbie still lives in. The Cured have a detailed memory of what they have done while infected; many of them suffer from [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Conor, formerly a lawyer with political aspirations, cannot find work and is shunned by his family for his acts while infected. He forms an underground movement called the Cured Alliance, with the aim of regaining the civil liberties that the Cured have lost.\n\nThe government is planning to [[Euthanasia|euthanise]] the 25% (5000 patients) who are infected, despite the assertions of a prominent virologist that a better vaccine for the Infected is nearly developed. Senan takes a job at the hospital where the Infected are housed, and observes that they show no interest in attacking the Cured. This is a source of political tension in the community, as the never-infected suspect aloud that the Cured would love to see another outbreak of the Maze Virus, as they would be largely immune to its effects.\n\nConor attempts to recruit Senan into the Cured Alliance. Senan initially refuses, but after experiencing the hostility of society towards the Cured, he takes part in an arson mission for the group. Conor claims that the targets are uninhabited houses, but a soldier is killed and Cantor suspects Senan and Conor. Cantor approaches Abbie at her flat and tells her that the infected are linked in some telepathic manner, and that they form into packs like predatory animals. He suggests that the predatory traits are not eliminated by the vaccine, and that the Cured are still dangerous. He shows Abbie a photograph of Conor and Senan roaming together when they were infected. Conor appeared to be leading Senan in murderous acts in the photo. Conor later approaches Abbie, and tacitly admits that he and Senan killed her husband while they were infected during the early days of the outbreak.\n\nAbbie confronts Senan and throws him out. Senan realises that Conor has no remorse for what he has done in the past, and what he is still doing. Senan assists Cantor in a [[sting operation]] to arrest Conor after he confesses aloud to the arson; however, Conor violently murders Cantor and flees. The Cured Alliance initiate a plan to free the Infected from their confinement. The Infected take to the streets, killing and infecting new victims and causing mass chaos. [[Irish Army]] troops are deployed. Senan finds Abbie, who is frantically trying to retrieve Cillian from his school. Senan rescues Cillian but is confronted by Conor, who beats him savagely. A soldier shoots Conor but he escapes. Senan, Abbie and Cillian return to their flat, but Cillian is bitten and infected. Senan, knowing he is immune, takes Cillian, and tells Abbie he will keep him safe until another vaccine is available.\n\nSome time later, a news broadcast announces that order has been restored, although 8,000 new infected people are now in captivity. During the announcement, promotional posters of Conor (as the voice of the Cured Alliance) can be seen. It is publicised that some infected are now in hiding, as the government is again discussing euthanasia for the resistant 25%. Senan goes into hiding with the infected Cillian.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ellen Page]] as Abbie\n* [[Sam Keeley]] as Senan Browne\n* [[Tom Vaughan-Lawlor]] as Conor\n* [[Stuart Graham (actor)|Stuart Graham]] as Cantor\n* [[Paula Malcomson]] as Dr. Lyons\n\n==Response==\n===Box office===\n''The Cured'' grossed $26,630 in the United States and Canada and $297,146 in other territories for a worldwide total of $323,776,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> plus $48,200 with home video sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Cured-The-(Ireland)#tab=summary |title=''The Cured'' (2018) - Financial Information |publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]], Nash Information Services, LLC |accessdate=3 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 63 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 6.36/10.

This administration had the custom of having the covers of its accounting books decorated. In this contest there are mentions of Dietisalvi di Speme in 1261, 1262, 1276, 1278, 1282-1283 and 1284. Overall he seems to have painted some 56 such covers between 1259 and 1288. Of all these, only four have survived, and these are in fact his only documented works. The authorities seem to have employed only Dietisalvi in the years 1259-1272 and after this they instituted a system of calling also upon other painters (including [[Duccio]]), though Dietisalvi seems to have received the lion's share of the commissions.\n\nIn 1262 he painted a now lost [[gonfalon]], a civic processional [[heraldic flag]] or [[banner]], for the ''Terzo di San Martino'', one of the three main territorial divisions of the city of [[Siena]] in the Middle Ages. In 1281 (or, according to another document, in 1291), he executed an inscription for Palazzo Pubblico, the civic headquarters, and in 1285 and in August 1291 he decorated two chests or trunks, also now lost.\n\nIn 1285 and in 1291 it is recorded that he was resident first in the ''contrada'' of Sant'Egidio de' Malavolti, in the ''Terzo di Camollia'' area of the city and then in the ''contrada'' of San Donato. These various documents consistently give only his first name, Dietisalvi, and the quasi-surname ''di Speme'' appears only on a single occasion, in a record of 18 January 1290 (which according to Sienese usage was styled 1289).\n\n==Works==\nThe four items of the financial administration whose decoration is attributed to Dietisalvi, that of 1267 shows only the heraldic devices of the ''Quattro Provveditori'', that is the four chief civic finance officers   ( Archivio di Stato di Siena (Siena State Archives), inv. 3; that of July\u2013December 1264 is concerned with Ildebrandino Pagliaresi (Archivio di Stato di Siena, inv. 2); that of January\u2013June 1270 with Ranieri Pagliaresi  (Archivio di Stato di Siena, inv.  4); and finally that of July\u2013December 1282 is concerned with Don Griffolino ([[Budapest]]\u2019s [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]],   inv. 2-36). These four works show a development of style over the two decades, in the direction of a greater similarity with the work of [[Giunta Pisano]] and [[Cimabue]], and with the freer strokes and paler effects of his more diligent contemporary [[Guido da Siena]], with whom he in fact had sometimes worked.\n\nIn 1991 [[Luciano Bellosi]] claimed considerable importance for Dietisalvi, as an artist, attributing to him a number of important works painted on wood, that had at different times been assigned variously either to him or to [[Guido of Siena]]. Such works included the ''Madonna di San Bernardino'', dated 1262, the ''Madonna col Bambino'' of the Museo statale d\u2019arte medievale e moderna (State Museum of Medieval and Modern Art) of [[Arezzo]], the ''Galli-Dunn Madonna'' and the ''Madonna del Voto'', executed for an altar in [[Siena Cathedral]]. These works display a gradual distancing from the influence of [[Coppo di Marcovaldo]], and a movement towards more substantial depiction of bodies and a greater attention to colour.\n\nIn addition,  Dietisalvi is credited with the outer doors on the reliquary of Blessed [[Andrea Gallerani]] (in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale (Siena)|Pinacoteca Nazionale (National Gallery)]] of [[Siena]],  inv. 5).
