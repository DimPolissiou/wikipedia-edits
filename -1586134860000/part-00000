Towards the front of each issue are [[editorial]]s, news and feature articles on issues of general interest to scientists, including current affairs, science funding, business, scientific ethics and research breakthroughs. There are also sections on books, arts, and short science fiction stories. The remainder of the journal consists mostly of research papers (articles or letters), which are often dense and highly technical. Because of strict limits on the length of papers, often the printed text is actually a summary of the work in question with many details relegated to accompanying ''supplementary material'' on the journal's website.\n\nThere are many fields of [[research]] in which important new advances and original research are published as either articles or letters in ''Nature.'' The papers that have been published in this journal are internationally acclaimed for maintaining high research standards.

In addition, during this period, the number of popular science periodicals doubled from the 1850s to the 1860s.<ref name=\"Bar3\">{{harvnb|Barton|1996|p=3}}</ref> According to the editors of these popular science magazines, the publications were designed to serve as \"organs of science\", in essence, a means of connecting the public to the scientific world.<ref name=\"Bar3\"/>\n\n''Nature'', first created in 1869, was not the first magazine of its kind in Britain. One journal to precede ''Nature'' was ''Recreative Science: A Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation'', which, created in 1859, began as a [[natural history]] magazine and progressed to include more physical observational science and technical subjects and less natural history.<ref name=\"Bar7\">{{harvnb|Barton|1996|p=7}}</ref> The journal's name changed from its original title to ''Intellectual Observer: A Review of Natural History, Microscopic Research, and Recreative Science'' and then later to the ''Student and Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art''.<ref name=\"Bar6\">{{harvnb|Barton|1996|p=6}}</ref> While ''Recreative Science'' had attempted to include more physical sciences such as [[astronomy]] and [[archaeology]], the ''Intellectual Observer'' broadened itself further to include literature and art as well.<ref name=\"Bar6\"/> Similar to ''Recreative Science'' was the scientific journal ''Popular Science Review'', created in 1862,<ref name=\"Bar13\">{{harvnb|Barton|1996|p=13}}</ref> which covered different fields of science by creating subsections titled \"Scientific Summary\" or \"Quarterly Retrospect\", with book reviews and commentary on the latest scientific works and publications.<ref name=\"Bar13\"/> Two other journals produced in England prior to the development of ''Nature'' were the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' and ''[[Scientific Opinion]]'', established in 1864 and 1868, respectively.<ref name=\"Bar6\"/> The journal most closely related to ''Nature'' in its editorship and format was ''[[The Reader (weekly)|The Reader]]'', created in 1863; the publication mixed science with literature and art in an attempt to reach an audience outside of the scientific community, similar to ''Popular Science Review''.<ref name=\"Bar6\"/>\n\nThese similar journals all ultimately failed. The ''Popular Science Review'' survived longest, lasting 20 years and ending its publication in 1881; ''Recreative Science'' ceased publication as the ''Student and Intellectual Observer'' in 1871. The ''Quarterly Journal'', after undergoing a number of editorial changes, ceased publication in 1885.

[[John Maddox]], editor of ''Nature'' from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995, suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal's centennial edition that perhaps it was the journalistic qualities of Nature that drew readers in; \"journalism\" Maddox states, \"is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other.

In 1971, under [[John Maddox]]'s editorship, the journal split into ''Nature Physical Sciences'' (published on Mondays), ''Nature New Biology'' (published on Wednesdays) and ''Nature'' (published on Fridays).

In particular, empirical papers are often highly cited, which can lead to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these [[positive feedback]] effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like ''Nature'' and its closest competitor, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', can be very fierce. ''Nature''{{'}}s [[impact factor]], a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by [[Institute for Scientific Information|Thomson ISI]]), among the highest of any science journal.\n\nAs with most other professional scientific journals, papers undergo an initial screening by the editor, followed by [[peer review]] (in which other scientists, chosen by the editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review, will read and critique articles), before publication. In the case of ''Nature'', they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground-breaking in that particular field. As a consequence, the majority of submitted papers are rejected without review.\n\nAccording to ''Nature''{{'}}s original [[mission statement]]:\n{{quote|It is intended, FIRST, to place before the general public the grand results of Scientific Work and Scientific Discovery; and to urge the claims of Science to a more general recognition in Education and in Daily Life; and, SECONDLY, to aid Scientific men themselves, by giving early information of all advances made in any branch of Natural knowledge throughout the world, and by affording them an opportunity of discussing the various Scientific questions which arise from time to time.<ref name=nature1869>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/mission.html |title=Nature's mission statement |accessdate=11 September 2008 |work= nature.com|date=11 November 1869 }}</ref>}}\n\nThis was revised in 2000 to:\n{{quote|First, to serve scientists through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of science, and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning science.

The article commented on the placement and maintenance of statues honouring scientists with known unethical, abusive and torturous histories. Specifically, the editorial called on examples of [[J. Marion Sims]], the 'Father of gynecology' who experimented on African American female slaves who were unable to give informed consent, and [[Thomas Parran Jr.]] who oversaw the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].  The editorial as written made the case that removing such statues, and erasing names, runs the risk of \"whitewashing history\", and stated \"Instead of removing painful reminders, perhaps these should be supplemented\". The article caused a large outcry and was quickly modified by Nature.<ref>{{cite web |title=Science must acknowledge its past mistakes and crimes |date=4 September 2017 |url=https://www.nature.com/news/science-must-acknowledge-its-past-mistakes-and-crimes-1.22557?sf111543858=1&WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews |website=nature.com}}</ref> The article was largely seen as offensive, inappropriate, and by many, racist.

In particular, empirical papers are often highly cited, which can lead to promotions, grant funding, and attention from the mainstream media. Because of these [[positive feedback]] effects, competition among scientists to publish in high-level journals like ''Nature'' and its closest competitor, ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', can be very fierce. ''Nature''{{'}}s [[impact factor]], a measure of how many citations a journal generates in other works, was 38.138 in 2015 (as measured by [[Institute for Scientific Information|Thomson ISI]]), among the highest of any science journal.\n\nAs with most other professional scientific journals, papers undergo an initial screening by the editor, followed by [[peer review]] (in which other scientists, chosen by the editor for expertise with the subject matter but who have no connection to the research under review, will read and critique articles), before publication. In the case of ''Nature'', they are only sent for review if it is decided that they deal with a topical subject and are sufficiently ground-breaking in that particular field. As a consequence, the majority of submitted papers are rejected without review.\n\nAccording to ''Nature''{{'}}s original [[mission statement]]:\n{{quote|It is intended, FIRST, to place before the general public the grand results of Scientific Work and Scientific Discovery; and to urge the claims of Science to a more general recognition in Education and in Daily Life; and, SECONDLY, to aid Scientific men themselves, by giving early information of all advances made in any branch of Natural knowledge throughout the world, and by affording them an opportunity of discussing the various Scientific questions which arise from time to time.<ref name=nature1869>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/npg_/company_info/mission.html |title=Nature's mission statement |accessdate=11 September 2008 |work= nature.com|date=11 November 1869 }}</ref>}}\n\nThis was revised in 2000 to:\n{{quote|First, to serve scientists through prompt publication of significant advances in any branch of science, and to provide a forum for the reporting and discussion of news and issues concerning science. Second, to ensure that the results of science are rapidly disseminated to the public throughout the world, in a fashion that conveys their significance for knowledge, culture and daily life.<ref name=nature2000>{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/about/index.html |title=Nature's mission statement |website=nature.com}}</ref>}}\n\n===Landmark papers===\nMany of the most significant scientific breakthroughs in modern history have been first published in ''Nature''.

''Nature'' has offices in London, New York City, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., [[Boston]], Tokyo, Hong Kong, Paris, [[Munich]], and [[Basingstoke]]. Nature Research also publishes other specialized journals including ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', ''[[Nature Biotechnology]],'' ''[[Nature Methods]]'', the ''[[Nature Clinical Practice]]'' series of journals, ''[[Nature Structural & Molecular Biology]]'', ''[[Nature Chemistry]]'', and the ''Nature Reviews'' series of journals.\n\nSince 2005, each issue of ''Nature'' has been accompanied by a ''[[Nature Podcast]]''<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.nature.com/nature/podcast/archive.html | work = Nature |title = Archive: Nature Podcast |accessdate = 1 May 2014 }}</ref> featuring highlights from the issue and interviews with the articles' authors and the journalists covering the research. It is presented by Kerri Smith, and features interviews with scientists on the latest research, as well as news reports from Nature's editors and journalists. The Nature Podcast was founded \u2013 and the first 100 episodes were produced and presented \u2013 by clinician and virologist [[Chris Smith, The Naked Scientist|Chris Smith]] of Cambridge and ''[[The Naked Scientists]]''.\n\nIn 2007, Nature Publishing Group began publishing ''Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics'', the official journal of the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics and ''Molecular Therapy'', the American Society of Gene Therapy's official journal, as well as the ''International Society for Microbial Ecology (ISME) Journal''.

Responding to his call, Sister Nivedita (at that time Margaret Elizabeth Noble) came to India in January 1898. The main reason why Swamiji invited her was to spread education to the women of the country. When Nivedita informed Vivekananda about her planning he felt very excited. He organised a meeting at Balaram Bose's house on this issue.\n\nMany lay devotees of Sri Ramakrishna, including Mastermashay (Sri M., the chronicler of ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]''), Suresh Dutta, Haramohan etc. attended this meeting. Nivedita explained her plan and requested everyone to send their girls to the school. During her speech Vivekananda entered the room and took seat behind everyone. Nivedita did not notice it. But, when Nivedita appealed to collect girls for the school, she suddenly discovered Vivekananda in the room pushing others and prompting \"Ye, get up, get up! It\u2019s not good enough to just become girls\u2019 fathers. All of you must cooperate in the matter of their education as per national ideals. Stand up and commit. Reply to her appeal. Say, 'We all agree. We shall send our girls to you.'\" But no one stood up to support Nivedita's proposal.\n\nVivekananda forced Haramohan to agree to the proposal and behalf of Haramohan Vivekananda promised to send her girls to the school.<ref name=\"Nivedita of India.\">{{cite book|title=Nivedita of India.|url=http://estudantedavedanta.net/Nivedita_of_India__-Ramakrishan_Mission_Institute_of_Culture.pdf|year=2002|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|location=Kolkata|isbn=81-87332-20-4|edition=1st}}</ref>{{rp|21\u201322}}\n\nOn 13 November 1898, on the day of ''[[Kali]] Puja'', at 16 Bosepara Lane in the Bagbazar area of Calcutta, she started the school.<ref name=\"Restoration bid for Sister Nivedita's house faces hurdle\">{{cite news|title=Restoration bid for Sister Nivedita's house faces hurdle|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-24/kolkata/29809572_1_elderly-couple-heritage-building-house|accessdate=9 October 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=24 July 2011}}</ref> The school was inaugurated by Sarada Devi, in the presence of Swami Vivekananda and some of the other disciples of Ramakrishna.<ref name=\"The School's Ideals\">{{cite web|title=The School's Ideals|url=http://sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory_inside.html|publisher=RKSM Sister Nivedita Girls School|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> Sarada Devi blessed and prayed for the school saying \"I pray that the blessings of the Divine Mother may be upon the school and the girls; and the girls trained from the school may become ideal girls.\"<ref name=\"Nivedita of India.\" />{{rp|22}}\n\n=== 1917\u2013present ===\nIn 1902, it became a regular school.

Responding to his call, Sister Nivedita (at that time Margaret Elizabeth Noble) came to India in January 1898. The main reason why Swamiji invited her was to spread education to the women of the country. When Nivedita informed Vivekananda about her planning he felt very excited. He organised a meeting at Balaram Bose's house on this issue.\n\nMany lay devotees of Sri Ramakrishna, including Mastermashay (Sri M., the chronicler of ''[[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna]]''), Suresh Dutta, Haramohan etc. attended this meeting. Nivedita explained her plan and requested everyone to send their girls to the school. During her speech Vivekananda entered the room and took seat behind everyone. Nivedita did not notice it. But, when Nivedita appealed to collect girls for the school, she suddenly discovered Vivekananda in the room pushing others and prompting \"Ye, get up, get up! It\u2019s not good enough to just become girls\u2019 fathers. All of you must cooperate in the matter of their education as per national ideals. Stand up and commit. Reply to her appeal. Say, 'We all agree. We shall send our girls to you.'\" But no one stood up to support Nivedita's proposal.\n\nVivekananda forced Haramohan to agree to the proposal and behalf of Haramohan Vivekananda promised to send her girls to the school.<ref name=\"Nivedita of India.\">{{cite book|title=Nivedita of India.|url=http://estudantedavedanta.net/Nivedita_of_India__-Ramakrishan_Mission_Institute_of_Culture.pdf|year=2002|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|location=Kolkata|isbn=81-87332-20-4|edition=1st}}</ref>{{rp|21\u201322}}\n\nOn 13 November 1898, on the day of ''[[Kali]] Puja'', at 16 Bosepara Lane in the Bagbazar area of Calcutta, she started the school.<ref name=\"Restoration bid for Sister Nivedita's house faces hurdle\">{{cite news|title=Restoration bid for Sister Nivedita's house faces hurdle|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-24/kolkata/29809572_1_elderly-couple-heritage-building-house|accessdate=9 October 2012|newspaper=Times of India|date=24 July 2011}}</ref> The school was inaugurated by Sarada Devi, in the presence of Swami Vivekananda and some of the other disciples of Ramakrishna.<ref name=\"The School's Ideals\">{{cite web|title=The School's Ideals|url=http://sisterniveditagirlsschool.org/grandhistory_inside.html|publisher=RKSM Sister Nivedita Girls School|accessdate=9 October 2012}}</ref> Sarada Devi blessed and prayed for the school saying \"I pray that the blessings of the Divine Mother may be upon the school and the girls; and the girls trained from the school may become ideal girls.\"<ref name=\"Nivedita of India.\" />{{rp|22}}\n\n=== 1917\u2013present ===\nIn 1902, it became a regular school. In 1903, Sister Christine, an American disciple of Swami Vivekananda joined Sister Nivedita in the work. After the death of Sister Nivedita in October 1911 the school faced many difficulties. In 1914 Sister Sudhira took entire responsibility of the school. Since then it has been governed, maintained and nurtured by a group of self-sacrificing women.<ref name=\"The School's Ideals\" />\n\nSince 1918, the school was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Mission.

He managed operations at [[Madison Square Garden (1925)|Old Madison Square Garden]], introduced fans to innovative on-ice promotions which made amateur hockey a profitable event.

Since the EAHL schedule had 48 games with 24 home games each, and because the Gardens had just 16 Sunday afternoons available for games, he scheduled some of his home games at the visiting team's arena.<ref name=\"Miller-p1\" /><ref name=\"p38\" /> For the 21 games scheduled between the New York teams, Lockhart made up phony game scores and submitted them to newspapers in lieu of games that were never actually played, and the games were never questioned by the league.<ref name=\"Miller-p1\" /><ref name=\"p38\" /><ref name=\"Miller-p2\">''Miller, Chuck'' Part 1, page 2</ref><ref name=\"Floyd\">''Conner, Floyd (2002)''</ref> To cover up the [[Deception|ruse]], Lockhart printed a clause in the 1933 game program which read, \"extra games will be played at the assigned practice hours at the Garden and will not be open to the public\".<ref name=\"Miller-p1\" />\n\nLockhart's daughter Madeline later served as the league's secretary while her father was president.<ref name=\"Miller-p5\">''Miller, Chuck'' Part 2, page 5</ref> He defended criticism of the league's amateur status, by saying that its players earned a primary income outside of hockey, despite receiving money for basic living expenses and recreation.<ref name=\"HHOF\" /> He also instituted three separate trophies for competition in the EAHL. The [[Walker Cup (ice hockey)|Walker Cup]] was awarded to the regular season champions of the EAHL.<ref name=\"Miller-p2\" /> Lockhart purchased it for $500 from a [[pawnbroker]], after it had been previously donated to another hockey competition by Mayor [[Jimmy Walker]] in 1926.<ref name=\"Miller-p2\" /><ref name=\"p35\" /> He later repurchased the same Cup from a pawnbroker for $80, and relayed the story to Dan Parker for coverage in ''[[The Fairfield Mirror]]''.<ref name=\"p35\" /><ref name=\"p36\">''Fischler, Stan (2013)'' p. 36</ref> He lobbied the AAU to reactivate the [[Atlantic City Boardwalk Trophy]], and awarded it to the playoffs champions of the EAHL.<ref name=\"Miller-p2\" /> He also recovered the Hamilton B. Wills Trophy from a pawnbroker, and awarded it for winning a challenge series between teams in Canada and the United States.<ref name=\"Miller-p2\" /> \n\nIn the late 1940s, Lockhart made an interlocking schedule between the EAHL and the [[Quebec Senior Hockey League]], which allowed New York fans to see the [[Black players in ice hockey|all-black line]] of [[Herb Carnegie]] and his brothers play with the Sherbrooke team.<ref name=\"p46\" /> As the league president, Lockhart suspended a player for life in 1952, after Joe Desson assaulted referee Mickey Slowik on the ice.<ref

Airing a [[News radio|News]]/[[Talk radio|Talk]] [[radio format]], WBAL broadcasts on a [[list of broadcast station classes|Class A]] [[clear-channel station|clear-channel frequency]], with 50,000 [[watt]]s from a [[transmitter]] facility in [[Randallstown, Maryland]].  Listeners in and around Baltimore can also hear the station on [[FM radio|FM]] [[broadcast relay station|translator station]] '''W268BA''' at 101.5 [[hertz|MHz]].\n\nThe station shares its studios and offices with [[sister station]]s [[WBAL-TV]] (channel 11) and [[WIYY (FM)|WIYY]] (97.9 FM) on Television Hill in Baltimore's [[Woodberry, Baltimore|Woodberry]] neighborhood. WBAL and WIYY are the only two radio stations owned by Hearst, which is primarily a publishing and television company, also co-owned with the television station; they are also part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|triopoly]].\n\nWBAL is [[omnidirectional antenna|non-directional]] by day but uses a [[directional antenna]] at night to protect the other Class A stations on [[1090 AM]], [[KAAY]] in [[Little Rock]] and [[XEPRS-AM|XEPRS]] in [[Rosarito Beach|Rosarito]], [[Mexico]]. With a good radio, WBAL's nighttime signal can be heard in much of Eastern North America, reaching as far as [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Bermuda]]. Its daytime signal easily covers most of [[Maryland]] as well as the [[Washington metropolitan area]], and parts of [[Delaware]], [[Virginia]] and [[Pennsylvania]].\n\n==Programming==\nOn weekdays, WBAL airs 9 hours of all-news blocks, some of them [[simulcast]] from co-owned WBAL-TV. During middays, two local talk shows are heard, [[Clarence M. Mitchell, IV]] (known as \"C4\") and Brent Hollander.  Evenings often feature sports programming.  And overnights, the [[Radio syndication|nationally syndicated]] [[Lars Larson]] Show is heard.\n\nWeekends include local shows and syndicated programs, including [[Dana Loesch]], [[Brian Kilmeade]], ''[[Meet The Press]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]] from ABC'' and [[Bill Cunningham (talk show host)|Bill Cunningham]].  Some weekend hours are paid [[brokered programming]].  WBAL carries national news from [[ABC News Radio|ABC News]].\n\n===Sports===\nWBAL is the co-[[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] station with WIYY for [[Baltimore Ravens]] [[NFL|football]] and [[United States Naval Academy]] [[college football]].\n\nSince the [[Baltimore Orioles]] began their inaugural season in 1954, WBAL was their flagship station for most of that team's history, though not continuously.  For example, it carried Orioles games every season from 1987 to 2006, after which the team's games were broadcast on crosstown rival [[WJZ-FM]].  Orioles games returned to WBAL from 2011 to 2014 before the team switched back to WJZ-FM in 2015.  Ravens games have been broadcast on WBAL and WIYY since the 2006 season.\n\nOther teams whose games have been broadcast on WBAL include the [[Baltimore Colts]], the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland Terrapins]] and the [[Towson University|Towson Tigers]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Wbaltv.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The WBAL Building, on Television Hill in Baltimore, has housed WBAL Radio since 1962.]]\nWBAL began broadcasting after being dedicated on November 2, 1925, as a subsidiary of the Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company, a predecessor of [[Constellation (An Exelon Company)|Constellation Energy]].<ref name=\"Consolidated\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Thomson|title=Consolidated of Baltimore 1816\u20131950: A History of Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company of Baltimore|publisher=Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Co.|year=1950|location=Baltimore|pages=246, 274|url= |id= |isbn= }}</ref> WBAL's initial broadcasting studio was located at the utility's offices on Lexington Street.  It was an [[network affiliate|affiliate]] of the [[NBC]] [[Blue Network]].<ref name=\"Consolidated\"/> On January 12, 1935, with radio becoming more commercialized, there was little justification for a [[public service company]] to own a radio station.  WBAL was sold to the Hearst-controlled American Radio News Corporation, which operated it along with two daily newspapers, ''The Baltimore News-Post'' and ''The Baltimore American'' (later merged as the ''[[Baltimore News-American]]'').<ref name=\"Consolidated\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s, WBAL became the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] for the international broadcast of [[Televangelism|radio evangelist]] [[G. E. Lowman]], whose shows originated in Baltimore until 1959.<ref>O'Connor, Thomas H. ''Baltimore Broadcasting from A to Z'' (1985), p. 23.</ref> During the 1960s, WBAL had a [[Full service (radio format)|full service]] [[Middle of the road (music)|Middle Of The Road]] music format stressing personality and news.  The station played a mix of [[adult standards|standards]] with some softer songs from the [[Top 40]].\n[[File:WBAL (AM) former logo.png|thumb|200px|Former logo of the radio station]]\nBy the early 1970s, the station had a full-service [[adult contemporary music]] format with the exception of weekday evenings, where the station aired talk programming.<ref name=Zurawick>{{cite news|last=Zurawick|first=David|title=WBAL radio manager is leaving|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-07-24/features/0907230093_1_wbal-radio-beauchamp-leaving-the-station|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=July 24, 2009|page=3}}</ref> \n\nAmong its personalities during that period were program host Jay Grayson, Harley Brinsfield, who had a long-running Saturday night [[jazz]] music program, ''The Harley Show'', and [[White House]]-accredited newsman Galen Fromme. In the early 1980s, WBAL began running talk shows evenings and overnights, and continued to play some music during the day. Music gradually decreased and in the fall of 1985, with WBAL transitioning to its current news-talk format, winning 19&nbsp;national [[RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award|Edward R. Murrow Award]]s since then, the most of any local U.S. radio station.<ref name=Zurawick />  Since the mid-1990s, the station has become increasingly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], both in its on-air personalities and its editorial disposition.\n\nIn 2010, WBAL switched its morning and afternoon [[drive time]] shows to an all-news format, titled ''Maryland's Morning News'' and ''Afternoon News Journal'' respectively. (The shows has since been renamed to ''Maryland's News Now'' and later to \"WBAL News Now.\") The all-news blocks include national newscasts from [[ABC News Radio|ABC News]] every 30 minutes.  Previously, the national feed had been provided by [[CBS Radio News|CBS]] at the top of each hour until 2014.

Airing a [[News radio|News]]/[[Talk radio|Talk]] [[radio format]], WBAL broadcasts on a [[list of broadcast station classes|Class A]] [[clear-channel station|clear-channel frequency]], with 50,000 [[watt]]s from a [[transmitter]] facility in [[Randallstown, Maryland]].  Listeners in and around Baltimore can also hear the station on [[FM radio|FM]] [[broadcast relay station|translator station]] '''W268BA''' at 101.5 [[hertz|MHz]].\n\nThe station shares its studios and offices with [[sister station]]s [[WBAL-TV]] (channel 11) and [[WIYY (FM)|WIYY]] (97.9 FM) on Television Hill in Baltimore's [[Woodberry, Baltimore|Woodberry]] neighborhood. WBAL and WIYY are the only two radio stations owned by Hearst, which is primarily a publishing and television company, also co-owned with the television station; they are also part of a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|triopoly]].\n\nWBAL is [[omnidirectional antenna|non-directional]] by day but uses a [[directional antenna]] at night to protect the other Class A stations on [[1090 AM]], [[KAAY]] in [[Little Rock]] and [[XEPRS-AM|XEPRS]] in [[Rosarito Beach|Rosarito]], [[Mexico]]. With a good radio, WBAL's nighttime signal can be heard in much of Eastern North America, reaching as far as [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Bermuda]]. Its daytime signal easily covers most of [[Maryland]] as well as the [[Washington metropolitan area]], and parts of [[Delaware]], [[Virginia]] and [[Pennsylvania]].\n\n==Programming==\nOn weekdays, WBAL airs 9 hours of all-news blocks, some of them [[simulcast]] from co-owned WBAL-TV. During middays, two local talk shows are heard, [[Clarence M. Mitchell, IV]] (known as \"C4\") and Brent Hollander.  Evenings often feature sports programming.  And overnights, the [[Radio syndication|nationally syndicated]] [[Lars Larson]] Show is heard.\n\nWeekends include local shows and syndicated programs, including [[Dana Loesch]], [[Brian Kilmeade]], ''[[Meet The Press]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]] from ABC'' and [[Bill Cunningham (talk show host)|Bill Cunningham]].  Some weekend hours are paid [[brokered programming]].  WBAL carries national news from [[ABC News Radio|ABC News]].\n\n===Sports===\nWBAL is the co-[[Flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] station with WIYY for [[Baltimore Ravens]] [[NFL|football]] and [[United States Naval Academy]] [[college football]].\n\nSince the [[Baltimore Orioles]] began their inaugural season in 1954, WBAL was their flagship station for most of that team's history, though not continuously.  For example, it carried Orioles games every season from 1987 to 2006, after which the team's games were broadcast on crosstown rival [[WJZ-FM]].  Orioles games returned to WBAL from 2011 to 2014 before the team switched back to WJZ-FM in 2015.  Ravens games have been broadcast on WBAL and WIYY since the 2006 season.\n\nOther teams whose games have been broadcast on WBAL include the [[Baltimore Colts]], the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland Terrapins]] and the [[Towson University|Towson Tigers]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Wbaltv.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The WBAL Building, on Television Hill in Baltimore, has housed WBAL Radio since 1962.]]\nWBAL began broadcasting after being dedicated on November 2, 1925, as a subsidiary of the Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company, a predecessor of [[Constellation (An Exelon Company)|Constellation Energy]].<ref name=\"Consolidated\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Thomson|title=Consolidated of Baltimore 1816\u20131950: A History of Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Company of Baltimore|publisher=Consolidated Gas Electric Light and Power Co.|year=1950|location=Baltimore|pages=246, 274|url= |id= |isbn= }}</ref> WBAL's initial broadcasting studio was located at the utility's offices on Lexington Street.  It was an [[network affiliate|affiliate]] of the [[NBC]] [[Blue Network]].<ref name=\"Consolidated\"/> On January 12, 1935, with radio becoming more commercialized, there was little justification for a [[public service company]] to own a radio station.  WBAL was sold to the Hearst-controlled American Radio News Corporation, which operated it along with two daily newspapers, ''The Baltimore News-Post'' and ''The Baltimore American'' (later merged as the ''[[Baltimore News-American]]'').<ref name=\"Consolidated\"/>\n\nIn the 1930s, WBAL became the [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] for the international broadcast of [[Televangelism|radio evangelist]] [[G. E. Lowman]], whose shows originated in Baltimore until 1959.<ref>O'Connor, Thomas H. ''Baltimore Broadcasting from A to Z'' (1985), p. 23.</ref> During the 1960s, WBAL had a [[Full service (radio format)|full service]] [[Middle of the road (music)|Middle Of The Road]] music format stressing personality and news.  The station played a mix of [[adult standards|standards]] with some softer songs from the [[Top 40]].\n[[File:WBAL (AM) former logo.png|thumb|200px|Former logo of the radio station]]\nBy the early 1970s, the station had a full-service [[adult contemporary music]] format with the exception of weekday evenings, where the station aired talk programming.<ref name=Zurawick>{{cite news|last=Zurawick|first=David|title=WBAL radio manager is leaving|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-07-24/features/0907230093_1_wbal-radio-beauchamp-leaving-the-station|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=July 24, 2009|page=3}}</ref> \n\nAmong its personalities during that period were program host Jay Grayson, Harley Brinsfield, who had a long-running Saturday night [[jazz]] music program, ''The Harley Show'', and [[White House]]-accredited newsman Galen Fromme. In the early 1980s, WBAL began running talk shows evenings and overnights, and continued to play some music during the day. Music gradually decreased and in the fall of 1985, with WBAL transitioning to its current news-talk format, winning 19&nbsp;national [[RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award|Edward R. Murrow Award]]s since then, the most of any local U.S. radio station.<ref name=Zurawick />  Since the mid-1990s, the station has become increasingly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]], both in its on-air personalities and its editorial disposition.\n\nIn 2010, WBAL switched its morning and afternoon [[drive time]] shows to an all-news format, titled ''Maryland's Morning News'' and ''Afternoon News Journal'' respectively. (The shows has since been renamed to ''Maryland's News Now'' and later to \"WBAL News Now.\") The all-news blocks include national newscasts from [[ABC News Radio|ABC News]] every 30 minutes.  Previously, the national feed had been provided by [[CBS Radio News|CBS]] at the top of each hour until 2014.  Also in 2014, the station was re-branded as ''WBAL News Radio 1090'', to better reflect its status as Maryland's radio news leader.\n\nIn addition to its analog 1090&nbsp;kHz signal, WBAL is repeated on WIYY-HD2,<ref>{{cite news|title=WIYY Drops HD Only Music Channels|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/132908/wiyy-drops-hd-only-music-channels|work=AllAccess.com|publisher=All Access Music Group, Inc.|date=August 29, 2014}}</ref> a [[digital subchannel]] of WIYY's [[HD Radio]] signal.\n[[File:WBAL (AM) logo.png|thumb|left|150px|WBAL Previous Logo]]\n\n==Translators==\nW268BA simulcasts WBAL via 97.9 FM [[WIYY]]'s HD-2 subchannel.\n\n{{RadioTranslators\n| callsign = WBAL (AM)\n| width    =\n\n| call1    = W268BA \n| freq1    = 101.5\n| city1    = Baltimore, Maryland\n| fid1     = 154255\n| watts1   = 250\n| haat1    = 182\n| class1   = D\n| coord1   = {{Coord|39|20|5|N|76|39|3|W|type:landmark_region:US-MD_source:FCC|name=W268BA}}\n| notes1   = \n}}\n\n==Anchors, reporters & hosts==\n[[File:Robert lang.JPG|thumb|right|WBAL reporter Robert Lang at a Governor O'Malley press conference in 2009]]\n* Bill Vanko\n* Bryan Nehman (morning anchor) \n* Steve Fermier\n* Brett Hollander (afternoon host)\n* Dan Joseph (evening host)\n* Yuripzi Morgan (afternoon host)\n* Anne Kramer \n* Robert Lang (anchor & public affairs host)\n* [[Clarence M.

Eventually the city of Tarsus was established just north of G\u00f6zl\u00fckule. But G\u00f6zl\u00fckule was still active as the port of [[Cilicia]]. In 41 BC [[Cleopatra VII]] and [[Mark Antony]] entered Tarsus using the port of G\u00f6zl\u00fckule.''\n\nIn later years, the coastline moved to south because of the sediment carried by the [[Berdan River]] and G\u00f6zl\u00fckule lost its importance as a port.\n\n==Archaeology==\nBefore the official excavations began, the tumulus had been partially damaged. During the [[Franco-Turkish War|French]] occupation of Tarsus following [[World War I]], a French battalion had been deployed on G\u00f6zl\u00fckule. It is believed that this operation resulted in some depredation.\n\nThe initial excavations between 1934 and 1939 were carried out by a team from [[Bryn Mawr College]] and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] led by [[Hetty Goldman]].<ref>Hetty Goldman, Excavations at Gozlu Kule, Tarsus.

Volume II:\nFrom the Neolithic through the Bronze Age, [[Princeton University Press]], 1956</ref>\nIt was located at the intersection of the main road systems, one following the [[Mediterranean]] sea side, the other following valleys through [[Toros Mountains]] to [[Anatolia]]n plateau (so called [[Cilician Gates]]). Eventually the city of Tarsus was established just north of G\u00f6zl\u00fckule. But G\u00f6zl\u00fckule was still active as the port of [[Cilicia]]. In 41 BC [[Cleopatra VII]] and [[Mark Antony]] entered Tarsus using the port of G\u00f6zl\u00fckule.''\n\nIn later years, the coastline moved to south because of the sediment carried by the [[Berdan River]] and G\u00f6zl\u00fckule lost its importance as a port.\n\n==Archaeology==\nBefore the official excavations began, the tumulus had been partially damaged. During the [[Franco-Turkish War|French]] occupation of Tarsus following [[World War I]], a French battalion had been deployed on G\u00f6zl\u00fckule. It is believed that this operation resulted in some depredation.\n\nThe initial excavations between 1934 and 1939 were carried out by a team from [[Bryn Mawr College]] and the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] led by [[Hetty Goldman]].<ref>Hetty Goldman, Excavations at Gozlu Kule, Tarsus.
