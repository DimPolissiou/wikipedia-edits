It forms the large majority of the '''N1 [[national primary road]]''' connecting [[Dublin]] towards [[Belfast]] along the east of the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. The route heads north via [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]], [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] to the [[Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border|Northern Irish border]] just south of [[Newry]] in [[County Armagh]], where it joins the [[A1 road (Northern Ireland)|A1 road]] and further on, the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1 motorway]] in Northern Ireland. It also forms a significant part of the road connection between Dublin and the Northern Irish cities of [[Newry]], and [[Lisburn]].\nThe route is part of [[International E-road network|European route]] [[European route E01|E01]].\n\n==Route==\n[[File:The M1 Boyne Bridge, near Drogheda, Co. Louth - geograph.org.uk - 1414270.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mary McAleese Boyne Valley Bridge]] carries the [[Drogheda]] bypass across the [[river Boyne]].]]\n\nAlmost the entire length of the N1 has been upgraded to motorway standard and is designated the M1 motorway. It runs from the Junction 3 of the M50 [[ring road]] in Dublin, past [[Cloghran, Coolock|Cloghran]], [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]], [[Balbriggan]], [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] before ending at Ballymascanlon north of Dundalk. It by-passes many towns through which the N1 travelled.<ref>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0053.html S.I.

No. 54/2012 \u2014 Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2012</ref> At Ballymascanlon, it becomes the N1 dual carriageway and continues to the border with [[Northern Ireland]]. The motorway section of the N1 uses the M1 designation. Small yellow route markers along the motorway route also read N1.\n\nThe motorway was built in several stages as short disconnected bypasses, replacing the original N1 route. The first section opened (in 1983) was from Whitehall to Coolock Lane followed (in 1985) by the ''Airport Motorway'' between Whitehall and [[Dublin Airport]], only the third section of motorway opened in Ireland. 1980s style [[road signs in the Republic of Ireland|direction signs]] were still intact on this route up until 2006. Part of this original M1 is now a spur to Dublin Airport, while another part between Whitehall to the [[Dublin Port Tunnel|Port Tunnel]] portals is now narrowed to two+one lanes (although still grade separated) as a result of the Dublin Port Tunnel work.\n\nThere are toll fees for use of the motorway between junctions 7 and 10, the section which forms the [[Drogheda]] bypass.  Work began in 2004 on a bypass of Dundalk, and was completed three months ahead of schedule in 2005, extending the motorway to just south of the border.\n\nConstruction finished in 2007 on a cross-border stretch of [[grade-separated]] dual-carriageway linking the northern end of the M1 with the A1 near Newry in County Armagh. This was opened to traffic on 2 August 2007. Its length is 14&nbsp;km, 4.6&nbsp;km north of the border and 9.4&nbsp;km south of the border. This allows traffic to flow freely from [[Dublin Port]] on motorway/dual-carriageway standard road to the Hillsborough Roundabout, located south of Lisburn.\n\n==Junctions==\n[[Image:M1County

(Northern Ireland)}}\n\nThe upgrade of the N1 is now complete in the Republic of Ireland, the first major route to be completely upgraded to motorway/dual carriageway standard (outside of Dublin city centre) as per the [[National Development Plan]]. The [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] authorities have no plans to replace the A1 route (currently dual carriageway) with motorway, although many junctions have now been grade separated. Currently, to drive from Dublin city centre to [[Belfast]], one travels along the M1 (Republic of Ireland), N1, A1 and M1 (Northern Ireland).\n\n==Motorway service areas==\nThe first official on-line [[Motorway service area]] in Ireland opened on the M1 on 8 September 2010, located near [[Lusk services|Lusk]]. A second near Castlebellingham (M1 North service area) opened on 29 September 2010. Each location has northbound and southbound facilities, with no connection across the motorway between each side. Open 24 hours a day, they provide fuel and food and are of a design similar to those found in other European countries. The service areas are run by a consortium of companies known as Superstop.\n\n==ITS on the M1==\nAs with other sections of Irish motorways which feature [[Variable-message sign]]s, the M1 is also connected to an [[Intelligent transportation system]] providing real-time journey time information for motorists. The system works by recognising vehicle number plates at intervals along the motorway, and uses this information to calculate average vehicle speeds and hence travel times. Northbound, VMSs near Malahide and Balbriggan provide information on the journey times to the Drogheda (J7) and Dundalk (J16) exits. Similar signs southbound provide information on the travel time to Dublin airport and the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]].\n\n==Roadside art on the M1==\nRoadside art is funded under the Percentage For Arts Scheme where 1% of the scheme budget is allocated to roadside art with a cap of \u20ac63,000. The local authorities decide on a theme and are responsible for commissioning the work, usually by open competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/English-text5.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604142819/http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/English-text5.htm |archivedate=4 June 2009 }}</ref> There are several examples along the M1\n* '''The Beehives'''.

(Northern Ireland)}}\n\nThe upgrade of the N1 is now complete in the Republic of Ireland, the first major route to be completely upgraded to motorway/dual carriageway standard (outside of Dublin city centre) as per the [[National Development Plan]]. The [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] authorities have no plans to replace the A1 route (currently dual carriageway) with motorway, although many junctions have now been grade separated. Currently, to drive from Dublin city centre to [[Belfast]], one travels along the M1 (Republic of Ireland), N1, A1 and M1 (Northern Ireland).\n\n==Motorway service areas==\nThe first official on-line [[Motorway service area]] in Ireland opened on the M1 on 8 September 2010, located near [[Lusk services|Lusk]]. A second near Castlebellingham (M1 North service area) opened on 29 September 2010. Each location has northbound and southbound facilities, with no connection across the motorway between each side. Open 24 hours a day, they provide fuel and food and are of a design similar to those found in other European countries. The service areas are run by a consortium of companies known as Superstop.\n\n==ITS on the M1==\nAs with other sections of Irish motorways which feature [[Variable-message sign]]s, the M1 is also connected to an [[Intelligent transportation system]] providing real-time journey time information for motorists. The system works by recognising vehicle number plates at intervals along the motorway, and uses this information to calculate average vehicle speeds and hence travel times. Northbound, VMSs near Malahide and Balbriggan provide information on the journey times to the Drogheda (J7) and Dundalk (J16) exits. Similar signs southbound provide information on the travel time to Dublin airport and the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]].\n\n==Roadside art on the M1==\nRoadside art is funded under the Percentage For Arts Scheme where 1% of the scheme budget is allocated to roadside art with a cap of \u20ac63,000. The local authorities decide on a theme and are responsible for commissioning the work, usually by open competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/English-text5.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604142819/http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/English-text5.htm |archivedate=4 June 2009 }}</ref> There are several examples along the M1\n* '''The Beehives'''.

In 1858, another synagogue was erected on the site of today's synagogue in the former village of Szenttam\u00e1s.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAbout thirty years later, architect [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] and [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]], was commissioned to design a new synagogue. This was Baumhorn's first solo work. The synagogue was designed in the style of Late-romantic period, originally single-story with a gallery for the women of the congregation. It was inaugurated in 1888 by [[Ign\u00e1c Weisz]], rabbi of [[Immanuel L\u00f6w|Imm\u00e1nuel L\u0151w]] and [[Szeged]].<ref>{{https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/esztergom|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\nUntil World War II, it was frequented by the Jews of Esztergom and the surrounding villages. During World War II, the synagogue was bombed and got badly damaged. Most of the Jews \u2014 about five hundred \u2014 were deported, and have not had a significant community in the city ever since. Since then, only the name Imah\u00e1z utca remains of the original part of the building. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe empty building was awarded in 1964 to the organization of ATNSA (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in the city. This was when the first major renovations began. Space was partitioned with reinforced concrete slabs, breaking down the women's gallery. From 1980 to 1981, it housed the Tech House, which until 2006 served as a conference center.\n\nOver the next few years, the organization has continually renovated and completely restructured to be able to hold conferences and lectures. It has created lecture rooms, interpreting booths, rooms suitable for receptions, and district heating has been introduced. In 1996, the roof and dome shells were renovated.\n\nAccordingly, several prestigious events took place between the walls of the former Jewish temple. Politicians often gave lectures here on their tours.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In 2006, the municipality bought the Technika House for 70 million HUF. After that, the office of the Ister-Granum Euroregion operated there for a short time, until in 2008 it moved to the building of the County Hall of Botty\u00e1n J\u00e1nos Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN883IN883&q=county+hall+of+botty%C3%A1n+street&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjij9Lm4t7oAhUr8XMBHRfBD0oQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=1366&bih=657|title=county hall of botty\u00e1n street - Google Search|website=www.google.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nRecently, controversy has surrounded the Synagogue.

The original 2.5-meter bronze work was made for the monument competition in Mauthausen and was placed in the Hungarian barracks of the Auschwitz camp museum. Today's statue was erected in 1985.

In 1858, another synagogue was erected on the site of today's synagogue in the former village of Szenttam\u00e1s.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAbout thirty years later, architect [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] and [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]], was commissioned to design a new synagogue. This was Baumhorn's first solo work. The synagogue was designed in the style of Late-romantic period, originally single-story with a gallery for the women of the congregation. It was inaugurated in 1888 by [[Ign\u00e1c Weisz]], rabbi of [[Immanuel L\u00f6w|Imm\u00e1nuel L\u0151w]] and [[Szeged]].<ref>{{https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/esztergom|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\nUntil World War II, it was frequented by the Jews of Esztergom and the surrounding villages. During World War II, the synagogue was bombed and got badly damaged. Most of the Jews \u2014 about five hundred \u2014 were deported, and have not had a significant community in the city ever since. Since then, only the name Imah\u00e1z utca remains of the original part of the building. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe empty building was awarded in 1964 to the organization of ATNSA (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in the city. This was when the first major renovations began. Space was partitioned with reinforced concrete slabs, breaking down the women's gallery. From 1980 to 1981, it housed the Tech House, which until 2006 served as a conference center.\n\nOver the next few years, the organization has continually renovated and completely restructured to be able to hold conferences and lectures. It has created lecture rooms, interpreting booths, rooms suitable for receptions, and district heating has been introduced. In 1996, the roof and dome shells were renovated.\n\nAccordingly, several prestigious events took place between the walls of the former Jewish temple. Politicians often gave lectures here on their tours.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In 2006, the municipality bought the Technika House for 70 million HUF. After that, the office of the Ister-Granum Euroregion operated there for a short time, until in 2008 it moved to the building of the County Hall of Botty\u00e1n J\u00e1nos Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN883IN883&q=county+hall+of+botty%C3%A1n+street&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjij9Lm4t7oAhUr8XMBHRfBD0oQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=1366&bih=657|title=county hall of botty\u00e1n street - Google Search|website=www.google.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nRecently, controversy has surrounded the Synagogue.

These are connected by a triple-arched, arcade foyer. The original 1888 marble staircase leads to a conference room upstairs with interpreting booths.\n\nThe Martyr Monument in front of the building was made according to the plans of Istv\u00e1n Martsa. The original 2.5-meter bronze work was made for the monument competition in Mauthausen and was placed in the Hungarian barracks of the Auschwitz camp museum. Today's statue was erected in 1985. Its pedestal is a bonfire made of railway sleepers.

They were accomplished at the service of King [[Eurystheus]]. The episodes were later connected by a continuous narrative. The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an [[epic poem]], now lost, written by [[Peisander]], dated about 600 BC.<ref>According to [[Walter Burkert]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> After Heracles killed his wife and children, he went to the oracle at Delphi. He prayed to the god Apollo for guidance. Heracles was told to serve the king of Mycenae, Eurystheus, for ten years. During this time, he is sent to perform a series of difficult feats, called labours.<ref>Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA253 p. 253].</ref>\n\n==Backstory==\n[[File:P. Oxy. XXII 2331.jpg|thumb|The [[Heracles Papyrus]], a fragment of a 3rd-century Greek manuscript of a poem about the Labours of Heracles ([[Oxyrhynchus Papyrus]] 2331)]]\nDriven mad by [[Hera]]  (queen of the gods), Heracles slew his sons by his wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, p. 186.</ref> After recovering his sanity, Heracles deeply regretted his actions; he was purified by King [[Thespius]], then traveled to [[Delphi]] to inquire how he could atone for his actions. [[Pythia]], the Oracle of Delphi, advised him to go to [[Tiryns]] and serve his cousin, King [[Eurystheus]], for ten years, performing whatever labors Eurystheus might set him; in return, he would be rewarded with immortality. Heracles despaired at this, loathing to serve a man whom he knew to be far inferior to himself, yet fearing to oppose his father [[Zeus]]. Eventually, he placed himself at Eurystheus's disposal.\n\nEurystheus originally ordered Heracles to perform ten labours. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus refused to recognize two: the slaying of the [[Lernaean Hydra]], as Heracles' nephew and charioteer [[Iolaus]] had helped him; and the cleansing of the [[Augean stables|Augeas]], because Heracles accepted payment for the labour. Eurystheus set two more tasks (fetching the Golden Apples of [[Hesperides]] and capturing [[Cerberus]]), which Heracles also performed, bringing the total number of tasks to twelve.\n\n==Labours==\n[[File:Map_of_Heracles's_Early_Labors.jpg|thumb|Heracles's first six labours were located in the [[Peloponnese]].]]\n\nAs they survive, the labours of Heracles are not recounted in any single place, but must be reassembled from many sources. Ruck and Staples<ref name=\"ruck\">{{cite book | last = Ruck | first = Carl | author2=Danny Staples | year = 1994 | pages = 169 | title = The World of Classical Myth | location = Durham, North Carolina| publisher = Carolina Academic Press}}</ref> assert that there is no one way to interpret the labours, but that six were located in the [[Peloponnese]], culminating with the rededication of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Six others took the hero farther afield, to places that were, per Ruck, \"all previously strongholds of Hera or the 'Goddess' and were Entrances to the Netherworld\".<ref name=\"ruck\"/> In each case, the pattern was the same: Heracles was sent to kill or subdue, or to fetch back for Eurystheus (as Hera's representative) a magical animal or plant.\n\nA famous depiction of the labours in Greek sculpture is found on the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, which date to the 450s BC.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n<!-- \nthere are no \"fixed\" number of metopes: in the Archaic period, it may actually have been the labours' display on the twelve available metopes on temples which led to their being counted as twelve in number.\n-->\n\nIn his labours, Heracles was sometimes accompanied by a male companion (an ''[[eromenos]]''), according to [[Licymnius]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and others, such as [[Iolaus]], his nephew. Although he was supposed to perform only ten labours, this assistance led to two labours being disqualified: Eurystheus refused to recognize slaying the Hydra, because Iolaus helped him, and the cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was paid for his services and/or because the rivers did the work. Several of the labours involved the offspring (by various accounts) of [[Typhon]] and his mate [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], all overcome by Heracles.\n\nA traditional order of the labours found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1\u20132.5.12.</ref> by Pseudo-Apollodorus is:\n# Slay the [[Nemean lion]].\n# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].\n# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]].\n# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].\n# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.\n# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds]].\n# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].\n# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].\n# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]].\n# Obtain the cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]].\n# Steal three of the golden apples of the [[Hesperides]].\n# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].\n\n===First: Nemean lion===\n{{Main|Nemean lion}}\n[[File:Hercules with head of Nemean Lion.jpg|thumb|Hercules with the head of the Nemean lion]]\n\nHeracles wandered the area until he came to the town of [[Cleonae (Argolis)|Cleonae]]. There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to [[Zeus]], but if he did not return within 30 days or if he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus. Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.\n\nWhile searching for the lion, Heracles fletched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable. When he found and shot the lion, firing at it with his bow, he discovered the fur's protective property as the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature's thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club and, using his immense strength, strangled it to death. During the fight the lion bit off one of his fingers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Ther/LeonNemeios.html|title=NEMEAN LION (Leon Nemeios) - Labour of Heracles in Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref> Others say that he shot arrows at it, eventually shooting it in the unarmored mouth. After slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion's own claws to skin the pelt. Others say that Heracles' armor was, in fact, the hide of the lion of [[Cithaeron]].\n\nWhen he returned on the 30th day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; from then on he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus would then tell Heracles his tasks through a herald, not personally. Eurystheus even had a large bronze jar made for him in which to hide from Heracles if need be. Eurystheus then warned him that the tasks would become increasingly difficult.\n\n===Second: Lernaean Hydra===\n{{Main|poop\n}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra.webp|thumb|left|Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra]]\nHeracles' second labour was to slay the [[Lernaean Hydra]], which [[Hera]] had raised just to slay Heracles. Upon reaching the swamp near [[Lerna|Lake Lerna]], where the Hydra dwelt, Heracles used a cloth to cover his mouth and nose to protect himself from the poisonous fumes. He fired flaming arrows into the Hydra's lair, the spring of [[Amymone]], a deep cave that it only came out of to terrorize neighboring villages.<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (angelo) 1959:144.</ref> He then confronted the Hydra, wielding a harvesting [[sickle]] (according to some early vase-paintings), a sword or his famed club. Ruck and Staples (1994: 170) have pointed out that the [[chthonic]] creature's reaction was botanical: upon cutting off each of its heads he found that two grew back, an expression of the hopelessness of such a struggle for any but the [[hero]]. Additionally, one of the Hydra's heads - the middle one - was immortal.\n\nThe details of the struggle are explicit in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.5.2): realizing that he could not defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew [[Iolaus]] for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by [[Athena]]) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. He cut off the Hydra's one immortal head with a golden sword given to him by Athena. Heracles placed it under a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius (Kerenyi 1959:144), and dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood, and so his second task was complete. The alternative version of this myth is that after cutting off one head, he then dipped his sword in it and used its venom to burn each head so it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the [[Hydra (constellation)|constellation Hydra]]. She then turned the crab into the [[Cancer (constellation)|constellation Cancer]].\n\nLater, Heracles used an arrow dipped in the Hydra's poisonous blood to kill the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]; and Nessus's tainted blood was applied to the [[Tunic of Nessus]], by which the centaur had his posthumous revenge. Both [[Strabo]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] report that the stench of the river Anigrus in [[Elis]], making all the fish of the river inedible, was reputed to be due to the Hydra's venom, washed from the arrows Heracles used on the centaur.<ref>Strabo, viii.3.19, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], v.5.9; Grimal 1987:219.</ref>\n\n===Third: Ceryneian Hind===\n{{Main|Ceryneian Hind}}\n\n[[File:Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind.webp|thumb|Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind]]\nEurystheus and Hera were greatly angered that Heracles had survived the Nemean Lion and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]. For the third labour, they found a task which they thought would spell doom for the hero. It was not slaying a beast or monster, as it had already been established that Heracles could overcome even the most fearsome opponents. Instead, Eurystheus ordered him to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], which was so fast that it could outrun an arrow.\n\nAfter beginning the search, Heracles awoke from sleeping and saw the hind by the glint on its [[antlers]]. Heracles then chased the hind on foot for a full year through [[Greece]], [[Thrace]], [[Istria]], and the land of the [[Hyperboreans]]. In some versions, he captured the hind while it slept, rendering it lame with a trap net. In other versions, he encountered [[Artemis]] in her temple; she told him to leave the hind and tell Eurystheus all that had happened, and his third labor would be considered to be completed. Yet another version claims that Heracles trapped the Hind with an arrow between its forelegs.\n\nEurystheus had given Heracles this task hoping to incite Artemis' anger at Heracles for his desecration of her sacred animal. As he was returning with the hind, Heracles encountered Artemis and her brother [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. He begged the goddess for forgiveness, explaining that he had to catch it as part of his penance, but he promised to return it. Artemis forgave him, foiling Eurystheus' plan to have her punish him.\n\nUpon bringing the hind to Eurystheus, he was told that it was to become part of the King's [[menagerie]]. Heracles knew that he had to return the hind as he had promised, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. The King came out, but the moment that Heracles let the hind go, it sprinted back to its mistress and Heracles left, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.\n\n===Fourth: Erymanthian Boar===\n{{Main|Erymanthian Boar}}\n[[File:Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar.jpg|thumb|left|Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar]]\nEurystheus was disappointed that Heracles had overcome yet another creature and was humiliated by the hind's escape, so he assigned Heracles another dangerous task. By some accounts, the fourth labour was to bring the fearsome [[Erymanthian Boar]] back to Eurystheus alive (there is no single definitive telling of the labours). On the way to Mount Erymanthos where the boar lived, Heracles visited [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]] (\"caveman\"), a kind and hospitable [[centaur]] and old friend. Heracles ate with Pholus in his cavern (though the centaur devoured his meat raw) and asked for wine. Pholus had only one jar of wine, a gift from [[Dionysus]] to all the centaurs on Mount Erymanthos. Heracles convinced him to open it, and the smell attracted the other centaurs. They did not understand that wine needs to be tempered with water, became drunk, and attacked Heracles. Heracles shot at them with his poisonous arrows, killing many, and the centaurs retreated all the way to [[Chiron]]'s cave.\n\nPholus was curious why the arrows caused so much death. He picked one up but dropped it, and the arrow stabbed his hoof, poisoning him. One version states that a stray arrow hit Chiron as well. He was immortal, but he still felt the pain. Chiron's pain was so great that he volunteered to give up his immortality and take the place of [[Prometheus]], who had been chained to the top of a mountain to have his liver eaten daily by an [[eagle]]. Prometheus' torturer, the eagle, continued its torture on Chiron, so Heracles shot it dead with an arrow. It is generally accepted that the tale was meant to show Heracles as being the recipient of Chiron's surrendered immortality. However, this tale contradicts the fact that Chiron later taught [[Achilles]]. The tale of the centaurs sometimes appears in other parts of the twelve labours, as does the freeing of Prometheus.\n\nHeracles had visited Chiron to gain advice on how to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this labour in mid-winter. Heracles caught the boar, bound it, and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage ''[[pithos]]'', begging Heracles to get rid of the beast.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Fifth: Augean stables===\n{{Main|Augeas}}\n\n[[File:Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the rive.jpg|thumb|Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the river]]\nThe fifth labour was to clean the stables of King [[Augeas]]. This assignment was intended to be both humiliating (rather than impressive, as the previous labours had been) and impossible, since the livestock were divinely healthy (and immortal) and therefore produced an enormous quantity of dung. The Augean Stables ({{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|\u0259|n}}) had not been cleaned in over 30 years, and over 1,000 cattle lived there. However, Heracles succeeded by re-routing the rivers [[Alfeios River|Alpheus]] and [[Pineios River (Peloponnese)|Peneus]] to wash out the filth.\n\nBefore starting on the task, Heracles had asked Augeas for one-tenth of the cattle if he finished the task in one day, and Augeas agreed. But afterwards Augeas refused to honour the agreement on the grounds that Heracles had been ordered to carry out the task by Eurystheus anyway. Heracles claimed his reward in court, and was supported by Augeas' son [[Phyleus]]. Augeas banished them both before the court had ruled. Heracles returned, slew Augeas, and gave his kingdom to Phyleus. Heracles then founded the Olympic Games.\nThe success of this labour was ultimately discounted as the rushing waters had done the work of cleaning the stables and because Heracles was paid for doing the labour. \nEurystheus said that Heracles still had seven labours to perform.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|title=Maps of Mount Olympus|access-date=2019-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921212448/http://www.olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|archive-date=2018-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Sixth: Stymphalian birds===\n{{Main|Stymphalian birds}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and the Stymphalian Birds.png|thumb|left|Hercules and the Stymphalian birds]]\n\nThe sixth labour was to defeat the [[Stymphalian birds]], man-eating birds with beaks made of [[bronze]] and sharp metallic feathers they could launch at their victims. They were sacred to [[Ares]], the god of war. Furthermore, their dung was highly toxic. They had migrated to [[Lake Stymphalia]] in [[Arcadia]], where they bred quickly and took over the countryside, destroying local crops, fruit trees, and townspeople. Heracles could not go too far into the swamp, for it would not support his weight. [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, gave Heracles a rattle which [[Hephaestus]] had made especially for the occasion. Heracles shook the rattle and frightened the birds into the air. Heracles then shot many of them with his arrows. The rest flew far away, never to return. The [[Argonauts]] would later encounter them.\n\n===Seventh: Cretan Bull===\n{{Main|Cretan Bull}} \n[[File:Herculean effort.jpg|thumb|upright|Heracles forces the Cretan Bull to the ground ([[engraving]] by B. Picart, 1731)]]\n\nThe seventh labour was to capture the [[Cretan Bull]], father of the [[Minotaur]]. Heracles sailed to [[Crete]], where King [[Minos]] gave Heracles permission to take the bull away and even offered him assistance (which Heracles declined, plausibly because he did not want the labor to be discounted as before).<ref name=\"Apollod\">''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.7</ref> The bull had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Heracles sneaked up behind the bull and then used his hands to throttle it (stopping before it was killed), and then shipped it back to Tiryns. Eurystheus, who hid in his ''[[pithos]]'' at first sight of the creature, wanted to sacrifice the bull to Hera, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered into [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.<ref name=\"Apollod\" /> [[Theseus]] would later sacrifice the bull to [[Athena]] and/or [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]].\n\n===Eighth: Mares of Diomedes===\n{{Main|Mares of Diomedes}}\n[[File:Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses, 1752.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - ''Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses'', 1752]]\nAs the eighth of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]], also categorised as the second of the Non-[[Peloponnese|Peloponneisan]] labours<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morford, Mark P.

After overpowering Diomedes\u2019 men, Heracles broke the chains that tethered the horses and drove the mares down to sea. Unaware that the mares were man-eating and uncontrollable, Heracles left them in the charge of his favored companion, [[Abderus]], while he left to fight Diomedes. Upon his return, Heracles found that the boy was eaten. As revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses and then founded [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] next to the boy's tomb<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn another version, Heracles, who was visiting the island, stayed awake so that he didn't have his throat cut by Diomedes in the night, and cut the chains binding the horses once everyone was asleep. Having scared the horses onto the high ground of a knoll, Heracles quickly dug a trench through the peninsula, filling it with water and thus flooding the low lying plain. When Diomedes and his men turned to flee, Heracles killed them with an axe (or a club<ref name=\":1\" />), and fed Diomedes\u2019 body to the horses to calm them.\n\nIn yet another version, Heracles first captured Diomedes and fed him to the mares ''before'' releasing them. Only after realizing that their King was dead did his men, the [[Bistones|Bistonians]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />, attack Heracles. Upon seeing the mares charging at them, led in a chariot by Abderus, the Bistonians turned and fled.\n\nAll versions have eating human flesh make the horses calmer, giving Heracles the opportunity to bind their mouths shut, and easily take them back to King Eurystheus, who dedicated the horses to [[Hera]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rose, H.

After the incident, Eurystheus sent Heracles to bring back [[Hippolyta|Hippolyta's Girdle]].\n\n===Ninth: Belt of Hippolyta===\n{{Main|Hippolyta}}\n[[File:The magic girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons.jpg|thumb|eft|The magic girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons]]\n[[Eurystheus]]' daughter [[Admete]] wanted the Belt of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], a gift from her father Ares. To please his daughter, Eurystheus ordered Heracles to retrieve the belt as his ninth labour.\n\nTaking a band of friends with him, Heracles set sail, stopping at the island of [[Paros]], which was inhabited by some sons of Minos. The sons killed two of Heracles' companions, an act which set Heracles on a rampage. He killed two of the sons of Minos and threatened the other inhabitants until he was offered two men to replace his fallen companions. Heracles agreed and took two of Minos' grandsons, [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] and [[Sthenelus]]. They continued their voyage and landed at the court of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], whom Heracles defended in a battle against King [[Mygdon of Bebryces]]. After killing King Mygdon, Heracles gave much of the land to his friend Lycus. Lycus called the land [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]. The crew then set off for [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]], where Hippolyta lived.\n\nAll would have gone well for Heracles had it not been for Hera. Hippolyta, impressed with Heracles and his exploits, agreed to give him the belt and would have done so had Hera not disguised herself and walked among the Amazons sowing seeds of distrust. She claimed the strangers were plotting to carry off the queen of the Amazons. Alarmed, the women set off on horseback to confront Heracles. When Heracles saw them, he thought Hippolyta had been plotting such treachery all along and had never meant to hand over the belt, so he killed her, took the belt and returned to Eurystheus.\n\n===Tenth: Cattle of Geryon===\n{{Main|Geryon}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones.webp|thumb|Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones]]\nThe tenth labour was to obtain the Cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]]. In the fullest account in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca'', 2.5.10.</ref> [[Hercules|Heracles]] had to go to the island of Erytheia in the far west (sometimes identified with the [[Hesperides]], or with the island which forms the city of [[C\u00e1diz]]) to get the cattle. On the way there, he crossed the [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]n desert<ref>''Libya'' was the generic name for [[North Africa]] to the Greeks.</ref> and became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at the [[Sun]]. The sun-god [[Helios]] \"in admiration of his courage\" gave Heracles the golden cup Helios used to sail across the sea from west to east each night. Heracles rode the cup to Erytheia; Heracles in the cup was a favorite motif on [[black-figure pottery]].{{fact|date=March 2020}} Such a magical conveyance undercuts any literal geography for Erytheia, the \"red island\" of the sunset.\n\nWhen Heracles landed at Erytheia, he was confronted by the two-headed dog [[Orthrus]]. With one blow from his olive-wood club, Heracles killed Orthrus. [[Eurytion]] the herdsman came to assist Orthrus, but Heracles dealt with him the same way.\n\nOn hearing the commotion, Geryon sprang into action, carrying three shields and three spears, and wearing three helmets. He attacked Heracles at the River Anthemus, but was slain by one of Heracles' poisoned arrows. Heracles shot so forcefully that the arrow pierced Geryon's forehead, \"and Geryon bent his neck over to one side, like a poppy that spoils its delicate shapes, shedding its petals all at once.\"<ref>[[Stesichorus]], fragment, translated by Denys Page.</ref>\n\nHeracles then had to herd the cattle back to Eurystheus. In [[Roman mythology|Roman]] versions of the narrative, Heracles drove the cattle over the [[Aventine Hill]] on the future site of [[Rome]]. The giant [[Cacus]], who lived there, stole some of the cattle as Heracles slept, making the cattle walk backwards so that they left no trail, a repetition of the trick of the young [[Hermes]]. According to some versions, Heracles drove his remaining cattle past the cave, where Cacus had hidden the stolen animals, and they began calling out to each other. In other versions, Cacus' sister [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] told Heracles where he was. Heracles then killed Cacus, and set up an altar on the spot, later the site of Rome's [[Forum Boarium]] (the cattle market).\n\nTo annoy Heracles, Hera sent a [[Gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] to bite the cattle, irritate them, and scatter them. Within a year, Heracles retrieved them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the level of a river so much that Heracles could not cross with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\n\n===Eleventh: Golden Apples of the Hesperides===\n{{Main|Hesperides}}\n[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|left|Atlas and Hercules]]\n[[File:Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides.webp|thumb|Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides]]\nAfter [[Hercules|Heracles]] completed the first ten labours, Eurystheus gave him two more, claiming that slaying the Hydra did not count (because [[Iolaus]] helped Heracles), neither did cleaning the Augean Stables (either because he was paid for the job or because the rivers did the work).\n\nThe first additional labour was to steal three of the golden apples from the garden of the [[Hesperides]]. Heracles first caught the [[Old Man of the Sea]], the shapeshifting sea god,<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959, p.172, identifies him in this context as [[Nereus]]; as a shapeshifter he is often identified as [[Proteus]].</ref> to learn where the Garden of the Hesperides was located.<ref>In some versions of the tale, Hercules was directed to ask [[Prometheus]]. As payment, he freed Prometheus from his daily torture. This tale is more usually found as part of the story of the [[Erymanthian Boar]], since it is associated with [[Chiron]] choosing to forgo immortality and taking Prometheus' place.</ref>\n\nIn some variations, Heracles, either at the start or at the end of this task, meets [[Antaeus]], who was invincible as long as he touched his mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by holding him aloft and crushing him in a bear hug.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus ii. 5; [[Hyginus]], ''Fab.'' 31</ref>\n\n[[Herodotus]] claims that Heracles stopped in [[Egypt]], where King [[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]] decided to make him the yearly sacrifice, but Heracles burst out of his chains.\n\nHeracles finally made his way to the garden of the Hesperides, where he encountered [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] holding up the heavens on his shoulders. Heracles persuaded Atlas to get the three golden Apples for him by offering to hold up the heavens in his place for a little while. Atlas could get the apples because, in this version, he was the father or otherwise related to the Hesperides. This would have made the labour \u2013 like the Hydra and the Augean stables \u2013 void because Heracles had received help. When Atlas returned, he decided that he did not want to take the heavens back, and instead offered to deliver the apples himself, but Heracles tricked him by agreeing to remain in place of Atlas on the condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily while Heracles adjusted his cloak. Atlas agreed, but Heracles reneged and walked away with the apples. According to an alternative version, Heracles slew [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], the dragon who guarded the apples instead. Eurystheus was furious that Heracles had accomplished something that Eurystheus thought could not possibly be done.\n\n===Twelfth: Cerberus===\n\n{{Main|Cerberus}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and Cerberus.jpg|thumb|Hercules and Cerberus]]\n\nThe twelfth and final labour was the capture of [[Cerberus]], the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog that was the guardian of the gates of the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]]. To prepare for his descent into the Underworld, Heracles went to [[Eleusis]] (or [[Athens]]) to be initiated in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. He entered the Underworld, and [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]] were his guides.\n\nWhile in the Underworld, Heracles met [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]]. The two companions had been imprisoned by [[Hades]] for attempting to kidnap [[Persephone]]. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs, then turning into stone; another that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the Earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the goddess for himself was so insulting he was doomed to stay behind.\n\nHeracles found Hades and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Heracles could subdue the beast without using weapons. Heracles overpowered Cerberus with his bare hands and slung the beast over his back. He carried Cerberus out of the Underworld through a cavern entrance in the [[Peloponnese]] and brought it to Eurystheus, who again fled into his ''[[pithos]]''.  Eurystheus begged Heracles to return Cerberus to the Underworld, offering in return to release him from any further labours when Cerberus disappeared back to his master.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece by Jean-Francois Detroy.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece'' by Jean-Francois Detroy]]\nAfter completing the Twelve Labours, one tradition says Heracles joined Jason and the [[Argonauts]] in their quest for the [[Golden Fleece]]. However, [[Herodorus]] (c. 400 BC) disputed this and denied Heracles ever sailed with the Argonauts. A separate tradition (e.g. ''[[Argonautica]]'') has Heracles accompany the Argonauts, but he did not travel with them as far as [[Colchis]].\n\n==Allegorical interpretation==\nSome ancient Greeks found allegorical meanings of a moral, psychological or philosophical nature in the Labors of Heracles.  This trend became more prominent in the Renaissance.<ref>Brumble, H. David. ''Classical Myths and Legends in the Middle Ages and Renaissance: A Dictionary of Allegorical Meanings''. Routledge, 2013.</ref>  For example, [[Heraclitus_(commentator)|Heraclitus the Grammarian]] wrote in his ''Homeric Problems'':\n{{Quote \n|text=\nI turn to Heracles. We must not suppose he attained such power in those days as a result of his physical strength. Rather, he was a man of intellect, an initiate in heavenly wisdom, who, as it were, shed light on philosophy, which had been hidden in deep darkness. The most authoritative of the Stoics agree with this account.... The (Erymanthian) boar which he overcame is the common incontinence of men; the (Nemean) lion is the indiscriminate rush towards improper goals; in the same way, by fettering irrational passions he gave rise to the belief that he had fettered the violent (Cretan) bull. He banished cowardice also from the world, in the shape of the hind of Ceryneia. There was another \"labor\" too, not properly so called, in which he cleared out the mass of dung (from the Augean stables) \u2014 in other words, the foulness that disfigures humanity. The (Stymphalian) birds he scattered are the windy hopes that feed our lives; the many-headed hydra that he burned, as it were, with the fires of exhortation, is pleasure, which begins to grow again as soon as it is cut out.\n|author=Donald Andrew Russell, David Konstan\n|source=''Heraclitus: Homeric Problems'' 33 (2005)<ref>Russell, Donald Andrew; Konstan, David (trs.).

The establishment of a fixed cycle of twelve labours was attributed by the Greeks to an [[epic poem]], now lost, written by [[Peisander]], dated about 600 BC.<ref>According to [[Walter Burkert]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}</ref> After Heracles killed his wife and children, he went to the oracle at Delphi. He prayed to the god Apollo for guidance. Heracles was told to serve the king of Mycenae, Eurystheus, for ten years. During this time, he is sent to perform a series of difficult feats, called labours.<ref>Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&pg=PA253 p. 253].</ref>\n\n==Backstory==\n[[File:P. Oxy. XXII 2331.jpg|thumb|The [[Heracles Papyrus]], a fragment of a 3rd-century Greek manuscript of a poem about the Labours of Heracles ([[Oxyrhynchus Papyrus]] 2331)]]\nDriven mad by [[Hera]]  (queen of the gods), Heracles slew his sons by his wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]].<ref>Ker\u00e9nyi, p. 186.</ref> After recovering his sanity, Heracles deeply regretted his actions; he was purified by King [[Thespius]], then traveled to [[Delphi]] to inquire how he could atone for his actions. [[Pythia]], the Oracle of Delphi, advised him to go to [[Tiryns]] and serve his cousin, King [[Eurystheus]], for ten years, performing whatever labors Eurystheus might set him; in return, he would be rewarded with immortality. Heracles despaired at this, loathing to serve a man whom he knew to be far inferior to himself, yet fearing to oppose his father [[Zeus]]. Eventually, he placed himself at Eurystheus's disposal.\n\nEurystheus originally ordered Heracles to perform ten labours. Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus refused to recognize two: the slaying of the [[Lernaean Hydra]], as Heracles' nephew and charioteer [[Iolaus]] had helped him; and the cleansing of the [[Augean stables|Augeas]], because Heracles accepted payment for the labour. Eurystheus set two more tasks (fetching the Golden Apples of [[Hesperides]] and capturing [[Cerberus]]), which Heracles also performed, bringing the total number of tasks to twelve.\n\n==Labours==\n[[File:Map_of_Heracles's_Early_Labors.jpg|thumb|Heracles's first six labours were located in the [[Peloponnese]].]]\n\nAs they survive, the labours of Heracles are not recounted in any single place, but must be reassembled from many sources. Ruck and Staples<ref name=\"ruck\">{{cite book | last = Ruck | first = Carl | author2=Danny Staples | year = 1994 | pages = 169 | title = The World of Classical Myth | location = Durham, North Carolina| publisher = Carolina Academic Press}}</ref> assert that there is no one way to interpret the labours, but that six were located in the [[Peloponnese]], culminating with the rededication of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Six others took the hero farther afield, to places that were, per Ruck, \"all previously strongholds of Hera or the 'Goddess' and were Entrances to the Netherworld\".<ref name=\"ruck\"/> In each case, the pattern was the same: Heracles was sent to kill or subdue, or to fetch back for Eurystheus (as Hera's representative) a magical animal or plant.\n\nA famous depiction of the labours in Greek sculpture is found on the [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, which date to the 450s BC.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n<!-- \nthere are no \"fixed\" number of metopes: in the Archaic period, it may actually have been the labours' display on the twelve available metopes on temples which led to their being counted as twelve in number.\n-->\n\nIn his labours, Heracles was sometimes accompanied by a male companion (an ''[[eromenos]]''), according to [[Licymnius]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} and others, such as [[Iolaus]], his nephew. Although he was supposed to perform only ten labours, this assistance led to two labours being disqualified: Eurystheus refused to recognize slaying the Hydra, because Iolaus helped him, and the cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was paid for his services and/or because the rivers did the work. Several of the labours involved the offspring (by various accounts) of [[Typhon]] and his mate [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]], all overcome by Heracles.\n\nA traditional order of the labours found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.1\u20132.5.12.</ref> by Pseudo-Apollodorus is:\n# Slay the [[Nemean lion]].\n# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].\n# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]].\n# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].\n# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.\n# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds]].\n# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].\n# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].\n# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]].\n# Obtain the cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]].\n# Steal three of the golden apples of the [[Hesperides]].\n# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].\n\n===First: Nemean lion===\n{{Main|Nemean lion}}\n[[File:Hercules with head of Nemean Lion.jpg|thumb|Hercules with the head of the Nemean lion]]\n\nHeracles wandered the area until he came to the town of [[Cleonae (Argolis)|Cleonae]]. There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within 30 days, the town would sacrifice a lion to [[Zeus]], but if he did not return within 30 days or if he died, the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus. Another version claims that he met Molorchos, a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion, saying that if he came back within 30 days, a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus. If he did not return within 30 days, it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering.\n\nWhile searching for the lion, Heracles fletched some arrows to use against it, not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable. When he found and shot the lion, firing at it with his bow, he discovered the fur's protective property as the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature's thigh. After some time, Heracles made the lion return to his cave. The cave had two entrances, one of which Heracles blocked; he then entered the other. In those dark and close quarters, Heracles stunned the beast with his club and, using his immense strength, strangled it to death. During the fight the lion bit off one of his fingers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Ther/LeonNemeios.html|title=NEMEAN LION (Leon Nemeios) - Labour of Heracles in Greek Mythology|website=www.theoi.com}}</ref> Others say that he shot arrows at it, eventually shooting it in the unarmored mouth. After slaying the lion, he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt, but failed. He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself. Finally, [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, told Heracles to use one of the lion's own claws to skin the pelt. Others say that Heracles' armor was, in fact, the hide of the lion of [[Cithaeron]].\n\nWhen he returned on the 30th day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders, King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified. Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city; from then on he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates. Eurystheus would then tell Heracles his tasks through a herald, not personally. Eurystheus even had a large bronze jar made for him in which to hide from Heracles if need be. Eurystheus then warned him that the tasks would become increasingly difficult.\n\n===Second: Lernaean Hydra===\n{{Main|Lernaean Hydra}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra.webp|thumb|left|Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra]]\nHeracles' second labour was to slay the [[Lernaean Hydra]], which [[Hera]] had raised just to slay Heracles. Upon reaching the swamp near [[Lerna|Lake Lerna]], where the Hydra dwelt, Heracles used a cloth to cover his mouth and nose to protect himself from the poisonous fumes. He fired flaming arrows into the Hydra's lair, the spring of [[Amymone]], a deep cave that it only came out of to terrorize neighboring villages.<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (angelo) 1959:144.</ref> He then confronted the Hydra, wielding a harvesting [[sickle]] (according to some early vase-paintings), a sword or his famed club. Ruck and Staples (1994: 170) have pointed out that the [[chthonic]] creature's reaction was botanical: upon cutting off each of its heads he found that two grew back, an expression of the hopelessness of such a struggle for any but the [[hero]]. Additionally, one of the Hydra's heads - the middle one - was immortal.\n\nThe details of the struggle are explicit in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' (2.5.2): realizing that he could not defeat the Hydra in this way, Heracles called on his nephew [[Iolaus]] for help. His nephew then came upon the idea (possibly inspired by [[Athena]]) of using a firebrand to scorch the neck stumps after each decapitation. Heracles cut off each head and Iolaus cauterized the open stumps. Seeing that Heracles was winning the struggle, Hera sent a giant crab to distract him. He crushed it under his mighty foot. He cut off the Hydra's one immortal head with a golden sword given to him by Athena. Heracles placed it under a great rock on the sacred way between Lerna and Elaius (Kerenyi 1959:144), and dipped his arrows in the Hydra's poisonous blood, and so his second task was complete. The alternative version of this myth is that after cutting off one head, he then dipped his sword in it and used its venom to burn each head so it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the [[Hydra (constellation)|constellation Hydra]]. She then turned the crab into the [[Cancer (constellation)|constellation Cancer]].\n\nLater, Heracles used an arrow dipped in the Hydra's poisonous blood to kill the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]; and Nessus's tainted blood was applied to the [[Tunic of Nessus]], by which the centaur had his posthumous revenge. Both [[Strabo]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] report that the stench of the river Anigrus in [[Elis]], making all the fish of the river inedible, was reputed to be due to the Hydra's venom, washed from the arrows Heracles used on the centaur.<ref>Strabo, viii.3.19, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], v.5.9; Grimal 1987:219.</ref>\n\n===Third: Ceryneian Hind===\n{{Main|Ceryneian Hind}}\n\n[[File:Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind.webp|thumb|Hercules capturing the Ceryneian Hind]]\nEurystheus and Hera were greatly angered that Heracles had survived the Nemean Lion and the [[Lernaean Hydra]]. For the third labour, they found a task which they thought would spell doom for the hero. It was not slaying a beast or monster, as it had already been established that Heracles could overcome even the most fearsome opponents. Instead, Eurystheus ordered him to capture the [[Ceryneian Hind]], which was so fast that it could outrun an arrow.\n\nAfter beginning the search, Heracles awoke from sleeping and saw the hind by the glint on its [[antlers]]. Heracles then chased the hind on foot for a full year through [[Greece]], [[Thrace]], [[Istria]], and the land of the [[Hyperboreans]]. In some versions, he captured the hind while it slept, rendering it lame with a trap net. In other versions, he encountered [[Artemis]] in her temple; she told him to leave the hind and tell Eurystheus all that had happened, and his third labor would be considered to be completed. Yet another version claims that Heracles trapped the Hind with an arrow between its forelegs.\n\nEurystheus had given Heracles this task hoping to incite Artemis' anger at Heracles for his desecration of her sacred animal. As he was returning with the hind, Heracles encountered Artemis and her brother [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]]. He begged the goddess for forgiveness, explaining that he had to catch it as part of his penance, but he promised to return it. Artemis forgave him, foiling Eurystheus' plan to have her punish him.\n\nUpon bringing the hind to Eurystheus, he was told that it was to become part of the King's [[menagerie]]. Heracles knew that he had to return the hind as he had promised, so he agreed to hand it over on the condition that Eurystheus himself come out and take it from him. The King came out, but the moment that Heracles let the hind go, it sprinted back to its mistress and Heracles left, saying that Eurystheus had not been quick enough.\n\n===Fourth: Erymanthian Boar===\n{{Main|Erymanthian Boar}}\n[[File:Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar.jpg|thumb|left|Heracles and the Erymanthian Boar]]\nEurystheus was disappointed that Heracles had overcome yet another creature and was humiliated by the hind's escape, so he assigned Heracles another dangerous task. By some accounts, the fourth labour was to bring the fearsome [[Erymanthian Boar]] back to Eurystheus alive (there is no single definitive telling of the labours). On the way to Mount Erymanthos where the boar lived, Heracles visited [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]] (\"caveman\"), a kind and hospitable [[centaur]] and old friend. Heracles ate with Pholus in his cavern (though the centaur devoured his meat raw) and asked for wine. Pholus had only one jar of wine, a gift from [[Dionysus]] to all the centaurs on Mount Erymanthos. Heracles convinced him to open it, and the smell attracted the other centaurs. They did not understand that wine needs to be tempered with water, became drunk, and attacked Heracles. Heracles shot at them with his poisonous arrows, killing many, and the centaurs retreated all the way to [[Chiron]]'s cave.\n\nPholus was curious why the arrows caused so much death. He picked one up but dropped it, and the arrow stabbed his hoof, poisoning him. One version states that a stray arrow hit Chiron as well. He was immortal, but he still felt the pain. Chiron's pain was so great that he volunteered to give up his immortality and take the place of [[Prometheus]], who had been chained to the top of a mountain to have his liver eaten daily by an [[eagle]]. Prometheus' torturer, the eagle, continued its torture on Chiron, so Heracles shot it dead with an arrow. It is generally accepted that the tale was meant to show Heracles as being the recipient of Chiron's surrendered immortality. However, this tale contradicts the fact that Chiron later taught [[Achilles]]. The tale of the centaurs sometimes appears in other parts of the twelve labours, as does the freeing of Prometheus.\n\nHeracles had visited Chiron to gain advice on how to catch the boar, and Chiron had told him to drive it into thick snow, which sets this labour in mid-winter. Heracles caught the boar, bound it, and carried it back to Eurystheus, who was frightened of it and ducked down in his half-buried storage ''[[pithos]]'', begging Heracles to get rid of the beast.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Fifth: Augean stables===\n{{Main|Augeas}}\n\n[[File:Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the rive.jpg|thumb|Hercules cleans the Augean stables by redirecting the river]]\nThe fifth labour was to clean the stables of King [[Augeas]]. This assignment was intended to be both humiliating (rather than impressive, as the previous labours had been) and impossible, since the livestock were divinely healthy (and immortal) and therefore produced an enormous quantity of dung. The Augean Stables ({{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0|\u02c8|d\u0292|i\u02d0|\u0259|n}}) had not been cleaned in over 30 years, and over 1,000 cattle lived there. However, Heracles succeeded by re-routing the rivers [[Alfeios River|Alpheus]] and [[Pineios River (Peloponnese)|Peneus]] to wash out the filth.\n\nBefore starting on the task, Heracles had asked Augeas for one-tenth of the cattle if he finished the task in one day, and Augeas agreed. But afterwards Augeas refused to honour the agreement on the grounds that Heracles had been ordered to carry out the task by Eurystheus anyway. Heracles claimed his reward in court, and was supported by Augeas' son [[Phyleus]]. Augeas banished them both before the court had ruled. Heracles returned, slew Augeas, and gave his kingdom to Phyleus. Heracles then founded the Olympic Games.\nThe success of this labour was ultimately discounted as the rushing waters had done the work of cleaning the stables and because Heracles was paid for doing the labour. \nEurystheus said that Heracles still had seven labours to perform.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|title=Maps of Mount Olympus|access-date=2019-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921212448/http://www.olympusfd.gr/images/Maps/map_us.pdf|archive-date=2018-09-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Sixth: Stymphalian birds===\n{{Main|Stymphalian birds}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and the Stymphalian Birds.png|thumb|left|Hercules and the Stymphalian birds]]\n\nThe sixth labour was to defeat the [[Stymphalian birds]], man-eating birds with beaks made of [[bronze]] and sharp metallic feathers they could launch at their victims. They were sacred to [[Ares]], the god of war. Furthermore, their dung was highly toxic. They had migrated to [[Lake Stymphalia]] in [[Arcadia]], where they bred quickly and took over the countryside, destroying local crops, fruit trees, and townspeople. Heracles could not go too far into the swamp, for it would not support his weight. [[Athena]], noticing the hero's plight, gave Heracles a rattle which [[Hephaestus]] had made especially for the occasion. Heracles shook the rattle and frightened the birds into the air. Heracles then shot many of them with his arrows. The rest flew far away, never to return. The [[Argonauts]] would later encounter them.\n\n===Seventh: Cretan Bull===\n{{Main|Cretan Bull}} \n[[File:Herculean effort.jpg|thumb|upright|Heracles forces the Cretan Bull to the ground ([[engraving]] by B. Picart, 1731)]]\n\nThe seventh labour was to capture the [[Cretan Bull]], father of the [[Minotaur]]. Heracles sailed to [[Crete]], where King [[Minos]] gave Heracles permission to take the bull away and even offered him assistance (which Heracles declined, plausibly because he did not want the labor to be discounted as before).<ref name=\"Apollod\">''Bibliotheca'' 2.5.7</ref> The bull had been wreaking havoc on Crete by uprooting crops and leveling orchard walls. Heracles sneaked up behind the bull and then used his hands to throttle it (stopping before it was killed), and then shipped it back to Tiryns. Eurystheus, who hid in his ''[[pithos]]'' at first sight of the creature, wanted to sacrifice the bull to Hera, who hated Heracles. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered into [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], becoming known as the Marathonian Bull.<ref name=\"Apollod\" /> [[Theseus]] would later sacrifice the bull to [[Athena]] and/or [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]].\n\n===Eighth: Mares of Diomedes===\n{{Main|Mares of Diomedes}}\n[[File:Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses, 1752.jpg|thumb|left|Jean Baptiste Marie Pierre - ''Diomedes King of Thrace Killed by Hercules and Devoured by his own Horses'', 1752]]\nAs the eighth of his [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]], also categorised as the second of the Non-[[Peloponnese|Peloponneisan]] labours<ref>{{Cite book|last=Morford, Mark P.

After overpowering Diomedes\u2019 men, Heracles broke the chains that tethered the horses and drove the mares down to sea. Unaware that the mares were man-eating and uncontrollable, Heracles left them in the charge of his favored companion, [[Abderus]], while he left to fight Diomedes. Upon his return, Heracles found that the boy was eaten. As revenge, Heracles fed Diomedes to his own horses and then founded [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] next to the boy's tomb<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nIn another version, Heracles, who was visiting the island, stayed awake so that he didn't have his throat cut by Diomedes in the night, and cut the chains binding the horses once everyone was asleep. Having scared the horses onto the high ground of a knoll, Heracles quickly dug a trench through the peninsula, filling it with water and thus flooding the low lying plain. When Diomedes and his men turned to flee, Heracles killed them with an axe (or a club<ref name=\":1\" />), and fed Diomedes\u2019 body to the horses to calm them.\n\nIn yet another version, Heracles first captured Diomedes and fed him to the mares ''before'' releasing them. Only after realizing that their King was dead did his men, the [[Bistones|Bistonians]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />, attack Heracles. Upon seeing the mares charging at them, led in a chariot by Abderus, the Bistonians turned and fled.\n\nAll versions have eating human flesh make the horses calmer, giving Heracles the opportunity to bind their mouths shut, and easily take them back to King Eurystheus, who dedicated the horses to [[Hera]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rose, H.

After the incident, Eurystheus sent Heracles to bring back [[Hippolyta|Hippolyta's Girdle]].\n\n===Ninth: Belt of Hippolyta===\n{{Main|Hippolyta}}\n[[File:The magic girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons.jpg|thumb|eft|The magic girdle of Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons]]\n[[Eurystheus]]' daughter [[Admete]] wanted the Belt of [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], a gift from her father Ares. To please his daughter, Eurystheus ordered Heracles to retrieve the belt as his ninth labour.\n\nTaking a band of friends with him, Heracles set sail, stopping at the island of [[Paros]], which was inhabited by some sons of Minos. The sons killed two of Heracles' companions, an act which set Heracles on a rampage. He killed two of the sons of Minos and threatened the other inhabitants until he was offered two men to replace his fallen companions. Heracles agreed and took two of Minos' grandsons, [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]] and [[Sthenelus]]. They continued their voyage and landed at the court of [[Lycus (mythology)|Lycus]], whom Heracles defended in a battle against King [[Mygdon of Bebryces]]. After killing King Mygdon, Heracles gave much of the land to his friend Lycus. Lycus called the land [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]. The crew then set off for [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]], where Hippolyta lived.\n\nAll would have gone well for Heracles had it not been for Hera. Hippolyta, impressed with Heracles and his exploits, agreed to give him the belt and would have done so had Hera not disguised herself and walked among the Amazons sowing seeds of distrust. She claimed the strangers were plotting to carry off the queen of the Amazons. Alarmed, the women set off on horseback to confront Heracles. When Heracles saw them, he thought Hippolyta had been plotting such treachery all along and had never meant to hand over the belt, so he killed her, took the belt and returned to Eurystheus.\n\n===Tenth: Cattle of Geryon===\n{{Main|Geryon}}\n[[File:Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones.webp|thumb|Hercules and the Cattle of Geryones]]\nThe tenth labour was to obtain the Cattle of the three-bodied giant [[Geryon]]. In the fullest account in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' of Pseudo-Apollodorus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca'', 2.5.10.</ref> [[Hercules|Heracles]] had to go to the island of Erytheia in the far west (sometimes identified with the [[Hesperides]], or with the island which forms the city of [[C\u00e1diz]]) to get the cattle. On the way there, he crossed the [[Ancient Libya|Libya]]n desert<ref>''Libya'' was the generic name for [[North Africa]] to the Greeks.</ref> and became so frustrated at the heat that he shot an arrow at the [[Sun]]. The sun-god [[Helios]] \"in admiration of his courage\" gave Heracles the golden cup Helios used to sail across the sea from west to east each night. Heracles rode the cup to Erytheia; Heracles in the cup was a favorite motif on [[black-figure pottery]].{{fact|date=March 2020}} Such a magical conveyance undercuts any literal geography for Erytheia, the \"red island\" of the sunset.\n\nWhen Heracles landed at Erytheia, he was confronted by the two-headed dog [[Orthrus]]. With one blow from his olive-wood club, Heracles killed Orthrus. [[Eurytion]] the herdsman came to assist Orthrus, but Heracles dealt with him the same way.\n\nOn hearing the commotion, Geryon sprang into action, carrying three shields and three spears, and wearing three helmets. He attacked Heracles at the River Anthemus, but was slain by one of Heracles' poisoned arrows. Heracles shot so forcefully that the arrow pierced Geryon's forehead, \"and Geryon bent his neck over to one side, like a poppy that spoils its delicate shapes, shedding its petals all at once.\"<ref>[[Stesichorus]], fragment, translated by Denys Page.</ref>\n\nHeracles then had to herd the cattle back to Eurystheus. In [[Roman mythology|Roman]] versions of the narrative, Heracles drove the cattle over the [[Aventine Hill]] on the future site of [[Rome]]. The giant [[Cacus]], who lived there, stole some of the cattle as Heracles slept, making the cattle walk backwards so that they left no trail, a repetition of the trick of the young [[Hermes]]. According to some versions, Heracles drove his remaining cattle past the cave, where Cacus had hidden the stolen animals, and they began calling out to each other. In other versions, Cacus' sister [[Caca (mythology)|Caca]] told Heracles where he was. Heracles then killed Cacus, and set up an altar on the spot, later the site of Rome's [[Forum Boarium]] (the cattle market).\n\nTo annoy Heracles, Hera sent a [[Gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] to bite the cattle, irritate them, and scatter them. Within a year, Heracles retrieved them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the level of a river so much that Heracles could not cross with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\n\n===Eleventh: Golden Apples of the Hesperides===\n{{Main|Hesperides}}\n[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|left|Atlas and Hercules]]\n[[File:Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides.webp|thumb|Hercules stealing the apples from the Hesperides]]\nAfter [[Hercules|Heracles]] completed the first ten labours, Eurystheus gave him two more, claiming that slaying the Hydra did not count (because [[Iolaus]] helped Heracles), neither did cleaning the Augean Stables (either because he was paid for the job or because the rivers did the work).\n\nThe first additional labour was to steal three of the golden apples from the garden of the [[Hesperides]]. Heracles first caught the [[Old Man of the Sea]], the shapeshifting sea god,<ref>Kerenyi, ''The Heroes of the Greeks'', 1959, p.172, identifies him in this context as [[Nereus]]; as a shapeshifter he is often identified as [[Proteus]].</ref> to learn where the Garden of the Hesperides was located.<ref>In some versions of the tale, Hercules was directed to ask [[Prometheus]]. As payment, he freed Prometheus from his daily torture. This tale is more usually found as part of the story of the [[Erymanthian Boar]], since it is associated with [[Chiron]] choosing to forgo immortality and taking Prometheus' place.</ref>\n\nIn some variations, Heracles, either at the start or at the end of this task, meets [[Antaeus]], who was invincible as long as he touched his mother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the Earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by holding him aloft and crushing him in a bear hug.<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus ii. 5; [[Hyginus]], ''Fab.'' 31</ref>\n\n[[Herodotus]] claims that Heracles stopped in [[Egypt]], where King [[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]] decided to make him the yearly sacrifice, but Heracles burst out of his chains.\n\nHeracles finally made his way to the garden of the Hesperides, where he encountered [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] holding up the heavens on his shoulders. Heracles persuaded Atlas to get the three golden Apples for him by offering to hold up the heavens in his place for a little while. Atlas could get the apples because, in this version, he was the father or otherwise related to the Hesperides. This would have made the labour \u2013 like the Hydra and the Augean stables \u2013 void because Heracles had received help. When Atlas returned, he decided that he did not want to take the heavens back, and instead offered to deliver the apples himself, but Heracles tricked him by agreeing to remain in place of Atlas on the condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily while Heracles adjusted his cloak. Atlas agreed, but Heracles reneged and walked away with the apples. According to an alternative version, Heracles slew [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]], the dragon who guarded the apples instead. Eurystheus was furious that Heracles had accomplished something that Eurystheus thought could not possibly be done.\n\n===Twelfth: Cerberus===\n\n{{Main|Cerberus}}\n\n[[File:Hercules and Cerberus.jpg|thumb|Hercules and Cerberus]]\n\nThe twelfth and final labour was the capture of [[Cerberus]], the three-headed, dragon-tailed dog that was the guardian of the gates of the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]]. To prepare for his descent into the Underworld, Heracles went to [[Eleusis]] (or [[Athens]]) to be initiated in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. He entered the Underworld, and [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]] were his guides.\n\nWhile in the Underworld, Heracles met [[Theseus]] and [[Pirithous]]. The two companions had been imprisoned by [[Hades]] for attempting to kidnap [[Persephone]]. One tradition tells of snakes coiling around their legs, then turning into stone; another that Hades feigned hospitality and prepared a feast inviting them to sit. They unknowingly sat in chairs of forgetfulness and were permanently ensnared. When Heracles had pulled Theseus first from his chair, some of his thigh stuck to it (this explains the supposedly lean thighs of Athenians), but the Earth shook at the attempt to liberate Pirithous, whose desire to have the goddess for himself was so insulting he was doomed to stay behind.\n\nHeracles found Hades and asked permission to bring Cerberus to the surface, which Hades agreed to if Heracles could subdue the beast without using weapons. Heracles overpowered Cerberus with his bare hands and slung the beast over his back. He carried Cerberus out of the Underworld through a cavern entrance in the [[Peloponnese]] and brought it to Eurystheus, who again fled into his ''[[pithos]]''.  Eurystheus begged Heracles to return Cerberus to the Underworld, offering in return to release him from any further labours when Cerberus disappeared back to his master.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece by Jean-Francois Detroy.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Jason and the Legendary Golden Fleece'' by Jean-Francois Detroy]]\nAfter completing the Twelve Labours, one tradition says Heracles joined Jason and the [[Argonauts]] in their quest for the [[Golden Fleece]]. However, [[Herodorus]] (c. 400 BC) disputed this and denied Heracles ever sailed with the Argonauts. A separate tradition (e.g. ''[[Argonautica]]'') has Heracles accompany the Argonauts, but he did not travel with them as far as [[Colchis]].\n\n==Allegorical interpretation==\nSome ancient Greeks found allegorical meanings of a moral, psychological or philosophical nature in the Labors of Heracles.  This trend became more prominent in the Renaissance.<ref>Brumble, H. David. ''Classical Myths and Legends in the Middle Ages and Renaissance: A Dictionary of Allegorical Meanings''. Routledge, 2013.</ref>  For example, [[Heraclitus_(commentator)|Heraclitus the Grammarian]] wrote in his ''Homeric Problems'':\n{{Quote \n|text=\nI turn to Heracles. We must not suppose he attained such power in those days as a result of his physical strength. Rather, he was a man of intellect, an initiate in heavenly wisdom, who, as it were, shed light on philosophy, which had been hidden in deep darkness. The most authoritative of the Stoics agree with this account.... The (Erymanthian) boar which he overcame is the common incontinence of men; the (Nemean) lion is the indiscriminate rush towards improper goals; in the same way, by fettering irrational passions he gave rise to the belief that he had fettered the violent (Cretan) bull. He banished cowardice also from the world, in the shape of the hind of Ceryneia. There was another \"labor\" too, not properly so called, in which he cleared out the mass of dung (from the Augean stables) \u2014 in other words, the foulness that disfigures humanity. The (Stymphalian) birds he scattered are the windy hopes that feed our lives; the many-headed hydra that he burned, as it were, with the fires of exhortation, is pleasure, which begins to grow again as soon as it is cut out.\n|author=Donald Andrew Russell, David Konstan\n|source=''Heraclitus: Homeric Problems'' 33 (2005)<ref>Russell, Donald Andrew; Konstan, David (trs.).

Cecil spotted his workmates driving radio-controlled cars on the company's helipad and decided it needed a [[ball differential]] after noticing the cars skittered.   He soon started noticing large areas that these early primitive cars could be improved. Having noticed high tyre wear he introduced the [[ball differential]] to radio-controlled cars.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Cecil|publisher=RC Racing TV|year=2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsIX5J9mbhs|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Burr|2015|p=156 }}\n\nThese ball differentials were used by his son Robin then his friends then local model shop requested to stock it and soon international orders followed. It came to the point that Cecil Schumacher was making more money from this side business than through his employer. So in 1981 Schumacher Racing Products was formed in [[Northampton]], England.\n\nThe company has always operated out of Northampton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioracecar.com/article.aspx?a=4875 |title=The Hobby Hub |publisher=Radioracecar.com |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> but sourced some components from China like most other successful RC companies; however, the majority of manufacturing remains in England and Schumacher remains very much an English company. Cecil Schumacher's son Robin Schumacher took over the business in 2001.\n\n===1980s===\nThe first car to be produced by Schumacher was the XL Lexan chassis pan car in 1981 which had intentionally highly flexible chassis suitable for indoor racing. This was followed in 1983 by the \"C\" car which was made out of fibreglass reinforced epoxy resin sheet and designed specifically for racing on carpet. It included many features that are still around on every modern 1/12-scale car; race wins include the euros in 1985 and 1988.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1980s, [[off-road]] RC cars increased in popularity. In 1986 the first [[4WD]] [[1:10 radio-controlled off-road buggy|1/10-scale off-road buggy]] was launched, called the SWB CAT. This launched the CAT (Competition All Terrain) brand for Schumacher. This first variant SWB (Short Wheel Base) 4WD car was an instant success with serious RC fans with its popularity cemented into history when [[Masami Hirosaka]] won the 1987 [[IFMAR]] off-road RC World Championships<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUSO_QwBrhU |title=Past IFMAR WC\u00b4s \u2013 1987 IFMAR Worlds Championship |via=YouTube |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> having been lent a works car after Schumacher scouts noted his driving form during practice sessions.\n\n===1990s===\nFollowing the success of the first generation of off-road CATs, Schumacher continued to produce many successful off and on-road electric cars. The popularity of the touring car class seriously affected the off-road world during the 1990s. Schumacher stepped down the development of this class through the 1990s. Schumacher was then starting to dominate a niche in the \"fun\" car sector, with high-power/speed [[Nitromethane|nitro]]-powered models capable of real speeds in excess of 80&nbsp;mph.\n\n===2000s===\nOver the turn of this century the Schumacher product line-up became quite familiar with the \"fun\" cars with increasing number of nitro products; however it remained in the 1/10 competition touring cars market. \n\n===2010s===\nThe flood of cheap high-volume low-margin ready to run cars produced in Asia meant the company no longer produce a nitro car or fun car. Schumacher now concentrate on the high level 1/10-scale electrical competitive market. Alongside their Mi touring car range the company re-entered the off-road scene with the CAT SX (4WD) and Cougar SV (2WD). Vintage racing of older designed cars became popular with Schumacher re-releasing the CAT XLS in 2017 and then the Top Cat. In the mid 2010s a move was made to help the sport grow with the introduction of a number of lower priced competition cars. The Mi1 touring car was introduced alongside the ever evolving top spec version. And then a move was made to re-establish 1/12th electric carpet racing with the launch of the Supastock and Eclipse range. It also increased its distrution business of other none competing RC products.\n\n===2020s===\nIn January 2020 Schumacher won IFMAR 1/12 World Championships held in [[Milton Keynes]]\n\n==Racing Success==\n\n===World Championships===\n\nPodiums\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Cecil spotted his workmates driving radio-controlled cars on the company's helipad and decided it needed a [[ball differential]] after noticing the cars skittered.   He soon started noticing large areas that these early primitive cars could be improved. Having noticed high tyre wear he introduced the [[ball differential]] to radio-controlled cars.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Cecil|publisher=RC Racing TV|year=2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsIX5J9mbhs|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Burr|2015|p=156 }}\n\nThese ball differentials were used by his son Robin then his friends then local model shop requested to stock it and soon international orders followed. It came to the point that Cecil Schumacher was making more money from this side business than through his employer. So in 1981 Schumacher Racing Products was formed in [[Northampton]], England.\n\nThe company has always operated out of Northampton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioracecar.com/article.aspx?a=4875 |title=The Hobby Hub |publisher=Radioracecar.com |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> but sourced some components from China like most other successful RC companies; however, the majority of manufacturing remains in England and Schumacher remains very much an English company. Cecil Schumacher's son Robin Schumacher took over the business in 2001.\n\n===1980s===\nThe first car to be produced by Schumacher was the XL Lexan chassis pan car in 1981 which had intentionally highly flexible chassis suitable for indoor racing. This was followed in 1983 by the \"C\" car which was made out of fibreglass reinforced epoxy resin sheet and designed specifically for racing on carpet. It included many features that are still around on every modern 1/12-scale car; race wins include the euros in 1985 and 1988.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1980s, [[off-road]] RC cars increased in popularity. In 1986 the first [[4WD]] [[1:10 radio-controlled off-road buggy|1/10-scale off-road buggy]] was launched, called the SWB CAT. This launched the CAT (Competition All Terrain) brand for Schumacher. This first variant SWB (Short Wheel Base) 4WD car was an instant success with serious RC fans with its popularity cemented into history when [[Masami Hirosaka]] won the 1987 [[IFMAR]] off-road RC World Championships<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUSO_QwBrhU |title=Past IFMAR WC\u00b4s \u2013 1987 IFMAR Worlds Championship |via=YouTube |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> having been lent a works car after Schumacher scouts noted his driving form during practice sessions.\n\n===1990s===\nFollowing the success of the first generation of off-road CATs, Schumacher continued to produce many successful off and on-road electric cars. The popularity of the touring car class seriously affected the off-road world during the 1990s. Schumacher stepped down the development of this class through the 1990s. Schumacher was then starting to dominate a niche in the \"fun\" car sector, with high-power/speed [[Nitromethane|nitro]]-powered models capable of real speeds in excess of 80&nbsp;mph.\n\n===2000s===\nOver the turn of this century the Schumacher product line-up became quite familiar with the \"fun\" cars with increasing number of nitro products; however it remained in the 1/10 competition touring cars market. \n\n===2010s===\nThe flood of cheap high-volume low-margin ready to run cars produced in Asia meant the company no longer produce a nitro car or fun car. Schumacher now concentrate on the high level 1/10-scale electrical competitive market. Alongside their Mi touring car range the company re-entered the off-road scene with the CAT SX (4WD) and Cougar SV (2WD). Vintage racing of older designed cars became popular with Schumacher re-releasing the CAT XLS in 2017 and then the Top Cat. In the mid 2010s a move was made to help the sport grow with the introduction of a number of lower priced competition cars. The Mi1 touring car was introduced alongside the ever evolving top spec version. And then a move was made to re-establish 1/12th electric carpet racing with the launch of the Supastock and Eclipse range. It also increased its distrution business of other none competing RC products.\n\n===2020s===\nIn January 2020 Schumacher won IFMAR 1/12 World Championships held in [[Milton Keynes]]\n\n==Racing Success==\n\n===World Championships===\n\nPodiums\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

From then on, the poet approached the [[Symbolism (art)|symbolist trend]] and became friend with [[Claude Debussy]], and met in [[Edmond Bailly]]'s ''Librairie de l'art ind\u00e9pendant'', the \"master of the dream\" [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]], of whom he attended the \"Tuesdays of the Rue de Rome\".<ref>Read the memories of Mourey about this in ''Chez les Symbolistes'', text appeared in ''Les Nouvelles litt\u00e9raires'', 20 June 1936 \u2014 [http://livrenblog.blogspot.fr/2009/11/gabriel-mourey-chez-les-symbolistes.html online] sur ''Livres en blog''.</ref> The following year, he published his first essay of art criticism, ''Les Arts de la vie et le r\u00e8gne de la laideur'' at {{ill|Paul Ollendorff|fr}}, a rather reactionary essay that denounced [[impressionism]], the realistic or naturalist drifts of painting, and which was more on the side of [[William Morris]], the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and [[John Ruskin]], and in which he affirmed that \"it is the spirit of anarchism that reigns in France in the artistic movement... a need for destruction, a sort of delirium that wants to abolish everything that exists.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lesartsdelavieet00mour ''Les arts de la vie et Le r\u00e8gne de la laideur''], 2nd edition (1899), online on ''archive.org''.</ref> Mourey was much more open during the following decades; he was commissioned by the Ministry of Fine Arts from 1895 onwards, and served as a link between the emerging English, Italian, Russian and Parisian [[decorative arts]], and then saluted the advent of the [[Art Nouveau]] style. He wrote for catalogs of the [[Siegfried Bing|Bing gallery]] and the [[Julius Meier-Graefe|Maison moderne]], defended [[Albert Besnard]], {{ill|Felix Borchardt|fr}}, [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Edmond Aman-Jean]], [[Edgar Chahine]], etc.\n\nBasically, this versatile writer was a promoter in the hexagon of the Pre-Raphaelites and the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement. Erecting the latter as a model, with a tendency to idealize his supposed success, Mourey argued for an art with a social vocation [...]. As a number of his contemporaries, and as an art for all, his ideas found one of their extensions in 1904\u20131905 in the ephemeral magazine ''Les Arts de la vie,'' which he created and directed [at Larousse].

From then on, the poet approached the [[Symbolism (art)|symbolist trend]] and became friend with [[Claude Debussy]], and met in [[Edmond Bailly]]'s ''Librairie de l'art ind\u00e9pendant'', the \"master of the dream\" [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]], of whom he attended the \"Tuesdays of the Rue de Rome\".<ref>Read the memories of Mourey about this in ''Chez les Symbolistes'', text appeared in ''Les Nouvelles litt\u00e9raires'', 20 June 1936 \u2014 [http://livrenblog.blogspot.fr/2009/11/gabriel-mourey-chez-les-symbolistes.html online] sur ''Livres en blog''.</ref> The following year, he published his first essay of art criticism, ''Les Arts de la vie et le r\u00e8gne de la laideur'' at {{ill|Paul Ollendorff|fr}}, a rather reactionary essay that denounced [[impressionism]], the realistic or naturalist drifts of painting, and which was more on the side of [[William Morris]], the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and [[John Ruskin]], and in which he affirmed that \"it is the spirit of anarchism that reigns in France in the artistic movement... a need for destruction, a sort of delirium that wants to abolish everything that exists.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lesartsdelavieet00mour ''Les arts de la vie et Le r\u00e8gne de la laideur''], 2nd edition (1899), online on ''archive.org''.</ref> Mourey was much more open during the following decades; he was commissioned by the Ministry of Fine Arts from 1895 onwards, and served as a link between the emerging English, Italian, Russian and Parisian [[decorative arts]], and then saluted the advent of the [[Art Nouveau]] style. He wrote for catalogs of the [[Siegfried Bing|Bing galery]] and the [[Julius Meier-Graefe|Maison moderne]], defended [[Albert Besnard]], {{ill|Felix Borchardt|fr}}, [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Edmond Aman-Jean]], [[Edgar Chahine]], etc.\n\nBasically, this versatile writer was a promoter in the hexagon of the Pre-Raphaelites and the [[Arts and Crafts]] movement. Erecting the latter as a model, with a tendency to idealize his supposed success, Mourey argued for an art with a social vocation [...]. As a number of his contemporaries, and as an art for all, his ideas found one of their extensions in 1904-1905 in the ephemeral magazine ''Les Arts de la vie,'' which he created and directed [at Larousse].

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he represented [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[United States Senate]] and served as an adviser to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]. \n\nBorn in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], Moynihan moved at a young age to [[New York City]]. Following a stint in the navy, he earned a Ph.D. in history from [[Tufts University]]. He worked on the staff of New York Governor [[W. Averell Harriman]] before joining President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration in 1961. He served as an Assistant Secretary of Labor under Kennedy and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], devoting much of his time to the [[War on Poverty]]. In 1965, he published the controversial [[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action|Moynihan Report]]. Moynihan left the Johnson administration in 1965 and became a professor at [[Harvard University]].\n\nIn 1969, he accepted Nixon's offer to serve as an Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and he was elevated to the position of [[Counselor to the President]] later that year. He left the administration at the end of 1970, and accepted appointment as [[United States Ambassador to India]] in 1973. He accepted President [[Gerald Ford]]'s appointment to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1975, holding that position until 1976, when he won election to the Senate.\n\nMoynihan represented New York in the Senate from 1977 to 2001. He served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment Committee]] from 1992 to 1993 and as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] from 1993 to 1995.

During this period, Moynihan struggled with writer's block and began to fashion himself as a \"[[dandy]],\" cultivating \"a taste for [[Savile Row tailoring|Savile Row]] suits, rococo conversational riffs and Churchillian oratory\" even as he maintained that \"nothing and no one at LSE ever disposed me to be anything but a New York Democrat who had some friends who worked on the docks and drank beer after work.\"<ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism|author=Troy, G.|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199920303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyOoaxtz6KoC&pg=PA44|page=44|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\nHe ultimately received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[history]] (with a dissertation on the relationship between the United States and the [[International Labour Organization]]) from the Fletcher School in 1961 while serving as an assistant professor of [[political science]] and director of a government research project centered around [[Averell Harriman]]'s papers at [[Syracuse University]]'s [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]].<ref name=\"proquest\">{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302084811/|title=The United States and the International Labor Organization, 1889\u20131934 \u2013 ProQuest|accessdate=2017-01-26|via=ProQuest}}</ref><ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\">{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002530045|publisher=search.marquiswhoswho.com|title=Marquis Biographies Online|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Political career and return to academia==\nMoynihan's political career started in the 1950s, when he served as a member of New York Governor [[Averell Harriman]]'s staff in a variety of positions (including speechwriter and acting secretary to the governor). He met his future wife, Elizabeth (Liz) Brennan, who also worked on Harriman's staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/27/archives/elizabeth-moynihan-leaves-the-sidelines-for-an-active-role-in.html|title=Elizabeth Moynihan Leaves the Sidelines for an Active Role in Senate Race|website=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThis period ended following Harriman's loss to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the 1958 general election. Moynihan returned to academia, serving as a lecturer for brief periods at [[Russell Sage College]] (1957\u20131958) and the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] (1959) before taking a tenure-track position at Syracuse University (1959\u20131961). During this period, Moynihan was a delegate to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] as part of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s delegate pool.\n\n===Kennedy and Johnson Administrations; controversy over the War on Poverty===\nMoynihan first served in the Kennedy administration as special (1961\u20131962) and executive (1962\u20131963) assistant to [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretaries]] [[Arthur J. Goldberg]] and [[W. Willard Wirtz]]. In 1962, he authored the directive \"Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture\", which discouraged use of an official style for [[Federal building|federal buildings,]] and has been credited with enabling \"a wide ranging set of innovative public building projects\" in subsequent decades, including the [[San Francisco Federal Building]] and the [[United States Courthouse (Austin, Texas, 2012)|United States Courthouse in Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/news/article/150182232/new-executive-order-could-make-classical-architecture-the-preferred-and-default-style-for-america-s-public-buildings|title=New executive order could make classical architecture \"the preferred and default style\" for America's public buildings|last=Pacheco|first=Antonio|date=2020-02-04|website=Archinect|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\nHe was then appointed as [[United States Department of Labor|Assistant Secretary of Labor]] for Policy, Planning and Research, serving from 1963 to 1965 under Kennedy and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In this capacity, he did not have operational responsibilities. He devoted his time to trying to formulate national policy for what would become the [[War on Poverty]]. His small staff included [[Ralph Nader]].\n\nThey took inspiration from historian [[Stanley Elkins]]'s ''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' (1959). Elkins essentially contended that [[slavery]] had made black Americans dependent on the dominant society, and that such dependence still existed a century later after the American Civil War. Moynihan and his staff believed that government must go beyond simply ensuring that members of minority groups have the same rights as the majority and must also \"act affirmatively\" in order to counter the problem of historic discrimination.\n\nMoynihan's research of Labor Department data demonstrated that even as fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments in certain parts of the United States.\n\nMoynihan issued his research in 1965 under the title ''[[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action]]'', now commonly known as ''The Moynihan Report''. Moynihan's report<ref name=\"dol\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|publisher=dol.gov|title=U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 History \u2013 The Negro Family \u2013 The Case for National Action (Moynihan's War on Poverty report)|accessdate=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120102028/https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|archive-date=2017-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> fueled a debate over the proper course for government to take with regard to the economic underclass, especially blacks.

Kennedy]]. For this reason he was not favored by then-President Johnson, and he left the Johnson Administration in 1965. He ran for office in the Democratic Party primary for the presidency of the [[New York City Council]], a position now known as the [[New York City Public Advocate]]. However, he was defeated by Queens District Attorney [[Frank D. O'Connor]].\n\nDuring this transitional period, Moynihan maintained an academic affiliation as a fellow at [[Wesleyan University]]'s Center for Advanced Studies from 1964 to 1967. In 1966, he was appointed to the faculties of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education]] and [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Graduate School of Public Administration]] as a full professor of education and urban politics. After commencing a second extended leave because of his public service in 1973, his faculty line was transferred to the University's Department of Government, where he remained until 1977. From 1966 to 1969, he also held a secondary administrative appointment as director of the [[Harvard\u2013MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]].<ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\"/> With turmoil and [[riots]] in the United States, Moynihan, \"a national board member of [[Americans for Democratic Action|ADA]] incensed at the radicalism of the current [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] and [[Black Power]] movements\", decided to \"call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives,\"<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]].

As one of the few people in Nixon's inner circle who had done academic research related to social policies, he was very influential in the early months of the administration. However, his disdain for \"traditional budget-conscious positions\" (including his proposed Family Assistance Plan, a \"[[negative income tax]] or [[guaranteed minimum income]]\" for families that met work requirements or demonstrated that they were seeking work which ultimately stalled in the Senate despite prefiguring the later [[Supplemental Security Income]] program) led to frequent clashes (belying their unwavering mutual respect) with Nixon's principal domestic policy advisor, conservative economist and [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet-rank]] [[Counselor to the President]] [[Arthur F. Burns]].<ref name=\"bloomberg\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-28/when-nixon-listened-to-liberal-moynihan|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=When Nixon Listened to Liberal Moynihan \u2013 Bloomberg View|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref>\n\nWhile formulating Nixon's [[Guaranteed minimum income|Guaranteed Annual Income]] (GAI) proposal, Moynihan conducted significant discussions concerning a [[Basic Income Guarantee]] with [[Russell B. Long]] and [[Louis O. Kelso]].\n\nAlthough Moynihan was promoted to Counselor to the President for Urban Affairs with Cabinet rank shortly after Burns was nominated by Nixon to serve as [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] in October 1969, it was concurrently announced that Moynihan would be returning to Harvard (a stipulation of his leave from the University) at the end of 1970. Accordingly, operational oversight of the Urban Affairs Council was given to Moynihan's nominal successor as Domestic Policy Assistant, former [[White House Counsel]] [[John Ehrlichman]]. This decision was instigated by [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H.R. Haldeman]],<ref name=\"google4\">{{cite book|title=The Professor and the President: Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the Nixon White House|author=Hess, S.|date=2014|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815726166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU2aBAAAQBAJ|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref> a close friend of Ehrlichman since college and his main patron in the administration.

The relationship between the two countries was at a low point following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Ambassador Moynihan was alarmed that two great democracies were cast as antagonists, and set out to fix things. He proposed that part of the burdensome debt be written off, part used to pay for US embassy expenses in India, and the remaining converted into Indian [[Indian rupee|rupees]] to fund an Indo-US cultural and educational exchange program that lasted for a quarter century. On February 18, 1974, he presented to the Government of India a check for 16,640,000,000 rupees, then equivalent to $2,046,700,000, which was the greatest amount paid by a single check in the history of banking.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/11/moynihan-letters-201011 An American Original], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', October 2010</ref> The \"Rupee Deal\" is logged in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the world's largest check, written by Ambassador Moynihan to Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]].<ref>[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/america-can-learn-from-india/1/119060.html America can learn from India], ''[[India Today]]'', November 6, 2010</ref>\n\nIn June 1975, Moynihan accepted his third offer to serve as United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a position (including a rotation as President of the [[United Nations Security Council]]) that he would only hold until February 1976.

[[Gerald Ford]] considered Indonesia, then under a military dictatorship, a key ally against [[Communism]], which was influential in East Timor. Moynihan ensured that the [[UN Security Council]] took no action against the larger nation's annexation of a small country.

In his 1993 book on nationalism, ''Pandaemonium'', he wrote that as time progressed, he began to view the [[Soviet Union]] in less ideological terms. He regarded it less as an expansionist, [[imperialist]] [[Marxist]] state, and more as a weak [[political realism|realist]] state in decline. He believed it was most motivated by self-preservation. This view would influence his thinking in subsequent years, when he became an outspoken proponent of the then-unpopular view that the Soviet Union was a [[failed state]] headed for implosion.\n\nNevertheless, Moynihan's tenure at the UN marked the beginnings of a more bellicose, [[neoconservative]] American foreign policy that turned away from Kissinger's unabashedly covert, [[d\u00e9tente]]-driven [[realpolitik]].<ref>''Moynihan's Moment'', p. 159</ref> Although it was never substantiated, Moynihan initially believed that Kissinger directed [[Ivor Richard, Baron Richard]] (then [[British Ambassador to the United Nations]]) to publicly denounce his actions as \"[[Wyatt Earp]]\" diplomacy. Demoralized, Moynihan resigned from what he would subsequently characterize as an \"abbreviated posting\" in February 1976. In ''Pandaemonium'', Moynihan expounded upon this decision, maintaining that he was \"something of an embarrassment to my own government, and fairly soon left before I was fired.\"\n\n===Career in the Senate===\nIn November 1976, Moynihan was elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] from the State of New York, defeating U.S. Representative [[Bella Abzug]], former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]], New York City Council President [[Paul O'Dwyer]] and businessman [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] in the Democratic primary, and [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] incumbent [[James L. Buckley]] in the general election. Shortly after election, Moynihan analyzed the State of New York's budget to determine whether it was paying out more in [[Federal spending and taxation across states|federal taxes than it received in spending]]. Finding that it was, he produced a yearly report known as the ''[[Fisc]]'' (from the French<ref>[http://fiscreport.org/index02a7.html?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=26 \"The History of the Fisc\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, on the Fisc Report website.

Senator [[Kit Bond]], nearing retirement in 2010, recalled with some embarrassment in a conversation on [[civility]] in political discourse that Moynihan had once \"slugged [Bond] on the Senate floor after Bond denounced an [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] Moynihan had slipped into a [[highway]] appropriations bill.

His strongly anti-Soviet views became far more moderate, as he emerged as a critic of the [[Ronald Reagan]] Administration's hawkish [[Cold War]] policies, such as support for the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Moynihan argued there was no active Soviet-backed conspiracy in [[Latin America]], or anywhere. He suggested the Soviets were suffering from massive internal problems, such as rising [[ethnic]] [[nationalism]] and a collapsing economy. In a December 21, 1986, editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Moynihan predicted the replacement on the world stage of Communist expansion with ethnic conflicts. He criticized the Reagan Administration's \"consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism \u2013 which is not in fact going on.\" In a September 8, 1990, letter to [[Erwin Griswold]], Moynihan wrote: \"I have one purpose left in life; or at least in the Senate. It is to try to sort out what would be involved in reconstituting the American government in the aftermath of the cold war.

He said of the procedure: \"I think this is just too close to [[infanticide]]. A child has been born and it has exited the [[uterus]]. What on Earth is this procedure?\" Earlier in his career in the Senate, Moynihan had expressed his annoyance with the adamantly pro-choice interest groups petitioning him and others on the issue. He challenged them saying, \"you women are ruining the Democratic Party with your insistence on [[abortion]].\"<ref>''Human Life Review'', Summer 2003, page 13.</ref><ref>Chapter4: Too close to infanticide [https://books.google.com/books?id=WS7IqNEKUFQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT51#v=onepage GB link] at [[Google Books]]</ref>\n\nMoynihan broke with orthodox liberal positions of his party on numerous occasions. As chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]] in the 1990s, he strongly opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s proposal to expand health care coverage to all Americans. Seeking to focus the debate over health insurance on the financing of health care, Moynihan garnered controversy by stating that \"there is no health care crisis in this country.\"\n\nOn other issues though, he was much more progressive. He voted against the [[death penalty]]; the [[flag desecration amendment]];<ref>{{USBill|106|SJ|14}}, 106th Congress, 2nd Session, [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&session=2&vote=00048#position Record Vote Number: 48]</ref> the [[balanced budget amendment]], the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]]; the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]; the [[Communications Decency Act]]; and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. He was critical of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a [[flat tax]]. Moynihan also voted against authorization of the [[Gulf War]]. Despite his earlier writings on the negative effects of the welfare state, he ended by voting against [[welfare reform]] in 1996, a bill that removed unemployment benefits. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who crossed party lines to support it.\n\n==Public speaker==\nMoynihan was a popular public speaker with a distinctly [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] style. He had some peculiar mannerisms of speech, in the form of slight stuttering and drawn-out vowels for emphasis. Linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] compared his speaking style to that of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|title=William F.

Moynihan chaired the Commission, which studied and made recommendations on the \"culture of secrecy\" that pervaded the United States government and its intelligence community for 80 years, beginning with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], and made recommendations on the statutory regulation of classified information.\n\nThe Commission's findings and recommendations were presented to the President in 1997. As part of the effort, Moynihan secured release from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] of its classified [[Venona]] file. This file documents the FBI's joint [[counterintelligence]] investigation, with the United States [[Arlington Hall|Signals Intelligence Service]], into Soviet espionage within the United States. Much of the information had been collected and classified as secret information for over 50 years.\n\nAfter release of the information, Moynihan authored ''Secrecy: The American Experience''<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300080794|title= Secrecy: The American Experience |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref> where he discussed the impact government secrecy has had on the domestic politics of America for the past half century, and how myths and suspicion created an unnecessary partisan chasm.\n\n==Career as scholar==\nAs a [[public intellectual]], Moynihan published articles on urban ethnic politics and on the problems of the poor in cities of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] in numerous publications, including ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and ''[[The Public Interest]]''.\n\nMoynihan coined the term \"professionalization of reform,\" by which the government bureaucracy thinks up problems for government to solve rather than simply responding to problems identified elsewhere.<ref>''The Public Interest'', volume 1, Issue 1 1965</ref>\n\nIn 1983, he was awarded the [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] Award given by the [[American Political Science Association]] \"in recognition of notable public service by a political scientist.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} He wrote 19 books, leading his personal friend, columnist and former professor [[George F.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he represented [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[United States Senate]] and served as an adviser to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]. \n\nBorn in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], Moynihan moved at a young age to [[New York City]]. Following a stint in the navy, he earned a Ph.D. in history from [[Tufts University]]. He worked on the staff of New York Governor [[W. Averell Harriman]] before joining President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration in 1961. He served as an Assistant Secretary of Labor under Kennedy and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], devoting much of his time to the [[War on Poverty]]. In 1965, he published the controversial [[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action|Moynihan Report]]. Moynihan left the Johnson administration in 1965 and became a professor at [[Harvard University]].\n\nIn 1969, he accepted Nixon's offer to serve as an Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and he was elevated to the position of [[Counselor to the President]] later that year. He left the administration at the end of 1970, and accepted appointment as [[United States Ambassador to India]] in 1973. He accepted President [[Gerald Ford]]'s appointment to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1975, holding that position until 1976, when he won election to the Senate.\n\nMoynihan represented New York in the Senate from 1977 to 2001. He served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment Committee]] from 1992 to 1993 and as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] from 1993 to 1995. He also led the [[Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy|Moynihan Secrecy Commission]], which studied the regulation of classified information. He emerged as a strong critic of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s foreign policy and opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]]. He frequently broke with [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] positions, but opposed welfare reform in the 1990s. He also voted against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the Congressional authorization for the [[Gulf War]]. He is tied with [[Jacob K.

Moynihan briefly worked as a [[longshoreman]] before entering the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), which at that time provided free [[higher education]] to city residents.\n\nFollowing a year at CCNY, Moynihan joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1944. He was assigned to the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] at [[Middlebury College]] from 1944 to 1945 and then enrolled as a [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] student at [[Tufts University]], where he received an undergraduate degree in naval science in 1946. He completed active service as [[Gun|gunnery officer]] of the [[USS Quirinus (ARL-39)|USS ''Quirinus'']] at the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] in 1947.

During this period, Moynihan struggled with writer's block and began to fashion himself as a \"[[dandy]],\" cultivating \"a taste for [[Savile Row tailoring|Savile Row]] suits, rococo conversational riffs and Churchillian oratory\" even as he maintained that \"nothing and no one at LSE ever disposed me to be anything but a New York Democrat who had some friends who worked on the docks and drank beer after work.\"<ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism|author=Troy, G.|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199920303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyOoaxtz6KoC&pg=PA44|page=44|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\nHe ultimately received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[history]] (with a dissertation on the relationship between the United States and the [[International Labour Organization]]) from the Fletcher School in 1961 while serving as an assistant professor of [[political science]] and director of a government research project centered around [[Averell Harriman]]'s papers at [[Syracuse University]]'s [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]].<ref name=\"proquest\">{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302084811/|title=The United States and the International Labor Organization, 1889\u20131934 \u2013 ProQuest|accessdate=2017-01-26|via=ProQuest}}</ref><ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\">{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002530045|publisher=search.marquiswhoswho.com|title=Marquis Biographies Online|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>\n\n==Political career and return to academia==\nMoynihan's political career started in the 1950s, when he served as a member of New York Governor [[Averell Harriman]]'s staff in a variety of positions (including speechwriter and acting secretary to the governor). He met his future wife, Elizabeth (Liz) Brennan, who also worked on Harriman's staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/27/archives/elizabeth-moynihan-leaves-the-sidelines-for-an-active-role-in.html|title=Elizabeth Moynihan Leaves the Sidelines for an Active Role in Senate Race|website=New York Times}}</ref>\n\nThis period ended following Harriman's loss to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the 1958 general election. Moynihan returned to academia, serving as a lecturer for brief periods at [[Russell Sage College]] (1957\u20131958) and the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] (1959) before taking a tenure-track position at Syracuse University (1959\u20131961). During this period, Moynihan was a delegate to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] as part of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s delegate pool.\n\n===Kennedy and Johnson Administrations; controversy over the War on Poverty===\nMoynihan first served in the Kennedy administration as special (1961\u20131962) and executive (1962\u20131963) assistant to [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretaries]] [[Arthur J. Goldberg]] and [[W. Willard Wirtz]]. In 1962, he authored the directive \"Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture\", which discouraged use of an official style for [[Federal building|federal buildings,]] and has been credited with enabling \"a wide ranging set of innovative public building projects\" in subsequent decades, including the [[San Francisco Federal Building]] and the [[United States Courthouse (Austin, Texas, 2012)|United States Courthouse in Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/news/article/150182232/new-executive-order-could-make-classical-architecture-the-preferred-and-default-style-for-america-s-public-buildings|title=New executive order could make classical architecture \"the preferred and default style\" for America's public buildings|last=Pacheco|first=Antonio|date=2020-02-04|website=Archinect|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\nHe was then appointed as [[United States Department of Labor|Assistant Secretary of Labor]] for Policy, Planning and Research, serving from 1963 to 1965 under Kennedy and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In this capacity, he did not have operational responsibilities. He devoted his time to trying to formulate national policy for what would become the [[War on Poverty]]. His small staff included [[Ralph Nader]].\n\nThey took inspiration from historian [[Stanley Elkins]]'s ''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' (1959). Elkins essentially contended that [[slavery]] had made black Americans dependent on the dominant society, and that such dependence still existed a century later after the American Civil War. Moynihan and his staff believed that government must go beyond simply ensuring that members of minority groups have the same rights as the majority and must also \"act affirmatively\" in order to counter the problem of historic discrimination.\n\nMoynihan's research of Labor Department data demonstrated that even as fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments in certain parts of the United States.\n\nMoynihan issued his research in 1965 under the title ''[[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action]]'', now commonly known as ''The Moynihan Report''. Moynihan's report<ref name=\"dol\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|publisher=dol.gov|title=U.S. Department of Labor \u2013 History \u2013 The Negro Family \u2013 The Case for National Action (Moynihan's War on Poverty report)|accessdate=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120102028/https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|archive-date=2017-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> fueled a debate over the proper course for government to take with regard to the economic underclass, especially blacks.

Kennedy]]. For this reason he was not favored by then-President Johnson, and he left the Johnson Administration in 1965. He ran for office in the Democratic Party primary for the presidency of the [[New York City Council]], a position now known as the [[New York City Public Advocate]]. However, he was defeated by Queens District Attorney [[Frank D. O'Connor]].\n\nDuring this transitional period, Moynihan maintained an academic affiliation as a fellow at [[Wesleyan University]]'s Center for Advanced Studies from 1964 to 1967. In 1966, he was appointed to the faculties of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education]] and [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Graduate School of Public Administration]] as a full professor of education and urban politics. After commencing a second extended leave because of his public service in 1973, his faculty line was transferred to the University's Department of Government, where he remained until 1977. From 1966 to 1969, he also held a secondary administrative appointment as director of the [[Harvard\u2013MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]].<ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\"/> With turmoil and [[riots]] in the United States, Moynihan, \"a national board member of [[Americans for Democratic Action|ADA]] incensed at the radicalism of the current [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] and [[Black Power]] movements\", decided to \"call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives,\"<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]]. [https://www.mises.org/story/1842 Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal], ''[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]''</ref> and wrote that the next administration would have to be able to unite the nation again.\n\n===Nixon Administration===\nConnecting with [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968, Moynihan joined the [[Executive Office of the President]] in January 1969 as Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and executive secretary of the Council of Urban Affairs (later the Urban Affairs Council), a forerunner of the [[Domestic Policy Council]] envisaged as an analog to the [[United States National Security Council]]. As one of the few people in Nixon's inner circle who had done academic research related to social policies, he was very influential in the early months of the administration. However, his disdain for \"traditional budget-conscious positions\" (including his proposed Family Assistance Plan, a \"[[negative income tax]] or [[guaranteed minimum income]]\" for families that met work requirements or demonstrated that they were seeking work which ultimately stalled in the Senate despite prefiguring the later [[Supplemental Security Income]] program) led to frequent clashes (belying their unwavering mutual respect) with Nixon's principal domestic policy advisor, conservative economist and [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet-rank]] [[Counselor to the President]] [[Arthur F. Burns]].<ref name=\"bloomberg\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-28/when-nixon-listened-to-liberal-moynihan|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=When Nixon Listened to Liberal Moynihan \u2013 Bloomberg View|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref>\n\nWhile formulating Nixon's [[Guaranteed minimum income|Guaranteed Annual Income]] (GAI) proposal, Moynihan conducted significant discussions concerning a [[Basic Income Guarantee]] with [[Russell B. Long]] and [[Louis O. Kelso]].\n\nAlthough Moynihan was promoted to Counselor to the President for Urban Affairs with Cabinet rank shortly after Burns was nominated by Nixon to serve as [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] in October 1969, it was concurrently announced that Moynihan would be returning to Harvard (a stipulation of his leave from the University) at the end of 1970. Accordingly, operational oversight of the Urban Affairs Council was given to Moynihan's nominal successor as Domestic Policy Assistant, former [[White House Counsel]] [[John Ehrlichman]]. This decision was instigated by [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H.R.

The relationship between the two countries was at a low point following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Ambassador Moynihan was alarmed that two great democracies were cast as antagonists, and set out to fix things. He proposed that part of the burdensome debt be written off, part used to pay for US embassy expenses in India, and the remaining converted into Indian [[Indian rupee|rupees]] to fund an Indo-US cultural and educational exchange program that lasted for a quarter century. On February 18, 1974, he presented to the Government of India a check for 16,640,000,000 rupees, then equivalent to $2,046,700,000, which was the greatest amount paid by a single check in the history of banking.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/11/moynihan-letters-201011 An American Original], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', October 2010</ref> The \"Rupee Deal\" is logged in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the world's largest check, written by Ambassador Moynihan to Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]].<ref>[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/america-can-learn-from-india/1/119060.html America can learn from India], ''[[India Today]]'', November 6, 2010</ref>\n\nIn June 1975, Moynihan accepted his third offer to serve as United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a position (including a rotation as President of the [[United Nations Security Council]]) that he would only hold until February 1976. Under President [[Gerald Ford]], Ambassador Moynihan took a hardline [[anti-communist]] stance, in line with the agenda of the White House at the time.

[[Gerald Ford]] considered Indonesia, then under a military dictatorship, a key ally against [[Communism]], which was influential in East Timor. Moynihan ensured that the [[UN Security Council]] took no action against the larger nation's annexation of a small country. The Indonesian invasion caused the deaths of 100,000\u2013200,000 Timorese through violence, illness, and hunger.<ref name=CAVR>[http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/Brief.htm Chega!

The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. This task was given to me, and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ON2TPWZkiCIC ''A Dangerous Place''], Little Brown, 1980, p. 247</ref>}}\n\nLater, he said he had defended a \"shameless\" [[Cold War]] policy toward East Timor.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/pandaemoniumethn00moyn ''Pandaemonium: Ethnicity in International Politics''], Oxford University Press 1993, page 153</ref>\n\nMoynihan's thinking began to change during his tenure at the UN. In his 1993 book on nationalism, ''Pandaemonium'', he wrote that as time progressed, he began to view the [[Soviet Union]] in less ideological terms. He regarded it less as an expansionist, [[imperialist]] [[Marxist]] state, and more as a weak [[political realism|realist]] state in decline. He believed it was most motivated by self-preservation. This view would influence his thinking in subsequent years, when he became an outspoken proponent of the then-unpopular view that the Soviet Union was a [[failed state]] headed for implosion.\n\nNevertheless, Moynihan's tenure at the UN marked the beginnings of a more bellicose, [[neoconservative]] American foreign policy that turned away from Kissinger's unabashedly covert, [[d\u00e9tente]]-driven [[realpolitik]].<ref>''Moynihan's Moment'', p. 159</ref> Although it was never substantiated, Moynihan initially believed that Kissinger directed [[Ivor Richard, Baron Richard]] (then [[British Ambassador to the United Nations]]) to publicly denounce his actions as \"[[Wyatt Earp]]\" diplomacy. Demoralized, Moynihan resigned from what he would subsequently characterize as an \"abbreviated posting\" in February 1976. In ''Pandaemonium'', Moynihan expounded upon this decision, maintaining that he was \"something of an embarrassment to my own government, and fairly soon left before I was fired.\"\n\n===Career in the Senate===\nIn November 1976, Moynihan was elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] from the State of New York, defeating U.S. Representative [[Bella Abzug]], former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]], New York City Council President [[Paul O'Dwyer]] and businessman [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] in the Democratic primary, and [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] incumbent [[James L. Buckley]] in the general election. Shortly after election, Moynihan analyzed the State of New York's budget to determine whether it was paying out more in [[Federal spending and taxation across states|federal taxes than it received in spending]]. Finding that it was, he produced a yearly report known as the ''[[Fisc]]'' (from the French<ref>[http://fiscreport.org/index02a7.html?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=26 \"The History of the Fisc\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, on the Fisc Report website.

A. Farber]], Moynihan stated the possibility of Congress having to become involved with securing press freedom and that the Senate should be aware of the issue's seriousness.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-moynihan-sees-need-for-bill-to-guarantee-freedom.html|title=Moynihan Sees Need For Bill to Guarantee Freedom of the Press|date=August 8, 1978|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nMoynihan's strong advocacy for New York's interests in the Senate, buttressed by the ''Fisc'' reports and recalling his strong advocacy for US positions in the UN, did at least on one occasion allow his advocacy to escalate into a physical attack. Senator [[Kit Bond]], nearing retirement in 2010, recalled with some embarrassment in a conversation on [[civility]] in political discourse that Moynihan had once \"slugged [Bond] on the Senate floor after Bond denounced an [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] Moynihan had slipped into a [[highway]] appropriations bill. Some months later Moynihan apologized, and the two occasionally would relax in Moynihan's office after a long day to discuss their shared interest in [[urban renewal]] over a glass of port.\"<ref>[http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2010/06/02/pages/3628/index.xml?page=2& \"Uncivil society: Jim Leach '64 leads an effort to restore respectful discourse to our national life, but it's tough going\"], by Mark F.

Retrieved 2010-06-17.</ref>\n\nMoynihan continued to be interested in foreign policy as a Senator, sitting on the Select Committee on Intelligence. His strongly anti-Soviet views became far more moderate, as he emerged as a critic of the [[Ronald Reagan]] Administration's hawkish [[Cold War]] policies, such as support for the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Moynihan argued there was no active Soviet-backed conspiracy in [[Latin America]], or anywhere. He suggested the Soviets were suffering from massive internal problems, such as rising [[ethnic]] [[nationalism]] and a collapsing economy. In a December 21, 1986, editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Moynihan predicted the replacement on the world stage of Communist expansion with ethnic conflicts. He criticized the Reagan Administration's \"consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism \u2013 which is not in fact going on.\" In a September 8, 1990, letter to [[Erwin Griswold]], Moynihan wrote: \"I have one purpose left in life; or at least in the Senate. It is to try to sort out what would be involved in reconstituting the American government in the aftermath of the cold war. Huge changes took place, some of which we hardly notice.\"<ref>[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]].

He said of the procedure: \"I think this is just too close to [[infanticide]]. A child has been born and it has exited the [[uterus]]. What on Earth is this procedure?\" Earlier in his career in the Senate, Moynihan had expressed his annoyance with the adamantly pro-choice interest groups petitioning him and others on the issue. He challenged them saying, \"you women are ruining the Democratic Party with your insistence on [[abortion]].\"<ref>''Human Life Review'', Summer 2003, page 13.</ref><ref>Chapter4: Too close to infanticide [https://books.google.com/books?id=WS7IqNEKUFQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT51#v=onepage GB link] at [[Google Books]]</ref>\n\nMoynihan broke with orthodox liberal positions of his party on numerous occasions. As chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]] in the 1990s, he strongly opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s proposal to expand health care coverage to all Americans. Seeking to focus the debate over health insurance on the financing of health care, Moynihan garnered controversy by stating that \"there is no health care crisis in this country.\"\n\nOn other issues though, he was much more progressive. He voted against the [[death penalty]]; the [[flag desecration amendment]];<ref>{{USBill|106|SJ|14}}, 106th Congress, 2nd Session, [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&session=2&vote=00048#position Record Vote Number: 48]</ref> the [[balanced budget amendment]], the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]]; the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]; the [[Communications Decency Act]]; and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. He was critical of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a [[flat tax]]. Moynihan also voted against authorization of the [[Gulf War]]. Despite his earlier writings on the negative effects of the welfare state, he ended by voting against [[welfare reform]] in 1996, a bill that removed unemployment benefits. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who crossed party lines to support it.\n\n==Public speaker==\nMoynihan was a popular public speaker with a distinctly [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] style. He had some peculiar mannerisms of speech, in the form of slight stuttering and drawn-out vowels for emphasis. Linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] compared his speaking style to that of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|title=William F.

Moynihan chaired the Commission, which studied and made recommendations on the \"culture of secrecy\" that pervaded the United States government and its intelligence community for 80 years, beginning with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], and made recommendations on the statutory regulation of classified information.\n\nThe Commission's findings and recommendations were presented to the President in 1997. As part of the effort, Moynihan secured release from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] of its classified [[Venona]] file. This file documents the FBI's joint [[counterintelligence]] investigation, with the United States [[Arlington Hall|Signals Intelligence Service]], into Soviet espionage within the United States. Much of the information had been collected and classified as secret information for over 50 years.\n\nAfter release of the information, Moynihan authored ''Secrecy: The American Experience''<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300080794|title= Secrecy: The American Experience |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref> where he discussed the impact government secrecy has had on the domestic politics of America for the past half century, and how myths and suspicion created an unnecessary partisan chasm.\n\n==Career as scholar==\nAs a [[public intellectual]], Moynihan published articles on urban ethnic politics and on the problems of the poor in cities of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] in numerous publications, including ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and ''[[The Public Interest]]''.\n\nMoynihan coined the term \"professionalization of reform,\" by which the government bureaucracy thinks up problems for government to solve rather than simply responding to problems identified elsewhere.<ref>''The Public Interest'', volume 1, Issue 1 1965</ref>\n\nIn 1983, he was awarded the [[Hubert H.
