Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations into her teens. Following high school graduation, she worked in a local bank and completed night classes at a college-level banking institute. After several years, Seely and several friends drove cross-country and moved to southern California. It was on the west coast that she rediscovered country music. Originally hired as a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs at the same label. Many of these songs would be recorded later by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a career. In Nashville, Seely recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" for [[Monument Records]] and had major success. She followed it with several more hits hits during the 1960s, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Seely collaborated on [[duet]] recordings with [[Jack Greene]]. The pair toured and had hits through the 1970s, including their biggest single \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" (1970). Seely had further solo success during this time with the hits \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after a sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely started taking a more diverse career approach as she entered the 1980s. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays, and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'' which featured duets with several recording artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that incorporated [[bluegrass music]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of weekly broadcast of a [[Sirius XM]] country music radio program. \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A photograph of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]].

Leo Seely was a farmer and was employed by the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed signing with her children while baking.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would often spend time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also used to bring her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the venue, the family often watched performances by country artists [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]]. Because of her short height and nonadjustable microphone stands, Seely had to stand on top of wooden beverage containers to sing.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/>{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} At age 16, Seely became a regular performer on [[WICU (AM)|WICU]], a local television station in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"PBS\"/> She recounted being ridiculed by her high school peers in choosing to sing country music. \"They all made fun of me because I sang country. I grew up poor and in those days calling someone 'country' was a put-down,\" she said in 2003.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} In high school, Seely was a [[cheerleading|cheerleader]] and an [[honors student]]. In 1958, she graduated from Townville High School at age eighteen.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} \n\nInstead of attending college, Seely took a job at the Titusville Trust Company as a [[stenographer]]. She was later promoted to a secretarial position.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}}{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} Rather than taking collegiate-level courses, she enrolled at the [[American Bankers Association|American Institute of Banking]] and took night classes regularly.<ref name=\"Meadville\"/> She later reflected that having background knowledge in finance and law helped her better understand the music business.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} According to Seely, she was becoming increasingly frustrated with Pennsylvania winters. One winter day, her car got caught in a snow bank and had to walk home. \"I decided right then and there that I was ready to make a change,\" she recounted on her website.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}}\n\n==Career==\n===Success of \"Don't Touch Me\"===\n[[File:Jeannie Seely.jpg|thumb|upright|Seeley in 2006]]\nUpon arriving in Nashville, she was hired to fill in for [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]] on [[Porter Wagoner]]'s road show and television series. Seely was also looking for a record label during this time, having been initially turned down by every record label in town; however Monument Records ultimately offered her a recording contract in early 1966. She was recording in the studio by March of that year. One of the first songs recorded was her husband's composition, \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\". Seely's recording became her first major chart success, peaking at the No. 2 position on the ''Billboard'' country singles charts, and stayed there for three weeks; on all the other major country charts (Cashbox, Record World), the song reached No. 1, and remained on the charts for over five months. The song climbed into the lower regions of the pop singles charts, peaking at No. 85. Because of the success of \"Don't Touch Me\", Seely was invited to perform on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' that June. She also won Billboard's, Cashbox's, and Record World's \"Most Promising Female Artist Award\". In March 1967, Seely won the Grammy award for ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"Don't Touch Me\", becoming only the third female country singer to win the award. That year, an album was released, titled ''[[The Seely Style]]'', which featured \"Don't Touch Me\". In September 1967, Seely joined the Grand Ole Opry, a lifelong dream of hers, where she became only the third woman to celebrate her fiftieth anniversary as a member on September 16, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|title=Members of the Grand Ole Opry: Jeannie Seely at Opry.com|website=Opry.com|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922052504/http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|archivedate=December 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"In 1966, Seely's '[[Don't Touch Me]]' took country women's sexuality from the [[honky-tonk]] into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards.

The song made the top 15 on the country charts at No. 15. The next year, Seely had two other top 40 country hits from her next album, ''Thanks! Hank'', one of which hit the Top 20, called \"A Wanderin' Man\". For the rest of the decade, Seely enjoyed only one other top 10 song, titled \"I'll Love You More (Than You'll Ever Need)\" in 1968. Another album released in 1968, titled ''Little Things'', produced a top-30 hit, \"Welcome Home to Nothing\". Seely stayed under Monument until late 1968, before switching to Decca records in 1969.\n\nFor several years she was married to [[Hank Cochran]], the writer of such songs as \"[[Make the World Go Away]]\", \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\", \"The Chair\", and \"Ocean Front Property\". The marriage \u2013 the first for Seely but the fourth for Cochran \u2013 ended in a divorce.<ref name=webbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeannieseely.com/biography.cfm|title=Jeannie Seely Official Internet Home Page|website=Jeannieseely.com|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Success with Jack Greene in the 1970s and revitalizing her solo career===\nWhile moving over to Decca in 1969, Seely teamed up with fellow country star [[Jack Greene]]. Together they recorded a single (\"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\") and an album (''Jack Greene/Jeannie Seely''). Their single hit No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1970 and No. 1 on all the other major country charts, making the duo one of the most successful duet pairings of the early 1970s. Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''. Two singles from the album hit the top 20 on the country charts, starting with \"Much Oblige\", followed by \"What in the World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\". The duo has been nominated for the [[CMA Awards]]' ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' as well as various Grammy award nominations. Together they toured for ten years performing everywhere from New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] to London's [[Wembley Arena]], most often in country music \"package shows\".\n\nA long list of artists \u2013 including [[Dottie West]], Norma Jean, [[Tex Williams]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], Jack Greene, [[Connie Smith]], and [[Doyle Lawson]] \u2013 have recorded compositions written by Seely. In 1972, [[Faron Young]] took \"Leavin\u2019 And Sayin\u2019 Goodbye\" to the No. 1 position in \"Record World\" on October 23, 1971, earning Seely a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriter's Award.<ref name=webbio/>\n\nAfter being successfully paired with Greene, Seely saw the time to take note to revitalizing her career as a solo artist. In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''[[Life's Highway]]'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood. Seely and her dog, Cheyenne, sought refuge at a friend's.\n\nCurrently, she is a DJ on Willie Nelson's XM Radio station Ch 59.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Seely married attorney Gene Ward.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Jeannie Seely released a new album, her first in 6 years, titled ''\"[[Written in Song]]''\".

[[country music]] singer, songwriter, and record producer. She also has several acting credits and published a book. Seely notably found success with the [[Grammy Award]]-winning hit \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\" (1966).

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations into her teens. Following high school graduation, she worked in a local bank and completed night classes at a college-level banking institute. After several years, Seely and several friends drove cross-country and moved to southern California. It was on the west coast that she rediscovered country music. Originally hired as a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs at the same label. Many of these songs would be recorded later by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a career. In Nashville, Seely recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" for [[Monument Records]] and had major success. She followed it with several more hits hits during the 1960s, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nStarting in the late 1960s, Seely collaborated on [[duet]] recordings with [[Jack Greene]]. The pair toured and had hits through the 1970s, including their biggest single \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\" (1970). Seely had further solo success during this time with the hits \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after a sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely started taking a more diverse career approach as she entered the 1980s. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays, and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'' which featured duets with several recording artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that incorporated [[bluegrass music]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of weekly broadcast of a [[Sirius XM]] country music radio program. \n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A photograph of [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]].

Leo Seely was a farmer and was employed by the Titusville Steel Mill. On weekends, he worked at local square dances and played the [[fiddle]]. Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed signing with her children while baking.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would often spend time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also used to bring her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the venue, the family often watched performances by country artists [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]]. Because of her short height and nonadjustable microphone stands, Seely had to stand on top of wooden beverage containers to sing.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/>{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} At age 16, Seely became a regular performer on [[WICU (AM)|WICU]], a local television station in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"PBS\"/> She recounted being ridiculed by her high school peers in choosing to sing country music. \"They all made fun of me because I sang country. I grew up poor and in those days calling someone 'country' was a put-down,\" she said in 2003.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} In high school, Seely was a [[cheerleading|cheerleader]] and an [[honors student]]. In 1958, she graduated from Townville High School at age eighteen.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} \n\nInstead of attending college, Seely took a job at the Titusville Trust Company as a [[stenographer]]. She was later promoted to a secretarial position.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}}{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} Rather than taking collegiate-level courses, she enrolled at the [[American Bankers Association|American Institute of Banking]] and took night classes regularly.<ref name=\"Meadville\"/> She later reflected that having background knowledge in finance and law helped her better understand the music business.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}} According to Seely, she was becoming increasingly frustrated with Pennsylvania winters. One winter day, her car got caught in a snow bank and had to walk home. \"I decided right then and there that I was ready to make a change,\" she recounted on her website.{{sfn|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=2}}\n\n==Career==\n===Success of \"Don't Touch Me\"===\n[[File:Jeannie Seely.jpg|thumb|upright|Seeley in 2006]]\nUpon arriving in Nashville, she was hired to fill in for [[Norma Jean (singer)|Norma Jean]] on [[Porter Wagoner]]'s road show and television series. Seely was also looking for a record label during this time, having been initially turned down by every record label in town; however Monument Records ultimately offered her a recording contract in early 1966. She was recording in the studio by March of that year. One of the first songs recorded was her husband's composition, \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\". Seely's recording became her first major chart success, peaking at the No. 2 position on the ''Billboard'' country singles charts, and stayed there for three weeks; on all the other major country charts (Cashbox, Record World), the song reached No. 1, and remained on the charts for over five months. The song climbed into the lower regions of the pop singles charts, peaking at No. 85. Because of the success of \"Don't Touch Me\", Seely was invited to perform on the ''Grand Ole Opry'' that June. She also won Billboard's, Cashbox's, and Record World's \"Most Promising Female Artist Award\". In March 1967, Seely won the Grammy award for ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"Don't Touch Me\", becoming only the third female country singer to win the award. That year, an album was released, titled ''[[The Seely Style]]'', which featured \"Don't Touch Me\". In September 1967, Seely joined the Grand Ole Opry, a lifelong dream of hers, where she became only the third woman to celebrate her fiftieth anniversary as a member on September 16, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|title=Members of the Grand Ole Opry: Jeannie Seely at Opry.com|website=Opry.com|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922052504/http://www.opry.com/artist/jeannie-seely|archivedate=December 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quote=\"In 1966, Seely's '[[Don't Touch Me]]' took country women's sexuality from the [[honky-tonk]] into the bedroom even though it didn't end up there, and the on-again off-again ache in her voice retained its savor afterwards.

The song made the top 15 on the country charts at No. 15. The next year, Seely had two other top 40 country hits from her next album, ''Thanks! Hank'', one of which hit the Top 20, called \"A Wanderin' Man\". For the rest of the decade, Seely enjoyed only one other top 10 song, titled \"I'll Love You More (Than You'll Ever Need)\" in 1968. Another album released in 1968, titled ''Little Things'', produced a top-30 hit, \"Welcome Home to Nothing\". Seely stayed under Monument until late 1968, before switching to Decca records in 1969.\n\nFor several years she was married to [[Hank Cochran]], the writer of such songs as \"[[Make the World Go Away]]\", \"[[She's Got You]]\", \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\", \"The Chair\", and \"Ocean Front Property\". The marriage \u2013 the first for Seely but the fourth for Cochran \u2013 ended in a divorce.<ref name=webbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.jeannieseely.com/biography.cfm|title=Jeannie Seely Official Internet Home Page|website=Jeannieseely.com|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Success with Jack Greene in the 1970s and revitalizing her solo career===\nWhile moving over to Decca in 1969, Seely teamed up with fellow country star [[Jack Greene]]. Together they recorded a single (\"I Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You\") and an album (''Jack Greene/Jeannie Seely''). Their single hit No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' country charts in 1970 and No. 1 on all the other major country charts, making the duo one of the most successful duet pairings of the early 1970s. Their road shows were also successful, and the duo performed at venues from New York's Madison Square Garden to London's Wembley Arena. In 1972, they released a new album, entitled ''Two for the Show''. Two singles from the album hit the top 20 on the country charts, starting with \"Much Oblige\", followed by \"What in the World Has Gone Wrong With Our Love\". The duo has been nominated for the [[CMA Awards]]' ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' as well as various Grammy award nominations. Together they toured for ten years performing everywhere from New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] to London's [[Wembley Arena]], most often in country music \"package shows\".\n\nA long list of artists \u2013 including [[Dottie West]], Norma Jean, [[Tex Williams]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], Jack Greene, [[Connie Smith]], and [[Doyle Lawson]] \u2013 have recorded compositions written by Seely. In 1972, [[Faron Young]] took \"Leavin\u2019 And Sayin\u2019 Goodbye\" to the No. 1 position in \"Record World\" on October 23, 1971, earning Seely a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Songwriter's Award.<ref name=webbio/>\n\nAfter being successfully paired with Greene, Seely saw the time to take note to revitalizing her career as a solo artist. In 1973, Decca became MCA records. Under MCA, she recorded a new album, titled ''Can I Sleep in Your Arms/Lucky Ladies'', the name of two singles to be released by Seely between 1973 and 1974. The first single was released in 1973, which was \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\". The song was well liked by Country radio, and peaked in the top 10 at No. 6, just missing the Top 5 spot. \"Can I Sleep in Your Arms\" was originally derived from an old hobo lament titled, [[\"May I Sleep in Your Barn Tonight, Mister?\"]]. The follow-up to the top 10 came with \"Lucky Ladies\" in 1974, which came close to hitting the top 10, peaking in the top 15. \"Lucky Ladies\" was also derived from another song. Seely transformed an old Appalachian ballad titled \"[[Come All You Fair and Tender Ladies]]\" to \"Lucky Ladies\". While under MCA, Seely's material got more sexual and riskier like 1975's \"First Time\" and 1976's \"Since I Met You Boy\". In early 1977, Seely switched labels again, this time to Columbia records.\n\nAfter just getting started under a new record company, Seely was involved in a serious near-fatal automobile accident in 1977, which almost caused her career to come abruptly to an end. Because of the support of friends and family, most notably good friend [[Dottie West]], Seely was able to recover and return to touring and performing. (In August 1991, West was involved in a serious automobile accident, which would ultimately claim her life.) Today, Seely greatly misses West, and she was played by [[Cathy Worthington]] in the TV-movie about West's life in 1995, titled ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', starring [[Michele Lee]]. By late 1977, Seely's chart success was already fading from the public view. Her last record to hit the national charts came later that year, with the song \"Take Me to Bed\".\n\n===Later careers and life today===\nIn the early 1980s, Seely continued to record and perform. She served as an opening act for [[Willie Nelson]]'s road show, appeared in his film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', and recorded for the soundtrack, which eventually received a \"Platinum\" rating by the [[RIAA]]. Seely also became the first female country singer to host half-hour segments of the Grand Ole Opry, first starting in 1985, when country singer [[Del Reeves]] was caught in a snowstorm. In the late 1980s, Seely played various acting roles. She played \"Miss Mona\" in ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]'' play as well as playing [[Jean Shepard]]'s daughter and [[Lorrie Morgan]]'s mother in the country music musical ''Takin' It Home''. In 1988, she also published her own book, titled ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''. In the early 1990s, Seely continued to try new things, including playing Danny Shirley's mother in the music video for [[Confederate Railroad]]'s 1993 No. 1 hit \"Trashy Woman\". Seely has played at [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Dollywood]]\" and served as [[Brad Paisley]]'s date for the 2000 CMA awards show. [[Lorrie Morgan]] has also recorded one of Seely's compositions for her 1997 album, ''[[Shakin' Things Up]]''. Morgan credits Seely to be one of the biggest inspirations to her career, and even refers to her as a second mother.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nIn 2003, Seely appeared in the movie ''[[Changing Hearts (film)|Changing Hearts]]'' starring [[Faye Dunaway]]. Fellow country singers and friends [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Jan Howard]] also appeared in the movie. In the fall of 2003 Seely released a new album, marketed towards [[bluegrass music]] and titled ''[[Life's Highway]]'', which received high critical acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Today, Jeannie Seely still remains a member of the Grand Ole Opry and lives close by the Opry in a house by the Cumberland River that was renovated and decorated by Seely herself.\n\nOn May 3, 2010, Seely posted on her official Facebook page that she had lost her home along Nashville's Cumberland River, including car, clothes and personal possessions, as a result of the 2010 Nashville flood. Seely and her dog, Cheyenne, sought refuge at a friend's.\n\nCurrently, she is a DJ on Willie Nelson's XM Radio station Ch 59.\n\nOn November 10, 2010, Seely married attorney Gene Ward.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nOn January 13, 2017, Jeannie Seely released a new album, her first in 6 years, titled ''\"[[Written in Song]]''\". The album contains 14 tracks, all of which were written/co-written by Seely herself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/new-country-americana-alt-country-bluegrass-folk-albums-2017/#photogallery-1=4|title=New Country, Americana, Alt-Country, Bluegrass and Folk Albums Coming in 2017|website=The Boot|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref> ''Written in Song'' was chosen as one of the most anticipated albums of 2017 by both [[CMT.com]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1775143/11-new-albums-coming-in-the-new-year/|title=11 New Albums Coming in the New Year|publisher=Country Music Television|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref> and [[The Boot (website)|The Boot]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/new-albums-january-2017/|title=Vote for the Most Anticipated Album of January 2017|website=The Boot|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSeely celebrated her 50th anniversary as a member of the Grand Ole Opry on September 16, 2017<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/09/15/jeannie-seely-grand-ole-opry-elizabeth-cook/659744001/|title=Jeannie Seely celebrates 50 years as Opry member|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|accessdate=June 8, 2019}}</ref> and is one of only four living women (the others being [[Dolly Parton]], [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Connie Smith]]) to have reached this milestone.\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Jeannie Seely among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Jeannie Seely discography}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Year''' || '''Award program''' || '''Award''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 1966 || [[Billboard magazine]] || ''Most Promising New Artist'' || Won\n|-\n| 1966 || [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox magazine]] || ''Most Promising New Artist'' || Won\n|-\n| 1966 || [[Record World|Record World magazine]] || ''Most Promising New Artist'' || Won\n|-\n| 1967 || [[Grammy Awards]] || ''[[Best Female Country Vocal Performance]]'' for \"[[Don't Touch Me]]\" || Won\n|-\n| 1972 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with [[Jack Greene]]) || Nominated\n|-\n| 1973 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with Jack Greene) || Nominated\n|-\n| 1974 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with Jack Greene) || Nominated\n|-\n| 1975 || [[CMA Awards]] || ''Vocal Duo of the Year'' (with Jack Greene) || Nominated\n|-\n| 2017 || R.O.P.E || ''Entertainer of the Year'' (with [[Gene Watson]]) || Won\n|}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Oermann |first1=Robert K. |last2=Bufwack |first2=Mary A. |title=Finding Her Voice: Women in Country Music: 1800\u20132000 |date=2003 |publisher=The Country Music Press & Vanderbilt University Press |location=Nashville, TN |isbn=0-8265-1432-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/findinghervoicew0000bufw|ref={{SfnRef|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003}} }}\n* {{cite web |author=Seely, Jeannie|year=2002|url=http://jeannieseely.com/docs/Jeannie%20Seely%20Full%20Length%20Bio.pdf|title=Biography|work=Jeannie Seely|accessdate=April 10, 2020|ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.jeannieseely.com/}}\n* [http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/seely_jeannie/artist.jhtml Jeannie Seely at CMT.com]\n\n{{Jeannie Seely}}\n{{Grand Ole Opry}}\n{{Grand Ole Opry members}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seely, Jeannie}}\n[[Category:1940 births]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American female country singers]]\n[[Category:Challenge Records artists]]\n[[Category:Columbia Records artists]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Decca Records artists]]\n[[Category:Grammy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Grand Ole Opry members]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:MCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:Monument Records artists]]\n[[Category:People from Titusville, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Songwriters from Pennsylvania]]\n", "name_user": "ChrisTofu11961", "label": "safe", "comment": "updated", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeannie_Seely"}

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, there were 687 applications with portfolios to the undergraduate BSc Architecture program with only 51 spaces, giving an overall applications to enrolments ratio of 7.42%.<ref name=Admissions>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.13 Section 2.0: Academic Programs, Teaching and Learning | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> With the exception of the new Bioengineering degree at McGill, for Quebec [[CEGEP]] students, admissions to the School of Architecture represent the highest average [[R score]] of students accepted into the Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.39 Section 2.7.1 Admissions | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> however in contrast to the high average R score, the lowest score admitted can sometimes be closer to the engineering average due to the importance of the portfolio in the admissions process.\n\nThe School of Architecture has one of the highest percentages of female representation at McGill, with an overall ratio of female-to-male students of approximately 2:1. As of fall&nbsp;2019, there were 119 female and 44 male undergraduate students, and 54 female and 36 male graduate students enrolled at the School.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder. Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, and Henry F.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students.

Her story is told in [[Aelian]]'s ''Varia Storia'': orphaned in early childhood and raised by her father, Aspasia, despite living in poverty, has dreamt of meeting a noble man. As she dozes off, the girl has a vision of a dove transforming into a woman, who instructs her on how to remove a physical imperfection and restore her own beauty. In another episode, she and other courtesans are made to attend a feast hosted by [[Persian people|Persian]] regent [[Cyrus the Younger]]. During the banquet, the Persian King sets his sights on Aspasia herself and ignores the other women.<ref>Ben-Amos, D. \"Straparola: The Revolution That Was Not\".

This version is about Shahrbanou, daughter of a rich merchant and her evil stepmother and stepsister. At the end of the story, Shahrbanou marries a prince; who falls in love with Shahrbanou after seeing her in a wedding.\n\n==Literary versions==\n[[File:Giambattista Basile by Nicolaus Perrey.jpg|thumb|upright|Italian author [[Giambattista Basile]] wrote the first literary version of the story.]]\nThe first written European version of the story was published in Naples, Italy, by [[Giambattista Basile]], in his ''[[Pentamerone]]'' (1634). The story itself was set in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], at that time the most important political and cultural center of [[Southern Italy]] and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the [[Neapolitan Language|Neapolitan dialect]]. It was later retold, along with other Basile tales, by [[Charles Perrault]] in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9]]'' (1697),<ref name=\"Bottigheimer, Ruth 2008 pp. 175\"/> and by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in their folk tale collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' (1812).\n\nThe name \"Cenerentola\" comes from the Italian word \"cenere\" (ash, cinder). It has to do with the fact that servants and scullions were usually soiled with ash at that time, because of their cleaning work and also because they had to live in cold basements so they usually tried to get warm by sitting close to the fireplace.\n\n===''Cenerentola'', by Basile===\n[[Giambattista Basile]], an Italian soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled ''Lo cunto de li cunti'' (The Story of Stories), or ''[[Pentamerone]]''. It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper. It was published posthumously in 1634.\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A prince has a daughter, Zezolla (tonnie) (the Cinderella figure), who is tended by a beloved governess. The governess, with Zezolla's help, persuades the prince to marry her. The governess then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zezolla (tonnie), and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince goes to the island of Sinia, meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter, and brings back for her: a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silken napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the king hosts a ball, Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree. The king falls in love with her, but Zezolla runs away before he can find out who she is. Twice Zezolla escapes the king and his servants. The third time, the king's servant captures one of her slippers.

The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the [[pumpkin]], the fairy-godmother and the introduction of \"glass\" slippers.<ref>A modern edition of the original French text by Perrault is found in Charles Perrault, ''Contes'', ed. Marc Soriano (Paris: Flammarion, 1989), pp. 274\u201379.</ref>\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A wealthy widower has a beautiful young daughter; a girl of unparalleled kindness and sweet temper. The gentleman marries a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She has two [[false hero|daughters]], who are equally vain and selfish. The girl is forced into servitude by her stepmother, where she is made to work day and night doing menial chores. After the girl's chores are done for the day, she curls up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm. She often arises covered in cinders, giving rise to the mocking nickname \"Cinderella\" by her stepsisters. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and does not tell her father, who would have scolded her.\n:One day, the Prince invites all the young ladies in the land to a [[ball (dance)|royal ball]], planning to choose a wife. The two [[Ugly sisters|stepsisters]] gleefully plan their wardrobes for the ball, and taunt Cinderella by telling her that maids are not invited to the ball.\n:As the sisters depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her [[Fairy godmother|Fairy Godmother]] magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a [[pumpkin]] into a golden carriage, [[Mouse|mice]] into [[horse]]s, a [[rat]] into a [[coachman]], and [[lizard]]s into [[footman|footmen]]. She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before [[midnight]], when the [[magic (paranormal)|spells]] will be broken.\n:At the ball, the entire [[noble court|court]] is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Godmother. She then innocently greets the stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier, and talk of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball.\n:Another ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Godmother's help. The Prince has become even more infatuated with the mysterious woman at the ball, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards see only a simple country girl leave. The Prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belongs. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which does not disappear when the spell is broken.\n:The Prince tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the Prince arrives at Cinderella's home, the stepsisters try in vain to win him over. Cinderella asks if she may try, but the stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. Cinderella's stepfamily pleads for forgiveness, and Cinderella agrees. Cinderella had hoped her step-family would love her always.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The annotated classic fairy tales|date=2002|publisher=Norton|others=Tatar, Maria, 1945-|isbn=0393051633|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=49894271}}</ref> \n:Cinderella married the Prince as her stepsisters are married to two handsome gentlemen of the royal court.\n\nThe first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless.

These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.\"<ref name=\"pitt.edu\"/>\n\n===''Aschenputtel'', by the Brothers Grimm===\n[[File:Aschenputtel.jpg|right|thumb|[[Alexander Zick]] illustrated ''Cinderella with the doves'', inspired by the Grimms' version.]]\nAnother well-known version was recorded by the German brothers [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century. The tale is called ''\"Aschenputtel\"'' (''\"Cinderella\"'' in English translations). This version is much more intense than that of Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella's father did not die and the stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit in the golden slipper. There is no fairy godmother, but rather help comes from a wishing tree that the heroine planted on her mother's grave.  In the second edition of their collection (1819), the Grimms supplemented the original 1812 version with a coda in which the stepsisters suffer a terrible punishment for their cruelty.\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A plague infests a village, and a wealthy gentleman's wife lies on her deathbed. She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname \"Aschenputtel\" (\"Ashfool\"). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and will always go to her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.\n\n:One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.\n\n:The king decides to ordain a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in the land to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival, if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.\n\n:The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside a pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince falls in love with her and dances with her for the whole day, and when sunset comes, the prince tries to accompany her home again. However, she climbs a pear tree to escape him. The Prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel has disappeared. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel loses track of time, and when she runs away one of her golden slippers sticks on that pitch. The prince proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.\n\n:The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. The sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes in order to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two doves from Heaven tell the Prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel in order to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that they keep a kitchen-maid in the house&nbsp;\u2013 omitting to mention that she is his own daughter&nbsp;\u2013 and the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing herself, and when she puts on the slipper, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the ball.\n\n:In a coda added in the second edition of 1819, during Aschenputtel's wedding, as she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, (they had hoped to worm their way into her favour), the doves fly down and strike the two stepsisters' eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. When the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her prince march out of the church, the doves fly again, striking the remaining eyes of the two evil sisters blind, a punishment they had to endure for the rest of their lives.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19068/19068-h/19068-h.htm#illus-135 Aschenputtel], included in ''Household Stories'' by the Brothers Grimm, translated by Lucy Crane, at [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\nAschenputtel's relationship with her father in this version is ambiguous; [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s version states that the absent father is dominated by his second wife, explaining why he does not prevent the abuse of his daughter. However, the father in this tale plays an active role in several scenes, and it is not explained why he tolerates the mistreatment of his child. He also describes Aschenputtel as his \"first wife's child\" and not his own.\n\n==Plot variations and alternative tellings==\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones Cinderella.jpg|thumb|''Cinderella'' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], 1863, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]\n[[File:CinderAdelphi.jpg|thumb|right|Pantomime at the Adelphi]]\n[[File:Cinderella (1911).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|''Cinderella'' (1911)]]\n\n===Villains===\nIn some versions, her father plays an active role in the humiliation of his daughter; in others, he is secondary to his new wife, Cinderella's stepmother; in some versions, especially the popular [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 Disney film]], Cinderella's father has died and so has Cinderella's mother.\n\nAlthough many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type [[Antti Aarne|510A]] is a female persecutor: in ''[[Fair, Brown and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Finette Cendron]]'', the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen. In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her. Of this type (510B) are ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]'', ''[[Catskin]]'', All-Kinds-of-Fur, and ''[[Allerleirauh]]'', and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there.<ref>Heidi Anne Heiner, \"[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/donkeyskin/other.html Tales Similar to Donkeyskin]\"</ref> In ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]'', the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.\n\nIn ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', [[Gioachino Rossini]] inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is oppressed by her [[Stepfamily#stepfathers|stepfather]]. (This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B.) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' [[dowry|dowries]] larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry. Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.<ref>[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', p 213-4 {{ISBN|0-374-15901-7}}</ref>\n\n===Ball, Ballgown, and Curfew===\nThe number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three. The [[fairy godmother]] is Perrault's own addition to the tale.<ref>Jane Yolen, p 23, ''Touch Magic'' {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}</ref> The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]]'s version is her dead mother. Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as ''The Cinder Maid'', collected by [[Joseph Jacobs]], and the Finnish ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''. Playwright [[James Lapine]] incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical ''[[Into the Woods]]''. [[Giambattista Basile]]'s ''[[Cenerentola]]'' combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]'', ''[[Rushen Coatie]]'', ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'', ''[[The Story of Tam and Cam]]'', or ''[[The Sharp Grey Sheep]]''\u2014these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in ''[[The Golden Slipper]]'', a fish aids her after she puts it in water. In \"The Anklet\", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball. [[Gioachino Rossini]], having agreed to do an opera based on ''Cinderella'' if he could omit all magical elements, wrote ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor.\n\nThe midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.<ref>Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 116 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the gathering need not be a ball; several variants on Cinderella, such as ''Katie Woodencloak'' and ''The Golden Slipper'' have her attend church.\n\nIn the three-ball version, Cinderella keeps a close watch on the time the first two nights and is able to leave without difficulty. However, on the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] (or only) night, she loses track of the time and must flee the castle before her disguise vanishes. In her haste, she loses a glass slipper which the prince finds\u2014or else the prince has carefully had her exit tarred, so as to catch her, and the slipper is caught in it.\n\n===The identifying item===\nThe glass slipper is unique to [[Charles Perrault]]'s version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]], [[German language|German]]: ''Aschenbroedel'' and ''Aschenputtel'', for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella's identity. In Rossini's opera \"''[[La Cenerentola]]''\" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]'' the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers. Some interpreters, perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's \"glass slipper\" (''pantoufle de verre'') had been a \"squirrel fur slipper\" (''pantoufle de [[vair]]'') in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words; however, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 28, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>  The [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 Disney adaptation]] takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on, leaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity.\n\nAnother interpretation of verre/vair (glass/fur) suggested a sexual element\u2014the Prince was 'trying on' the 'fur slipper' (vagina) of the maidens in the kingdom, as a '[[Droit du seigneur]]' right of sexual possession of his subjects. The disguised Cinderella's 'fur slipper' was of unique appeal to the Prince who sought her thereafter through sexual congress (a variety of sources including Joan Gould).\n\nThe translation of the story into cultures with different standards of beauty has left the significance of Cinderella's shoe size unclear, and resulted in the implausibility of Cinderella's feet being of a unique size for no particular reason. Humorous retellings of the story sometimes use the twist of having the shoes turn out to also fit somebody completely unsuitable, such as an amorous old crone. In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Witches Abroad]]'', the witches accuse another witch of manipulating the events because it was a common shoe size, and she could only ensure that the right woman put it on if she already knew where she was and went straight to her. In \"When the Clock Strikes\" (from ''[[Red As Blood]]''), [[Tanith Lee]] had the sorcerous shoe alter shape whenever a woman tried to put it on, so it would not fit.\n\n[[Image:Gustave dore cendrillon4.JPG|thumb|Cinderella tries on the slipper]]\n\n===The Revelation===\nCinderella's stepmother and stepsisters (in some versions just the stepsisters and, in some other versions, a stepfather and stepsisters) conspire to win the prince's hand for one of them.  In the German telling, the first stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off a toe, but the doves in the hazel tree alert the prince to the blood dripping from the slipper, and he returns the false bride to her mother. The second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel, but the same doves give her away.\n\nIn many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged. Often, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters. In the Grimms' version, both the stepmother and the father urge it.<ref>Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 126-8 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref> The prince nevertheless insists on her trying. Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other).\n\n===The Conclusion===\nIn the German version of the story, the evil stepsisters are punished for their deception by having their eyes pecked out by birds. In other versions, they are forgiven, and made ladies-in-waiting with marriages to lesser lords.\n\nIn [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|The Thousand Nights and A Night]], in a tale called \"The Anklet\",<ref>{{cite book | last = Mardrus | first = Joseph-Charles | authorlink = Joseph-Charles Mardrus |author2=Powys Mathers  | title = The book of the Thousand Nights and One Night | volume = 4 | publisher = [[Routledge]] |date= June 1987 | location = London and New York | pages = 191\u2013194 | isbn = 0-415-04543-6 }}</ref> the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night. In ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]'', the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth. Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.\n\nIn an episode of [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Storyteller (TV series)|The Storyteller]]'', writer [[Anthony Minghella]] merged the old folk tale ''[[Donkeyskin]]'' (also written by Perrault) with ''Cinderella'' to tell the tale of ''Sapsorrow'', a girl both cursed and blessed by destiny.\n\nMany popular new works based on the story feature one step-sister who is not as cruel to Cinderella as the other. Examples are the film ''[[Ever After]]'', ''Cinderella 3'' and the Broadway revival.\n\n==Folkloristics==\n\n*\n\n[[File:Cendrillon2 crop.jpg|thumb|Cinderella or Cendrillon in French.

As she dozes off, the girl has a vision of a dove transforming into a woman, who instructs her on how to remove a physical imperfection and restore her own beauty.

This version is about Shahrbanou, daughter of a rich merchant and her evil stepmother and stepsister. At the end of the story, Shahrbanou marries a prince; who falls in love with Shahrbanou after seeing her in a wedding.\n\n==Literary versions==\n[[File:Giambattista Basile by Nicolaus Perrey.jpg|thumb|upright|Italian author [[Giambattista Basile]] wrote the first literary version of the story.]]\nThe first written European version of the story was published in Naples, Italy, by [[Giambattista Basile]], in his ''[[Pentamerone]]'' (1634). The story itself was set in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], at that time the most important political and cultural center of [[Southern Italy]] and among the most influential capitals in Europe, and written in the [[Neapolitan Language|Neapolitan dialect]]. It was later retold, along with other Basile tales, by [[Charles Perrault]] in ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9]]'' (1697),<ref name=\"Bottigheimer, Ruth 2008 pp. 175\"/> and by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in their folk tale collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' (1812).\n\nThe name \"Cenerentola\" comes from the Italian word \"cenere\" (ash, cinder). It has to do with the fact that servants and scullions were usually soiled with ash at that time, because of their cleaning work and also because they had to live in cold basements so they usually tried to get warm by sitting close to the fireplace.\n\n===''Cenerentola'', by Basile===\n[[Giambattista Basile]], an Italian soldier and government official, assembled a set of oral folk tales into a written collection titled ''Lo cunto de li cunti'' (The Story of Stories), or ''[[Pentamerone]]''. It included the tale of Cenerentola, which features a wicked stepmother and evil stepsisters, magical transformations, a missing slipper, and a hunt by a monarch for the owner of the slipper. It was published posthumously in 1634.\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A prince has a daughter, Zezolla (tonnie) (the Cinderella figure), who is tended by a beloved governess. The governess, with Zezolla's help, persuades the prince to marry her. The governess then brings forward six daughters of her own, who abuse Zezolla (tonnie), and send her into the kitchen to work as a servant. The prince goes to the island of Sinia, meets a fairy who gives presents to his daughter, and brings back for her: a golden spade, a golden bucket, a silken napkin, and a date seedling. The girl cultivates the tree, and when the king hosts a ball, Zezolla appears dressed richly by a fairy living in the date tree. The king falls in love with her, but Zezolla runs away before he can find out who she is. Twice Zezolla escapes the king and his servants. The third time, the king's servant captures one of her slippers. The king invites all of the maidens in the land to a ball with a shoe-test, identifies Zezolla (tonnie) after the shoe jumps from his hand to her foot, and eventually marries her.<ref>Basile, Giambattista (1911).

The popularity of his tale was due to his additions to the story, including the [[pumpkin]], the fairy-godmother and the introduction of \"glass\" slippers.<ref>A modern edition of the original French text by Perrault is found in Charles Perrault, ''Contes'', ed. Marc Soriano (Paris: Flammarion, 1989), pp. 274\u201379.</ref>\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A wealthy widower has a beautiful young daughter; a girl of unparalleled kindness and sweet temper. The gentleman marries a proud and haughty woman as his second wife. She has two [[false hero|daughters]], who are equally vain and selfish. The girl is forced into servitude by her stepmother, where she is made to work day and night doing menial chores. After the girl's chores are done for the day, she curls up near the fireplace in an effort to stay warm. She often arises covered in cinders, giving rise to the mocking nickname \"Cinderella\" by her stepsisters. Cinderella bears the abuse patiently and does not tell her father, who would have scolded her.\n:One day, the Prince invites all the young ladies in the land to a [[ball (dance)|royal ball]], planning to choose a wife. The two [[Ugly sisters|stepsisters]] gleefully plan their wardrobes for the ball, and taunt Cinderella by telling her that maids are not invited to the ball.\n:As the sisters depart to the ball, Cinderella cries in despair. Her [[Fairy godmother|Fairy Godmother]] magically appears and immediately begins to transform Cinderella from house servant to the young lady she was by birth, all in the effort to get Cinderella to the ball. She turns a [[pumpkin]] into a golden carriage, [[Mouse|mice]] into [[horse]]s, a [[rat]] into a [[coachman]], and [[lizard]]s into [[footman|footmen]]. She then turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful jeweled gown, complete with a delicate pair of glass slippers. The Godmother tells her to enjoy the ball, but warns her that she must return before [[midnight]], when the [[magic (paranormal)|spells]] will be broken.\n:At the ball, the entire [[noble court|court]] is entranced by Cinderella, especially the Prince. At this first ball, Cinderella remembers to leave before midnight. Back home, Cinderella graciously thanks her Godmother. She then innocently greets the stepsisters, who had not recognized her earlier, and talk of nothing but the beautiful girl at the ball.\n:Another ball is held the next evening, and Cinderella again attends with her Godmother's help. The Prince has become even more infatuated with the mysterious woman at the ball, and Cinderella in turn becomes so enchanted by him she loses track of time and leaves only at the final stroke of midnight, losing one of her glass slippers on the steps of the palace in her haste. The Prince chases her, but outside the palace, the guards see only a simple country girl leave. The Prince pockets the slipper and vows to find and marry the girl to whom it belongs. Meanwhile, Cinderella keeps the other slipper, which does not disappear when the spell is broken.\n:The Prince tries the slipper on all the women in the kingdom. When the Prince arrives at Cinderella's home, the stepsisters try in vain to win him over. Cinderella asks if she may try, but the stepsisters taunt her. Naturally, the slipper fits perfectly, and Cinderella produces the other slipper for good measure. Cinderella's stepfamily pleads for forgiveness, and Cinderella agrees. Cinderella had hoped her step-family would love her always.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The annotated classic fairy tales|date=2002|publisher=Norton|others=Tatar, Maria, 1945-|isbn=0393051633|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=49894271}}</ref> \n:Cinderella married the Prince as her stepsisters are married to two handsome gentlemen of the royal court.\n\nThe first moral of the story is that beauty is a treasure, but graciousness is priceless.

These, and similar talents come only from heaven, and it is good to have them. However, even these may fail to bring you success, without the blessing of a godfather or a godmother.\"<ref name=\"pitt.edu\"/>\n\n===''Aschenputtel'', by the Brothers Grimm===\n[[File:Aschenputtel.jpg|right|thumb|[[Alexander Zick]] illustrated ''Cinderella with the doves'', inspired by the Grimms' version.]]\nAnother well-known version was recorded by the German brothers [[Brothers Grimm|Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm]] in the 19th century. The tale is called ''\"Aschenputtel\"'' (''\"Cinderella\"'' in English translations). This version is much more intense than that of Perrault and Disney, in that Cinderella's father did not die and the stepsisters mutilate their feet to fit in the golden slipper. There is no fairy godmother, but rather help comes from a wishing tree that the heroine planted on her mother's grave.  In the second edition of their collection (1819), the Grimms supplemented the original 1812 version with a coda in which the stepsisters suffer a terrible punishment for their cruelty.\n\n'''Plot:'''\n:A plague infests a village, and a wealthy gentleman's wife lies on her deathbed. She calls for her only daughter, and tells her to remain good and kind, as God would protect her. She then dies and is buried. The child visits her mother's grave every day to grieve and a year goes by. The gentleman marries another woman with two older daughters from a previous marriage. They have beautiful faces and fair skin, but their hearts are cruel and wicked. The stepsisters steal the girl's fine clothes and jewels and force her to wear rags. They banish her into the kitchen, and give her the nickname \"Aschenputtel\" (\"Ashfool\"). She is forced to do all kinds of hard work from dawn to dusk for the sisters. The cruel sisters do nothing but mock her and make her chores harder by creating messes. However, despite all of it, the girl remains good and kind, and will always go to her mother's grave to cry and pray to God that she will see her circumstances improve.\n\n:One day the gentleman visits a fair, promising his stepdaughters gifts of luxury. The eldest asks for beautiful dresses, while the younger for pearls and diamonds. His own daughter merely begs for the first twig to knock his hat off on the way. The gentleman goes on his way, and acquires presents for his stepdaughters. While passing a forest he gets a hazel twig, and gives it to his daughter. She plants the twig over her mother's grave, waters it with her tears and over the years, it grows into a glowing hazel tree. The girl prays under it three times a day, and a white bird always comes to her as she prays. She tells her wishes to the bird, and every time the bird throws down to her what she has wished for.\n\n:The king decides to ordain a festival that will last for three days and invites all the beautiful maidens in the land to attend so that the prince can select one of them for his bride. The two sisters are also invited, but when Aschenputtel begs them to allow her to go with them into the celebration, the stepmother refuses because she has no decent dress nor shoes to wear. When the girl insists, the woman throws a dish of lentils into the ashes for her to pick up, guaranteeing her permission to attend the festival, if she can clean up the lentils in two hours. When the girl accomplished the task in less than an hour with the help of a flock of white doves that came when she sang a certain chant, the stepmother only redoubles the task and throws down even a greater quantity of lentils. When Aschenputtel is able to accomplish it in a greater speed, not wanting to spoil her daughters' chances, the stepmother hastens away with her husband and daughters to the celebration and leaves the crying stepdaughter behind.\n\n:The girl retreats to the graveyard and asks to be clothed in silver and gold. The white bird drops a gold and silver gown and silk shoes. She goes to the feast. The prince dances with her all the time, and when sunset comes she asks to leave. The prince escorts her home, but she eludes him and jumps inside a pigeon coop. The father came home ahead of time and the prince asks him to chop the pigeon coop down, but Aschenputtel has already escaped. The next day, the girl appears in grander apparel. The prince falls in love with her and dances with her for the whole day, and when sunset comes, the prince tries to accompany her home again. However, she climbs a pear tree to escape him. The Prince calls her father who chops down the tree, wondering if it could be Aschenputtel, but Aschenputtel has disappeared. The third day, she appears dressed in grand finery, with slippers of gold. Now the prince is determined to keep her, and has the entire stairway smeared with pitch. Aschenputtel loses track of time, and when she runs away one of her golden slippers sticks on that pitch. The prince proclaims that he will marry the maiden whose foot fits the golden slipper.\n\n:The next morning, the prince goes to Aschenputtel's house and tries the slipper on the eldest stepsister. The sister was advised by her mother to cut off her toes in order to fit the slipper. While riding with the stepsister, the two doves from Heaven tell the Prince that blood drips from her foot. Appalled by her treachery, he goes back again and tries the slipper on the other stepsister. She cut off part of her heel in order to get her foot in the slipper, and again the prince is fooled. While riding with her to the king's castle, the doves alert him again about the blood on her foot. He comes back to inquire about another girl. The gentleman tells him that they keep a kitchen-maid in the house&nbsp;\u2013 omitting to mention that she is his own daughter&nbsp;\u2013 and the prince asks him to let her try on the slipper. Aschenputtel appears after washing herself, and when she puts on the slipper, the prince recognizes her as the stranger with whom he has danced at the ball.\n\n:In a coda added in the second edition of 1819, during Aschenputtel's wedding, as she walks down the aisle with her stepsisters as her bridesmaids, (they had hoped to worm their way into her favour), the doves fly down and strike the two stepsisters' eyes, one in the left and the other in the right. When the wedding comes to an end, and Aschenputtel and her prince march out of the church, the doves fly again, striking the remaining eyes of the two evil sisters blind, a punishment they had to endure for the rest of their lives.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19068/19068-h/19068-h.htm#illus-135 Aschenputtel], included in ''Household Stories'' by the Brothers Grimm, translated by Lucy Crane, at [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\nAschenputtel's relationship with her father in this version is ambiguous; [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s version states that the absent father is dominated by his second wife, explaining why he does not prevent the abuse of his daughter. However, the father in this tale plays an active role in several scenes, and it is not explained why he tolerates the mistreatment of his child. He also describes Aschenputtel as his \"first wife's child\" and not his own.\n\n==Plot variations and alternative tellings==\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones Cinderella.jpg|thumb|''Cinderella'' by [[Edward Burne-Jones]], 1863, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]\n[[File:CinderAdelphi.jpg|thumb|right|Pantomime at the Adelphi]]\n[[File:Cinderella (1911).webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|''Cinderella'' (1911)]]\n\n===Villains===\nIn some versions, her father plays an active role in the humiliation of his daughter; in others, he is secondary to his new wife, Cinderella's stepmother; in some versions, especially the popular [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 Disney film]], Cinderella's father has died and so has Cinderella's mother.\n\nAlthough many variants of Cinderella feature the wicked stepmother, the defining trait of type [[Antti Aarne|510A]] is a female persecutor: in ''[[Fair, Brown and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Finette Cendron]]'', the stepmother does not appear at all, and it is the older sisters who confine her to the kitchen. In other fairy tales featuring the ball, she was driven from home by the persecutions of her father, usually because he wished to marry her. Of this type (510B) are ''[[Cap O' Rushes]]'', ''[[Catskin]]'', All-Kinds-of-Fur, and ''[[Allerleirauh]]'', and she slaves in the kitchen because she found a job there.<ref>Heidi Anne Heiner, \"[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/donkeyskin/other.html Tales Similar to Donkeyskin]\"</ref> In ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]'', the stepmother drives her from home, and she likewise finds such a job.\n\nIn ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', [[Gioachino Rossini]] inverted the sex roles: Cenerentola is oppressed by her [[Stepfamily#stepfathers|stepfather]]. (This makes the opera Aarne-Thompson type 510B.) He also made the economic basis for such hostility unusually clear, in that Don Magnifico wishes to make his own daughters' [[dowry|dowries]] larger, to attract a grander match, which is impossible if he must provide a third dowry. Folklorists often interpret the hostility between the stepmother and stepdaughter as just such a competition for resources, but seldom does the tale make it clear.<ref>[[Marina Warner]], ''From the Beast to the Blonde: On Fairy Tales And Their Tellers'', p 213-4 {{ISBN|0-374-15901-7}}</ref>\n\n===Ball, Ballgown, and Curfew===\nThe number of balls varies, sometimes one, sometimes two, and sometimes three. The [[fairy godmother]] is Perrault's own addition to the tale.<ref>Jane Yolen, p 23, ''Touch Magic'' {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}</ref> The person who aided Cinderella (Aschenputtel) in the [[Brothers Grimm|Grimms]]'s version is her dead mother. Aschenputtel requests her aid by praying at her grave, on which a tree is growing. Helpful doves roosting in the tree shake down the clothing she needs for the ball. This motif is found in other variants of the tale as well, such as ''The Cinder Maid'', collected by [[Joseph Jacobs]], and the Finnish ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]''. Playwright [[James Lapine]] incorporated this motif into the Cinderella plotline of the musical ''[[Into the Woods]]''. [[Giambattista Basile]]'s ''[[Cenerentola]]'' combined them; the Cinderella figure, Zezolla, asks her father to commend her to the Dove of Fairies and ask her to send her something, and she receives a tree that will provide her clothing. Other variants have her helped by talking animals, as in ''[[Katie Woodencloak]]'', ''[[Rushen Coatie]]'', ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'', ''[[The Story of Tam and Cam]]'', or ''[[The Sharp Grey Sheep]]''\u2014these animals often having some connection with her dead mother; in ''[[The Golden Slipper]]'', a fish aids her after she puts it in water. In \"The Anklet\", it's a magical alabaster pot the girl purchased with her own money that brings her the gowns and the anklets she wears to the ball. [[Gioachino Rossini]], having agreed to do an opera based on ''Cinderella'' if he could omit all magical elements, wrote ''[[La Cenerentola]]'', in which she was aided by Alidoro, a philosopher and formerly the Prince's tutor.\n\nThe midnight curfew is also absent in many versions; Cinderella leaves the ball to get home before her stepmother and stepsisters, or she is simply tired. In the Grimms' version, Aschenputtel slips away when she is tired, hiding on her father's estate in a tree, and then the pigeon coop, to elude her pursuers; her father tries to catch her by chopping them down, but she escapes.<ref>Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 116 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the gathering need not be a ball; several variants on Cinderella, such as ''Katie Woodencloak'' and ''The Golden Slipper'' have her attend church.\n\nIn the three-ball version, Cinderella keeps a close watch on the time the first two nights and is able to leave without difficulty. However, on the [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] (or only) night, she loses track of the time and must flee the castle before her disguise vanishes. In her haste, she loses a glass slipper which the prince finds\u2014or else the prince has carefully had her exit tarred, so as to catch her, and the slipper is caught in it.\n\n===The identifying item===\nThe glass slipper is unique to [[Charles Perrault]]'s version and its derivatives; in other versions of the tale it may be made of other materials (in the version recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]], [[German language|German]]: ''Aschenbroedel'' and ''Aschenputtel'', for instance, it is gold) and in still other tellings, it is not a slipper but an anklet, a ring, or a bracelet that gives the prince the key to Cinderella's identity. In Rossini's opera \"''[[La Cenerentola]]''\" (\"Cinderella\"), the slipper is replaced by twin bracelets to prove her identity. In the Finnish variant ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]'' the prince uses tar to gain something every ball, and so has a ring, a circlet, and a pair of slippers. Some interpreters, perhaps troubled by sartorial impracticalities, have suggested that Perrault's \"glass slipper\" (''pantoufle de verre'') had been a \"squirrel fur slipper\" (''pantoufle de [[vair]]'') in some unidentified earlier version of the tale, and that Perrault or one of his sources confused the words; however, most scholars believe the glass slipper was a deliberate piece of poetic invention on Perrault's part.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 28, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>  The [[Cinderella (1950 film)|1950 Disney adaptation]] takes advantage of the slipper being made of glass to add a twist whereby the slipper is shattered just before Cinderella has the chance to try it on, leaving her with only the matching slipper with which to prove her identity.\n\nAnother interpretation of verre/vair (glass/fur) suggested a sexual element\u2014the Prince was 'trying on' the 'fur slipper' (vagina) of the maidens in the kingdom, as a '[[Droit du seigneur]]' right of sexual possession of his subjects. The disguised Cinderella's 'fur slipper' was of unique appeal to the Prince who sought her thereafter through sexual congress (a variety of sources including Joan Gould).\n\nThe translation of the story into cultures with different standards of beauty has left the significance of Cinderella's shoe size unclear, and resulted in the implausibility of Cinderella's feet being of a unique size for no particular reason. Humorous retellings of the story sometimes use the twist of having the shoes turn out to also fit somebody completely unsuitable, such as an amorous old crone. In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Witches Abroad]]'', the witches accuse another witch of manipulating the events because it was a common shoe size, and she could only ensure that the right woman put it on if she already knew where she was and went straight to her. In \"When the Clock Strikes\" (from ''[[Red As Blood]]''), [[Tanith Lee]] had the sorcerous shoe alter shape whenever a woman tried to put it on, so it would not fit.\n\n[[Image:Gustave dore cendrillon4.JPG|thumb|Cinderella tries on the slipper]]\n\n===The Revelation===\nCinderella's stepmother and stepsisters (in some versions just the stepsisters and, in some other versions, a stepfather and stepsisters) conspire to win the prince's hand for one of them.  In the German telling, the first stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off a toe, but the doves in the hazel tree alert the prince to the blood dripping from the slipper, and he returns the false bride to her mother. The second stepsister fits into the slipper by cutting off her heel, but the same doves give her away.\n\nIn many variants of the tale, the prince is told that Cinderella can not possibly be the one, as she is too dirty and ragged. Often, this is said by the stepmother or stepsisters. In the Grimms' version, both the stepmother and the father urge it.<ref>Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 126-8 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref> The prince nevertheless insists on her trying. Cinderella arrives and proves her identity by fitting into the slipper or other item (in some cases she has kept the other).\n\n===The Conclusion===\nIn the German version of the story, the evil stepsisters are punished for their deception by having their eyes pecked out by birds. In other versions, they are forgiven, and made ladies-in-waiting with marriages to lesser lords.\n\nIn [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|The Thousand Nights and A Night]], in a tale called \"The Anklet\",<ref>{{cite book | last = Mardrus | first = Joseph-Charles | authorlink = Joseph-Charles Mardrus |author2=Powys Mathers  | title = The book of the Thousand Nights and One Night | volume = 4 | publisher = [[Routledge]] |date= June 1987 | location = London and New York | pages = 191\u2013194 | isbn = 0-415-04543-6 }}</ref> the stepsisters make a comeback by using twelve magical hairpins to turn the bride into a dove on her wedding night. In ''[[The Wonderful Birch]]'', the stepmother, a witch, manages to substitute her daughter for the true bride after she has given birth. Such tales continue the fairy tale into what is in effect a second episode.\n\nIn an episode of [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Storyteller (TV series)|The Storyteller]]'', writer [[Anthony Minghella]] merged the old folk tale ''[[Donkeyskin]]'' (also written by Perrault) with ''Cinderella'' to tell the tale of ''Sapsorrow'', a girl both cursed and blessed by destiny.\n\nMany popular new works based on the story feature one step-sister who is not as cruel to Cinderella as the other.

It is not meant to go far, fast or carry much load. If that's what you need, Icon will happily give you the number for your local Cirrus dealer\u2014or Southwest Airlines. The A5 was designed for fun\u2014and to qualify as a light-sport aircraft, which it barely did by getting a waiver to increase its maximum takeoff weight. There are other new airplanes designed principally for fun, mostly other light sports, but in comparison to the A5, they sometimes feel like really nice kitplanes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.avweb.com/news/features/AVweb-Flies-the-Icon-A5-229579-1.html |title=AVweb Flies the Icon A5 |last=Rapoport |first=Geoff |work=AVweb |date=3 September 2017 |accessdate=4 September 2017}}</ref>}}\n\n===Awards===\n*2008 ''[[Popular Science]]'' 100 Best Innovations of the Year<ref name=\"PopSci reference\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/gear-amp-gadgets/gallery/2008-12/top-100-innovations-2008?image=41 |title=Icon A5: A seaplane for beginners |work=Popular Science |date=December 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref>\n*2009 ''[[I.D.
