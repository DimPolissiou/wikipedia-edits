[1]\n\nRam Swarup Joon[10] writes.......Bhimrolia is the gotra of the Dholpur dynasty. According to their bard, descendants of the Vir Bhadra were called Bhadras for 184 generations. After Tej Sen they were called Sens for 62 generations. For several generations thereafter they were called Muni and later Ghandras after King Vijaya Chand. Their last ruler was Shamsi, whose descendants are the present Dholpur dynasty.\n\nRajayapal Yadawa made Bayana his Capital in\n\nHistory of the Jats, End of Page-75\n\n1100 Vikram Samvat. Among the ancestors of Dholpur dynasty there was a king named Palansis Rao who was killed in Kanauj on the occasion of Sanyogita's Swayamwara (the self-selection of the groom by the girl). King Vijayapal who declared her his dharam sister gave his grandson Brahmadev and his mother queens Ghandra Kaumudi. When Shahabuddin Mohammad Ghori drove them out after killing the ruler. King Vijayapal had to face the invasion of Mohammad Ghori. He also had to fight against Abubakar Kandhari, Dharampal, and grandson of King. Sohan Pal founded the dynasty of Bichor. Their descendants are found both among the Jats and Rajputs. According to Colonel Todd, Chonkars, inspite of being Jats, are called Rajputs. in Mugal period some chhonkar jats accepted islam after shudhi andolan they joined chhonkar jadaun caste.they are now calling rajput chhodkar but original rajput donot marry them\n\nMadanpal had a son called Subaipal, who drove out Kriah Raja of Digh and established his rule there. The Chonkar gotra is found in Western and Eastern Punjab. There are ten villages belonging to the Chonkars in Aligarh district, two in Jullundur district and one in Ambala district.\n\nRam Swarup Joon[11] writes about Chhonkar and Sansanwal: This is the gotra of the Bharatpur ruling dynasty. Their original gotra is Yadu. As they settled down in a village called Sansani, they became known as Sansanwal. They raised their voice against the atrocities of Aurangzeb, protected the Hindu Dharma and established a new capital. One Yaduvanshi ancestor belonging to this gotra, named Brij Raj ruled over the territory called Brij after his name. These people had returned home from Dwarka and their capital was Mathura, in the 64th generation of King Brij Raj.\n\nRam Sarup Joon[12] writes that...about 70 Jat Gotras joined the Gujar force and started calling themselves Gujars. Chhonker is one of them.\n\n==Modern fashion==\nIn recent years, chokers have been popular with a number of celebrities including [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] who wore one to the 1999 Academy Awards.
