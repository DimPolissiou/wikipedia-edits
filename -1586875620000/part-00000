J. Abrams]] consisting of three films, [[viral marketing]] websites linking the films together, and a tie-in manga to the first film titled ''[[Cloverfield/Kishin]]'' (2008), all set in a shared fictional universe referred to as the \"Cloververse\". The franchise as a whole deals with creatures from other dimensions attacking Earth throughout various decades, all as a repercussion of an experiment by an astronaut team aboard the ''Cloverfield Station'' in outer-space. Each film depicts the reality-altering effects of their study, which was meant to find a new energy source replacing the planet's depleted resources, only to open portals for assault from various [[Extraterrestrial life|beasts from deep space]].\n\n''[[Cloverfield]]'', the first film in the series, is a [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] monster film released on January 18, 2008, which was well-received by critics. After it, several films initially conceived as standalone features were modified to make them part of a franchise. The first sequel, titled ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'', is a psychological horror film that was released on March 11, 2016, and like its predecessor received positive reviews from critics. ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'', a science fiction horror film, was released by [[Netflix]] on February 4, 2018. Unlike the previous two films, it received negative reviews.\n\n==Films==\n===''Cloverfield'' (2008)===\n{{main|Cloverfield}}\nThe first film of the series, released in 2008, is a found-footage monster horror film directed by [[Matt Reeves]], produced by [[J. J. Abrams]] and [[Bryan Burk]], and written by [[Drew Goddard]]. Before settling on an official title, the film was marketed as ''01-18-08''. The film, which is presented as found footage shot with a home camcorder, follows six people  fleeing from a gigantic monster that attacks [[New York City]] while they are having a farewell party. The film was well received by critics and grossed over $170 million at the box office against a $25 million budget. ''Cloverfield'' was first publicized with a two-minute [[teaser trailer]] that did not advertise the film's title, only its release date: ''01-18-08'' (referring to January 18, 2008).<ref name=\"rolls\">{{cite news |author=Borys Kit |author2=Tatiana Siegel |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3id4ef5b33280f855a6076329c1ca10481 |title=Paramount rolls in the 'Cloverfield' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2007-07-06 |accessdate=2007-07-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708103155/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3id4ef5b33280f855a6076329c1ca10481 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=2007-07-08}}</ref> Elements of the viral marketing campaign included MySpace pages created for fictional characters,<ref name=\"myspace\">{{cite news |author=chapinyoung |url=http://current.com/items/88818115_cloverfield_s_fake_myspace_pages |title=Cloverfield's\" Fake MySpace Pages |publisher=[[Current TV|Current]] |date=2008-01-17 |accessdate=2008-01-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121003431/http://current.com/items/88818115_cloverfield_s_fake_myspace_pages | archive-date=January 21, 2008 | url-status=dead}}</ref> unusually intense secrecy over the film's plot, and websites created for fictional companies alluded to in the film.<ref>{{cite news |author=Harry Knowles |url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/33261 |title=JJ Abrams drops Harry a Line on all this 1-18-08 stuff! |work=[[Ain't It Cool News]] |date=2007-07-09 |accessdate=2007-07-09 | author-link=Harry Knowles}}</ref><ref name=\"burk\">{{cite news |author=Tara DiLullo Bennett |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=46450 |title=Producer Talks ''Cloverfield'' |website=[[Sci Fi Wire]] |date=2007-12-17 |accessdate=2007-12-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220142258/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?id=46450 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=2007-12-20}}</ref>\n\n===''10 Cloverfield Lane'' (2016)===\n{{main|10 Cloverfield Lane}}\nThe second film, released in 2016, is a psychological horror film with science fiction elements directed by [[Dan Trachtenberg]], produced by Abrams and Lindsey Weber, and written by Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken, and [[Damien Chazelle]]. The film was developed from a script titled ''The Cellar'', but under production by [[Bad Robot Productions|Bad Robot]] it was ultimately adapted to be set in the same universe as the first ''Cloverfield'' film, thus establishing the grounds for a franchise. The film follows a young woman who is held in an underground bunker with two men who insist that a hostile event has left the surface of the Earth uninhabitable. The film presents the questionable truth of such statements made by the owner of the bunker. The film is presented in a typical third-person narrative, in contrast to its predecessor's found footage style. Critical response was largely positive, and the film grossed over $110 million against a $15 million budget.\n\n===''The Cloverfield Paradox'' (2018)===\n{{main|The Cloverfield Paradox}}\nThe third film, released in 2018 on Netflix, is a science fiction horror film directed by [[Julius Onah]], produced by Abrams and Weber, and written by Oren Uziel and [[Doug Jung]]. It is based on Uziel's original spec script ''God Particle'' which, like ''10 Cloverfield Lane'', was initially unconnected to the ''Cloverfield'' title. Set in 2028, the film follows a team of astronauts who are left stranded in space after they perform a [[particle accelerator]] test that causes their vessel, the ''Cloverfield Station'', to travel into an alternate universe, from which they must find their way back. Meanwhile, the test causes other realities to open up on their home Earth, creating supernatural attacks across parallel universes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1578220/jj-abrams-mysterious-god-particle-could-somehow-be-the-next-cloverfield-movie |title=J.J.

Clover is the main antagonist of the film. Various members of the filmmaking crew referred to the monster as \"Clover\" throughout the special features of the ''Cloverfield'' DVD. Additionally, actor [[Michael Stahl-David]] reported that the monster was referred to as \"Clover\" prior to the movie's release.<ref>{{cite news |author=Larry Carroll |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1576563/20071214/story.jhtml |title='Cloverfield' Star Speaks At Last, Shedding Light On Secret J.J.

The monster kills Jason when it smashes the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] with its tail and later kills Hud by biting him in half. The parasites that drop off its body during its rampage also bite Marlena, who later dies gruesomely as a result.\n\nAccording to the tie-in manga ''[[Cloverfield/Kishin]]'', and hinted at slightly by the viral marketing websites, a Japanese oil-drilling company known as [[Tagruato]] (of which [[Cloverfield#Viral tie-ins|Slusho!]], where Rob was supposed to work, is a subsidiary company) captured the monster for unknown reasons. In the manga, the monster has some kind of biological connection to Kishin Aiba, the main character, due to a result of tampering or experimentation. Kishin Aiba is able to control the monster without it harming him.\n\n* Marlena Diamond (played by [[Lizzy Caplan]]), 26, is good friends with Lily. During Rob's going-away party, she is seen mostly avoiding Hud during the party while he tries unsuccessfully to flirt with her. She is bitten and killed by one of the monster's parasites.\n\nIn spite of not being initially told the premise of the film, Lizzy Caplan stated that she accepted a role in ''Cloverfield'' solely because she was a fan of the Abrams-produced television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' (in which her former ''[[Related]]'' co-star [[Kiele Sanchez]] was a recurring character), and her experience of discovering its true nature eventually caused her to state that she would not sign on for a film in the future \"without knowing full well what it is.\" She indicated that her character was a \"[[sarcasm|sarcastic]] outsider,\" and that her role was \"physically demanding.\"<ref name=\"blackbook\">{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/features/comments/lizzy/ |title=Lizzy Caplan: The Meanest Girl in Hollywood? |publisher=[[BlackBook Magazine]] |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>\n\n* Lily Ford (played by [[Jessica Lucas]]), 27, is friends of Beth and Marlena and the girlfriend of Jason.

During the evacuation of Manhattan, Lily is put on a different helicopter from the rest of the group, but her overall fate is left unknown.\n\n* Hud Platt (played by [[T. J.

The next morning, he is killed by the monster.\n\nHud himself was also originally to have survived, but producer [[J. J. Abrams]] suggested having him getting eaten by the monster, allowing the audience to vicariously experience this. The scene was then planned as having Hud be eaten instantly after turning around, but it was decided that the audience deserved a clearer look at the monster, which resulted in the longer shot with the monster leaning down to inspect Hud before biting and killing him.<ref>''[[Cloverfield]]'' - (Special Features: \"The Making Of ''Cloverfield'').

During the evacuation of Manhattan, the monster attacks the helicopter he, Beth and Rob are in, causing it to crash. His ultimate fate is unknown. Stahl-David reprises his role in ''The Cloverfield Files'', in which he is revealed to have become Vice-President of Tagruato.\n\n* Jason Hawkins (played by [[Mike Vogel]]), 28, is Rob's older brother and boyfriend of Lily. He is killed when the monster attacks the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] during the evacuation of Manhattan.\n\n* Beth McIntyre (played by [[Odette Annable]]), 23, is the long-time platonic friend of Rob Hawkins. After a heated argument between Beth and Rob during his farewell party, she and a friend Travis leave the party. Upon the monster's arrival, however, she becomes trapped in her father's apartment during the onslaught. After Rob, Hudson, and Lily rescue her, she, along with Rob and Hud, board a helicopter that is treated to a bird's eye view of the assault on the monster, but is attacked in the process. She survives the monster attack and crash. After the death of Hud, she and Rob take cover under a nearby bridge and make a final recording, professing their love towards each other and letting whoever watches the video know who they are, and what happened. The bridge is then destroyed by the bombs used in the attempt to kill the monster. Her ultimate fate is unknown.\n\n* Ganu Yoshida is the C.E.O. of [[Tagruato]]. He is attacked in New York City by a group that he suspects is [[T.I.D.O. Wave]] weeks after the Chuai Station sinks in the Atlantic and just before the monster attacks.\n\n* Jenn and Antonio (played by Margot Farley and [[Theo Rossi]]) are close friends of Rob Hawkins. Jenn and her boyfriend Antonio are seen frequently through the party, showing that both are close friends with Hud as well. They are both last seen in the streets soon after Jason makes the decision to cross the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] from [[Manhattan]]. Their ultimate fate remains unknown.\n\n* Charlie (played by [[Brian Klugman]]) first appears prominently in the [[teaser trailer]]; towards the beginning of the trailer he directs the comment \"You owe me eleven dollars,\" to Rob. Charlie again appears at the very end of the trailer, stating \"This is going to be the best night ever!\" which is not seen in the film. He also appears in the extended [[theatrical trailer]], though briefly, and is only visible during the short party scene at the beginning. He is not seen again for the rest of the film and his ultimate fate is unknown.\n\n* Travis Marello (played by [[Ben Feldman (actor)|Ben Feldman]]) is Beth's new boyfriend. He is seen in the party with Beth, which upsets Rob. According to the Special Investigation Mode on the ''Cloverfield'' Blu-ray release, Travis drives home to New Jersey before the end of the party and thus survives the attack.\n\n* Sergeant Pryce helps the group by allowing them to go search for Beth and afterwards escorting them to a chopper. He is last seen entering a departing Humvee as [[Clover (creature)|the monster]] attacks the evacuation site. His fate is unknown.\n\n* Heather (played by [[Liza Lapira]]) is a girl at the party and a close friend of Lily. She is seen multiple times during the party. Heather is then seen in the streets as the monster rampages where Rob, Hud, Lily, Marlena, Jason and the other party guests, and onlookers are standing watching the destruction. Her ultimate fate is unknown.\n\n===''Cloverfield/Kishin''===\n{{Main|Cloverfield/Kishin}}\n* Kishin Aiba is a troubled boy who had been repeatedly tormented by a couple of bullies in a public restroom within their school. Although he is saved from humiliation by a girl named Aiko Sasahara, they continue their activities with him and decide to leave him within the confines of an emergency safety house. He has a long history of being bullied due to his mother being \"strange\", and along with her, he is badly ridiculed. When his mother died, he was so stricken with grief that even into his teens, he wished he had died with her. His emotional torment continues, while at the same time the monster begins to surface within Tagruato's oceans. He later escapes the school grounds with Aiko's help after seeing news coverage about the monster. Here, the two bond together while on their way to Kishin's apartment to seek shelter, only to stumble across an unknown cult bent on using him for a dark purpose tied to the monster.\n\nAs shown in some panels, Kishin and his father are not on good terms. Medical records seen in his father's room, along with the cult tracking him down, heavily imply that Kishin is part of a series of experiments with an item revered by the cult, which ties him to [[Clover (creature)|the monster]], itself. In the third chapter, it is seen that his system has been mixed with the monster's in a tiny organ called the Splinter of Amnion, which allows him to control it without falling victim to its wrath. Kishin's father confirms this as an act of sabotage by his mother, who uses Kishin as a vessel under the cult's orders, but dies by Tagruato's hands.\n\nKishin succumbs to madness due to the betrayal of his mother, and now uses the monster to cause more destruction. He is able to control the monster without it harming him, it thinking him its kin or brethren. In the final chapter, with the help of Aiko, Kishin regains his sanity and learns to value his life and the lives of others. He faces the monster, whereupon it moves the Splinter of Amnion from his system to its own. But as it cannot feed on the emotions Kishin has laced it with, it leaves Kishin in the seas of Japan, where he is rescued by Aiko and the bullies. The manga ends as they embrace, Kishin having finally found the one thing he cares for in his life.\n\n* Yoko Aiba is Kishin's mother. In the manga she is ostracized by both children and adults because of her eccentric nature. It is later revealed that she is part of the cult that worships the monster. She is deeply attached to her son, and comforts him during troubled times. She cares little for her own wellbeing so long as her son believes in her. She dies having been targeted by Tagruato, leaving her son alone and in emotional pain for most of his life. During her time with Kishin's father, she obtains a biological device and places it inside Kishin, giving him the ability to control the monster.\n\n* Aiko Sasahara is Kishin Aiba's classmate. She keeps an uptight attitude but is optimistic despite her troubled past with her parents. Her father has died two years prior to the story and her mother is an abusive drunk who exploits her husband's finances over their daughter's well-being. She is determined to live life on her own terms. She has a deep fear of rodents/mice. She and Kishin are fans of one of the popstars promoting Tagruato's product Slusho! named Yuki. Aiko's role is greatly expanded in the final chapter, wherein she helps bring Kishin's sanity back by confessing her feelings to him. She escapes the school with Kishin after hearing a report about the monster's rampage on the coastline of Japan, and bonds with Kishin. They arrive at Kishin's residence where two unknown men from a cult come looking for him. She tries to seek help but to no avail, and is instead escorted to a shelter by the cult's underlings. However, her mind is still set on saving Kishin. She is thrown out of the shelter by the very same group that bullies Kishin. Unlike Kishin, she has some physical prowess and is able to defeat the monster's parasites without bites or injuries. Fighting off the monster's parasites, she comes upon Kishin and the monster causing destruction in Japan. She, Kishin and the bullies hold off the parasites while Kishin leaves to deal with the monster. The monster, unable to feed on the stimuli of Kishin's emotions due to his love for Aiko, leaves him in the sea of Japan. Aiko and the bullies rescue him as the monster retreats back into the ocean. The manga ends with Kishin and Aiko embracing in the wake of the disaster.\n\n* Kurosaki is a sailor who unknowingly escorts the monster in one of Tagruato's ships. He is a father-to-be and loves to show off pictures of his wife and unborn child to his fellow unit, much to their chagrin, and longs to return home and see his family again. When the monster escapes Tagruato's grasp, he and his unit attempt to fight off the beast while waiting for backup; they fail miserably. He gives his last transmission calling for an airstrike, and laments his death while musing at his wife's picture before the monster claws its way through the ship's hull, devouring him. Before his death, it was heavily implied that he and his unit did not know of the monster's existence until the attack, despite having been briefed about the classified mission.\n\n* Mr. Aiba is Kishin's father. He is revealed to be head of Tagruato's research, and has connections to the Slusho! drink. He is callous and cares little for his son, and therefore the two are not on good terms. He saves Kishin from the cult and reveals to Kishin his true purpose and his tie to the monster, but attempts to destroy him before the monster can get to Kishin. He fails as the monster shields Kishin from harm. Mr. Aiba is the researcher and developer of the Splinter of Amnion, a biological orb that controls the monster.\n\n* Three unnamed individuals bully Kishin because of his mother's eccentricity. They take deep pleasure in tormenting Kishin throughout the manga. Kishin, with the help of Aiko, evades them on the second chapter. They are seen again in the shelter where the parasites rush into the city and purge its citizens. They play a large role in the final chapter with Kishin and Aiko, when one begs to be spared and is saved only by Aiko's intervention. With Aiko's help, they hold the parasites off until Kishin stops the monster.\n\n* Yuki is a famous popstar in the ''Cloverfield'' universe. He is first introduced in the second chapter promoting the Slusho! drink. Aiko Sasahara admires Yuki's performances and is surprised that Kishin has some connections to him.\n\n* The Cult are a mysterious group of fanatics who abduct Kishin, wishing to use him in some unknown experiments. Their goal is to make Kishin a vessel for controlling the monster to purify Japan, which they believe has been tainted by human society. They also worship the creature itself, implying that they have known of its existence long before Tagruato or the Japanese government. Most are killed by Kishin's father. Kishin's mother is affiliated with the cult prior to conceiving her son, having entered a relationship with one of Tagruato's staff.\n\n===''10 Cloverfield Lane''===\n{{Main|10 Cloverfield Lane}}\n* Michelle (played by [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]) is a young woman who leaves New Orleans and drives through rural Louisiana after an argument with her fianc\u00e9, Ben, that ends with her ending their relationship. Late at night, she turns on the radio and hears of continuous blackouts in major cities. Distracted by a call from Ben, Michelle gets into an accident and is rendered unconscious. She wakes up in a concrete room chained to a wall, and is approached by a man named Howard, who explains that an unknown attack has taken place and that he brought her to his bunker after finding her on the side of the road. Michelle struggles with accepting the idea that some type of war has left the Earth uninhabitable, and fights to know the truth about what is really going on.\n\n* Howard Stambler (played by [[John Goodman]]) is a man who brings Michelle to an underground bunker following her car accident. He explains that he has saved her from an unknown attack that has taken place and that left the surface uninhabitable. Michelle doubts his motives and his story about what is occurring on the surface. Stambler is later shown to be mentally unstable, and kills Emmett. During Michelle's escape attempt she kicks over a barrel of [[perchloric acid]], which causes an electrical fire that kills Stambler. A viral marketing site used to promote the film states that Howard was Tagruato Corporation's Employee of the Month in February 2016.<ref>[http://tagruato.jp/employee_of_the_month_2016_february.php/ \"Tagruato Corporation - Employees of the Month: February 2016\"].

He helped build the bunker for Howard and confirms to Michelle that something dangerous and deadly is taking place at the surface. Howard later shoots Emmett in the face for wanting to construct a weapon, though Emmett was really covering for Michelle. Michelle later finds his corpse dissolving in [[perchloric acid]].\n\n* Ben (voiced by [[Bradley Cooper]]) is Michelle's ex-fianc\u00e9. Michelle abruptly breaks up with Ben at the start of the film after an argument and leaves town, leading to her car accident and her connection with Howard.\n\n* Leslie (played by [[Suzanne Cryer]]) is Howard's neighbour who begs to be let into the bunker when Michelle is trying to escape. Noticing that Leslie is suffering from severe skin lesions, Michelle realizes the air may not be safe, and refuses to open the door. Leslie dies.\n\n===''The Cloverfield Paradox''===\n{{Main|The Cloverfield Paradox}}\n* Ava Hamilton (played by [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]]) is a British communications officer aboard Cloverfield Station and Michael's wife.

The franchise as a whole deals with creatures from other dimensions attacking Earth throughout various decades, all as a repercussion of an experiment by an astronaut team aboard the ''Cloverfield Station'' in outer-space.

The first sequel, titled ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'', is a psychological horror film that was released on March 11, 2016, and like its predecessor received positive reviews from critics. ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'', a science fiction horror film, was released by [[Netflix]] on February 4, 2018.

The film, which is presented as found footage shot with a home camcorder, follows six people  fleeing from a gigantic monster that attacks [[New York City]] while they are having a farewell party. The film was well received by critics and grossed over $170 million at the box office against a $25 million budget.

The film was developed from a script titled ''The Cellar'', but under production by [[Bad Robot Productions|Bad Robot]] it was ultimately adapted to be set in the same universe as the first ''Cloverfield'' film, thus establishing the grounds for a franchise. The film follows a young woman who is held in an underground bunker with two men who insist that a hostile event has left the surface of the Earth uninhabitable. The film presents the questionable truth of such statements made by the owner of the bunker. The film is presented in a typical third-person narrative, in contrast to its predecessor's found footage style. Critical response was largely positive, and the film grossed over $110 million against a $15 million budget.\n\n===''The Cloverfield Paradox'' (2018)===\n{{main|The Cloverfield Paradox}}\nThe third film, released in 2018 on Netflix, is a science fiction horror film directed by [[Julius Onah]], produced by Abrams and Weber, and written by Oren Uziel and [[Doug Jung]]. It is based on Uziel's original spec script ''God Particle'' which, like ''10 Cloverfield Lane'', was initially unconnected to the ''Cloverfield'' title. Set in 2028, the film follows a team of astronauts who are left stranded in space after they perform a [[particle accelerator]] test that causes their vessel, the ''Cloverfield Station'', to travel into an alternate universe, from which they must find their way back. Meanwhile, the test causes other realities to open up on their home Earth, creating supernatural attacks across parallel universes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1578220/jj-abrams-mysterious-god-particle-could-somehow-be-the-next-cloverfield-movie |title=J.J.

Clover is the main antagonist of the film. Various members of the filmmaking crew referred to the monster as \"Clover\" throughout the special features of the ''Cloverfield'' DVD. Additionally, actor [[Michael Stahl-David]] reported that the monster was referred to as \"Clover\" prior to the movie's release.<ref>{{cite news |author=Larry Carroll |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1576563/20071214/story.jhtml |title='Cloverfield' Star Speaks At Last, Shedding Light On Secret J.J.

The monster kills Jason when it smashes the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] with its tail and later kills Hud by biting him in half. The parasites that drop off its body during its rampage also bite Marlena, who later dies gruesomely as a result.\n\nAccording to the tie-in manga ''[[Cloverfield/Kishin]]'', and hinted at slightly by the viral marketing websites, a Japanese oil-drilling company known as [[Tagruato]] (of which [[Cloverfield#Viral tie-ins|Slusho!]], where Rob was supposed to work, is a subsidiary company) captured the monster for unknown reasons. In the manga, the monster has some kind of biological connection to Kishin Aiba, the main character, due to a result of tampering or experimentation. Kishin Aiba is able to control the monster without it harming him.\n\n* Marlena Diamond (played by [[Lizzy Caplan]]), 26, is good friends with Lily. During Rob's going-away party, she is seen mostly avoiding Hud during the party while he tries unsuccessfully to flirt with her. She is bitten and killed by one of the monster's parasites.\n\nIn spite of not being initially told the premise of the film, Lizzy Caplan stated that she accepted a role in ''Cloverfield'' solely because she was a fan of the Abrams-produced television series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' (in which her former ''[[Related]]'' co-star [[Kiele Sanchez]] was a recurring character), and her experience of discovering its true nature eventually caused her to state that she would not sign on for a film in the future \"without knowing full well what it is.\" She indicated that her character was a \"[[sarcasm|sarcastic]] outsider,\" and that her role was \"physically demanding.\"<ref name=\"blackbook\">{{cite web |url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/features/comments/lizzy/ |title=Lizzy Caplan: The Meanest Girl in Hollywood? |publisher=[[BlackBook Magazine]] |date=2007-11-15 |accessdate=2007-11-16}}</ref>\n\n* Lily Ford (played by [[Jessica Lucas]]), 27, is friends of Beth and Marlena and the girlfriend of Jason. In the film, she suggested to Jason that they should throw a farewell party for his brother, Rob, before his departure to Japan to accept a new job. During the evacuation of Manhattan, Lily is put on a different helicopter from the rest of the group, but her overall fate is left unknown.\n\n* Hud Platt (played by [[T. J. Miller]]), 27, was Rob's best friend and inadvertently filmed nearly the entire attack by the monster.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HORMlVMgY1Q YouTube - ''Cloverfield'' T.J.

The next morning, he is killed by the monster.\n\nHud himself was also originally to have survived, but producer [[J. J. Abrams]] suggested having him getting eaten by the monster, allowing the audience to vicariously experience this. The scene was then planned as having Hud be eaten instantly after turning around, but it was decided that the audience deserved a clearer look at the monster, which resulted in the longer shot with the monster leaning down to inspect Hud before biting and killing him.<ref>''[[Cloverfield]]'' - (Special Features: \"The Making Of ''Cloverfield'').

During the evacuation of Manhattan, the monster attacks the helicopter he, Beth and Rob are in, causing it to crash. His ultimate fate is unknown. Stahl-David reprises his role in ''The Cloverfield Files'', in which he is revealed to have become Vice-President of Tagruato.\n\n* Jason Hawkins (played by [[Mike Vogel]]), 28, is Rob's older brother and boyfriend of Lily. He is killed when the monster attacks the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] during the evacuation of Manhattan.\n\n* Beth McIntyre (played by [[Odette Annable]]), 23, is the long-time platonic friend of Rob Hawkins. After a heated argument between Beth and Rob during his farewell party, she and a friend Travis leave the party. Upon the monster's arrival, however, she becomes trapped in her father's apartment during the onslaught. After Rob, Hudson, and Lily rescue her, she, along with Rob and Hud, board a helicopter that is treated to a bird's eye view of the assault on the monster, but is attacked in the process. She survives the monster attack and crash. After the death of Hud, she and Rob take cover under a nearby bridge and make a final recording, professing their love towards each other and letting whoever watches the video know who they are, and what happened. The bridge is then destroyed by the bombs used in the attempt to kill the monster. Her ultimate fate is unknown.\n\n* Ganu Yoshida is the C.E.O. of [[Tagruato]]. He is attacked in New York City by a group that he suspects is [[T.I.D.O. Wave]] weeks after the Chuai Station sinks in the Atlantic and just before the monster attacks.\n\n* Jenn and Antonio (played by Margot Farley and [[Theo Rossi]]) are close friends of Rob Hawkins. Jenn and her boyfriend Antonio are seen frequently through the party, showing that both are close friends with Hud as well. They are both last seen in the streets soon after Jason makes the decision to cross the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] from [[Manhattan]]. Their ultimate fate remains unknown.\n\n* Charlie (played by [[Brian Klugman]]) first appears prominently in the [[teaser trailer]]; towards the beginning of the trailer he directs the comment \"You owe me eleven dollars,\" to Rob. Charlie again appears at the very end of the trailer, stating \"This is going to be the best night ever!\" which is not seen in the film. He also appears in the extended [[theatrical trailer]], though briefly, and is only visible during the short party scene at the beginning. He is not seen again for the rest of the film and his ultimate fate is unknown.\n\n* Travis Marello (played by [[Ben Feldman (actor)|Ben Feldman]]) is Beth's new boyfriend. He is seen in the party with Beth, which upsets Rob. According to the Special Investigation Mode on the ''Cloverfield'' Blu-ray release, Travis drives home to New Jersey before the end of the party and thus survives the attack.\n\n* Sergeant Pryce helps the group by allowing them to go search for Beth and afterwards escorting them to a chopper. He is last seen entering a departing Humvee as [[Clover (creature)|the monster]] attacks the evacuation site. His fate is unknown.\n\n* Heather (played by [[Liza Lapira]]) is a girl at the party and a close friend of Lily. She is seen multiple times during the party. Heather is then seen in the streets as the monster rampages where Rob, Hud, Lily, Marlena, Jason and the other party guests, and onlookers are standing watching the destruction. Her ultimate fate is unknown.\n\n===''Cloverfield/Kishin''===\n{{Main|Cloverfield/Kishin}}\n* Kishin Aiba is a troubled boy who had been repeatedly tormented by a couple of bullies in a public restroom within their school. Although he is saved from humiliation by a girl named Aiko Sasahara, they continue their activities with him and decide to leave him within the confines of an emergency safety house. He has a long history of being bullied due to his mother being \"strange\", and along with her, he is badly ridiculed. When his mother died, he was so stricken with grief that even into his teens, he wished he had died with her. His emotional torment continues, while at the same time the monster begins to surface within Tagruato's oceans. He later escapes the school grounds with Aiko's help after seeing news coverage about the monster. Here, the two bond together while on their way to Kishin's apartment to seek shelter, only to stumble across an unknown cult bent on using him for a dark purpose tied to the monster.\n\nAs shown in some panels, Kishin and his father are not on good terms. Medical records seen in his father's room, along with the cult tracking him down, heavily imply that Kishin is part of a series of experiments with an item revered by the cult, which ties him to [[Clover (creature)|the monster]], itself. In the third chapter, it is seen that his system has been mixed with the monster's in a tiny organ called the Splinter of Amnion, which allows him to control it without falling victim to its wrath. Kishin's father confirms this as an act of sabotage by his mother, who uses Kishin as a vessel under the cult's orders, but dies by Tagruato's hands.\n\nKishin succumbs to madness due to the betrayal of his mother, and now uses the monster to cause more destruction. He is able to control the monster without it harming him, it thinking him its kin or brethren. In the final chapter, with the help of Aiko, Kishin regains his sanity and learns to value his life and the lives of others. He faces the monster, whereupon it moves the Splinter of Amnion from his system to its own. But as it cannot feed on the emotions Kishin has laced it with, it leaves Kishin in the seas of Japan, where he is rescued by Aiko and the bullies. The manga ends as they embrace, Kishin having finally found the one thing he cares for in his life.\n\n* Yoko Aiba is Kishin's mother. In the manga she is ostracized by both children and adults because of her eccentric nature. It is later revealed that she is part of the cult that worships the monster. She is deeply attached to her son, and comforts him during troubled times. She cares little for her own wellbeing so long as her son believes in her. She dies having been targeted by Tagruato, leaving her son alone and in emotional pain for most of his life. During her time with Kishin's father, she obtains a biological device and places it inside Kishin, giving him the ability to control the monster.\n\n* Aiko Sasahara is Kishin Aiba's classmate. She keeps an uptight attitude but is optimistic despite her troubled past with her parents. Her father has died two years prior to the story and her mother is an abusive drunk who exploits her husband's finances over their daughter's well-being. She is determined to live life on her own terms. She has a deep fear of rodents/mice. She and Kishin are fans of one of the popstars promoting Tagruato's product Slusho! named Yuki. Aiko's role is greatly expanded in the final chapter, wherein she helps bring Kishin's sanity back by confessing her feelings to him. She escapes the school with Kishin after hearing a report about the monster's rampage on the coastline of Japan, and bonds with Kishin. They arrive at Kishin's residence where two unknown men from a cult come looking for him. She tries to seek help but to no avail, and is instead escorted to a shelter by the cult's underlings. However, her mind is still set on saving Kishin. She is thrown out of the shelter by the very same group that bullies Kishin. Unlike Kishin, she has some physical prowess and is able to defeat the monster's parasites without bites or injuries. Fighting off the monster's parasites, she comes upon Kishin and the monster causing destruction in Japan. She, Kishin and the bullies hold off the parasites while Kishin leaves to deal with the monster. The monster, unable to feed on the stimuli of Kishin's emotions due to his love for Aiko, leaves him in the sea of Japan. Aiko and the bullies rescue him as the monster retreats back into the ocean. The manga ends with Kishin and Aiko embracing in the wake of the disaster.\n\n* Kurosaki is a sailor who unknowingly escorts the monster in one of Tagruato's ships. He is a father-to-be and loves to show off pictures of his wife and unborn child to his fellow unit, much to their chagrin, and longs to return home and see his family again. When the monster escapes Tagruato's grasp, he and his unit attempt to fight off the beast while waiting for backup; they fail miserably. He gives his last transmission calling for an airstrike, and laments his death while musing at his wife's picture before the monster claws its way through the ship's hull, devouring him. Before his death, it was heavily implied that he and his unit did not know of the monster's existence until the attack, despite having been briefed about the classified mission.\n\n* Mr. Aiba is Kishin's father. He is revealed to be head of Tagruato's research, and has connections to the Slusho! drink. He is callous and cares little for his son, and therefore the two are not on good terms. He saves Kishin from the cult and reveals to Kishin his true purpose and his tie to the monster, but attempts to destroy him before the monster can get to Kishin. He fails as the monster shields Kishin from harm. Mr. Aiba is the researcher and developer of the Splinter of Amnion, a biological orb that controls the monster.\n\n* Three unnamed individuals bully Kishin because of his mother's eccentricity. They take deep pleasure in tormenting Kishin throughout the manga. Kishin, with the help of Aiko, evades them on the second chapter. They are seen again in the shelter where the parasites rush into the city and purge its citizens. They play a large role in the final chapter with Kishin and Aiko, when one begs to be spared and is saved only by Aiko's intervention. With Aiko's help, they hold the parasites off until Kishin stops the monster.\n\n* Yuki is a famous popstar in the ''Cloverfield'' universe. He is first introduced in the second chapter promoting the Slusho! drink. Aiko Sasahara admires Yuki's performances and is surprised that Kishin has some connections to him.\n\n* The Cult are a mysterious group of fanatics who abduct Kishin, wishing to use him in some unknown experiments. Their goal is to make Kishin a vessel for controlling the monster to purify Japan, which they believe has been tainted by human society. They also worship the creature itself, implying that they have known of its existence long before Tagruato or the Japanese government. Most are killed by Kishin's father. Kishin's mother is affiliated with the cult prior to conceiving her son, having entered a relationship with one of Tagruato's staff.\n\n===''10 Cloverfield Lane''===\n{{Main|10 Cloverfield Lane}}\n* Michelle (played by [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]) is a young woman who leaves New Orleans and drives through rural Louisiana after an argument with her fianc\u00e9, Ben, that ends with her ending their relationship. Late at night, she turns on the radio and hears of continuous blackouts in major cities. Distracted by a call from Ben, Michelle gets into an accident and is rendered unconscious. She wakes up in a concrete room chained to a wall, and is approached by a man named Howard, who explains that an unknown attack has taken place and that he brought her to his bunker after finding her on the side of the road. Michelle struggles with accepting the idea that some type of war has left the Earth uninhabitable, and fights to know the truth about what is really going on.\n\n* Howard Stambler (played by [[John Goodman]]) is a man who brings Michelle to an underground bunker following her car accident. He explains that he has saved her from an unknown attack that has taken place and that left the surface uninhabitable. Michelle doubts his motives and his story about what is occurring on the surface. Stambler is later shown to be mentally unstable, and kills Emmett. During Michelle's escape attempt she kicks over a barrel of [[perchloric acid]], which causes an electrical fire that kills Stambler. A viral marketing site used to promote the film states that Howard was Tagruato Corporation's Employee of the Month in February 2016.<ref>[http://tagruato.jp/employee_of_the_month_2016_february.php/ \"Tagruato Corporation - Employees of the Month: February 2016\"]. Retrieved February 10, 2016. Tagruato.jp is a website that was first used by the makers of Cloverfield in its [[viral marketing|viral marketing campaign]].</ref>\n\n* Emmett DeWitt (played by [[John Gallagher Jr.]]) is another survivor who witnessed the attack and fled to Howard's bunker. He helped build the bunker for Howard and confirms to Michelle that something dangerous and deadly is taking place at the surface. Howard later shoots Emmett in the face for wanting to construct a weapon, though Emmett was really covering for Michelle. Michelle later finds his corpse dissolving in [[perchloric acid]].\n\n* Ben (voiced by [[Bradley Cooper]]) is Michelle's ex-fianc\u00e9. Michelle abruptly breaks up with Ben at the start of the film after an argument and leaves town, leading to her car accident and her connection with Howard.\n\n* Leslie (played by [[Suzanne Cryer]]) is Howard's neighbour who begs to be let into the bunker when Michelle is trying to escape. Noticing that Leslie is suffering from severe skin lesions, Michelle realizes the air may not be safe, and refuses to open the door. Leslie dies.\n\n===''The Cloverfield Paradox''===\n{{Main|The Cloverfield Paradox}}\n* Ava Hamilton (played by [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]]) is a British communications officer aboard Cloverfield Station and Michael's wife. Losing her children to a fire that she inadvertently caused, she deals with grief from the loss with her husband, but ultimately goes aboard the Cloverfield Station.\n\n* Jason Kiel (played by [[David Oyelowo]]) is an American commander of the station.\n\n* Ernst Schmidt (played by [[Daniel Br\u00fchl]]) is a German physicist of the station.\n\n* Monk Acosta (played by [[John Ortiz]]) is a Brazilian doctor of the station.\n\n* Gordon Mundy (played by [[Chris O'Dowd]]) is an Irish engineer of the station.\n\n* Sasha Volkov (played by [[Aksel Hennie]]) is a Russian engineer of the station.\n\n* Ling Tam (played by [[Zhang Ziyi]]) is a Chinese engineer of the station.\n\n* Mina Jensen (played by [[Elizabeth Debicki]]) is an Australian engineer from a alternate timeline.\n\n* Michael Hamilton (played by [[Roger Davies (actor)|Roger Davies]]) is the husband of Ava.

These carbohydrates are composed of three principal monosaccharides: [[glucose]], [[fructose]] and [[galactose]]; in addition [[glycogen]] is the storage form of carbohydrates in humans. The failure to effectively use these molecules accounts for the majority of the inborn errors of human carbohydrates [[metabolism]].\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==By Carbohydrate ==\n\n===Glycogen and Glucose===\n{{main|Glycogen storage disease}}\nGlycogen storage diseases are enzyme deficiencies which impair [[Glycogenesis|glycogen synthesis]], [[Glycogenolysis|glycogen degradation]] or [[glycolysis]]. The two organs most commonly affected are the liver and the skeletal muscle. Glycogen storage diseases that affect the liver typically cause [[hepatomegaly]] and [[hypoglycemia]]; those that affect skeletal muscle cause exercise intolerance, progressive weakness and cramping.<ref>Jorde, et al.  2006.  Carbohydrate metabolism.  Medical Genetics.  3rd edition.  Chapter 7.  Biochemical genetics:Disorders of metabolism.  pp139-142.</ref>\n\n[[Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase]] deficiency affects step 2 of glycolysis. [[Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency]] affects step 5 of glycolysis. [[Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency]] affects step 7 of glycolysis. [[Pyruvate kinase deficiency]] affects the 10th and last step of glycolysis.\n\n[[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] affects the degradation of glucose in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is especially important in red blood cells.\n\nFor further information on [[#Glucose metabolism|inborn errors of glucose metabolism]] and [[#Glycogen metabolism|inborn errors of glycogen metabolism]] see below.\n\n===Lactose===\n{{See also|Lactose intolerance}} \n[[Lactose]] is a [[disaccharide]] sugar composed of [[galactose]] and glucose that is found in milk. Lactose can not be absorbed by the intestine and needs to be split in the small intestine into galactose and glucose by the enzyme called [[lactase]]; unabsorbed lactose can cause abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea.\n\nIn most mammals, production of lactase diminishes after infants are weaned from maternal milk. However, 5% to 90% of the human population possess an advantageous autosomal mutation in which lactase production persists after infancy. The geographic distribution of lactase persistence is concordant with areas of high milk intake. Lactase non-persistence is common in tropical and subtropical countries. Individuals with lactase non-persistency may experience nausea, bloating and diarrhea after ingesting dairy.\n\n====Galactose====\n[[Galactosemia]], the inability to metabolize [[galactose]] in liver cells, is the most common monogenic disorder of carbohydrate metabolism, affecting 1 in every 55,000 newborns.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} When galactose in the body is not broken down, it accumulates in tissues. The most common signs are [[failure to thrive]], hepatic insufficiency, cataracts and developmental delay. Long term disabilities include poor growth, [[mental retardation]], and ovarian failure in females.<ref>{{cite |title=Liver disease in children |authors=Frederick J. Suchy, Ronald J. Sokol, William F. Balistreri |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rGxPASmZWesC&pg=PA595&hl=en&ei=jb8yTIikMtOGnQeV-53WAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&f=false |pages=598 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 }}</ref>\n\nGalactosemia is caused by [[mutation]]s in the [[gene]] that makes the [[enzyme]] [[galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]].  Approximately 70% of galactosemia-causing alleles have a single [[missense mutation]] in exon 6.  A milder form of galactosemia, called [[Galactokinase deficiency]], is caused a lack of the enzyme [[UDP-glucose 4-epimerase|uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase]] which breaks down a byproduct of galactose. This type of is associated with cataracts, but does not cause growth failure, mental retardation, or hepatic disease.  Dietary reduction of galactose is also the treatment but not as severe as in patients with classical galactosemia.  This deficiency can be systemic or limited to red blood cells and leukocytes.\n\nScreening is performed by measuring GAL-1-P urydil transferase activity.  Early identification affords prompt treatment, which consists largely of eliminating dietary galactose.\n\n===Fructose===\n[[Fructose malabsorption]] is a digestive disorder in which absorption of [[fructose]] is impaired by deficient fructose carriers in the small intestine's enterocytes.\n\nThree autosomal recessive disorders impair [[Fructolysis|fructose metabolism in liver cells]]. The most common is caused by mutations in the gene encoding [[hepatic fructokinase]], an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the metabolism of dietary fructose. Inactivation of the hepatic fructokinase results in asymptomatic [[Essential fructosuria|fructosuria]].\n\n[[Hereditary fructose intolerance]] (HFI) results in poor feeding, failure to thrive, chronic liver disease and [[chronic kidney disease]], and death. HFI is caused by a deficiency of fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase in the liver, kidney cortex and small intestine. Infants and adults are asymptomatic unless they ingest fructose or sucrose.\n\nDeficiency of hepatic fructose 1,6-biphosphate (FBPase) causes impaired gluconeogenesis, hypoglycemia and severe metabolic acidemia. If patients are adequately supported beyond childhood, growth and development appear to be normal.\n\n[[Essential fructosuria]] is a clinically benign condition characterized by the incomplete metabolism of fructose in the liver, leading to its excretion in urine.\n\n== By affected system ==\n{{Dynamic list}}<!-- This list will probably never be complete -->\n\n=== Glucose metabolism ===\n\n==== Glycolysis ====\n\nThe [[metabolic pathway]] [[glycolysis]] is used by cells to break down carbohydrates like glucose (and various other [[monosaccharide|simple sugars]]) in order to extract energy from them. During glycolysis [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] (both an energy transport form used [[intracellular|inside cells]]) as well as [[pyruvate]] are produced.\n\nGlycolysis is taking place in the [[cytosol]], and the created pyruvate needs to be transported to the [[mitochondrion]], where further energy can extracted through the [[Lactate dehydrogenase|conversion of pyruvate]] to [[lactic acid|lactate]], and through the [[citric acid cycle|citric acid cycle (CAC)]] (see below, c.f. [[bioenergetic systems]]).\n\nThe liver can also create glucose ([[gluconeogenesis]], see below); during times of low carbohydrate supply from the digestive system, the liver creates glucose and supplies it to other organs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Christopher Charles|last2=Smith|first2=James|year=2016|title=Gluconeogenesis during endurance exercise in cyclists habituated to a long-term low carbohydrate high fat diet|volume= 594|issue= 15|pages= 4389\u20134405|journal=The Journal of Physiology|doi=10.1113/JP271934|pmid=26918583|pmc=4967730|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296055925|accessdate= }}</ref> Most enzymes of glycolysis also participate in gluconeogenesis, as it is mostly the reverse metabolic pathway of glycolysis; a deficiency of these liver enzymes will therefore impact both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. (Note: gluconeogenesis is taking place only in the liver and not in other cells like e.g. muscle cells.)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n |- valign=\"top\" \n !

Glycogen, which consists of branched [[polysaccharide|long chains]] made out of the [[monosaccharide|simple sugar]] [[glucose]], is an energy storage form for [[carbohydrate]]s in many human cells; this is most important in [[liver]], [[muscle]] and [[Astrocytes|certain brain cells]].\n\nThe monosaccharide [[glucose-6-phosphate]] (G-6-P) is typically the [[Substrate (chemistry)|input substance]] for glycogenesis. G-6-P is most commonly created from glucose by the action of the [[enzyme]]s [[glucokinase]] (see glycolysis step 1) or [[hexokinase]].\n\nThrough the action of several enzymes glycogen is build up:<!--Taken from [[Glycogenesis]] -->\n* G-6-P is converted into [[glucose-1-phosphate]] (G-1-P) by the action of [[phosphoglucomutase]] (PGM), passing through the obligatory intermediate [[glucose-1,6-bisphosphate]].\n* G-1-P is converted into [[UDP-glucose]] by the action of the enzyme [[UTP\u2014glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase|UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase]] (UGP).\n* The enzyme [[glycogenin]] (GYG) is needed to create initial short glycogen chains, which are lengthened and branched by the other enzymes of glycogenesis.\n* Once eight glucose have been added to the glycogen chain, then [[glycogen synthase]] (GYS) can bind to the growing glycogen chain and add UDP-glucose to lengthen the glucogen chain.\n* Branches are made by [[glycogen branching enzyme]] (GBE), which transfers the end of the chain onto an earlier part, forming branches; these grow further grow by addition of more units.\n\nOn an alternative metabolic pathway the simple sugar [[galactose]] (Gal, which is typically derived from [[lactose]]) is converted by the enzyme [[galactokinase]] (GALK) to [[galactose-1-phosphate]] (Gal-1-P), which in turn is converted by the enzyme [[galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]] (GALT) to [[glucose-1-phosphate]] (G-1-P), which can also serve as input for glycogenesis \u2013 this bypasses the first step of glycogenesis (the enzyme [[phosphoglucomutase]] PGM).\n\nErrors in glycogenesis can have different consequences on a cellular level:\n* Too little glycogen is produced, e.g. in GSD 0\n* The glycogen is badly formed and inaccessible, typically accumulating in the affected cells (e.g. polyglucosan bodies).\nDepending on the affected cells and the extent of the deficiency, a wide range of symptoms and severities are the result.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n |- valign=\"top\" \n !

These carbohydrates are composed of three principal monosaccharides: [[glucose]], [[fructose]] and [[galactose]]; in addition [[glycogen]] is the storage form of carbohydrates in humans. The failure to effectively use these molecules accounts for the majority of the inborn errors of human carbohydrates [[metabolism]].\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==By Carbohydrate ==\n\n===Glycogen and Glucose===\n{{main|Glycogen storage disease}}\nGlycogen storage diseases are enzyme deficiencies which impair [[Glycogenesis|glycogen synthesis]], [[Glycogenolysis|glycogen degradation]] or [[glycolysis]]. The two organs most commonly affected are the liver and the skeletal muscle. Glycogen storage diseases that affect the liver typically cause [[hepatomegaly]] and [[hypoglycemia]]; those that affect skeletal muscle cause exercise intolerance, progressive weakness and cramping.<ref>Jorde, et al.  2006.  Carbohydrate metabolism.  Medical Genetics.  3rd edition.  Chapter 7.  Biochemical genetics:Disorders of metabolism.  pp139-142.</ref>\n\n[[Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase]] deficiency affects step 2 of glycolysis. [[Triosephosphate isomerase deficiency]] affects step 5 of glycolysis. [[Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency]] affects step 7 of glycolysis. [[Pyruvate kinase deficiency]] affects the 10th and last step of glycolysis.\n\n[[Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency]] affects the degradation of glucose in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is especially important in red blood cells.\n\nFor further information on [[#Glucose metabolism|inborn errors of glucose metabolism]] and [[#Glycogen metabolism|inborn errors of glycogen metabolism]] see below.\n\n===Lactose===\n{{See also|Lactose intolerance}} \n[[Lactose]] is a [[disaccharide]] sugar composed of [[galactose]] and glucose that is found in milk. Lactose can not be absorbed by the intestine and needs to be split in the small intestine into galactose and glucose by the enzyme called [[lactase]]; unabsorbed lactose can cause abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, and nausea.\n\nIn most mammals, production of lactase diminishes after infants are weaned from maternal milk. However, 5% to 90% of the human population possess an advantageous autosomal mutation in which lactase production persists after infancy. The geographic distribution of lactase persistence is concordant with areas of high milk intake. Lactase non-persistence is common in tropical and subtropical countries. Individuals with lactase non-persistency may experience nausea, bloating and diarrhea after ingesting dairy.\n\n====Galactose====\n[[Galactosemia]], the inability to metabolize [[galactose]] in liver cells, is the most common monogenic disorder of carbohydrate metabolism, affecting 1 in every 55,000 newborns.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} When galactose in the body is not broken down, it accumulates in tissues. The most common signs are [[failure to thrive]], hepatic insufficiency, cataracts and developmental delay. Long term disabilities include poor growth, [[mental retardation]], and ovarian failure in females.<ref>{{cite |title=Liver disease in children |authors=Frederick J. Suchy, Ronald J.

Approximately 70% of galactosemia-causing alleles have a single [[missense mutation]] in exon 6.  A milder form of galactosemia, called [[Galactokinase deficiency]], is caused a lack of the enzyme [[UDP-glucose 4-epimerase|uridine diphosphate galactose-4-epimerase]] which breaks down a byproduct of galactose. This type of is associated with cataracts, but does not cause growth failure, mental retardation, or hepatic disease.  Dietary reduction of galactose is also the treatment but not as severe as in patients with classical galactosemia.  This deficiency can be systemic or limited to red blood cells and leukocytes.\n\nScreening is performed by measuring GAL-1-P urydil transferase activity.  Early identification affords prompt treatment, which consists largely of eliminating dietary galactose.\n\n===Fructose===\n[[Fructose malabsorption]] is a digestive disorder in which absorption of [[fructose]] is impaired by deficient fructose carriers in the small intestine's enterocytes.\n\nThree autosomal recessive disorders impair [[Fructolysis|fructose metabolism in liver cells]]. The most common is caused by mutations in the gene encoding [[hepatic fructokinase]], an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the metabolism of dietary fructose. Inactivation of the hepatic fructokinase results in asymptomatic [[Essential fructosuria|fructosuria]].\n\n[[Hereditary fructose intolerance]] (HFI) results in poor feeding, failure to thrive, chronic liver disease and [[chronic kidney disease]], and death. HFI is caused by a deficiency of fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase in the liver, kidney cortex and small intestine. Infants and adults are asymptomatic unless they ingest fructose or sucrose.\n\nDeficiency of hepatic fructose 1,6-biphosphate (FBPase) causes impaired gluconeogenesis, hypoglycemia and severe metabolic acidemia. If patients are adequately supported beyond childhood, growth and development appear to be normal.\n\n[[Essential fructosuria]] is a clinically benign condition characterized by the incomplete metabolism of fructose in the liver, leading to its excretion in urine.\n\n== By affected system ==\n{{Dynamic list}}<!-- This list will probably never be complete -->\n\n=== Glucose metabolism ===\n\n==== Glycolysis ====\n\nThe [[metabolic pathway]] [[glycolysis]] is used by cells to break down carbohydrates like glucose (and various other [[monosaccharide|simple sugars]]) in order to extract energy from them. During glycolysis [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]] (both an energy transport form used [[intracellular|inside cells]]) as well as [[pyruvate]] are produced.\n\nGlycolysis is taking place in the [[cytosol]], and the created pyruvate needs to be transported to the [[mitochondrion]], where further energy can extracted through the [[Lactate dehydrogenase|conversion of pyruvate]] to [[lactic acid|lactate]], and through the [[citric acid cycle|citric acid cycle (CAC)]] (see below, c.f. [[bioenergetic systems]]).\n\nThe liver can also create glucose ([[gluconeogenesis]], see below); during times of low carbohydrate supply from the digestive system, the liver creates glucose and supplies it to other organs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Christopher Charles|last2=Smith|first2=James|year=2016|title=Gluconeogenesis during endurance exercise in cyclists habituated to a long-term low carbohydrate high fat diet|volume= 594|issue= 15|pages= 4389\u20134405|journal=The Journal of Physiology|doi=10.1113/JP271934|pmid=26918583|pmc=4967730|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296055925|accessdate= }}</ref> Most enzymes of glycolysis also participate in gluconeogenesis, as it is mostly the reverse metabolic pathway of glycolysis; a deficiency of these liver enzymes will therefore impact both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Glycogen, which consists of branched [[polysaccharide|long chains]] made out of the [[monosaccharide|simple sugar]] [[glucose]], is an energy storage form for [[carbohydrate]]s in many human cells; this is most important in [[liver]], [[muscle]] and [[Astrocytes|certain brain cells]].\n\nThe monosaccharide [[glucose-6-phosphate]] (G-6-P) is typically the [[Substrate (chemistry)|input substance]] for glycogenesis. G-6-P is most commonly created from glucose by the action of the [[enzyme]]s [[glucokinase]] (see glycolysis step 1) or [[hexokinase]].\n\nThrough the action of several enzymes glycogen is build up:<!--Taken from [[Glycogenesis]] -->\n* G-6-P is converted into [[glucose-1-phosphate]] (G-1-P) by the action of [[phosphoglucomutase]] (PGM), passing through the obligatory intermediate [[glucose-1,6-bisphosphate]].\n* G-1-P is converted into [[UDP-glucose]] by the action of the enzyme [[UTP\u2014glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase|UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase]] (UGP).\n* The enzyme [[glycogenin]] (GYG) is needed to create initial short glycogen chains, which are lengthened and branched by the other enzymes of glycogenesis.\n* Once eight glucose have been added to the glycogen chain, then [[glycogen synthase]] (GYS) can bind to the growing glycogen chain and add UDP-glucose to lengthen the glucogen chain.\n* Branches are made by [[glycogen branching enzyme]] (GBE), which transfers the end of the chain onto an earlier part, forming branches; these grow further grow by addition of more units.\n\nOn an alternative metabolic pathway the simple sugar [[galactose]] (Gal, which is typically derived from [[lactose]]) is converted by the enzyme [[galactokinase]] (GALK) to [[galactose-1-phosphate]] (Gal-1-P), which in turn is converted by the enzyme [[galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase]] (GALT) to [[glucose-1-phosphate]] (G-1-P), which can also serve as input for glycogenesis \u2013 this bypasses the first step of glycogenesis (the enzyme [[phosphoglucomutase]] PGM).\n\nErrors in glycogenesis can have different consequences on a cellular level:\n* Too little glycogen is produced, e.g. in GSD 0\n* The glycogen is badly formed and inaccessible, typically accumulating in the affected cells (e.g. polyglucosan bodies).\nDepending on the affected cells and the extent of the deficiency, a wide range of symptoms and severities are the result.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n |- valign=\"top\" \n !

Muscle cells in contrast do not have the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase, so they cannot share their glycogen stores with the rest of the body.\n\nIn addition to glycogen breakdown with the glycogen debranching enzyme and the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme, cells also use the enzyme [[acid alpha-glucosidase]] in [[lysosome]]s to degrade glycogen.\n\nAn deficiency of an involved enzyme results in:\n* Accumulation of glycogen in the cells\n* Lack of cellular energy negatively affects the involved organs\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n |- valign=\"top\" \n !

response===\n''MacGyver'' has received generally negative reviews from television critics, with many comparing it poorly to the original and some praising and criticizing CBS for making it an updated show. ''Variety'' wrote: \"Lucas Till\u2019s performance as the title character misses the mark completely; even when MacGyver explains the contraptions he builds on the fly via voiceovers, Till\u2019s delivery is wooden and clunky. The writing doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the pilot script is full of silly plot short-cuts and painfully cheesy lines \u2014 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the new version of the character has very little appeal.... George Eads does what he can to bring a bit of energy to the MacGyver spy crew, but it\u2019s a futile effort. MacGyver may know a lot about chemistry, but this unmemorable team has none.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ryan|first1=Maureen|title=TV Review: 'Lethal Weapon' and 'MacGyver'|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/reviews/lethal-weapon-macgyver-tv-review-damon-wayans-clayne-crawford-1201860866/|accessdate=September 24, 2016|website=[[Variety.com]]|date=September 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''[[USA Today]]'' wrote: \"If... you\u2019re looking for something approaching the original\u2019s simple DIY charms \u2014 or, for that matter, something even marginally original \u2014 look elsewhere.

Trained as an [[Bomb disposal|EOD technician]] for the Army, Mac prefers to use non-lethal means to stop his enemies; he is never without his trusty [[Swiss Army knife]] and uses anything in his environment to his advantage.

He also has history with Riley, because he was once in a relationship with her mother and had an altercation with her deadbeat father. While mostly easy-going and laid-back, Jack can get serious when the situation calls for it and often calls upon his special operations training to help the team get out of a tight spot.

show. ''Variety'' wrote: \"Lucas Till\u2019s performance as the title character misses the mark completely; even when MacGyver explains the contraptions he builds on the fly via voiceovers, Till\u2019s delivery is wooden and clunky.

The nature of this doctrine prevented them from understanding how diseases actually progressed, with predictable consequences.

In Book IV of the ''El-Kanun'', Ibn Sina discussed [[epidemics]], outlining the classical [[miasma theory]] and attempting to blend it with his own early contagion theory.

The diseases were categorised based on how they were transmitted, and how long they could lie dormant.\n\n===The Early Modern Period===\n\nItalian physician [[Francesco Redi]] provided early evidence against [[spontaneous generation]]. He devised an experiment in 1668 in which he used three jars. He placed a [[meatloaf]] and egg in each of the three jars. He had one of the jars open, another one tightly sealed, and the last one covered with gauze. After a few days, he observed that the meatloaf in the open jar was covered with maggots, and the jar covered with gauze had maggots on the surface of the gauze. However, the tightly sealed jar had no maggots inside or outside it. He also noticed that the maggots were found only on surfaces that were accessible by flies. From this he concluded that spontaneous generation is not a plausible theory.\n\nMicroorganisms are said to have been first directly observed in the 1670s by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], an early pioneer in [[microbiology]], considered \"the Father of Microbiology\". Leeuwenhoek is said to be the first to see and describe bacteria (1674), yeast plants, the teeming life in a drop of water (such as algae), and the circulation of blood corpuscles in capillaries. The word \"bacteria\" didn't exist yet, so he called these microscopic living organisms \"animalcules\", meaning \"little animals\". Those \"very little animalcules\" he was able to isolate from different sources, such as rainwater, pond and well water, and the human mouth and intestine. Yet German Jesuit priest and scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]] may have observed such microorganisms prior to this. One of his books written in 1646 contains a chapter in Latin, which reads in translation \"Concerning the wonderful structure of things in nature, investigated by Microscope\", stating \"who would believe that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms.\" Kircher defined the invisible organisms found in decaying bodies, meat, milk, and secretions as \"worms\". His studies with the microscope led him to the belief, which he was possibly the first to hold, that disease and putrefaction (decay) were caused by the presence of invisible living bodies. In 1646, Kircher (or \"Kirchner\", as it is often spelled), wrote that \"a number of things might be discovered in the blood of fever patients\". When Rome was struck by the bubonic plague in 1656, Kircher spent days on end caring for the sick. Searching for a cure, Kircher investigated the blood of plague victims under the microscope. He noted the presence of \"little worms\" or \"animalcules\" in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by microorganisms. He was the first to attribute infectious disease to a microscopic pathogen, inventing the germ theory of disease, which he outlined in his ''Scrutinium pestis physico-medicum'' (Rome 1658).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjt.org/exhibits/kircher.html|title=The Life and Work of Athanaseus Kircher, S.J.|work=mjt.org|access-date=18 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417200844/http://www.mjt.org/exhibits/kircher.html|archive-date=17 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Kircher's conclusion that disease was caused by microorganisms was correct, although it is likely that what he saw under the microscope were in fact red or white blood cells and not the plague agent itself. Kircher also proposed hygienic measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, quarantine, burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing facemasks to prevent the inhalation of germs. It was Kircher who first proposed that living beings enter and exist in the blood.\n\nIn 1700, physician [[Nicolas Andry]] argued that microorganisms he called \"worms\" were responsible for [[smallpox]] and other diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The History of the Germ Theory|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume= 1 |year=1888|page=312 |issue= 1415 | url = https://archive.org/stream/britishmedicaljo11888brit#page/312/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\nIn 1720, [[Richard Bradley (botanist)|Richard Bradley]] theorised that the plague and 'all pestilential distempers' were caused by 'poisonous insects', living creatures viewable only with the help of microscopes.<ref name=Santer>Melvin Santer, \"Richard Bradley: A Unified, Living Agent Theory of the Cause of Infectious Diseases of Plants, Animals, and Humans in the First Decades of the 18th Century\", in ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine'', Volume 52, Number 4, Autumn, 2009, pp. 566\u201378</ref>\n\nIn 1762, the Austrian physician Marcus Antonius von Plenciz (1705\u20131786) published a book titled ''Opera medico-physica''. It outlined a theory of contagion stating that specific [[animalcule]]s in the soil and the air were responsible for causing specific diseases. Von Plenciz noted the distinction between diseases which are both epidemic and contagious (like measles and dysentery), and diseases which are contagious but not epidemic (like rabies and leprosy).<ref>Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory (1967).

Ultimately, the theory espoused by von Plenciz was not accepted by the scientific community.\n\n=== Agostino Bassi ===\nThe Italian [[Agostino Bassi]] was the first person to prove that a disease was caused by a microorganism when he conducted a series of experiments between 1808 and 1813, demonstrating that a \"vegetable parasite\" caused a disease in silkworms known as ''calcinaccio'' which was devastating the French silk industry at the time. The \"vegetable parasite\" is now known to be a fungus pathogenic to insects called ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'' (named after Bassi).\n\n=== Ignaz Semmelweis ===\n[[Ignaz Semmelweis]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[obstetrician]] working at the [[Vienna General Hospital]] (''Allgemeines Krankenhaus'') in 1847, noticed the dramatically high maternal mortality from [[puerperal fever]] following births assisted by doctors and medical students. However, those attended by [[midwives]] were relatively safe. Investigating further, Semmelweis made the connection between puerperal fever and examinations of delivering women by doctors, and further realized that these physicians had usually come directly from [[autopsies]]. Asserting that puerperal fever was a [[Contagious disease|contagious]] disease and that matter from autopsies were implicated in its development, Semmelweis made doctors wash their hands with chlorinated lime water before examining pregnant women.  He then documented a sudden reduction in the mortality rate from 18% to 2.2% over a period of a year.  Despite this evidence, he and his theories were [[Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis|rejected]] by most of the contemporary medical establishment.\n\n=== Gideon Mantell ===\n\n[[Gideon Mantell]], the Sussex doctor more famous for discovering [[dinosaur fossils]], spent time with his microscope, and speculated in his ''Thoughts on Animalcules'' (1850) that perhaps \"many of the most serious maladies which afflict humanity, are produced by peculiar states of invisible animalcular life\".<ref>From p. 90 of \"The invisible world revealed by the microscope or, thoughts on animalcules.\", second edition, 1850 (May have appeared in first edition, too.

Even though the germ theory of disease pioneered by Girolamo Fracastoro had not yet achieved full development or widespread currency, Snow demonstrated a clear understanding of germ theory in his writings.  He first published his theory in an 1849 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera,''  in which he correctly suggested that the [[fecal-oral route]] was the mode of communication, and that the disease replicated itself in the lower intestines.  He even proposed in his 1855 edition of the work, that the structure of cholera was that of a cell.\n\n{{bquote|Having rejected effluvia and the poisoning of the blood in the first instance, and being led to the conclusion that'' ''the disease is something that acts directly on the alimentary canal, the excretions of the sick at once suggest themselves as containing some material which being accidentally swallowed might attach itself to the mucous membrane of the small intestines, and there multiply itself by appropriation of surrounding matter, in virtue of molecular changes going on within it, or capable of going on, as soon as it is placed in congenial circumstances.||John Snow (1849)}}\n\n{{bquote|For the morbid matter of cholera having the property of reproducing its own kind, must necessarily have some sort of structure, most likely that of a cell.  It is no objection to this view that the structure of the cholera poison cannot be recognized by the microscope, for the matter of smallpox and of chancre can only be recognized by their effects, and not by their physical properties.||John Snow (1855)}}\n\nSnow's 1849 recommendation that water be \"filtered and boiled before it is used\" is one of the first practical applications of germ theory in the area of public health and is the antecedent to the modern [[boil-water advisory]].\n\nIn 1855 he published a second edition of his article, documenting his more elaborate investigation of the effect of the water supply in the [[Soho]], London epidemic of 1854.\n\nBy talking to local residents, he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle. This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Snow |title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera |location=London |publisher=J. Churchill |year=1849 |url=http://resource.nlm.nih.gov/0050707 |quote=There is no doubt that the mortality was much diminished, as I said before, by the flight of the population, which commenced soon after the outbreak; but the attacks had so far diminished before the use of the water was stopped, that it is impossible to decide whether the well still contained the cholera poison in an active state, or whether, from some cause, the water had become free from it}}</ref>\n\nSnow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump. He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as one of the founding events of the science of [[epidemiology]].\n\nLater, researchers discovered that this public well had been dug only three feet from an old [[cesspit]], which had begun to leak fecal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The diapers of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.\n\nAfter the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the handle on the Broad Street pump. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward, they rejected Snow's theory. To accept his proposal would have meant accepting the fecal-oral method transmission of disease, which they dismissed.<ref>{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Chapelle |chapter=Ch. 5: Hidden Life, Hidden Death |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGVzCQgjEIC&pg=PA82 |title=Wellsprings |location=New Brunswick NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8135-3614-9 |pages=82}}</ref>\n\n=== Louis Pasteur ===\n[[File:Louis Pasteur Experiment.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Louis Pasteur's pasteurization experiment illustrates the fact that the spoilage of liquid was caused by particles in the air rather than the air itself.

He exposed freshly boiled broth to air in vessels that contained a filter to stop all particles passing through to the growth medium, and even with no filter at all, with air being admitted via a long tortuous tube that would not pass dust particles. Nothing grew in the broths: therefore the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than being generated within the broth.\n\nPasteur discovered that another serious disease of silkworms, ''[[p\u00e9brine]]'', was caused by a small microscopic organism now known as ''[[Nosema bombycis]]'' (1870). Pasteur saved France's silk industry by developing a method to screen silkworms eggs for those that were not infected, a method that is still used today to control this and other silkworm diseases.\n\n=== Robert Koch ===\n[[Robert Koch]] is known for developing four basic criteria (known as [[Koch's postulates]]) for demonstrating, in a scientifically sound manner, that a disease is caused by a particular organism.

Eventually, a \"golden era\" of [[bacteriology]] ensued, during which the germ theory quickly led to the identification of the actual organisms that cause many diseases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/cholera_prevailingtheories_a2.html|title=Brief History During the Snow Era|work=ucla.edu|access-date=1 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117060701/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/cholera_prevailingtheories_a2.html|archive-date=17 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/3035/Germ-Theory.html|title=Germ Theory|work=jrank.org|access-date=1 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131183451/http://science.jrank.org/pages/3035/Germ-Theory.html|archive-date=31 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Miasma theory ==\n[[File:Cholera art.jpg|thumb|A representation by [[Robert Seymour (illustrator)|Robert Seymour]] of the cholera epidemic depicts the spread of the disease in the form of poisonous air.]]\n{{Main|Miasma theory}}\n\nThe miasma theory was the predominant theory of disease transmission before the germ theory took hold towards the end of the 19th century, and it is no longer accepted as a scientific theory of disease.

In Book IV of the ''El-Kanun'', Ibn Sina discussed [[epidemics]], outlining the classical [[miasma theory]] and attempting to blend it with his own early contagion theory. He mentioned that people can transmit disease to others by breath, noted contagion with [[tuberculosis]], and discussed the transmission of disease through water and dirt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Byrne |first1=Joseph Patrick |title=Encyclopedia of the Black Death |date=2012 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=9781598842531 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5KtDfvlSrDAC&pg=PA29}}</ref> \n\nThe concept of invisible contagion was later discussed by several [[Islamic scholars]] in the [[Ayyubid Sultanate]] who referred to them as ''[[najasat]]'' (\"impure substances\"). The [[fiqh]] scholar [[Ibn al-Haj al-Abdari]] (c. 1250\u20131336), while discussing [[Islamic dietary laws|Islamic diet]] and [[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence|hygiene]], gave warnings about how contagion can contaminate water, food, and garments, and could spread through the water supply, and may have implied contagion to be unseen particles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Megan H. |title=Law and Piety in Medieval Islam |date=2013 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=9781107067110 |pages=106, 114, 189\u2013190 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5fJ4AAAAQBAJ}}</ref> When the [[Black Death]] [[bubonic plague]] reached [[Al-Andalus]] in the 14th century, the Arab physicians Ibn Khatima (c. 1369) and [[Ibn al-Khatib]] (1313\u20131374) hypothesised that infectious diseases were caused by \"minute bodies\" and described how they can be transmitted through garments, vessels and earrings.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Majeed |first1=Azeem |title=How Islam changed medicine |journal=[[BMJ]] |date=22 December 2005 |volume=331 |issue=7531 |pages=1486\u20131487 |doi=10.1136/bmj.331.7531.1486 |pmid=16373721 |url=https://www.bmj.com/content/331/7531/1486/rapid-responses |issn=0959-8138|pmc=1322233 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the early Middle Ages, [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560\u2013636) mentioned \"plague-bearing seeds\" (''pestifera semina'') in his ''On the Nature of Things'' (c.

The diseases were categorised based on how they were transmitted, and how long they could lie dormant.\n\n===The Early Modern Period===\n\nItalian physician [[Francesco Redi]] provided early evidence against [[spontaneous generation]]. He devised an experiment in 1668 in which he used three jars. He placed a [[meatloaf]] and egg in each of the three jars. He had one of the jars open, another one tightly sealed, and the last one covered with gauze. After a few days, he observed that the meatloaf in the open jar was covered with maggots, and the jar covered with gauze had maggots on the surface of the gauze. However, the tightly sealed jar had no maggots inside or outside it. He also noticed that the maggots were found only on surfaces that were accessible by flies. From this he concluded that spontaneous generation is not a plausible theory.\n\nMicroorganisms are said to have been first directly observed in the 1670s by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], an early pioneer in [[microbiology]], considered \"the Father of Microbiology\". Leeuwenhoek is said to be the first to see and describe bacteria (1674), yeast plants, the teeming life in a drop of water (such as algae), and the circulation of blood corpuscles in capillaries. The word \"bacteria\" didn't exist yet, so he called these microscopic living organisms \"animalcules\", meaning \"little animals\". Those \"very little animalcules\" he was able to isolate from different sources, such as rainwater, pond and well water, and the human mouth and intestine. Yet German Jesuit priest and scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]] may have observed such microorganisms prior to this. One of his books written in 1646 contains a chapter in Latin, which reads in translation \"Concerning the wonderful structure of things in nature, investigated by Microscope\", stating \"who would believe that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms.\" Kircher defined the invisible organisms found in decaying bodies, meat, milk, and secretions as \"worms\". His studies with the microscope led him to the belief, which he was possibly the first to hold, that disease and putrefaction (decay) were caused by the presence of invisible living bodies. In 1646, Kircher (or \"Kirchner\", as it is often spelled), wrote that \"a number of things might be discovered in the blood of fever patients\". When Rome was struck by the bubonic plague in 1656, Kircher spent days on end caring for the sick. Searching for a cure, Kircher investigated the blood of plague victims under the microscope. He noted the presence of \"little worms\" or \"animalcules\" in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by microorganisms. He was the first to attribute infectious disease to a microscopic pathogen, inventing the germ theory of disease, which he outlined in his ''Scrutinium pestis physico-medicum'' (Rome 1658).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mjt.org/exhibits/kircher.html|title=The Life and Work of Athanaseus Kircher, S.J.|work=mjt.org|access-date=18 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417200844/http://www.mjt.org/exhibits/kircher.html|archive-date=17 April 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Kircher's conclusion that disease was caused by microorganisms was correct, although it is likely that what he saw under the microscope were in fact red or white blood cells and not the plague agent itself. Kircher also proposed hygienic measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, quarantine, burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing facemasks to prevent the inhalation of germs. It was Kircher who first proposed that living beings enter and exist in the blood.\n\nIn 1700, physician [[Nicolas Andry]] argued that microorganisms he called \"worms\" were responsible for [[smallpox]] and other diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The History of the Germ Theory|journal=The British Medical Journal|volume= 1 |year=1888|page=312 |issue= 1415 | url = https://archive.org/stream/britishmedicaljo11888brit#page/312/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\nIn 1720, [[Richard Bradley (botanist)|Richard Bradley]] theorised that the plague and 'all pestilential distempers' were caused by 'poisonous insects', living creatures viewable only with the help of microscopes.<ref name=Santer>Melvin Santer, \"Richard Bradley: A Unified, Living Agent Theory of the Cause of Infectious Diseases of Plants, Animals, and Humans in the First Decades of the 18th Century\", in ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine'', Volume 52, Number 4, Autumn, 2009, pp. 566\u201378</ref>\n\nIn 1762, the Austrian physician Marcus Antonius von Plenciz (1705\u20131786) published a book titled ''Opera medico-physica''. It outlined a theory of contagion stating that specific [[animalcule]]s in the soil and the air were responsible for causing specific diseases. Von Plenciz noted the distinction between diseases which are both epidemic and contagious (like measles and dysentery), and diseases which are contagious but not epidemic (like rabies and leprosy).<ref>Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory (1967).

Ultimately, the theory espoused by von Plenciz was not accepted by the scientific community.\n\n=== Agostino Bassi ===\nThe Italian [[Agostino Bassi]] was the first person to prove that a disease was caused by a microorganism when he conducted a series of experiments between 1808 and 1813, demonstrating that a \"vegetable parasite\" caused a disease in silkworms known as ''calcinaccio'' which was devastating the French silk industry at the time. The \"vegetable parasite\" is now known to be a fungus pathogenic to insects called ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]'' (named after Bassi).\n\n=== Ignaz Semmelweis ===\n[[Ignaz Semmelweis]], a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[obstetrician]] working at the [[Vienna General Hospital]] (''Allgemeines Krankenhaus'') in 1847, noticed the dramatically high maternal mortality from [[puerperal fever]] following births assisted by doctors and medical students. However, those attended by [[midwives]] were relatively safe. Investigating further, Semmelweis made the connection between puerperal fever and examinations of delivering women by doctors, and further realized that these physicians had usually come directly from [[autopsies]]. Asserting that puerperal fever was a [[Contagious disease|contagious]] disease and that matter from autopsies were implicated in its development, Semmelweis made doctors wash their hands with chlorinated lime water before examining pregnant women.  He then documented a sudden reduction in the mortality rate from 18% to 2.2% over a period of a year.  Despite this evidence, he and his theories were [[Contemporary reaction to Ignaz Semmelweis|rejected]] by most of the contemporary medical establishment.\n\n=== Gideon Mantell ===\n\n[[Gideon Mantell]], the Sussex doctor more famous for discovering [[dinosaur fossils]], spent time with his microscope, and speculated in his ''Thoughts on Animalcules'' (1850) that perhaps \"many of the most serious maladies which afflict humanity, are produced by peculiar states of invisible animalcular life\".<ref>From p. 90 of \"The invisible world revealed by the microscope or, thoughts on animalcules.\", second edition, 1850 (May have appeared in first edition, too.

Even though the germ theory of disease pioneered by Girolamo Fracastoro had not yet achieved full development or widespread currency, Snow demonstrated a clear understanding of germ theory in his writings.  He first published his theory in an 1849 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera,''  in which he correctly suggested that the [[fecal-oral route]] was the mode of communication, and that the disease replicated itself in the lower intestines.  He even proposed in his 1855 edition of the work, that the structure of cholera was that of a cell.\n\n{{bquote|Having rejected effluvia and the poisoning of the blood in the first instance, and being led to the conclusion that'' ''the disease is something that acts directly on the alimentary canal, the excretions of the sick at once suggest themselves as containing some material which being accidentally swallowed might attach itself to the mucous membrane of the small intestines, and there multiply itself by appropriation of surrounding matter, in virtue of molecular changes going on within it, or capable of going on, as soon as it is placed in congenial circumstances.||John Snow (1849)}}\n\n{{bquote|For the morbid matter of cholera having the property of reproducing its own kind, must necessarily have some sort of structure, most likely that of a cell.  It is no objection to this view that the structure of the cholera poison cannot be recognized by the microscope, for the matter of smallpox and of chancre can only be recognized by their effects, and not by their physical properties.||John Snow (1855)}}\n\nSnow's 1849 recommendation that water be \"filtered and boiled before it is used\" is one of the first practical applications of germ theory in the area of public health and is the antecedent to the modern [[boil-water advisory]].\n\nIn 1855 he published a second edition of his article, documenting his more elaborate investigation of the effect of the water supply in the [[Soho]], London epidemic of 1854.\n\nBy talking to local residents, he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]). Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle. This action has been commonly credited as ending the outbreak, but Snow observed that the epidemic may have already been in rapid decline.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Snow |title=On the Mode of Communication of Cholera |location=London |publisher=J.

He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography. It is regarded as one of the founding events of the science of [[epidemiology]].\n\nLater, researchers discovered that this public well had been dug only three feet from an old [[cesspit]], which had begun to leak fecal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The diapers of a baby, who had contracted cholera from another source, had been washed into this cesspit. Its opening was originally under a nearby house, which had been rebuilt farther away after a fire. The city had widened the street and the cesspit was lost. It was common at the time to have a cesspit under most homes. Most families tried to have their raw sewage collected and dumped in the Thames to prevent their cesspit from filling faster than the sewage could decompose into the soil.\n\nAfter the cholera epidemic had subsided, government officials replaced the handle on the Broad Street pump. They had responded only to the urgent threat posed to the population, and afterward, they rejected Snow's theory. To accept his proposal would have meant accepting the fecal-oral method transmission of disease, which they dismissed.<ref>{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Chapelle |chapter=Ch. 5: Hidden Life, Hidden Death |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGVzCQgjEIC&pg=PA82 |title=Wellsprings |location=New Brunswick NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8135-3614-9 |pages=82}}</ref>\n\n=== Louis Pasteur ===\n[[File:Louis Pasteur Experiment.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Louis Pasteur's pasteurization experiment illustrates the fact that the spoilage of liquid was caused by particles in the air rather than the air itself.

He exposed freshly boiled broth to air in vessels that contained a filter to stop all particles passing through to the growth medium, and even with no filter at all, with air being admitted via a long tortuous tube that would not pass dust particles. Nothing grew in the broths: therefore the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, as spores on dust, rather than being generated within the broth.\n\nPasteur discovered that another serious disease of silkworms, ''[[p\u00e9brine]]'', was caused by a small microscopic organism now known as ''[[Nosema bombycis]]'' (1870). Pasteur saved France's silk industry by developing a method to screen silkworms eggs for those that were not infected, a method that is still used today to control this and other silkworm diseases.\n\n=== Robert Koch ===\n[[Robert Koch]] is known for developing four basic criteria (known as [[Koch's postulates]]) for demonstrating, in a scientifically sound manner, that a disease is caused by a particular organism.

The outgoing House continues in office until the newly elected House assumes office, but during this time the outgoing House does not have the power to make any laws or to take any decision on any matter, except in urgent and exceptional unforeseen circumstances.\n\nThe House may dissolve itself by its own decision before its term of office expires. When it so decides, it must also specify the date of the general elections which must not be less than 30 or more than 40 days from the date of such decision. In the event of the House dissolving itself it must also specify the date for the first meeting of the newly elected House, which must not be later than fifteen days after the general elections.\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Communities===\nAccording to article 62(1) of the Constitution the number of representatives is 50. Out of this number 35 are elected by the [[Greek Cypriot]] Community and 15 by the [[Turkish Cypriot]] Community.  However, since 1964, Turkish Cypriot members have not attended the House, and no elections have been held among the Turkish Cypriot community in accordance with the Republic's constitution. Despite this anomaly, the House has kept vacant the seats allocated to the Turkish Cypriot community. These seats remain at the disposal of Turkish Cypriot Deputies should they be elected according to the constitutional provisions.\n\nHowever, for the smooth running of the House of Representatives and of the Committees in particular, the House decided in July 1985 by adopting law 124, to increase the seats to 80. Of these 56 (70%) representatives are elected by the Greek Cypriot Community and 24 (30%) by the Turkish Cypriot Community, as provided in article 62(2) of the Constitution.  The decision was dictated by events because of the broadening of the activities of the House and its participation in many international parliamentary organisations; the number of 50 Representatives was not enough for the unhindered functioning of the legislative body and particularly the functioning of the parliamentary committees.\n\n===Seats by District===\nThe current electoral law provides for a simple proportional representation system. The number of seats in each constituency is determined by law with constituencies coinciding with [[Districts of Cyprus|administrative districts]].

They were conducted on the basis of the colonial legislation and in accordance with the majority electoral system. The Constitution stipulated that there should be fifty Representatives, thirty-five Greek (70%), elected by the Greek community, and fifteen Turkish (30%), elected by the Turkish community. The smooth functioning of the newly established House of Representatives was however impeded from the very beginning, due to the weaknesses of the Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus was a given one, worked out by a composite constitutional committee. Though it safeguards the fundamental freedoms and rights of the citizens, at the same time it comprises divisive elements that from the very outset acted as an impediment to the smooth course and development of the State. That happened for the parliament where the constitution provided the requirement for separate majorities of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot Representatives for any amendment of the electoral law and the adoption of legislation pertaining to the municipalities and the imposition of duties or taxes. Thus, a small number of Turkish Cypriot Representatives had the ability to block decisions pertaining to these matters.\n\nIn 1961 the Turkish Cypriot Representatives, making use of this right, voted against the bill for the extension of the taxation law and, subsequently, against the Income Tax Bill, leaving the Republic without pertinent income tax legislation for four years.\n\nFollowing intercommunal violence, which occurred in December 1963, the fifteen Turkish Cypriot Representatives withdrew from the House and their seats remain vacant to this day. All Turkish Cypriots holding state offices or posts in the civil service also withdrew.\n\nIn its subsequent terms of office, the House of Representatives assumed the additional task of collaborating with the executive authority, in order to enact special legislation for the equitable distribution of the burdens emanating from the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] and occupation, as well as to take other legislative measures aiming at the island\u2019s economic recovery and the relief of the missing persons\u2019 families and those persons displaced or adversely affected. Ever since it is actively involved, both at local and international levels, in the struggle of the people of Cyprus for a just and viable settlement in the [[Cyprus dispute]].\n\n==Election results==\n\n===2016 election===\n{{Main|Cypriot legislative election, 2016}}\n{{Cypriot legislative election, 2016}}\n\n===2011 election===\n{{Main|Cypriot legislative election, 2011}}\n{{Cypriot legislative election, 2011}}\n\n===2006 election===\n{{Main|Cypriot legislative election, 2006}}\n{{Cypriot legislative election, 2006}}\n\n===2001 election===\n{{Main|Cypriot legislative election, 2001}}\n{{Cypriot legislative election, 2001}}\n\n==Presidents of the House of Representatives==\nThe President of the House is Greek Cypriot and is elected by the Representatives elected by the Greek Cypriot community. The Vice-President is constitutionally provided for to be Turkish Cypriot and is elected by the Representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community. In case of temporary absence of the President or Vice-President of the House, their functions are performed by the eldest Representative of the respective community unless the Representatives of that community decide otherwise.

Seat allocation for the Greek Cypriot community are as follows:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"text-align: left;\"|Districts  !!style=\"text-align: right;\"|Seats\n|-\n|[[Nicosia District|Nicosia]]         ||style=\"text-align: right;\"|20\n|-\n|[[Limassol District|Limassol]]       ||style=\"text-align: right;\"|12\n|-\n|[[Famagusta District|Famagusta]]     ||style=\"text-align: right;\"|11\n|-\n|[[Larnaca District|Larnaca]]         ||style=\"text-align: right;\"|6\n|-\n|[[Paphos District|Paphos]]           ||style=\"text-align: right;\"|4\n|-\n|[[Kyrenia District|Kyrenia]]         ||style=\"text-align: right;\"|3\n|-\n!                                     !!style=\"text-align: right;\"|Total: 56\n|}\n\n==History==\nThe first [[Elections in Cyprus|parliamentary elections]] were held on 31 July 1960 and the elections for the Communal Chambers on 7 August 1960. They were conducted on the basis of the colonial legislation and in accordance with the majority electoral system. The Constitution stipulated that there should be fifty Representatives, thirty-five Greek (70%), elected by the Greek community, and fifteen Turkish (30%), elected by the Turkish community. The smooth functioning of the newly established House of Representatives was however impeded from the very beginning, due to the weaknesses of the Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus was a given one, worked out by a composite constitutional committee. Though it safeguards the fundamental freedoms and rights of the citizens, at the same time it comprises divisive elements that from the very outset acted as an impediment to the smooth course and development of the State. That happened for the parliament where the constitution provided the requirement for separate majorities of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot Representatives for any amendment of the electoral law and the adoption of legislation pertaining to the municipalities and the imposition of duties or taxes. Thus, a small number of Turkish Cypriot Representatives had the ability to block decisions pertaining to these matters.\n\nIn 1961 the Turkish Cypriot Representatives, making use of this right, voted against the bill for the extension of the taxation law and, subsequently, against the Income Tax Bill, leaving the Republic without pertinent income tax legislation for four years.\n\nFollowing intercommunal violence, which occurred in December 1963, the fifteen Turkish Cypriot Representatives withdrew from the House and their seats remain vacant to this day. All Turkish Cypriots holding state offices or posts in the civil service also withdrew.\n\nIn its subsequent terms of office, the House of Representatives assumed the additional task of collaborating with the executive authority, in order to enact special legislation for the equitable distribution of the burdens emanating from the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion]] and occupation, as well as to take other legislative measures aiming at the island\u2019s economic recovery and the relief of the missing persons\u2019 families and those persons displaced or adversely affected. Ever since it is actively involved, both at local and international levels, in the struggle of the people of Cyprus for a just and viable settlement in the [[Cyprus dispute]].\n\n==Election results==\n\n===2016 election===\n{{Main|Cypriot legislative election, 2016}}\n{{Cypriot legislative election, 2016}}\n\n===2011 election===\n{{Main|Cypriot legislative election, 2011}}\n{{Cypriot legislative election, 2011}}\n\n===2006 election===\n{{Main|Cypriot legislative election, 2006}}\n{{Cypriot legislative election, 2006}}\n\n===2001 election===\n{{Main|Cypriot legislative election, 2001}}\n{{Cypriot legislative election, 2001}}\n\n==Presidents of the House of Representatives==\nThe President of the House is Greek Cypriot and is elected by the Representatives elected by the Greek Cypriot community. The Vice-President is constitutionally provided for to be Turkish Cypriot and is elected by the Representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community. In case of temporary absence of the President or Vice-President of the House, their functions are performed by the eldest Representative of the respective community unless the Representatives of that community decide otherwise. Currently, the President of the House is [[Demetris Syllouris]].\n\nThe following people have been Presidents of the House<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.cy/el/photos/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AD%CF%83%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%82-%CF%80%CF%81%CF%8C%CE%B5%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B9-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B2%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AE%CF%82|title=Parliament Of Cyprus|website=www.parliament.cy}}</ref>\n* [[Glafkos Klerides]]: August 1960 \u2013 July 22, 1976\n* [[Tassos Papadopoulos]]: July 22, 1976 \u2013 September 20, 1976\n* [[Spyros Kyprianou]]: September 20, 1976 \u2013 September, 1977\n* [[Alekos Michaelides]]: September, 1977 \u2013 June 4, 1981\n* [[Georgios Ladas]]: June 4, 1981 \u2013 December 30, 1985\n* [[Vassos Lyssaridis]]: December 30, 1985 \u2013 May 30, 1991\n* [[Alexis Galanos]]: May 30, 1991 \u2013 June 6, 1996\n* [[Spyros Kyprianou]]: June 6, 1996 \u2013 June 7, 2001\n* [[Dimitris Christofias]]: June 7, 2001 \u2013 February 28, 2008\n* [[Marios Garoyian|Marios Karoyian]]: March 7, 2008 \u2013 June 2, 2011\n* [[Yiannakis Omirou]]: June 2, 2011 \u2013 June 2, 2016\n* [[Demetris Syllouris]]: June 2, 2016 \u2013 present\n\n==Members==\n*[[List of members of the parliament of Cyprus, 1981\u20131985]]\n*[[List of members of the parliament of Cyprus, 1985\u20131991]]\n*[[List of members of the parliament of Cyprus, 1991\u20131996]]\n*[[List of members of the parliament of Cyprus, 2001\u20132006]]\n*[[List of members of the parliament of Cyprus, 2006\u20132011]]\n*[[List of members of the parliament of Cyprus, 2011\u20132016]]\n*[[List of members of the parliament of Cyprus|List of members of the parliament of Cyprus, 2016\u2013present]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cyprus|Politics}}\n*[[Politics of Cyprus]]\n*[[List of legislatures by country]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.parliament.cy}}\n\n{{coord|35.1722|33.3546|type:landmark_region:CY|display=title}}\n\n{{Europe topic|Parliament of}}\n{{Asia topic|Parliament of}}\n{{National unicameral legislatures}}\n\n[[Category:House of Representatives (Cyprus)| ]]\n[[Category:Government of Cyprus]]\n[[Category:Parliaments by country|Cyprus]]\n[[Category:National legislatures|Cyprus]]\n[[Category:Unicameral legislatures|Cyprus]]\n[[Category:1960 establishments in Cyprus]]\n", "name_user": "KnolGua", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Cyprus)"}
