Maryam Amid was born in Semnan and studied primary education with her father. Later, she learned French and photography. At age 16, she married Hosseini Prince Mirza Emad al-Saltanah Salvar.  After only one year of marriage, Maryam secured a divorce. \n\nSeven years later, Maryam married an intellectual named Qawamul Hakmah. They had two kids together. Seven years after her marrige, Qawamul died leaving Maryam to raise their two children by herself.<ref> Truth, Abdul Rafiee. The first female journalist in Iran, Ghohar, numbers 11\u201312 (December 1973 \u2013 January 1974) .</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nMaryam did a lot of important things in her life. Maryam Amid Semnani published a [[women's magazine]] named ''Shokoufeh,'' which provided the opportunity for both women and men to be informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]]. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhetaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanuayeh Maziniyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by men. She translated several French books into the [[Persian language]].\n\n== The establishment of a girls\u2019 school ==\nThe establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and most enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to the patriarchal circumstances of society at the time and the reluctance of families to educate their daughters, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying. This was done for one out of every two students and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school until the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches and one of which was Dar al-'Elm. Various subjects were taught in this branch including reading, writing, mathematics, geography, and foreign languages. The condition of admission was passing a test held by the Ministry of Education. This branch was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in the Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nAt a time when reading and writing were uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, was published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. \n\nMaryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.\n\nThe following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools. Sometimes these were known in two levels.}}\n\n== Shokoufeh Newspaper ==\nThe ''Shokoufeh Newspaper'' was the second significant dedicated newspaper published for women after the Science Magazine (1910\u20131911) in 1913. This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper were written in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, originally consisted of four pages with the Traditional version in the writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also the final page of each issue was decorated with a [[caricature]], referring to the subject matter that the issue was about.  From the third year onward the caricatures were not included, after the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nThe Hemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired.

Maryam Amid was born in Semnan and studied primary education with her father. Later, she learned French and photography. At age 16, she married Hosseini Prince Mirza Emad al-Saltanah Salvar.  After only one year of marriage, Maryam secured a divorce. \n\nSeven years later, Maryam married an intellectual named Qawamul Hakmah. They had two kids together. Seven years after her marrige, Qawamul died leaving Maryam to raise their two children by herself.<ref> Truth, Abdul Rafiee. The first female journalist in Iran, Ghohar, numbers 11\u201312 (December 1973 \u2013 January 1974) .</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nMaryam Amid Semnani published a [[women's magazine]] named ''Shokoufeh,'' which provided the opportunity for both women and men to be informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]]. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhetaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanuayeh Maziniyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by men. She translated several French books into the [[Persian language]].\n\n== The establishment of a girls\u2019 school ==\nThe establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and most enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to the patriarchal circumstances of society at the time and the reluctance of families to educate their daughters, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying. This was done for one out of every two students and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school until the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches and one of which was Dar al-'Elm. Various subjects were taught in this branch including reading, writing, mathematics, geography, and foreign languages. The condition of admission was passing a test held by the Ministry of Education. This branch was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in the Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nAt a time when reading and writing were uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, was published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. \n\nMaryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.\n\nThe following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools. Sometimes these were known in two levels.}}\n\n== Shokoufeh Newspaper ==\nThe ''Shokoufeh Newspaper'' was the second significant dedicated newspaper published for women after the Science Magazine (1910\u20131911) in 1913. This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper were written in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, originally consisted of four pages with the Traditional version in the writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also the final page of each issue was decorated with a [[caricature]], referring to the subject matter that the issue was about.  From the third year onward the caricatures were not included, after the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nThe Hemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam.

Released in June 1973, it peaked at number 59 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] but hit big in the band's native Boston, where it was the number one single of the year on [[WMJX|WBZ-FM]], number five for the year on [[WRKO]] and number 16 on [[WMEX (AM)]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} The song also received immediate heavy airplay on the former WVBF (FM), often showing up in the #1 position on \"The Top Five At Five\" in June 1973.\n\nThe album version of \"Dream On\" (4:28, as opposed to the 3:25 1973 [[gramophone record|45rpm]] edit where most of the intro has been edited out and the first chorus is replaced with the second chorus) was re-issued in late 1975, debuting at number 81 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart on January 10, 1976, breaking into the Top 40 on February 14 and peaking at number 6 on April 10. [[Columbia Records]] chose to service Top 40 radio stations with both long and short versions of the song; thus, many 1976 pop radio listeners were exposed to the group's first Top 10 effort through the 45 edit.\n\n==Background==\n\"Dream On\" was first played live in [[Mansfield, Connecticut]], at the Shaboo Inn.<ref name=\"song\">[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1296 Song Facts \u2013 Dream On by Aerosmith], viewed May 24th 2017</ref>{{Unreliable source?|sure=y|date=January 2020}} In a 2011 interview, Tyler reminisced about his father, a [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]-trained musician. He recalled lying beneath his dad's piano as a three-year-old listening to him play classical music. \"That's where I got that ''Dream On'' chordage\", he said.<ref>\"The Emancipation of Steven Tyler\", ''Rolling Stone'', May 12, 2011.</ref>\n\nTyler says that this was the only song on the band's first album where he used his real voice.

At the same time, the Defence Commission reported the maintenance of the Fleet to be substandard. In this context, ''Charles de Gaulle'', then under repairs, was again an object of criticism, with former President [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] describing it as a \"half-aircraft-carrier\" and requesting launching of the second carrier vessel (named PA2) in order to guarantee an availability rate of 100%.\n\n===Link 16===\n{{main|Link 16}}\nOn 11 October 2001, the frigate {{ship|French frigate|Cassard|D 614|2}}, four [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] aircraft and ''Charles de Gaulle'' were involved in a successful trial of the [[Link 16]] high-bandwidth secure data network.

Inside the delimited space, nothing was happening or placed other than what was outside of it. The absurd enclosure lasted 54 days on the square. After such a long time, the artist himself contacted city officials. This work was connected to the pointing out the indifference to the use of public space and the unjustifiableness of certain restrictions associated with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-v-bourani-graffiti-je-indikator-opustenosti-mista-ale-i-svobody-5183544|title=Epos 257 v Bour\u00e1n\u00ed: Graffiti je indik\u00e1tor opu\u0161t\u011bnosti m\u00edsta, ale i svobody|date=2017-02-13|website=Radio Wave|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=Epic 257 in Demolition: Graffiti is an indicator of the abandonment of place, but also of freedom}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Portrait'' ===\nEpos 257 has also repeatedly devoted himself to [[billboard]]s.

Inside the delimited space, nothing was happening or placed other than what was outside of it. The absurd enclosure lasted 54 days on the square. After such a long time, the artist himself contacted city officials. This work was connected to the pointing out the indifference to the use of public space and the unjustifiability of certain restrictions associated with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-v-bourani-graffiti-je-indikator-opustenosti-mista-ale-i-svobody-5183544|title=Epos 257 v Bour\u00e1n\u00ed: Graffiti je indik\u00e1tor opu\u0161t\u011bnosti m\u00edsta, ale i svobody|date=2017-02-13|website=Radio Wave|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=Epic 257 in Demolition: Graffiti is an indicator of the abandonment of place, but also of freedom}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Portrait'' ===\nEpos 257 has also repeatedly devoted himself to [[billboard]]s.
