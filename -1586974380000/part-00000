In one model, diversification can be considered purely as a result of endogenous functionality (such as [[cell trafficking]]). However, it is more likely that diversification is driven by evasion of pathogen infection mechanism (e.g. ''[[Helicobacter]]'' attachment to terminal saccharide residues) and that diversity within the multicellular organism is then exploited endogenously.\n\n==Glycoprotein diversity==\n\nGlycosylation increases diversity in the [[proteome]], because almost every aspect of glycosylation can be modified, including:\n*[[Glycosidic bond]]\u2014the site of glycan linkage\n*Glycan composition\u2014the types of sugars that are linked to a given protein\n*Glycan structure\u2014can be unbranched or branched chains of sugars\n*Glycan length\u2014can be short- or long-chain oligosaccharides\n\n== Mechanisms ==\n\nThere are various mechanisms for glycosylation, although most share several common features:<ref name=\"varki\"/>\n*Glycosylation, unlike [[glycation]], is an enzymatic process.

In one model, diversification can be considered purely as a result of endogenous functionality (such as [[cell trafficking]]).

The ''N''-linked glycosylation process occurs in [[eukaryotes]] in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and widely in [[archaea]], but very rarely in [[bacteria]].

Usually, it acts as a versatile, less commitment fringe style and is considered by some to suit all types of faces. It can be worn as a full fringe or as a side swept fringe. Commonly, it is done by the point cutting technique, in which the shears are held vertically or slightly at an angle rather than a horizontally blunt cut. Unlike the typical straight across or full bangs, see-through can easily be concealed by its thinness without the trimmed portion even being noticed. Unlike the straight-across or side-swept styles, which each have their respective lengths, see-through can be of eyebrow length or even as long as side-swept or peekaboo bangs, where the hair can reach eye level. Unlike typical bangs that require high maintenance, such as brushing while being heavily blow-dried, ironing, and/or styling, see-through bangs need just a simple light combing with a narrow-toothed comb after a shower and light blow-drying.\n*'''Angled or asymmetrical bangs''': The bangs are cut into layers at an angle, such that there are different lengths of hair overlapping each other. The hair towards the hairline is usually longer than the hair above, creating a [[feathered hair|feathered]] effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MByu22Uvbj0/UgpqGBTOGjI/AAAAAAAADxM/AWuLMrekzGE/s1600/Tiffany.jpg |title=Photo |publisher=2.bp.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref>  It can also be cut into a side-swept style and brushed back to enhance the effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/68/7c/25/687c2515beafd6acea93c2369602aca1--hairstyles-for-round-faces-curly-hairstyles.jpg |title=Photo |publisher=i.pinimg.com |date= |accessdate=2019-11-13}}</ref>\n*'''Arch or rounded bangs''': A more rounded type of cut, in which the bangs form the shape on an arch, similar to a crescent moon shape pointing upward. The style is similar to full bangs but the bangs are longer as they approach the two sides of the forehead. Usually, it is achieved by twisting the hair on the fringe area using one's dominant hand and substituting it with the non-dominant hand to form a cross hair and underneath the fingers is the amount of hair that must be cut off.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sam Villa |url=http://www.samvilla.com/pro/blog/2013/02/perfecting-the-fringe-twist-cut-front-and-side-sweeping-fringes/ |title=Cutting The Perfect Fringe Using The Twist Bang Cut Technique |publisher=Sam Villa |date=2016-02-05 |accessdate=2016-09-04}}</ref> Usually, this style is thicker and looks heavier than straight-across bangs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dy6g3i6a1660s.cloudfront.net/Cl2tPU2OaTDZuNtL_mjHTAEsATs/orig.jpg |format=JPG |title=Photographic image |website=Dy6g3i6a1660s.cloudfront.net |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref>\n*'''Curtain bangs''': The hair is parted down the middle or slightly off center. It is rather similar to side-swept in terms of length and to see-through in terms of styling and thickness. It flows outwards the sides of the face and is commonly longer as it goes on the sides. Similar to arch/rounded fringe in structure yet longer in terms of length.\n*'''Baby or statement short bangs''': The hair is usually cut above the brows, normally bluntly across the middle of the forehead, but may be shorter. It usually complements a child's short haircut or a [[bob cut]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n*'''Brow-skimming or Textured bangs''': A style that falls below the brow and can look \"heavy\" or \"light\" on the face which is more of the uneven, choppy looking fringe to make a peek-a-boo effect on the forehead.<ref name=\"teamsugar\">{{cite web|url=http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl2/0/3987/09_2009/b4040ff9e1c6f05d_Lauren-Conrad.preview.jpg|title=Image: b4040ff9e1c6f05d_Lauren-Conrad.preview.jpg, (550 \u00d7 425 px)|publisher=images.teamsugar.com|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTiWm2MjrSNCH0vy3OZ63Ld7HZXK_s4TfilyJFKk1Uu2F_A15nj |title=Photographic image |website=Encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com |accessdate=2016-09-10}}</ref>\n\n==History and development==\nBangs occur naturally in many styles of short hair-cuts.\n\nHairstyles that feature bangs have come and gone out of fashion as frequently as other hairstyles, and they can be worn in any number of ways.

In October 2007, style icon and model [[Kate Moss]] changed her hairstyle to have bangs, signalling the continuation of the trend into 2008.<ref name=\"fashionising\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--Kate-Moss-gets-a-new-hairstyle-with-fringe-807.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029091825/http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--Kate-Moss-gets-a-new-hairstyle-with-fringe-807.html |archive-date=29 October 2007 |url-status=dead |title=Kate Moss gets a new hairstyle, with fringe - Fashionising.com |accessdate=5 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bowl cut]]\n*[[Mop top|Mop top haircut]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline}}\n\n{{Human hair}}\n\n[[Category:20th-century fashion]]\n[[Category:21st-century fashion]]\n[[Category:Hairstyles]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:1812:c6b:5200:894d:be8a:a80b:6d35", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangs_(hair)"}

{"title_page": "Houses of Hillel and Shammai", "text_new": "The '''House of Hillel (Beit Hillel)''' and '''House of Shammai (Beit Shammai)''' were, among Jewish scholars, two [[schools of thought]] during the period of [[tannaim]], named after the sages '''[[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]]''' and '''[[Shammai]]''' (of the last century BCE and the early 1st century [[Common Era|CE]]) who founded them. These two schools had vigorous debates on matters of ritual practice, ethics, and theology which were critical for the shaping of the Oral Law and Judaism as it is today.\n\nThe [[Mishnah]] mentions the disagreement of Hillel and Shammai as one which had lasting positive value:\n:A disagreement which is for the sake of Heaven will be preserved, and one which is not for the sake of Heaven will not be preserved. What is a disagreement that is for the sake of Heaven? The disagreement of Hillel and Shammai. That is not for the sake of Heaven? The disagreement of [[Korah]] and his congregation.<ref>[[Pirkei Avot]] 5:17</ref>\n\nIn most cases, though not always, Beit Hillel's opinion is the more lenient and tolerant of the two. In nearly all cases, Beit Hillel's opinion has been accepted as normative by [[halacha]], and is the opinion followed by modern Jews.\n\n==Halachic disputes==\n===Examples===\nOnly three (or, according to some authorities, five) disputes are recorded between Hillel and Shammai themselves.<ref>Shabbat 15a; Hagigah 2:2; Eduyot 1:2,3; Niddah 1:1</ref> However, with time the differences between their respective schools multiplied, to the point that hundreds of disputes between them are recorded in the [[Talmud]]. The split between them was so deep that, according to the Talmud, \"the [[Torah]] (Jewish law) became like two Torahs\".<ref>[[Tosefta]] Hagigah 2:9; [https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.88b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Sanhedrin 88b]; Sotah 47b</ref>\n\nThe matters they debated included:\n*Admission to Torah study: Beit Shammai believed only worthy students should be admitted to study Torah. Beit Hillel believed that Torah may be taught to anyone, in the expectation that they will repent and become worthy.<ref>[[Avot of Rabbi Natan]] 2:9</ref>\n*[[Lie#White lie|White lies]]: Whether one should tell an ugly bride that she is beautiful. Beit Shammai said it was wrong to lie, and Beit Hillel said that all brides are beautiful on their wedding day.<ref>Talmud, Ketubot 16b\u201317a</ref>\n*[[Religion and divorce#Judaism|Divorce]]: Beit Shammai held that a man may only divorce his wife for a serious transgression, but Beit Hillel allowed divorce for even trivial offenses, such as burning a meal.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, ''[[Gittin]]'' 90a</ref>\n*[[Hanukkah]]: Beit Shammai held that on the first night eight lights should be lit, and then they should decrease on each successive night, ending with one on the last night; while Beit Hillel held that one should start with one light and increase the number on each night, ending with eight. Beit Hillel's rationale is that as a general rule in [[halacha]], one increases holiness, rather than decreasing. Beit Shammai's opinion was based on the halachic principle that allows one to derive law using similarities.

The [[Mishna]] provides a list of 18 matters in which the halacha was decided in favor of Beit Shammai.<ref>[[Mishnah]] Shabbat 1:3</ref>\n\nAccording to one opinion in the Talmud, while halacha follows Beit Hillel, one may choose to follow either Beit Hillel or Beit Shammai as long as they do so consistently. However, if they follow the leniencies of both schools, they are considered evil; while if they follow the stringencies of both schools, the verse \"The fool walks in darkness\"<ref>{{Bibleref|Ecclesiastes|2:14|HE}}</ref> is applied to them.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rosh_Hashanah.14b.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Rosh Hashana 14b]</ref>\n\nAccording to the Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]], in the future messianic era halacha will follow Beit Shammai rather than Beit Hillel.<ref>[http://din.org.il/2013/12/02/%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%93-%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%95%D7%90-%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94-%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%99%D7%94-%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99/ \u05dc\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05de\u05d0\u05d9]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe political principles of Beit Shammai were similar to those of the [[Zealots]], among whom they therefore found support.<ref name=je/> As public indignation against the Romans grew over the course of the 1st century, Beit Shammai gradually gained the upper hand, and the gentle and conciliatory Beit Hillel came to be ostracised from Beit Shammai's public acts of prayer.<ref>Jost, \"Gesch. des Judenthums und Seiner Sekten,\" i. 261; [[Tosefta]] Rosh Hashana, end</ref>\n\nAs the Jewish conflict with the Romans grew,<ref>H.H.

These relations deteriorated seriously during Caligula's reign, and, though after his death the peace was outwardly re-established, considerable bitterness remained on both sides. ... Caligula ordered that a golden statue of himself be set up in the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]]. ... Only Caligula's death, at the hands of Roman conspirators (41), prevented the outbreak of a Jewish-Roman war that might well have spread to the entire [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]].\"</ref> the nations surrounding [[Judea]] (then part of Roman [[Iudaea province]]) all sided with the Romans, causing Beit Shammai to propose that all commerce and communication between Jew and Gentile should be completely prohibited.<ref name=je/> Beit Hillel disagreed, but when the [[Sanhedrin]] convened to discuss the matter, the Zealots sided with Beit Shammai.<ref name=je/> Then [[Eleazar ben Hanania]], the Temple captain and a leader of the militant Zealots, invited the students of both schools to meet at his house; Eleazar placed armed men at the door, and instructed them to let no-one leave the meeting. During the discussions Beit Shammai achieved a majority and were able to force all the remaining individuals to adopt a radically restrictive set of rules known as \"Eighteen Articles\"; later Jewish history came to look back on the occasion as a day of misfortune.<ref>[[Tosefta]] ''Shabbat'' 1:16 etc.; [https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.13b.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Shabbat 13a]; [https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.17a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=enShabbat 17a]</ref> According to one source, Beit Shammai obtained their majority either by killing members of Beit Hillel, or by intimidating them into leaving the room.<ref>Jerusalem Talmud, ''Shabbat'' 1:4 (3c)</ref>\n\nHowever, the fortunes of Beit Hillel improved after the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]], which had resulted in destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish Temple]]; Jewish leaders no longer had an appetite for war. Under [[Gamaliel II]], the Sanhedrin, which was reconstituted in [[Yavne]] (see also [[Council of Jamnia]]), reviewed all the points disputed by Beit Hillel, and this time it was their opinions which won the Sanhedrin's support; on most issues,<ref>[[Tosefta]] ''[[Yebamot]]'' 1:13; [[Jerusalem Talmud]] ''[[Berakhot (tractate)|Berakhot]]'' 1:3b</ref> it was said that whenever Beit Shammai had disputed the opinion of Beit Hillel, Beit Shammai's opinion was now null and void.<ref>''Berakhot'' 36b; ''Beitzah'' 11b; ''Yevamot'' 9a</ref>\n\nEven though the two schools had vigorous arguments, they respected each other. The Talmud even records that the constituents of the two schools intermarried\u2014despite their disagreements regarding the laws of [[marriage]] and [[divorce]].<ref>Yevamot 1:4</ref>\n\nIn later generations, a fast day was observed due to the conflict between the two houses,<ref>[[Halachot Gedolot]], laws of Tisha BeAv; [[Shulchan Aruch]], Orach Chaim 580</ref> though this fast day is no longer observed.<ref>[[Beit Yosef (book)|Beit Yosef]], Orach Chaim 580</ref> Various explanations are given of the tragedy which justified fasting: bloodshed which killed 3000 students;<ref>[[Elijah Spira|Eliyahu Rabbah]] 580:7; see also a [[Cairo Geniza]] fragment quoted in {{cite book |last=Margalioth |first=Mordecai |title=Hilkhot Erets Yisra'el min ha-Genizah|publisher=[[Mossad Harav Kook]] |date=1973 |location=Jerusalem|page=142 |language=he |oclc=19497945 }}</ref> or else the simple fact of the Torah being divided into two incompatible interpretations.<ref>[[Mordecai Yoffe|Levush]], Orach Chaim 580; see also Cairo Geniza fragments quoted [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Va7LwCoM0oCMYUDteECQpCZpwfij9jd6/view here]</ref>\n\n== Enactments ==\nThe Houses of Hillel and Shammai convened to discuss arcane matters of Jewish law and to decide on new measures thought essential to ensure a more universal adherence to Jewish law and practice. Together, they legislated many new enactments and passed new decrees, in an effort to ensure that the people of Israel not transgress the basic laws bequeathed to them by Moses. These enactments were, therefore, seen as safeguards by the rabbinic clergy. While some of these enactments are still binding today, others have been cancelled by scholars of later generations.\n\nAccording to [[Mishnah]] ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 1:4,<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]], (''Shabbat'' 13b)</ref> disciples of Hillel and Shammai met in parley within the home of the astute [[Hananiah ben Hezekiah ben Garon]] to vote on many new measures and to make them binding upon Israel. Not all decisions were gladly received by the [[School of Hillel]], but they were compelled to acquiesce unto the rulings by virtue of the greater numbers of the [[School of Shammai]], seeing that they were the unanimous party, and whose vote was the most consequential. The [[Chazal|Sages]] at the time looked with displeasure upon many of these new enactments and decrees, saying that they had gone too far and have \"filled-up the measure.\"<ref>[[Tosefta]] (''Shabbat'' 1:17)</ref><ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Shabbat'' 9a [1:4])</ref> Many of these rulings revolve around Israelites and their relationship to the [[Kohanim|priests]] who are required to eat their [[Terumah]] (Heave-offering) in a state of ritual purity.

In some places of Jewry, they continued to eat bread baked by non-Jews. The Jerusalem Talmud (''ibid''.) says that leaven belonging to gentiles, which had been in existence during the Passover and which was left over after the Passover, may be eaten by Israel after the Passover in those places where it was customary for Israel to eat bread that was baked by gentiles. Where it was not customary for Israel to eat bread baked by gentiles, Israel could not eat of their leaven which remained after the Passover. [[Maimonides]], in his commentary on [[Mishnah]] ''Pesahim'' 2:2, writes that, by this, the matter of eating bread baked by gentiles depends upon local custom. Maimonides writes further (Hil. ''Ma'achaloth Asuroth'' 17:12) that, in Spain, while it was not a custom to eat gentile bread which was baked in their homes, it was, however, a custom to eat gentile bread taken from the public bakery. The Jerusalem Talmud (''Shabbat'' 10a) permits the consumption of bread baked by the local non-Jewish baker where bread cannot otherwise be found for consumption, and that one's sustenance depended upon it.

These two schools had vigorous debates on matters of ritual practice, ethics, and theology which were critical for the shaping of the Oral Law and Judaism as it is today.\n\nThe [[Mishnah]] mentions the disagreement of Hillel and Shammai as one which had lasting positive value:\n:A disagreement which is for the sake of Heaven will be preserved, and one which is not for the sake of Heaven will not be preserved. What is a disagreement that is for the sake of Heaven? The disagreement of Hillel and Shammai. That is not for the sake of Heaven? The disagreement of [[Korah]] and his congregation.<ref>[[Pirkei Avot]] 5:17</ref>\n\nIn most cases, though not always, Beit Hillel's opinion is the more lenient and tolerant of the two. In nearly all cases, Beit Hillel's opinion has been accepted as normative by [[halacha]], and is the opinion followed by modern Jews.\n\n==Halachic disputes==\n===Examples===\nOnly three (or, according to some authorities, five) disputes are recorded between Hillel and Shammai themselves.<ref>Shabbat 15a; Hagigah 2:2; Eduyot 1:2,3; Niddah 1:1</ref> However, with time the differences between their respective schools multiplied, to the point that hundreds of disputes between them are recorded in the [[Talmud]]. The split between them was so deep that, according to the Talmud, \"the [[Torah]] (Jewish law) became like two Torahs\".<ref>[[Tosefta]] Hagigah 2:9; [https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.88b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Sanhedrin 88b]; Sotah 47b</ref>\n\nThe matters they debated included:\n*Admission to Torah study: Beit Shammai believed only worthy students should be admitted to study Torah. Beit Hillel believed that Torah may be taught to anyone, in the expectation that they will repent and become worthy.<ref>[[Avot of Rabbi Natan]] 2:9</ref>\n*[[Lie#White lie|White lies]]: Whether one should tell an ugly bride that she is beautiful. Beit Shammai said it was wrong to lie, and Beit Hillel said that all brides are beautiful on their wedding day.<ref>Talmud, Ketubot 16b\u201317a</ref>\n*[[Religion and divorce#Judaism|Divorce]]: Beit Shammai held that a man may only divorce his wife for a serious transgression, but Beit Hillel allowed divorce for even trivial offenses, such as burning a meal.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, ''[[Gittin]]'' 90a</ref>\n*[[Hanukkah]]: Beit Shammai held that on the first night eight lights should be lit, and then they should decrease on each successive night, ending with one on the last night; while Beit Hillel held that one should start with one light and increase the number on each night, ending with eight. Beit Hillel's rationale is that as a general rule in [[halacha]], one increases holiness, rather than decreasing. Beit Shammai's opinion was based on the halachic principle that allows one to derive law using similarities. The [[Sukkot]] [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] sacrifices involved 70 [[Cattle|bullocks]], reducing by one each day from 13 down to 7.<ref>Shabbat 21b</ref>\n* ''Tu Bishvat'': Beit Hillel holds that the new year for trees is on the 15th of the Jewish month of [[Shevat]]. Beit Shammai says it is on the 1st on Shevat.<ref>Mishnah Rosh Hashana 1:1</ref> Beit Hillel's opinion is now accepted, so the new year is commonly called [[Tu Bishvat]] (literally \"15th of Shevat\").\n* Forgetting to say grace after meals: Beit Shammai says that one who forgot to say [[Birkat Hamazon]], and had left the place where he ate, should return to that place to recite birkat hamazon. Beit Hillel says that one should recite birkat hamazon in the place where he realizes his omission.<ref>[[Mishnah]] Brachot 8:7</ref>\n\nBeit Shammai and Beit Hillel are, respectively, the eighth and ninth most frequently mentioned halachic authorities in the [[Mishnah]].<ref>Drew Kaplan, [http://drewkaplans.blogspot.com/2011/07/rabbinic-popularity-in-mishnah-vii-top.html \"Rabbinic Popularity in the Mishnah VII: Top Ten Overall &#91;Final Tally&#93;] ''Drew Kaplan's Blog'' (5 July 2011).</ref>\n\n===Discussion===\n\nIn general, Beit Shammai's positions were stricter than those of Beit Hillel.<ref name=je>Jewish Encyclopedia, [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3190-bet-hillel-and-bet-shammai Bet Hillel and Bet-Shammai]</ref> It was said that ''the school of Shammai [[binding and loosing|binds]]; the school of Hillel [[binding and loosing|looses]]'',<ref name=\"EncBib\">{{EncyclopaediaBiblica|article=BINDING AND LOOSING|section=Beth_Rehob-Box}}</ref>  On the few occasions when the opposite was true, Beit Hillel would sometimes later recant their position.<ref>[[Eduyot]] 1:12 etc; compare Weiss, \"Dor,\" i. 179 et seq.</ref> Similarly, though there are no records of Beit Shammai as a whole changing its stance, a few individuals from Beit Shammai are recorded as deserting a particular stringent opinion of their school, in favor of Beit Hillel's opinion.<ref>''[[Beitzah]]'' 20a; [[Jerusalem Talmud]] ''Hagigah'' 2 (78a)</ref>\n\nThe final law almost always coincides with Beit Hillel, not because they constituted the majority,<ref>Cf. [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''[[Chagigah]]'' 2:3 [12a]), where the School of Shammai had grown to be more numerous than the School of Hillel.</ref> but because Beit Hillel studied the view of their opponents, and because a Divine voice (''bat-kol'') was heard in [[Yavne-Yam|Yavne]] declaring a general rule of practice: \"Both schools espouse to the words of the living God, but the ''Halakhah'' follows the School of Hillel.\"<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''[[Eruvin]]'' 13b); [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Berakhot'' 1:4)</ref> Accordingly, halachic-practice was decided in favor of Beit Hillel since they were agreeable and forebearing (or more literally, piteous).<ref>[[Hebrew]]: '''\u05e0\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9\u05df \u05d5\u05e2\u05dc\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5'''</ref> Not only did they teach Beit Shammai's teachings, but they said them first before their own.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eruvin.13b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Eruvin 13b]</ref> The ruling in accordance with the teachings of the School of Hillel was also intended to bring conformity to Jewish practices. \n\nLater in the same passage (''Eruvin'' 13b) a disagreement is mentioned between the two schools, on whether it would have been more suitable (\u05e0\u05d5\u05d7) for man to have been created or not to have been created, with the school of Shammai taking the position that it would have been preferable if man had not been created. The passage then says something which seems to imply that the postion of the school of Shammai was accepted (\"\u05e0\u05de\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d2\u05de\u05e8\u05d5 \u05e0\u05d5\u05d7 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05d0 \u05e0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8 \u05de\u05e9\u05e0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\").\n\nModern day [[Rabbinic Judaism]] almost invariably follows the teachings of Hillel, but there are several notable exceptions. The [[Mishna]] provides a list of 18 matters in which the halacha was decided in favor of Beit Shammai.<ref>[[Mishnah]] Shabbat 1:3</ref>\n\nAccording to one opinion in the Talmud, while halacha follows Beit Hillel, one may choose to follow either Beit Hillel or Beit Shammai as long as they do so consistently. However, if they follow the leniencies of both schools, they are considered evil; while if they follow the stringencies of both schools, the verse \"The fool walks in darkness\"<ref>{{Bibleref|Ecclesiastes|2:14|HE}}</ref> is applied to them.<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rosh_Hashanah.14b.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Rosh Hashana 14b]</ref>\n\nAccording to the Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]], in the future messianic era halacha will follow Beit Shammai rather than Beit Hillel.<ref>[http://din.org.il/2013/12/02/%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%93-%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%95%D7%90-%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94-%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%99%D7%94-%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99/ \u05dc\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9\u05d3 \u05dc\u05d1\u05d5\u05d0 \u05d4\u05dc\u05db\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05db\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05de\u05d0\u05d9]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe political principles of Beit Shammai were similar to those of the [[Zealots]], among whom they therefore found support.<ref name=je/> As public indignation against the Romans grew over the course of the 1st century, Beit Shammai gradually gained the upper hand, and the gentle and conciliatory Beit Hillel came to be ostracised from Beit Shammai's public acts of prayer.<ref>Jost, \"Gesch. des Judenthums und Seiner Sekten,\" i. 261; [[Tosefta]] Rosh Hashana, end</ref>\n\nAs the Jewish conflict with the Romans grew,<ref>H.H. Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-674-39731-2}}, ''The Crisis Under Gaius Caligula'', pages 254-256: \"The reign of [[Gaius Caligula]] (37-41) witnessed the first open break between the Jews and the [[Julio-Claudian]] empire. Until then &mdash; if one accepts [[Sejanus]]' heyday and the trouble caused by the [[Census of Quirinius|census after Archelaus' banishment]] &mdash; there was usually an atmosphere of understanding between the Jews and the empire ... These relations deteriorated seriously during Caligula's reign, and, though after his death the peace was outwardly re-established, considerable bitterness remained on both sides. ... Caligula ordered that a golden statue of himself be set up in the [[Herod's Temple|Temple in Jerusalem]]. ... Only Caligula's death, at the hands of Roman conspirators (41), prevented the outbreak of a Jewish-Roman war that might well have spread to the entire [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]].\"</ref> the nations surrounding [[Judea]] (then part of Roman [[Iudaea province]]) all sided with the Romans, causing Beit Shammai to propose that all commerce and communication between Jew and Gentile should be completely prohibited.<ref name=je/> Beit Hillel disagreed, but when the [[Sanhedrin]] convened to discuss the matter, the Zealots sided with Beit Shammai.<ref name=je/> Then [[Eleazar ben Hanania]], the Temple captain and a leader of the militant Zealots, invited the students of both schools to meet at his house; Eleazar placed armed men at the door, and instructed them to let no-one leave the meeting. During the discussions Beit Shammai achieved a majority and were able to force all the remaining individuals to adopt a radically restrictive set of rules known as \"Eighteen Articles\"; later Jewish history came to look back on the occasion as a day of misfortune.<ref>[[Tosefta]] ''Shabbat'' 1:16 etc.; [https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.13b.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Shabbat 13a]; [https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.17a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=enShabbat 17a]</ref> According to one source, Beit Shammai obtained their majority either by killing members of Beit Hillel, or by intimidating them into leaving the room.<ref>Jerusalem Talmud, ''Shabbat'' 1:4 (3c)</ref>\n\nHowever, the fortunes of Beit Hillel improved after the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]], which had resulted in destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish Temple]]; Jewish leaders no longer had an appetite for war. Under [[Gamaliel II]], the Sanhedrin, which was reconstituted in [[Yavne]] (see also [[Council of Jamnia]]), reviewed all the points disputed by Beit Hillel, and this time it was their opinions which won the Sanhedrin's support; on most issues,<ref>[[Tosefta]] ''[[Yebamot]]'' 1:13; [[Jerusalem Talmud]] ''[[Berakhot (tractate)|Berakhot]]'' 1:3b</ref> it was said that whenever Beit Shammai had disputed the opinion of Beit Hillel, Beit Shammai's opinion was now null and void.<ref>''Berakhot'' 36b; ''Beitzah'' 11b; ''Yevamot'' 9a</ref>\n\nEven though the two schools had vigorous arguments, they respected each other. The Talmud even records that the constituents of the two schools intermarried\u2014despite their disagreements regarding the laws of [[marriage]] and [[divorce]].<ref>Yevamot 1:4</ref>\n\nIn later generations, a fast day was observed due to the conflict between the two houses,<ref>[[Halachot Gedolot]], laws of Tisha BeAv; [[Shulchan Aruch]], Orach Chaim 580</ref> though this fast day is no longer observed.<ref>[[Beit Yosef]], Orach Chaim 580</ref> Various explanations are given of the tragedy which justified fasting: bloodshed which killed 3000 students;<ref>[[Elijah Spira|Eliyahu Rabbah]] 580:7; see also a [[Cairo Geniza]] fragment quoted in {{cite book |last=Margalioth |first=Mordecai |title=Hilkhot Erets Yisra'el min ha-Genizah|publisher=[[Mossad Harav Kook]] |date=1973 |location=Jerusalem|page=142 |language=he |oclc=19497945 }}</ref> or else the simple fact of the Torah being divided into two incompatible interpretations.<ref>[[Mordecai Yoffe|Levush]], Orach Chaim 580; see also Cairo Geniza fragments quoted [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Va7LwCoM0oCMYUDteECQpCZpwfij9jd6/view here]</ref>\n\n== Enactments ==\nThe Houses of Hillel and Shammai convened to discuss arcane matters of Jewish law and to decide on new measures thought essential to ensure a more universal adherence to Jewish law and practice. Together, they legislated many new enactments and passed new decrees, in an effort to ensure that the people of Israel not transgress the basic laws bequeathed to them by Moses. These enactments were, therefore, seen as safeguards by the rabbinic clergy. While some of these enactments are still binding today, others have been cancelled by scholars of later generations.\n\nAccording to [[Mishnah]] ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'' 1:4,<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]], (''Shabbat'' 13b)</ref> disciples of Hillel and Shammai met in parley within the home of the astute [[Hananiah ben Hezekiah ben Garon]] to vote on many new measures and to make them binding upon Israel. Not all decisions were gladly received by the [[School of Hillel]], but they were compelled to acquiesce unto the rulings by virtue of the greater numbers of the [[School of Shammai]], seeing that they were the unanimous party, and whose vote was the most consequential. The [[Chazal|Sages]] at the time looked with displeasure upon many of these new enactments and decrees, saying that they had gone too far and have \"filled-up the measure.\"<ref>[[Tosefta]] (''Shabbat'' 1:17)</ref><ref>[[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Shabbat'' 9a [1:4])</ref> Many of these rulings revolve around Israelites and their relationship to the [[Kohanim|priests]] who are required to eat their [[Terumah]] (Heave-offering) in a state of ritual purity.

In some places of Jewry, they continued to eat bread baked by non-Jews. The Jerusalem Talmud (''ibid''.) says that leaven belonging to gentiles, which had been in existence during the Passover and which was left over after the Passover, may be eaten by Israel after the Passover in those places where it was customary for Israel to eat bread that was baked by gentiles. Where it was not customary for Israel to eat bread baked by gentiles, Israel could not eat of their leaven which remained after the Passover. [[Maimonides]], in his commentary on [[Mishnah]] ''Pesahim'' 2:2, writes that, by this, the matter of eating bread baked by gentiles depends upon local custom. Maimonides writes further (Hil. ''Ma'achaloth Asuroth'' 17:12) that, in Spain, while it was not a custom to eat gentile bread which was baked in their homes, it was, however, a custom to eat gentile bread taken from the public bakery. The Jerusalem Talmud (''Shabbat'' 10a) permits the consumption of bread baked by the local non-Jewish baker where bread cannot otherwise be found for consumption, and that one's sustenance depended upon it.

The reason for this sudden enrollment drop in DCPS is that the Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 separated DC Public Charter Schools (DCPCS) from District of Columbia Public Schools.\n\nThe District of Columbia passed charter school legislation in 1996, which went into effect in September 1999.  The legislation gave the District the power to grant charters for 15 years.  Although this is longer than the traditional 3\u20135 year term observed in 31 other states, a required review takes place every 5 years. 4.4% of public school students enrolled in a charter school for the 1999 academic school year; the 28 schools had a total enrollment of approx. 3,000 students. After legislation was enacted in 2007, chartering authority was placed under the D.C. Public Charter School Board and disaffiliated from DCPS. The governance of DCPS was also restructured, and the district was placed under the [[Mayoral control of schools|control of the Mayor]]. In 2010 about 38% of Washington, D.C. public school students attended 60 [[charter schools]].<ref>{{Cite news | first=Michael | last=Birnbaum | title=Taking baby steps towards charter schools | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042704768.html| work= | publisher=Washington Pose | location=Washington, DC | pages= 18 in Casual Living | date=29 April 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> There are 52 public charter schools in the District, with 93 campuses and 30,000 students. The total number of public charter schools has been reduced from 60 schools on 96 campuses in 2008\u201309 to 53 schools on 98 campuses as of the 2011\u201312 school year. However, the addition of grades to the charter schools are still increasing enrollment and decreasing from DCPS\u2019 numbers.\n\n==Students==\n\n===Health===\nIn 2009, 43% of all DCPS public school students were overweight or obese. This was one of the highest rates in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Tim | last=Craig | title=D.C.

This constituted a large drop from the freshman graduation rate of 68.4% in 2002 and 68.8% as recently as 2005. In just the 2008\u201309 school year alone, 1,075 black students dropped out of high school. This figure raises concern since there were 1,246 students that dropped out of DCPS schools that year.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=Public School Graduates and Dropouts From the Common Core of Data: School Year 2008\u201309 | url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011312.pdf | work= National Center for Education Statistics| publisher=Institute of Education Sciences, Department of Education| location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date=2008\u20132009| id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nHowever, these numbers are not meant to be misleading; the 62.8% freshman graduation rate of black students in 2008 was above the state average.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Theodore Roosevelt High School, 13th St. in upper NW, Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Roosevelt Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in [[Petworth, Washington, D.C.|Petworth]].]]\nWithin DCPS, schools are classified as either a \"neighborhood school\" or a \"destination school.\" Neighborhood schools are elementary or secondary schools assigned to students based on his or her address. Destination schools are feeder-schools for elementary or secondary institutions from a school a student is already attending. Since the fall of 2009, students may choose a destination school, regardless of their neighborhood location. Locations of all of the schools and the neighborhood divides can be found on the DCPS website.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools--School Locator | url=http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/Learn+About+Schools/Find+Your+Assigned+Schools | work= | publisher=The Government of the District of Columbia | location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date= | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nFor the school year ending in spring 2007, the DCPS was governed by the [[District of Columbia State Board of Education|D.C. Board of Education]], with eleven members, including two students who had the right to debate but not to vote. Five members were elected and four were appointed by the Mayor. The Board established DCPS policies and employed a superintendent to serve as chief executive officer of the school district, responsible for day-to-day operations. Four Board members represented specific geographical boundaries and the Board President was elected at large. One condition of the District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 was the creation of DCPS as a separate cabinet-level agency from the D.C. Board of Education. This moved DCPS within the executive branch of the District of Columbia government\u2014specifically, under Mayoral control. Currently, this means that DCPS is subordinate to District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser. D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] proposed putting the public schools under the direct control of the Mayor's Office upon taking office in January 2007. However, this reform to District of Columbia Public Schools was encouraged by his predecessor and constituents at large. It also placed all of the District of Columbia public charter schools under the care of a new board\u2014District of Columbia Public Charter School Board (PCSB). Although these schools were previously a part of DCPS, they are now considered to be a separate district controlled by the D.C. Public Charter School Board (PCSB).\n\nThe D.C. Council passed the Mayor's proposal into law but since the change amended the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act|Home Rule Act]], the change needed to gain Federal approval before taking effect.  D.C. Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] introduced H.R. 2080, a bill to amend the D.C. Home Rule Charter Act to provide for the Mayor's proposal. H.R. 2080 was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] under an expedited procedure on May 8, 2007 by a voice vote. After three U.S. Senators ([[Ben Cardin]] of [[Maryland]], [[Mary Landrieu]] of [[Louisiana]], and [[Carl Levin]] of [[Michigan]]) initially placed \"holds\" on the bill to prevent its consideration in the [[United States Senate]], the Senate agreed to pass H.R. 2080 without amendment on May 22, 2007 by unanimous consent. On May 31, 2007, the bill was presented to the President and President Bush signed H.R. 2080 into law on June 1, 2007. After the standard Congressional review period expired on June 12, 2007, the Mayor's office had direct control of the Superintendent and the school budget.  On June 12, Mayor Fenty appointed [[Michelle Rhee]] the new Chancellor, replacing Superintendent [[Clifford B. Janey]].\n\n===D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003===\n{{Main|D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program}}\n\nIn January 2004, Congress passed the D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003. The law established a federally-funded private [[school voucher]] program known as the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP). The OSP distributes vouchers to low-income families to cover private school tuition. Because there are more eligible applicants than available vouchers, they are distributed by lottery. In 2010, a [[randomized controlled trial]] conducted under the auspices of the Department of Education examined the impacts of the OSP students, finding that it raised graduation rates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Patrick|title=Evaluation of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program: Final Report|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20104018/pdf/20104018.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Education -- Institute of Education Sciences}}</ref> Students who were offered vouchers had a graduation rate of 82%, while those who actually used their vouchers had a graduation rate of 91%.

Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007===\n\nThe Council of the District of Columbia enacted the DC Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007. This act established a DC public school agency based on authority given to the council in the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. The Department of Education that was established under the Mayor triggered several changes. The largest was already discussed\u2014DCPCS gained sole authority over chartering and charted schools, DCPS became subordinate to the Mayor's office. Secondly, many smaller authoritative changes took place. The first is that the State Education Office (SEO) became the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). The four subsections of the District were reaffirmed through location-based State Board of Education selectees. In addition, the smaller eight school election wards were reaffirmed. Finally, the Commission was established through this legislature. The \"Commission\" is the Interagency Collaboration and Services Integration Commission, which includes the Mayor, Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, Chief Judge of the DC Superior Family Court, Superintendent of Education, Chancellor of DCPS, Chair of DCPCSB and fourteen others.\nAfter the 2007\u20132008 school year, about one-fifth of the teachers and one-third of the principals resigned, retired, or were terminated from DCPS. A very strong negative impact was initially experienced by DCPS due to the loss. A [[GAO-conducted study]]<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools: Important Steps Taken to Continue Reform Efforts, But Enhanced Planning Could Improve Implementation and Sustainability| url=http://www.gao.gov/highlights/d09619high.pdf | work= Report to Congressional Requesters| publisher= United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) | location=Washington, DC | pages= | date=June 2009 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nrecommended that the Mayor direct DCPS to establish planning processes for strikes and look to performance reviews from central offices to strengthen accountability. These recommendations were followed and accountability has increased through academic and financial report generation.  Increased accountability made way for other small reforms. One example is the implementation of a requirement that students entering 9th grade are now required to sit down with a school counselor and construct a course-plan to reach graduation.\n\n==No Child Left Behind compliance==\n\nIn accordance with Section 1116, a provision of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB), entitled \"Academic Assessment and Local Education Agency and School Improvement\", the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) of the District of Columbia oversees compliance with [http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Adequate+Yearly+Progress+(AYP) Adequate Yearly Progress] (AYP). A large portion of meeting AYP is based on standardized-tests performance; the District used the [[summative assessment]] called the District of Columbia Comprehensive Assessment System (\"DC CAS\") through the 2013-2014 school year, after which it switched to tools from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers ([[PARCC]]) and the National Center and State Collaborative (NCSC).<ref>{{cite web|title=DC CAS|url=http://osse.dc.gov/service/dc-cas|website=Office of the State Superintendent of Education|publisher=Washington, DC|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How Students Are Assessed|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208040753/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|archive-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Assessment Glossary|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218022539/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|archive-date=February 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMany schools are failing to meet AYP, even though DCPS educators offer support and tools to students to be academically successful.{{citation needed|reason=this statement needs a source to back it up and has a slanted tone.|date=March 2015}} DCPS has created an evaluation tool to assess schools by more than their standardized test scores.

According to school choice researcher Erin Dillon, \"In its winning application for federal Race to the Top funds, DCPS, for example, touted its three models for autonomous schools: The aptly named 'Autonomous Schools,' which are granted autonomy as a reward for high performance; 'Partnership Schools,' which are run by outside organizations that are granted autonomy in the hope of dramatically improving performance; and the 'D.C. Collaborative for Change,' or DC3, a joint effort of some of the District\u2019s highest- and lowest-performing schools that have been granted autonomy as a tool for innovating with curriculum and professional development. (Meanwhile, highly autonomous charter schools, a growing presence in the District of Columbia, educate almost 40 percent of the city\u2019s public school students.)\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Dillon|first=Erin|title=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|url=http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|work=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|publisher=Education Sector|accessdate=27 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628123000/http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|archive-date=June 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===High schools===\n====Traditional high schools====\n[[File:Wilson-high-dc.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson High School (Washington, D.C.)|Woodrow Wilson High School]], Tenleytown]]\n[[File:Eastern Senior High School - Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]], Kingman Park]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"175\" | School name || Students* ||class=\"unsortable\"| Low grade ||class=\"unsortable\"| High grade\n|-\n| [[Anacostia High School]] || 449 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Ballou High School]] || 930 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Coolidge Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Calvin Coolidge High School]] || 346 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]] || 584 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]] || 818 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[H.D.

The reason for this sudden enrollment drop in DCPS is that the Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 separated DC Public Charter Schools (DCPCS) from District of Columbia Public Schools.\n\nThe District of Columbia passed charter school legislation in 1996, which went into effect in September 1999.  The legislation gave the District the power to grant charters for 15 years.  Although this is longer than the traditional 3\u20135 year term observed in 31 other states, a required review takes place every 5 years. 4.4% of public school students enrolled in a charter school for the 1999 academic school year; the 28 schools had a total enrollment of approx. 3,000 students. After legislation was enacted in 2007, chartering authority was placed under the D.C. Public Charter School Board and disaffiliated from DCPS. The governance of DCPS was also restructured, and the district was placed under the [[Mayoral control of schools|control of the Mayor]]. In 2010 about 38% of Washington, D.C. public school students attended 60 [[charter schools]].<ref>{{Cite news | first=Michael | last=Birnbaum | title=Taking baby steps towards charter schools | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042704768.html| work= | publisher=Washington Pose | location=Washington, DC | pages= 18 in Casual Living | date=29 April 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> There are 52 public charter schools in the District, with 93 campuses and 30,000 students. The total number of public charter schools has been reduced from 60 schools on 96 campuses in 2008\u201309 to 53 schools on 98 campuses as of the 2011\u201312 school year. However, the addition of grades to the charter schools are still increasing enrollment and decreasing from DCPS\u2019 numbers.\n\n==Students==\n\n===Health===\nIn 2009, 43% of all DCPS public school students were overweight or obese.

This constituted a large drop from the freshman graduation rate of 68.4% in 2002 and 68.8% as recently as 2005. In just the 2008\u201309 school year alone, 1,075 black students dropped out of high school. This figure raises concern since there were 1,246 students that dropped out of DCPS schools that year.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=Public School Graduates and Dropouts From the Common Core of Data: School Year 2008\u201309 | url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011312.pdf | work= National Center for Education Statistics| publisher=Institute of Education Sciences, Department of Education| location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date=2008\u20132009| id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nHowever, these numbers are not meant to be misleading; the 62.8% freshman graduation rate of black students in 2008 was above the state average.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Theodore Roosevelt High School, 13th St. in upper NW, Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Roosevelt Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in [[Petworth, Washington, D.C.|Petworth]].]]\nWithin DCPS, schools are classified as either a \"neighborhood school\" or a \"destination school.\" Neighborhood schools are elementary or secondary schools assigned to students based on his or her address. Destination schools are feeder-schools for elementary or secondary institutions from a school a student is already attending. Since the fall of 2009, students may choose a destination school, regardless of their neighborhood location. Locations of all of the schools and the neighborhood divides can be found on the DCPS website.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools--School Locator | url=http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/Learn+About+Schools/Find+Your+Assigned+Schools | work= | publisher=The Government of the District of Columbia | location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date= | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nFor the school year ending in spring 2007, the DCPS was governed by the [[District of Columbia State Board of Education|D.C. Board of Education]], with eleven members, including two students who had the right to debate but not to vote. Five members were elected and four were appointed by the Mayor. The Board established DCPS policies and employed a superintendent to serve as chief executive officer of the school district, responsible for day-to-day operations. Four Board members represented specific geographical boundaries and the Board President was elected at large. One condition of the District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 was the creation of DCPS as a separate cabinet-level agency from the D.C. Board of Education. This moved DCPS within the executive branch of the District of Columbia government\u2014specifically, under Mayoral control. Currently, this means that DCPS is subordinate to District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser. D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] proposed putting the public schools under the direct control of the Mayor's Office upon taking office in January 2007. However, this reform to District of Columbia Public Schools was encouraged by his predecessor and constituents at large. It also placed all of the District of Columbia public charter schools under the care of a new board\u2014District of Columbia Public Charter School Board (PCSB). Although these schools were previously a part of DCPS, they are now considered to be a separate district controlled by the D.C. Public Charter School Board (PCSB).\n\nThe D.C. Council passed the Mayor's proposal into law but since the change amended the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act|Home Rule Act]], the change needed to gain Federal approval before taking effect.  D.C. Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] introduced H.R. 2080, a bill to amend the D.C. Home Rule Charter Act to provide for the Mayor's proposal. H.R. 2080 was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] under an expedited procedure on May 8, 2007 by a voice vote. After three U.S. Senators ([[Ben Cardin]] of [[Maryland]], [[Mary Landrieu]] of [[Louisiana]], and [[Carl Levin]] of [[Michigan]]) initially placed \"holds\" on the bill to prevent its consideration in the [[United States Senate]], the Senate agreed to pass H.R. 2080 without amendment on May 22, 2007 by unanimous consent. On May 31, 2007, the bill was presented to the President and President Bush signed H.R. 2080 into law on June 1, 2007. After the standard Congressional review period expired on June 12, 2007, the Mayor's office had direct control of the Superintendent and the school budget.  On June 12, Mayor Fenty appointed [[Michelle Rhee]] the new Chancellor, replacing Superintendent [[Clifford B. Janey]].\n\n===D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003===\n{{Main|D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program}}\n\nIn January 2004, Congress passed the D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003. The law established a federally-funded private [[school voucher]] program known as the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP). The OSP distributes vouchers to low-income families to cover private school tuition. Because there are more eligible applicants than available vouchers, they are distributed by lottery. In 2010, a [[randomized controlled trial]] conducted under the auspices of the Department of Education examined the impacts of the OSP students, finding that it raised graduation rates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Patrick|title=Evaluation of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program: Final Report|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20104018/pdf/20104018.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Education -- Institute of Education Sciences}}</ref> Students who were offered vouchers had a graduation rate of 82%, while those who actually used their vouchers had a graduation rate of 91%. By comparison, the rate for students who did not receive vouchers was only 70%.

Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007===\n\nThe Council of the District of Columbia enacted the DC Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007. This act established a DC public school agency based on authority given to the council in the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. The Department of Education that was established under the Mayor triggered several changes. The largest was already discussed\u2014DCPCS gained sole authority over chartering and charted schools, DCPS became subordinate to the Mayor's office. Secondly, many smaller authoritative changes took place. The first is that the State Education Office (SEO) became the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). The four subsections of the District were reaffirmed through location-based State Board of Education selectees. In addition, the smaller eight school election wards were reaffirmed. Finally, the Commission was established through this legislature. The \"Commission\" is the Interagency Collaboration and Services Integration Commission, which includes the Mayor, Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, Chief Judge of the DC Superior Family Court, Superintendent of Education, Chancellor of DCPS, Chair of DCPCSB and fourteen others.\nAfter the 2007\u20132008 school year, about one-fifth of the teachers and one-third of the principals resigned, retired, or were terminated from DCPS. A very strong negative impact was initially experienced by DCPS due to the loss. A [[GAO-conducted study]]<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools: Important Steps Taken to Continue Reform Efforts, But Enhanced Planning Could Improve Implementation and Sustainability| url=http://www.gao.gov/highlights/d09619high.pdf | work= Report to Congressional Requesters| publisher= United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) | location=Washington, DC | pages= | date=June 2009 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nrecommended that the Mayor direct DCPS to establish planning processes for strikes and look to performance reviews from central offices to strengthen accountability. These recommendations were followed and accountability has increased through academic and financial report generation.  Increased accountability made way for other small reforms. One example is the implementation of a requirement that students entering 9th grade are now required to sit down with a school counselor and construct a course-plan to reach graduation.\n\n==No Child Left Behind compliance==\n\nIn accordance with Section 1116, a provision of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB), entitled \"Academic Assessment and Local Education Agency and School Improvement\", the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) of the District of Columbia oversees compliance with [http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Adequate+Yearly+Progress+(AYP) Adequate Yearly Progress] (AYP). A large portion of meeting AYP is based on standardized-tests performance; the District used the [[summative assessment]] called the District of Columbia Comprehensive Assessment System (\"DC CAS\") through the 2013-2014 school year, after which it switched to tools from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers ([[PARCC]]) and the National Center and State Collaborative (NCSC).<ref>{{cite web|title=DC CAS|url=http://osse.dc.gov/service/dc-cas|website=Office of the State Superintendent of Education|publisher=Washington, DC|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How Students Are Assessed|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208040753/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|archive-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Assessment Glossary|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218022539/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|archive-date=February 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMany schools are failing to meet AYP, even though DCPS educators offer support and tools to students to be academically successful.{{citation needed|reason=this statement needs a source to back it up and has a slanted tone.|date=March 2015}} DCPS has created an evaluation tool to assess schools by more than their standardized test scores.

However, those figures likely underreport DCPS's actual total per pupil expenditures. In 2012, the [[Cato Institute]]'s [[Andrew J.

According to school choice researcher Erin Dillon, \"In its winning application for federal Race to the Top funds, DCPS, for example, touted its three models for autonomous schools: The aptly named 'Autonomous Schools,' which are granted autonomy as a reward for high performance; 'Partnership Schools,' which are run by outside organizations that are granted autonomy in the hope of dramatically improving performance; and the 'D.C. Collaborative for Change,' or DC3, a joint effort of some of the District\u2019s highest- and lowest-performing schools that have been granted autonomy as a tool for innovating with curriculum and professional development. (Meanwhile, highly autonomous charter schools, a growing presence in the District of Columbia, educate almost 40 percent of the city\u2019s public school students.)\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Dillon|first=Erin|title=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|url=http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|work=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|publisher=Education Sector|accessdate=27 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628123000/http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|archive-date=June 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===High schools===\n====Traditional high schools====\n[[File:Wilson-high-dc.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson High School (Washington, D.C.)|Woodrow Wilson High School]], Tenleytown]]\n[[File:Eastern Senior High School - Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]], Kingman Park]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"175\" | School name || Students* ||class=\"unsortable\"| Low grade ||class=\"unsortable\"| High grade\n|-\n| [[Anacostia High School]] || 449 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Ballou High School]] || 930 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Coolidge Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Calvin Coolidge High School]] || 346 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]] || 584 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]] || 818 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[H.D.
