Rosslau is situated on the right bank of the [[Elbe]], here crossed by two railway bridges, 3 mi. by rail N. of [[Dessau]] and 35 mi. S.E. of [[Magdeburg]]. It has a ducal residence, an old castle, a handsome parish church, and manufactures of machinery, paper, sealing-wax, wire goods, sugar, bricks and chemicals. Rosslau became a town in 1603.\n\n==Town merger==\nOn 1 July 2007 the town ''Rosslau (Elbe)'' was consolidated with the town ''[[Dessau]]''. Together they are named [[Dessau-Ro\u00dflau]]. The mayor of the new town is [[Klemens Koschig]], who was elected on 22 April 2007.\n\n==History==\nThe town \u201cRozelowe\u201c was first documented in 1215. In 1359 \u201cDat borchlen zu Rozlau\u201d was mentioned. The name is of Dutch heritage and suggests the foundation and the settlement of Rosslau by inhabitants of the Dutch town Reuzel in [[North Brabant]].\n\nThe construction of the bridge over the Elbe River occurred in 1583 and just 20 years later the town was chartered and received its right to hold markets. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] the bridge was a scene of a [[Battle of Dessau Bridge|battle]]. A few years later, in 1631, the bridge was destroyed. Six years after that, imperial soldiers burned down the town; in 1717 the town was in flames again. In 1740 the town hall and castle were built. From 1765-1767 Rosslau was a point of origin for colonial crusades of the Russian Tsarina [[Catherine the Great]], a princess of the [[principality of Anhalt-Zerbst]]. In 1806 fleeing Prussians set the Elbe-bridge on fire again. From 1836-1838 [[Henry, Duke of Anhalt-K\u00f6then]] prompted the renovation of the deteriorating medieval castle in a gothic and romantic fashion.\n\nIn the following years the connection to the network of the [[Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company]],<ref>{{citation|surname1=Peter Bley|title=150 Jahre Berlin-Anhaltische Eisenbahn |publisher=alba|publication-place=D\u00fcsseldorf|isbn=3-87094-340-8|date=  1990|language=German}}</ref> the foundation of fabrics, newspapers and shipyards took place. In 1907 the tramline between Dessau and Rosslau was put into operation.\n\nIn fall 1933 the National Socialist government of Anhalt setup one of the early [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in the former ''Volkshaus'' in the Hauptstra\u00dfe 51 in which predominantly members of the Communist Party (KPD) and Social Democratic Party (SPD) were detained and deviled. In summer 1934 the concentration camp was closed. The remaining inmates were transferred to the [[Lichtenburg (concentration camp)|concentration camp in Lichtenburg]].\n\nAiding the town of [[Dessau]] in becoming the [[Reichsgau|capital of the district]], the town Rosslau (Elbe) became suburbanised into Dessau from 1 April 1935 to 1 April 1946 which gave the town the required number of 100,000 inhabitants. In 1952 the [[Rosslau (district)|district of Rosslau]] was built out of the eastern part of the [[Zerbst (district)|district of Zerbst]]. This gave Rosslau the status of a [[country town]], which it hold until 30 Juny 1994, before it became part of the [[Anhalt-Zerbst|Anhalt-Zerbst district]].\n\nUntil 1991 Rosslau was the base of the [[7th Guards Tank Division]] of the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet forces in Germany]].\n\nThe [[2002 European floods|Elbe-flood from 2002]] exceeded the [[Elbe-flood from 1845]].\n\n==Sights==\nThe [[moated castle]] of Rosslau is very popular location for Open-Air Events and Stage Plays. The annual This is Ska Festival takes part in the castle since 1997. There's also a Country Festival offering Liveacts, Linedance and a Western Casino. The Knight Dinner is a popular event too.\n\nThe European village was built after an architectural competition from 1993 to 1996. Architect's offices from [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Finland]] and [[France]] created the plans and a few conspicuous buildings were built.\nOther places to see are the \"\u00d6hlm\u00fchle\" (Oil Mill) and St. Mary's City Church.\n\n==Traffic==\nThe \"Bundesstrassen\" B184 and B187 go through Rosslau.\nRosslau also has a main train station with connections to [[Dessau]], [[Magdeburg]], [[Berlin]], [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], [[Bitterfeld]] and Lutherstadt [[Wittenberg]].\n\n==Sons and daughters==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-11686-0004, Berlin, Verleihung Goethepreis, Paulick.jpg|thumb|100px|Richard Paulick in 1951.]]\n* [[Gottfried Bandhauer]] (1790\u20131837), master-builder of [[classicism]]\n* [[Gotthard Sachsenberg]] (1891\u20131961), officer, entrepreneur and politician ([[Reichspartei des deutschen Mittelstandes|Wirtschaftspartei]])\n* [[Richard Paulick (Architekt)|Richard Paulick]] (1903\u20131979), architect\n* [[Wolfgang Schwenke (Zoologe)|Wolfgang Schwenke]] (1921\u20132006), zoologist,  entomologist and forest scientist\n* [[Bobby B\u00f6lke]] (1926\u20132007), actor and entertainer\n* [[G\u00fcnter Dreibrodt]] (born 1951), former handball player\n* [[Peter M\u00fcller (art historian)|Peter M\u00fcller]] (born 1967), German art historian and publicist\n\n==Twin towns==\n*{{flagicon|Germany}} [[Ibbenb\u00fcren]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n*{{flagicon|Czech Republic}} [[Roudnice nad Labem]], [[Czech Republic]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{EB1911|wstitle=Rosslau|volume=23|page=752}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.dessau-rosslau.de/Deutsch/Stadtportraet/Rosslauer-Geschichte/ History of Rosslau]\n* [http://www.this-is-ska.de This is Ska Festival]\n\n{{Dessau-Ro\u00dflau}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rosslau}}\n[[Category:Towns in Saxony-Anhalt]]\n[[Category:Dessau-Ro\u00dflau| Rosslau]]\n[[Category:Former municipalities in Saxony-Anhalt]]\n[[Category:Duchy of Anhalt]]\n[[Category:Bezirk Halle]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox German location\n|name = Rosslau, Ro\u00dflau\n|type = Stadtteil\n|Town = Dessau-Ro\u00dflau\n|image_photo = Ro\u00dflau, Markt und Ev.
