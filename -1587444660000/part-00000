Over the course of the battle, the Liberal fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelite fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelite four, managed to close with the Miguelites, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelite fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG01\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG02\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelite crews proved no match for the Liberal crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelite fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelite fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]].<ref name=\"RG19\">Roche, (2005)</ref> The Miguelite-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.<ref name=\"RG03\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG04\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Liberal Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]].<ref name=\"RG05\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG06\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Liberal to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelite forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelite admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG07\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG08\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelite fleet. The Miguelite fleet significantly outnumbered the Liberal one, and aimed to defeat the Liberal via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.<ref name=\"RG09\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG10\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelite vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Liberal fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelite fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelites desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Liberal victory was that the majority of the Liberal crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelite fleet. In the battle the Liberal forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Liberal cause and swear allegiance to [[Pedro I of Brazil|Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelite fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelite fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros.<ref name=\"RG11\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG12\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelite fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Liberal fleet and the captured Miguelite prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelites had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Liberal victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the [[Navy Directory|Royal Navy List]] at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"RG13\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG14\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelite ''The Lord of the Isles'' [[Steamboat|steamer]] at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Liberal and Miguelite armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelite army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she finally passed away in 1853.<ref name=\"RG15\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG16\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|restored Portuguese parliament]]. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|parliamentary]] seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.<ref name=\"RG17\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG18\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n== Order of

After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelite admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelite fleet.<ref name=\"RG07\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG08\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelite fleet. The Miguelite fleet significantly outnumbered the Liberal one, and aimed to defeat the Liberal via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.<ref name=\"RG09\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG10\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelite vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Liberal fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelite fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelites desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Liberal victory was that the majority of the Liberal crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelite fleet. In the battle the Liberal forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Liberal cause and swear allegiance to [[Pedro I of Brazil|Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelite fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelite fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros.<ref name=\"RG11\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG12\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelite fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Liberal fleet and the captured Miguelite prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelites had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Liberal victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"RG13\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG14\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelite ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Liberal cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Liberal and Miguelite armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Liberal victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelite army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she finally passed away in 1853.<ref name=\"RG15\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG16\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|restored Portuguese parliament]]. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|parliamentary]] seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.<ref name=\"RG17\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG18\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n== Order of

She became the [[Great Royal Wife]] of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep III]]. She was the mother of [[Akhenaten]] and grandmother of [[Tutankhamun]]. In 2010, DNA analysis confirmed her as the mummy known as \"The Elder Lady\" found in the tomb of Amenhotep II ([[KV35]]) in 1898.\n\n==Family and early life==\nTiye's father, [[Yuya]], was a non-royal, wealthy landowner from the Upper Egyptian town of [[Akhmim]],{{sfn|Tyldesley|2006|p=115}} where he served as a [[priest]] and superintendent of oxen or commander of the chariotry.<ref>\"Bart, Anneke. \"Ancient Egypt.\" http://euler.slu.edu/~bart/egyptianhtml/kings%20and%20Queens/amenhotepiii.htm</ref> Tiye's mother, [[Tjuyu]], was involved in many religious cults, as her different titles attested (''Singer of Hathor'', ''Chief of the Entertainers'' of both [[Amun]] and [[Min (god)|Min]]...),{{sfn|Tyldesley|2006|p=116}} which suggests that she was a member of the royal family.\n\n[[File:Statua colossale di Amenhotep III e tiye con henuttaneb 02.jpg|thumb|left|Colossal statue of [[Amenhotep III]] and his wife Queen Tiye, [[Egyptian Museum, Cairo]]]]\nEgyptologists have suggested that Tiye's father, Yuya, was of foreign origin due to the features of his mummy and the many different spellings of his name, which might imply it was a non-Egyptian name in origin.{{sfn|O'Connor|Cline|1998|p=5}} Some suggest that the queen's strong political and unconventional religious views might have been due not just to a strong character, but to foreign descent.{{sfn|Tyldesley|2006|p=116}}\n\nTiye also had a brother, [[Anen]], who was Second Prophet of [[Amun]].{{sfn|O'Connor|Cline|1998|p=5-6}} [[Ay]], a successor of [[Tutankhamun]] as pharaoh after the latter's death, is believed to be yet another brother of Tiye, despite no clear date or monument confirming a link between the two. [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]] presume this connection from Ay's origins (also from Akhmin), because he is known to have built a chapel dedicated to the local god Min there, and because he inherited most of the titles that Tiye's father, Yuya, held at the court of Amenhotep III during his lifetime.{{sfn|Tyldesley|2006|p=116}}<ref>Shaw, Ian.

Amenhotep III built a temple to her in Sedeinga in northern [[Sudan]], where she was worshiped as a form of Hathor ... The temple at Sedeinga was the pendant to Amenhotep III's own, larger temple at Soleb, fifteen kilometres to the south (an arrangement followed a century later by Ramses II at [[Abu Simbel]], where there are likewise two temples, the larger southern temple dedicated to the king, and the smaller, northern temple dedicated to the queen, [[Nefertari|Nefertiry]], as Hathor).{{sfn|O'Connor|Cline|1998|p=6-7}}}}\n\n==Influence at court==\n[[File:QueenTiyFuneraryMask-AltesMuseum-Berlin.png|thumb|left|Fragmentary funerary mask of Queen Tiye in the \u00c4gyptisches Museum]]\nTiye wielded a great deal of power during both her husband\u2019s and son\u2019s reigns. Amenhotep III became a fine sportsman, a lover of outdoor life, and a great statesman. He often had to consider claims for Egypt's gold and requests for his royal daughters in marriage from foreign kings such as [[Tushratta]] of Mitanni and [[Kadashman-Enlil I]] of Babylon. The royal lineage was carried by the women of Ancient Egypt and marriage to one would have been a path to the throne for their progeny. Tiye became her husband\u2019s trusted adviser and confidant. Being wise, intelligent, strong, and fierce, she was able to gain the respect of foreign dignitaries. Foreign leaders were willing to deal directly through her. She continued to play an active role in foreign relations and was the first Egyptian queen to have her name recorded on official acts.{{sfn|Tyldesley|2006|p=118}}\n\nTiye may have continued to advise her son, Akhenaten, when he took the throne. Her son\u2019s correspondence with [[Tushratta]], the king of [[Mitanni]], speaks highly of the political influence she wielded at court. In Amarna letter '''EA 26''', Tushratta, corresponded directly with Tiye to reminisce about the good relations he enjoyed with her then deceased husband and extended his wish to continue on friendly terms with her son, Akhenaten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/a-tushratta_4.htm |title=EA 26 - A Letter from Tushratta to Tiye}}</ref>\n\nAmenhotep III died in Year 38 or Year 39 of his reign (1353 BC/1350 BC) and was buried in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in [[WV22]]; however, Tiye is known to have outlived him by as many as twelve years. Tiye continued to be mentioned in the [[Amarna letters]] and in inscriptions as queen and beloved of the king. Amarna letter EA 26, which is addressed to Tiye, dates to the reign of Akhenaten. She is known to have had a house at Akhetaten (Amarna), Akhenaten's new capital and is shown on the walls of the tomb of Huya \u2013 a \"steward in the house of the king's mother, the great royal wife [[Tiy]]i\" \u2013 depicted at a dinner table with Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and their family and then being escorted by the king to her ''sunshade''.{{sfn|O'Connor|Cline|1998|p=23}} In an inscription approximately dated to November 21 of Year 12 of Akhenaten's reign (1338 BC), both she and her granddaughter [[Meketaten]] are mentioned for the last time. They are thought to have died shortly after that date. This information is corrorborated by the fact that the shrine which Akhenaten created for her\u2014which was later found transported from Amarna to tomb [[KV55]] in Thebes\u2014bore the later form of the Aten's name which was only used after Akhenaten's Year 9.<ref>Joyce Tyldesley, Nefertiti: Egypt's Sun Queen, Penguin UK, 2005</ref>\n\nIf Tiye died soon after Year 12 of Akhenaten's reign (1338 BC), this would place her birth around 1398 BC, her marriage to Amenhotep III at the age of eleven or twelve, and her becoming a widow at the age of forty-eight to forty-nine. Suggestions of a co-regency between Amenhotep III and his son Akhenaten lasting for up to twelve years continue, but most scholars today either accept a brief co-regency lasting no more than one year <ref>Reeves, Nicholas.

[[Egyptology|Egyptologists]] presume this connection from Ay's origins (also from Akhmin), because he is known to have built a chapel dedicated to the local god Min there, and because he inherited most of the titles that Tiye's father, Yuya, held at the court of Amenhotep III during his lifetime.{{sfn|Tyldesley|2006|p=116}}<ref>Shaw, Ian.

No previous queen ever figured so prominently in her husband's lifetime. Tiyi regularly appeared besides Amenhotep III in  statuary, tomb and temple reliefs, and stelae while her name is paired with his on numerous small objects, such as vessels and jewelry, not to mention the large commemorative scarabs, where her name regularly follows his in the dateline. New elements in her portraiture, such as the addition of cows' horns and sun disks\u2014attributes of the goddess [[Hathor]]\u2014to her headdress, and her representation in the form of a sphinx\u2014an image formerly reserved for the king\u2014emphasize her role as the king's divine, as well as earthly partner. Amenhotep III built a temple to her in Sedeinga in northern [[Sudan]], where she was worshiped as a form of Hathor ... The temple at Sedeinga was the pendant to Amenhotep III's own, larger temple at Soleb, fifteen kilometres to the south (an arrangement followed a century later by Ramses II at [[Abu Simbel]], where there are likewise two temples, the larger southern temple dedicated to the king, and the smaller, northern temple dedicated to the queen, [[Nefertari|Nefertiry]], as Hathor).{{sfn|O'Connor|Cline|1998|p=6-7}}}}\n\n==Influence at court==\n[[File:QueenTiyFuneraryMask-AltesMuseum-Berlin.png|thumb|left|Fragmentary funerary mask of Queen Tiye in the \u00c4gyptisches Museum]]\nTiye wielded a great deal of power during both her husband\u2019s and son\u2019s reigns. Amenhotep III became a fine sportsman, a lover of outdoor life, and a great statesman. He often had to consider claims for Egypt's gold and requests for his royal daughters in marriage from foreign kings such as [[Tushratta]] of Mitanni and [[Kadashman-Enlil I]] of Babylon. The royal lineage was carried by the women of Ancient Egypt and marriage to one would have been a path to the throne for their progeny. Tiye became her husband\u2019s trusted adviser and confidant. Being wise, intelligent, strong, and fierce, she was able to gain the respect of foreign dignitaries. Foreign leaders were willing to deal directly through her. She continued to play an active role in foreign relations and was the first Egyptian queen to have her name recorded on official acts.{{sfn|Tyldesley|2006|p=118}}\n\nTiye may have continued to advise her son, Akhenaten, when he took the throne. Her son\u2019s correspondence with [[Tushratta]], the king of [[Mitanni]], speaks highly of the political influence she wielded at court. In Amarna letter '''EA 26''', Tushratta, corresponded directly with Tiye to reminisce about the good relations he enjoyed with her then deceased husband and extended his wish to continue on friendly terms with her son, Akhenaten.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/a-tushratta_4.htm |title=EA 26 - A Letter from Tushratta to Tiye}}</ref>\n\nAmenhotep III died in Year 38 or Year 39 of his reign (1353 BC/1350 BC) and was buried in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in [[WV22]]; however, Tiye is known to have outlived him by as many as twelve years. Tiye continued to be mentioned in the [[Amarna letters]] and in inscriptions as queen and beloved of the king. Amarna letter EA 26, which is addressed to Tiye, dates to the reign of Akhenaten. She is known to have had a house at Akhetaten (Amarna), Akhenaten's new capital and is shown on the walls of the tomb of Huya \u2013 a \"steward in the house of the king's mother, the great royal wife [[Tiy]]i\" \u2013 depicted at a dinner table with Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and their family and then being escorted by the king to her ''sunshade''.{{sfn|O'Connor|Cline|1998|p=23}} In an inscription approximately dated to November 21 of Year 12 of Akhenaten's reign (1338 BC), both she and her granddaughter [[Meketaten]] are mentioned for the last time. They are thought to have died shortly after that date. This information is corrorborated by the fact that the shrine which Akhenaten created for her\u2014which was later found transported from Amarna to tomb [[KV55]] in Thebes\u2014bore the later form of the Aten's name which was only used after Akhenaten's Year 9.<ref>Joyce Tyldesley, Nefertiti: Egypt's Sun Queen, Penguin UK, 2005</ref>\n\nIf Tiye died soon after Year 12 of Akhenaten's reign (1338 BC), this would place her birth around 1398 BC, her marriage to Amenhotep III at the age of eleven or twelve, and her becoming a widow at the age of forty-eight to forty-nine. Suggestions of a co-regency between Amenhotep III and his son Akhenaten lasting for up to twelve years continue, but most scholars today either accept a brief co-regency lasting no more than one year <ref>Reeves, Nicholas.

They are also sometimes addressed as '''blue''' at lower levels due to the common color of the uniform worn by umpires. In professional baseball, the term ''blue'' is seldom used by players or managers, who instead call the umpire by name. Although games were often officiated by a sole umpire in the formative years of the sport, since the turn of the 20th century, officiating has been commonly divided among several umpires, who form the '''umpiring crew'''.  The position is analogous to that of a [[referee]] in many other sports.\n\n==Duties and positions==\n[[File:Umpire Malachi Moore San Antonio Texas 2016.jpg|thumb|Home plate umpire Malachi Moore reviews the [[Glossary of baseball (L)#lineup cards|lineup cards]] from both teams before a 2016 minor league baseball game]]\nIn a game officiated by two or more umpires, the '''umpire in chief''' (usually the '''home plate umpire''') is the umpire who is in charge of the entire game. This umpire calls [[strike zone|balls and strikes]], calls [[fair ball]]s, [[foul ball]]s short of first/third base, and makes most calls concerning the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] or concerning [[baserunner]]s near home plate. To avoid injury, the home plate umpire wears similar equipment to the catcher, including mask, chest protector, leg guards and shoes with extra protection added over the laces.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> If another umpire leaves the infield to cover a potential play in foul ground or in the outfield, then the plate umpire may move to cover a potential play near second or third base. (The umpire-in-chief should not be confused with the crew chief, who is often a different umpire; see below.) In the event that an umpire is injured and only three remain, the second base position will generally be left vacant.\n\nIn nearly all levels of organized baseball, including the majors, an umpiring crew rotates so that each umpire in the crew works each position, including plate umpire, an equal number of games. In the earliest days of baseball, however, many senior umpires always worked the plate, with Hall of Fame umpire [[Bill Klem]] being the last umpire to do so. Klem did so for the first 16 years of his career.<ref name=\"Chief\">{{cite news |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=591266 |title=Chief among game's umpires |date=2007-04-14 |publisher=Journal Sentinel |author=Haudricourt, Tom |accessdate=2007-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111537/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=591266 |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> On the Major League level, an umpiring crew generally rotates positions clockwise each game. For example, the plate umpire in one game would umpire third base in the next.\n\nOther umpires are called '''base umpires''' and are commonly stationed near the bases. (''Field umpire'' is a less-common term.) When two umpires are used, the second umpire is simply the '''base umpire'''. This umpire will make most calls concerning runners on the bases and nearby plays, as well as in the middle of the outfield. When three umpires are used, the second umpire is called the '''first-base umpire''' and the third umpire is called the '''third-base umpire''', even though they may move to different positions on the field as the play demands.<ref name=\"Official rules\" />  These two umpires also call [[checked swing]]s, if asked by the plate umpire (often requested by catcher or defensive manager; however, only the plate umpire can authorize an appeal to the base umpire): the first base umpire for right-handed batters, and the third base umpire for left-handed batters; to indicate a checked swing, the umpire will make a \"safe\" gesture with his arms. To indicate a full swing, he will clench his fist.\n\n[[File:MLB umpire.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A second base umpire ([[Mike Reilly (umpire)|Mike Reilly]]) at an MLB game in 2008.]]\n\nWhen four umpires are used (as is the case for all regular season MLB games unless one has to leave due to injury), each umpire is named for the base at which he is stationed. Sometimes a league will provide six umpires; the extra two are stationed along the outfield foul lines and are called the '''left-field''' and '''right-field umpires''' (or simply '''outfield umpires''').\n\nOutfield umpires are used in major events, such as the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], and depending on the level, at parts of post-season [[playoff]]s. For Major League Baseball, all playoff levels use six umpires adding a left-field and right-field umpire, while at lower levels, six umpires are used at the championship games (such as NCAA).<ref name=\"Special Event selection\">{{cite web |title=Special Event selection |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=event_selection |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> Rulings on catches of batted balls are usually made by the umpire closest to the play.\n\n===Crew chief===\nThe term ''umpire-in-chief'' is not to be confused with the '''crew chief''', who is usually the most experienced umpire in a crew. At the major-league and high minor-league (Class AAA and AA) levels, the crew chief acts as a liaison between the league office and the crew and has a supervisory role over other members of the crew.<ref name=\"Crews\">{{cite web |title=2007 MLB Umpire Crews |url=http://www.mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/crews.jsp |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125035536/http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/crews.jsp |archivedate=2007-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nFor example, on the Major League level, \"The Crew Chief shall coordinate and direct his crew's compliance with the Office of the Commissioner's rules and policies. Other Crew Chief responsibilities include: leading periodic discussions and reviews of situations, plays and rules with his crew; generally directing the work of the other umpires on the crew, with particular emphasis on uniformity in dealing with unique situations; assigning responsibilities for maintaining time limits during the game; ensuring the timely filing of all required crew reports for incidents such as ejections, brawls and protested games; and reporting to the Office of Commissioner any irregularity in field conditions at any ballpark.\"<ref name=\"Crews\" /> Thus, on the professional level, some of the duties assigned to the umpire-in-chief (the plate umpire) in the [[Official Baseball Rules]] have been reassigned to the crew chief, regardless of the crew chief's umpiring position during a specific game.  Instant replay reviews, for example, will be reviewed with the crew chief and one other umpire, with results announced by the crew chief.  The crew chief acts analogous to the ''crew chief'' in basketball (as referenced in the NBA and FIBA rules) or the ''referee'' in American football.\n\n===Judgment calls===\n{{seealso|Instant replay#Baseball}}\nAn umpire's judgment call used to be final, unless the umpire making the call chose to ask his partner(s) for help and then decided to reverse it after the discussion.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> Since 2014, the MLB allows managers to challenge plays during the game. If the manager successfully has a call overturned, they are rewarded with another challenge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Replay Review Regulations|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/replay_review.jsp|work=MLB|publisher=MLB|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref> If an umpire seems to make an error in rule interpretation, his call, in some leagues, can be officially protested as is the case in MLB.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> If the umpire is persistent in his or her interpretation, the matter will be settled at a later time by a league official.  An independent study of umpire pitch-call accuracy over 11 seasons (2008-2018) released on April 8, 2019 by Mark T. Williams of Boston University concluded that over 20% of certain pitches were called incorrectly. For the 2018 season, home plate umpires made about 34,000 incorrect ball and strike calls, which is about 14 per game and 1.6 per inning.<ref>{{cite web|title=MLB Umpires Missed 34,294 Ball-Strike Calls in 2018. Bring on Robo-umps?|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2019/mlb-umpires-strike-zone-accuracy/|publisher=BU Today|accessdate=16 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the early years of professional baseball, umpires were not engaged by the league but rather by agreement between the team captains. However, by the start of the modern era in 1901, this had become a league responsibility. There is now a unitary major league umpiring roster, although until the [[1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation|1999 labor dispute]] that led to the decertification of the [[Major League Umpires Association]], there were separate National and American League umpires. As a result of the 2000 collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the newly formed [[Major League Baseball Umpires Association|World Umpires Association]] (now known as the Major League Baseball Umpires Association) all umpires were placed on one roster and work in games in both leagues.\n\n==Amateur umpiring==\n[[File:One Marine Making the Right Calls DVIDS177654.jpg|thumb|right|A volunteer umpire officiating a [[Little League Baseball]] game]]\nAn amateur umpire officiates non-professional or semi-professional baseball. Many amateur umpires are paid (typically on a per-game basis) and thus might be considered [[professionals]], while some amateur umpires are unpaid. According to the [[Little League Baseball]] official website, umpires should be volunteers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/umpirerole.htm|title=Umpire's Role|website=www.littleleague.org}}</ref>\n\nThere are numerous organizations that test or train anyone interested in umpiring for local leagues, and can help make connections to the leagues in the area. Little League Baseball and the [[Babe Ruth League]] are two of the most popular organizations when it comes to youth baseball, and each have their own application, test, and training process for becoming an umpire. In Canada, most umpires are certified through a provincial organization, and then hired by local municipal associations through an umpire in chief.\n\nFor the [[Little League World Series]], amateur umpires from around the world participate on a volunteer basis. Prospective Little League World Series umpires must participate at various levels of Little League All-Star tournaments, ranging from district to state to regional tournaments, prior to being accepted to work the World Series tournament.<ref name=\"LL umpires\">{{cite web |url=http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/index.asp |title=Umpires Home |publisher=[[Little League Baseball]] |accessdate=2007-05-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070425095910/http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/index.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-25}}</ref>\n\nCheck out the up and coming umpire team based out of Maple Grove, MN, called Walks & Balks. These guys know their stuff! Hit them up for some serious, elite umping.\n\n==High school umpiring==\nIn the United States, many (if not most) high schools sponsor a baseball team.  Many high schools sponsor multiple baseball teams; for instance, \"varsity\" and \"junior varsity\" teams.  During the 2017-18 academic year there were 16,513 high schools sponsoring at least one baseball team, and 488,859 students participated on a high school baseball team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatistics/ParticipationStatistics/|title=Participation Statistics|website=www.nfhs.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Thus, high school baseball is one of the most popular levels of baseball in the United States.  Unlike college athletics, there is no competitive national championship on the high school level.  And, unlike college athletics, umpires on the high school level are not administered by a national organization (such as the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]).  Rather, high school baseball is administered at the state level (usually by a statewide high school athletic association) and the qualifications for becoming and remaining a high school umpire are usually set by the entity overseeing high school baseball in each individual state.  For example, the [[Florida High School Athletic Association]] sets forth minimum requirements for being a high school umpire in Florida.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.becomeanofficial.org/sports/ba.asp|title=Become an FHSAA Official - Baseball|website=www.becomeanofficial.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Many statewide high school athletic associations contract with multiple local umpire associations throughout their state in which the local associations agree to train and provide umpires for high school games in each association's geographic area of the state in return for a \"booking fee\" being paid to the local associations by either the statewide high school association or by individual high schools.  The local associations also promise to train their umpires to meet the state high school association's minimum requirements for umpires.  For example, in Florida the Jacksonville Umpires Association trains and provides umpires for high school games in the [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaxump.com/schools_division.html|title=About|website=www.jaxump.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\nThe specific requirements for becoming a high school umpire vary from state-to-state.  However, generally all states share the same basic minimum requirements.  First, a person trying to become an umpire must usually register with both the state high school athletic association and their local umpire association.  Upon registering, most states provide their umpires with a high school rulebook, casebook, and umpires' manual.  Second, most states require all umpires to attend clinics and meetings.  These clinics may focus on rules, umpire mechanics, or a combination of both.  Third, most states also require an umpire to pass a rules exam.  Finally, most states also require umpires to work a certain number of pre-season scrimmages prior to working regular season games.  As an example of these requirements, Georgia has an \"officials accountability program\" which sets forth the specific requirements for its interscholastic officials (including the attendance at clinics and camps and the passing of an examination) which can be reviewed [https://www.ghsa.net/sites/default/files/documents/officials/GHSA-Officiating-Handbook_2018-2019.pdf here].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghsa.net/ghsa-contest-officials-handbook-and-accountability-program|title=GHSA Contest Officials Handbook and Accountability Program {{!}} GHSA.net|website=www.ghsa.net|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\nAlthough high school baseball is administered at the state level, the various state high school athletic associations have voluntarily formed the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfhs.org/who-we-are/aboutus|title=AboutUs|website=www.nfhs.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Through the federation, most state athletic associations have agreed to use its rulebook.  Thus, while high school baseball is administered on a state level, almost all state associations use the same unique baseball rulebook (and the associated casebook and umpire manual) written specifically for the high school level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfhs.com/p-1102-2019-baseball-rules-book.aspx?CategoryID=0&SectionID=0&ManufacturerID=0&DistributorID=0&GenreID=0&VectorID=0&|title=National Federation of State High School Associations - 2019 Baseball Rules Book|website=www.nfhs.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> As a result, if an individual umpire moves from one state to another state (s)he would likely be using the same rule set in his/her new state as was used in his/her former state.  However, that there are significant rule differences between the federation's rulebook compared to [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) and [[College baseball|NCAA]] rules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umpirebible.com/index.php/home/obr-fed-rule-differences|title=OBR-FED rule differences - UmpireBible|website=www.umpirebible.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> Thus, individuals wanting to umpire on the high school level will have to learn a different set of rules than those they may be familiar with had they previously umpired in a youth league using the MLB or NCAA rulebooks.\n\nAlmost exclusively, high school umpires are paid on a per game basis.  As they are not salaried, they are not paid if they do not actually umpire a game.  The amount paid differs, often significantly, from state to state.  Most high school games are officiated by a two-umpire crew.<ref>[http://www.westernpiedmontbaseball.org/RULES%20&%20MECHANICS.htm], retrieved November 1, 2013</ref>   However, many states use three-umpire and four-umpire crews to officiate playoff games.\n\n==Professional umpire training and career development==\nBecoming a [[Major League Baseball]] umpire requires rigorous training, and very few succeed. Provided the individual makes satisfactory progress throughout, it typically takes from 7\u201310 years to achieve MLB status. First, a person desiring to become a professional umpire must attend one of two umpiring schools authorized by Major League Baseball: [[Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy]] or The [[Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School]].<ref name=\"MiLB umpires\">{{cite web |url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp?mc=_ump_schools |title=Where are the Professional Umpire Schools Located? |publisher=[[Minor League Baseball|MiLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>   The former is owned and operated by [[National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues|Minor League Baseball]] while the latter is run by former and current Major League and Minor League umpires.  Both are located in [[Florida]]. There are no prerequisites for attending these schools; however, there is an [http://www.mlbuc.com Umpire Camp], run by Major League Baseball, that is generally considered a \"tool for success\" at either of these schools. These camps, offered as two separate one-week sessions, are held in November in Southern California. Top students at these camps are eligible to earn scholarships to either of the professional umpire schools in Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/camp/index.jsp?content=faqs|title=MLB Umpire Camps|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nAfter five weeks of training, each school sends its top students to the Minor League Baseball Umpire Development (MiLBUD) evaluation course also held in Florida.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\">{{cite web|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp?mc=_ump_career|title=Become an Umpire - MiLB.com Official Info - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}</ref> Minor League Baseball Umpire Development, \"is the entity which is responsible for the training, evaluation, and recommendation for promotion, retention, or release of all umpires in the Minor League Baseball system throughout the United States and Canada.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.milb.com/about/umpires|title=Minor League Baseball umpires|website=MiLB.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>  The actual number of students sent on to the evaluation course is determined by MiLBUD using input from the umpire schools.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/> Generally, the top 10 to 20 percent of each school's graduating class will advance to the evaluation course. The evaluation course is conducted by MiLBUD staff, some of whom are also instructors at the Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/> The evaluation course generally lasts around 10 days. Depending on the number of available positions in the various minor leagues, some (but not all) of the evaluation course attendees will be assigned to a low level [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]]. Out of approximately 300 original umpire school students, about 30-35 will ultimately be offered jobs in Minor League Baseball after the evaluation course.\n\nProfessional umpires begin their careers in one of the Rookie or [[Class A (baseball)|Class \"A\"]] Short-Season leagues, with Class-A being divided into three levels (Short-Season, Long-Season and Advanced \"A\").<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/>  Top umpiring prospects will often begin their careers in a short-season \"A\" league (for example, the [[New York\u2013Penn League]]), but most will begin in a rookie league (for example, the [[Gulf Coast League]]).  Since 2008, some umpires who attend the evaluation course, but are not offered jobs in professional baseball may be offered jobs in the [[Coastal Plain League]] (a summer wood bat league for collegiate players).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coastalplain.com/about/Umpires|title=Coastal Plain League|website=Coastal Plain League|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>  During the season, umpires in the Coastal Plain League are evaluated by MiLBUD and they may earn a promotion to a Rookie professional league as a result of injuries or resignations by umpires at higher levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coastalplain.com/about/Umpires|title=Coastal Plain League|website=Coastal Plain League|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:David Rackley 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Umpire [[David Rackley]] working a [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Texas League]] game in 2006]]\nThroughout the season, all minor league umpires in Rookie leagues, Class-A, and Class-AA are evaluated by members of the MiLBUD staff.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\">{{cite web|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp|title=Umpires - MiLB.com Official Info - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}</ref>  All umpires receive a detailed written evaluation of their performance after every season.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\"/>  In addition, all umpires (except those in the rookie or Short Season Class-A leagues) receive written mid-season evaluations.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\"/>\n\nGenerally, an umpire is regarded as making adequate progress \"up the ranks\" if he advances up one level of Class \"A\" ball each year (thus earning promotion to Class AA after three to four years) and promotion to Class AAA after two to three years on the Class AA level. However, this is a very rough estimate and other factors not discussed (such as the number of retirements at higher levels) may dramatically affect these estimates. For example, many umpires saw rapid advancement in 1999 due to the mass resignation of many Major League umpires as a [[collective bargaining]] ploy.\n\nWhen promoted to the Class AAA level, an umpire's evaluation will also be conducted by the umpiring supervisory staff of Major League Baseball. In recent years, top AAA prospects, in addition to umpiring and being evaluated during the regular season (in either the [[International League|International]] or [[Pacific Coast League]]), have been required to umpire in the [[Arizona Fall League]] where they receive extensive training and evaluation by Major League Baseball staff.  Additionally, top minor league prospects will also be sent to umpire in winter leagues (during Major League and Minor League baseball's off-season) usually located in the Caribbean, Central America or South America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.closecallsports.com/2016/11/2016-17-winter-league-milb-umpires.html|title=2016-17 Winter League MiLB Umpire Rosters|last=Imber|first=Gil|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, top AAA prospects may also be rewarded with umpiring only Major League preseason games during [[spring training]] (in lieu of Class AAA games). Additionally, the very top prospects may umpire Major League regular season games on a limited basis as \"fill-in\" umpires (where the Class AAA umpire replaces a sick, injured or vacationing Major League umpire).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.closecallsports.com/2019/01/triple-call-up-and-fill-in-results-end.html|title=Triple-A Call-Up and Fill-In Results - 2018-19 Offseason|last=Imber|first=Gil|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nFinally, upon the retirement (or firing) of a Major League umpire, a top Class AAA umpire will be promoted to Major League Baseball's permanent umpire staff. During this entire process, if an umpire is evaluated as no longer being a major-league prospect, he will be released, ending his professional career. In all, MiLBUD estimates that it will take an umpire seven to eight years of professional umpiring before he will be considered for a major league position.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/>\n\n{{As of|2018}}, major league umpires earn $150,000 to $450,000 per year depending on their experience, with a $340 [[per diem]] for hotel and meals.<ref name=brpaid>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2773321-how-much-are-mlb-umpires-paid |title=How Much Are MLB Umpires Paid? |first=Kerry |last=Miller |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=May 3, 2018 |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref> Minor league umpires earn from $2,000 to $3,900 per month during the season.<ref name=brpaid/> Amounts vary based on the umpire's classification and experience.\n\n{{As of|2018|3}}, there are 19 four-man crews in MLB, for a total of 76 full-time umpires; they are augmented by 16 Class AAA umpires eligible to umpire regular season games, yielding a total roster of 92 MLB umpires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/roster.jsp |title=Major League Umpire Roster |date=March 2018 |website=[[MLB.com]] |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tom Connolly 1916.jpg|thumb|right|Umpire [[Tom Connolly]] shown with the outside chest protector worn by AL home plate umpires for much of the 20th century]]\n\n==Uniform==\nUmpires are often referred as \"Blue\" because of the color of their uniforms. In the early days of baseball, umpire uniforms resembled suits (usually to keep them inconspicuous when in public) with the only difference being National League umpires wore an inside chest protector while American League umpires wore an outside (or \"balloon\") protector when calling balls and strikes.\n\nIn the 1960s, umpires were allowed to wear dress shirts that were light blue, and the American League umpires wore grey slacks with their blue coats, while National League umpires wore all blue coats and slacks. In 1970, the National League added a large patch on their coat and uniform with the league logo and a number on their left sleeve, along with a short-sleeved light blue shirt for hot summer games. The American League followed suit with the short sleeves in 1972, then in 1973 they wore a maroon blazer along with blue pants until 1979. In 1975, the American League umpire hats included the abbreviation \"AL\" (previous to that they included a shield for the AL). To celebrate the National League's 100th anniversary in 1976, the umpire blazers/light blue shirts included the league's centennial patch and the hats were designed in the \"pillbox\" style  with the year \"'76\" included on them. In 1977, the use of the outside (balloon) protector was outlawed for new umpires but grandfathered for existing umpires, with the last umpire that used the outside protector, [[Jerry Neudecker]], retiring in 1985. The use of ties with the blazers were gradually phased out; the last time they were worn in the World Series was in [[1975 World Series|1975]] and overall was in the [[1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] by [[George Maloney]], [[Terry Cooney]], and [[Nick Bremigan]]. In World Series games starting in [[1976 World Series|1976]], the umpires wore sweaters (light blue for National League umpires and off-white for American League umpires) instead of ties.\n\nIn 1980, Major League Baseball mandated that the umpires' uniforms be standardized, and they went to the American League pre-1973 style of blue blazers, grey slacks, and short sleeved light blue shirts; the American League began adding numbers to their umpire uniforms, with \"AL\" on their caps and National League umpires had \"NL\" on their caps. This style was pretty much the same (except for the use of windbreakers and sweaters later in the 1980s) through 1995. The league initials on the caps changed towards the late 1980s when the \"N\" and \"L\" were combined into a single letter, while the \"A\" and the \"L\" were interlocked.\n\nIn 1996, the button-down light blue shirt was replaced with a navy blue polo shirt with red and white trim on the collar and sleeve cuffs. The numbers were changed to red on the shirts, an \"N\" with the National League logo and an \"A\" with the American League logo on the hats. The American League used an optional red short-sleeved shirt (possibly a homage to the 1973-79 red blazers) that wasn't used by many umpires (the notable exceptions were [[Derryl Cousins]] and [[Dale Scott]], who frequently wore the red shirts while working home plate, even as their colleagues on the bases wore navy blue shirts). The National League added a light blue shirt in 1997, which became much more popular than the red shirts in the AL.\n\nBeginning in 2000, after the individual leagues' umpires were consolidated into a single staff, the 1996-99 uniform styles were carried over with \"MLB\" on the caps instead of the league designations. Since 2001, the uniforms switched to black blazers/windbreakers with grey slacks, with the hats now including the MLB logo (along with the short-sleeved light blue shirts), which remain relatively unchanged. The navy blue shirt was phased out in favor of black, and the light blue shirt was reintroduced after a brief experiment with gray. For the 2017 season, the umpires' jacket was black with light blue trim over the shoulders.\n\n==Famous umpires==\n{{see also|Honor Rolls of Baseball #Umpires|Baseball awards #Other individual awards}}\n\n[[File:Billklem.jpg|thumb|right|Longtime umpire [[Bill Klem]], a member of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]]]]\n\n===Hall of Fame===\nThe following ten umpires have been inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/umpires/umpiresinhof.shtml |title=Hall of Fame Umpires |website=[[Baseball Almanac]] |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref>\n*Class of 1953 \u2013 [[Tom Connolly|Tommy Connolly]] (NL, 1898\u20131900; AL, 1901\u20131931) \n*Class of 1953 \u2013 [[Bill Klem]] ([[National League|NL]] 1905\u20131941)\n*Class of 1973 \u2013 [[Billy Evans]] ([[American League|AL]], 1906\u20131927) \n*Class of 1974 \u2013 [[Jocko Conlan]] ([[National League|NL]] 1941\u20131964) \n*Class of 1976 \u2013 [[Cal Hubbard]] ([[American League|AL]], 1936\u20131951) \n*Class of 1989 \u2013 [[Al Barlick]] ([[National League|NL]], 1940\u20131943, 1946\u20131955, 1958\u20131971) \n*Class of 1992 \u2013 [[Bill McGowan]] ([[American League|AL]], 1925\u20131954)\n*Class of 1999 \u2013 [[Nestor Chylak]] ([[American League|AL]], 1954\u20131978)  \n*Class of 2010 \u2013 [[Doug Harvey (umpire)|Doug Harvey]] ([[National League|NL]] 1962\u20131992) \n*Class of 2013 \u2013 [[Hank O'Day]] ([[National League|NL]], 1895, 1897\u20131911, 1913, 1915\u20131927)\n\nConlan and O'Day played in 128 and 232 major league games, respectively, prior to becoming professional umpires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/C/Pconlj102.htm|title=Jocko Conlan|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/O/Podayh101.htm|title=Hank O'Day|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref>\n\nSeveral ''player'' inductees to the Hall of Fame served as substitute umpires for a small number of games during the early years of baseball; these include [[Hughie Jennings]], [[Willie Keeler]], [[King Kelly]], and [[Chuck Klein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/index.html#Umpires|title=The Directory of Umpires|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref>  Additionally, Hall of Fame player inductees [[Tim Keefe]] and [[Ed Walsh]] umpired professionally in the major leagues after their playing careers ended.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Keefe|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/Pkeeft101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ed Walsh|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/W/Pwalse101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Numbers retired by the National and American Leagues===\n{{see also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}\nLike players, umpires are identified by numbers on their uniforms. National League umpires began wearing numbers in 1970 (though they were assigned numbers in the 1960s) and American League umpires were assigned and began wearing uniform numbers in 1980. The National League umpires' numbers were initially assigned in alphabetical order ([[Al Barlick]] wearing number 1, [[Ken Burkhart]] number 2, etc.) from 1970 to 1978, which meant that an umpire's number could change each year depending on retirements and other staff changes. In 1979, the National League changed the numbering system and thereafter a number's umpire did not change from year to year. At first, as new umpires, they would be assigned higher numbers (for example, in 1979, [[Dave Pallone]], [[Steve Fields]], [[Fred Brocklander]], and [[Lanny Harris]] were assigned numbers 26 to 29 instead of available numbers between 1 and 25). The National League numbering practice changed again in the mid-1980s, when new umpires were assigned previously used numbers (for example, in 1982 [[Gerry Davis (umpire)|Gerry Davis]] was assigned number 12, previously worn by [[Andy Olsen]], and in 1985 [[Tom Hallion]] was assigned number 20, previously worn by [[Ed Vargo]].)\n\nThe American League's number assignments were largely random. [[Bill Haller]], the senior American League umpire in 1980, wore number 1 until his retirement following the [[1982 World Series]], but the number was never reassigned.\n\nIn 2000, the American League and National League umpiring staffs were merged into a unified staff under the auspices of Major League Baseball, and all numbers were made available, including the numbers that had been retired by one of the leagues. (For example, the American League had retired [[Lou DiMuro]]'s number 16 after his death, but it was made available to his son [[Mike DiMuro|Mike]] after the staffs were unified.) In the event of duplications, the more senior umpire was given the first choice. (For example, [[Al Clark (umpire)|Al Clark]] in the AL and [[Jerry Layne]] in the NL both wore the number 24, but because Clark had more seniority he was assigned 24 and Layne number 26. When Clark was relieved of his duties in 2000, Layne was able to obtain number 24.)\n\nFrom time to time, Major League Baseball retires those numbers for umpires who have given outstanding service to the game, or in honor of umpires who have died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=retired_numbers/|title=Umpires: Feature|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nSince unified umpiring crews were established in 2000, all numbers are available to Major League Baseball umpires, as each retired number was reserved per league. Only one umpire number has been retired since the current format was established, 42, because of the [[Major League Baseball]] policy instituted in 1997.\n\n* #1 [[Bill Klem]] ([[National League|NL]], 1905\u201341); currently worn by [[Bruce Dreckman]]\n* #2 [[Nick Bremigan]] ([[American League|AL]], 1974\u201389); currently worn by [[Dan Bellino]]\n* #2 [[Jocko Conlan]] ([[National League|NL]], 1941\u201364); worn by [[Jerry Crawford]] during his tenure in the NL (1977\u20131999)\n* #3 [[Al Barlick]] ([[National League|NL]], 1940\u201343, 1946\u201355, 1958\u201371); currently worn by [[Bill Welke]]\n* #9 [[Bill Kunkel (baseball)|Bill Kunkel]] ([[American League|AL]], 1968\u201384); also a National Basketball Association referee.

The leading '''n''' became attached to the article, changing it to '''an Oumper''' around 1475; this sort of linguistic shift is called [[false splitting]]. Thus today one says \"an umpire\" instead of \"a numpire\".\n\nThe word was applied to the officials of many sports other than baseball, including [[association football]] (where it has been superseded by ''referee'') and [[Umpire (cricket)|cricket]] (which still uses it).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n*[[List of Major League Baseball umpires]]\n*[[Referee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=Three and Two!

They are also sometimes addressed as '''blue''' at lower levels due to the common color of the uniform worn by umpires. In professional baseball, the term ''blue'' is seldom used by players or managers, who instead call the umpire by name. Although games were often officiated by a sole umpire in the formative years of the sport, since the turn of the 20th century, officiating has been commonly divided among several umpires, who form the '''umpiring crew'''.  The position is analogous to that of a [[referee]] in many other sports.\n\n==Duties and positions==\n[[File:Umpire Malachi Moore San Antonio Texas 2016.jpg|thumb|Home plate umpire Malachi Moore reviews the [[Glossary of baseball (L)#lineup cards|lineup cards]] from both teams before a 2016 minor league baseball game]]\nIn a game officiated by two or more umpires, the '''umpire in chief''' (usually the '''home plate umpire''') is the umpire who is in charge of the entire game. This umpire calls [[strike zone|balls and strikes]], calls [[fair ball]]s, [[foul ball]]s short of first/third base, and makes most calls concerning the [[batting (baseball)|batter]] or concerning [[baserunner]]s near home plate. To avoid injury, the home plate umpire wears similar equipment to the catcher, including mask, chest protector, leg guards and shoes with extra protection added over the laces.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> If another umpire leaves the infield to cover a potential play in foul ground or in the outfield, then the plate umpire may move to cover a potential play near second or third base. (The umpire-in-chief should not be confused with the crew chief, who is often a different umpire; see below.) In the event that an umpire is injured and only three remain, the second base position will generally be left vacant.\n\nIn nearly all levels of organized baseball, including the majors, an umpiring crew rotates so that each umpire in the crew works each position, including plate umpire, an equal number of games. In the earliest days of baseball, however, many senior umpires always worked the plate, with Hall of Fame umpire [[Bill Klem]] being the last umpire to do so. Klem did so for the first 16 years of his career.<ref name=\"Chief\">{{cite news |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=591266 |title=Chief among game's umpires |date=2007-04-14 |publisher=Journal Sentinel |author=Haudricourt, Tom |accessdate=2007-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111537/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=591266 |archivedate=2007-09-29 }}</ref> On the Major League level, an umpiring crew generally rotates positions clockwise each game. For example, the plate umpire in one game would umpire third base in the next.\n\nOther umpires are called '''base umpires''' and are commonly stationed near the bases. (''Field umpire'' is a less-common term.) When two umpires are used, the second umpire is simply the '''base umpire'''. This umpire will make most calls concerning runners on the bases and nearby plays, as well as in the middle of the outfield. When three umpires are used, the second umpire is called the '''first-base umpire''' and the third umpire is called the '''third-base umpire''', even though they may move to different positions on the field as the play demands.<ref name=\"Official rules\" />  These two umpires also call [[checked swing]]s, if asked by the plate umpire (often requested by catcher or defensive manager; however, only the plate umpire can authorize an appeal to the base umpire): the first base umpire for right-handed batters, and the third base umpire for left-handed batters; to indicate a checked swing, the umpire will make a \"safe\" gesture with his arms. To indicate a full swing, he will clench his fist.\n\n[[File:MLB umpire.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A second base umpire ([[Mike Reilly (umpire)|Mike Reilly]]) at an MLB game in 2008.]]\n\nWhen four umpires are used (as is the case for all regular season MLB games unless one has to leave due to injury), each umpire is named for the base at which he is stationed. Sometimes a league will provide six umpires; the extra two are stationed along the outfield foul lines and are called the '''left-field''' and '''right-field umpires''' (or simply '''outfield umpires''').\n\nOutfield umpires are used in major events, such as the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], and depending on the level, at parts of post-season [[playoff]]s. For Major League Baseball, all playoff levels use six umpires adding a left-field and right-field umpire, while at lower levels, six umpires are used at the championship games (such as NCAA).<ref name=\"Special Event selection\">{{cite web |title=Special Event selection |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=event_selection |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref> Rulings on catches of batted balls are usually made by the umpire closest to the play.\n\n===Crew chief===\nThe term ''umpire-in-chief'' is not to be confused with the '''crew chief''', who is usually the most experienced umpire in a crew. At the major-league and high minor-league (Class AAA and AA) levels, the crew chief acts as a liaison between the league office and the crew and has a supervisory role over other members of the crew.<ref name=\"Crews\">{{cite web |title=2007 MLB Umpire Crews |url=http://www.mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/crews.jsp |publisher=[[Major League Baseball|MLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125035536/http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/umpires/crews.jsp |archivedate=2007-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nFor example, on the Major League level, \"The Crew Chief shall coordinate and direct his crew's compliance with the Office of the Commissioner's rules and policies. Other Crew Chief responsibilities include: leading periodic discussions and reviews of situations, plays and rules with his crew; generally directing the work of the other umpires on the crew, with particular emphasis on uniformity in dealing with unique situations; assigning responsibilities for maintaining time limits during the game; ensuring the timely filing of all required crew reports for incidents such as ejections, brawls and protested games; and reporting to the Office of Commissioner any irregularity in field conditions at any ballpark.\"<ref name=\"Crews\" /> Thus, on the professional level, some of the duties assigned to the umpire-in-chief (the plate umpire) in the [[Official Baseball Rules]] have been reassigned to the crew chief, regardless of the crew chief's umpiring position during a specific game.  Instant replay reviews, for example, will be reviewed with the crew chief and one other umpire, with results announced by the crew chief.  The crew chief acts analogous to the ''crew chief'' in basketball (as referenced in the NBA and FIBA rules) or the ''referee'' in American football.\n\n===Judgment calls===\n{{seealso|Instant replay#Baseball}}\nAn umpire's judgment call used to be final, unless the umpire making the call chose to ask his partner(s) for help and then decided to reverse it after the discussion.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> Since 2014, the MLB allows managers to challenge plays during the game. If the manager successfully has a call overturned, they are rewarded with another challenge.<ref>{{cite web|title=Replay Review Regulations|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/replay_review.jsp|work=MLB|publisher=MLB|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref> If an umpire seems to make an error in rule interpretation, his call, in some leagues, can be officially protested as is the case in MLB.<ref name=\"Official rules\" /> If the umpire is persistent in his or her interpretation, the matter will be settled at a later time by a league official.  An independent study of umpire pitch-call accuracy over 11 seasons (2008-2018) released on April 8, 2019 by Mark T. Williams of Boston University concluded that over 20% of certain pitches were called incorrectly. For the 2018 season, home plate umpires made about 34,000 incorrect ball and strike calls, which is about 14 per game and 1.6 per inning.<ref>{{cite web|title=MLB Umpires Missed 34,294 Ball-Strike Calls in 2018.

However, by the start of the modern era in 1901, this had become a league responsibility. There is now a unitary major league umpiring roster, although until the [[1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation|1999 labor dispute]] that led to the decertification of the [[Major League Umpires Association]], there were separate National and American League umpires. As a result of the 2000 collective bargaining agreement between Major League Baseball and the newly formed [[Major League Baseball Umpires Association|World Umpires Association]] (now known as the Major League Baseball Umpires Association) all umpires were placed on one roster and work in games in both leagues.\n\n==Amateur umpiring==\n[[File:One Marine Making the Right Calls DVIDS177654.jpg|thumb|right|A volunteer umpire officiating a [[Little League Baseball]] game]]\nAn amateur umpire officiates non-professional or semi-professional baseball. Many amateur umpires are paid (typically on a per-game basis) and thus might be considered [[professionals]], while some amateur umpires are unpaid. According to the [[Little League Baseball]] official website, umpires should be volunteers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/umpirerole.htm|title=Umpire's Role|website=www.littleleague.org}}</ref>\n\nThere are numerous organizations that test or train anyone interested in umpiring for local leagues, and can help make connections to the leagues in the area. Little League Baseball and the [[Babe Ruth League]] are two of the most popular organizations when it comes to youth baseball, and each have their own application, test, and training process for becoming an umpire. In Canada, most umpires are certified through a provincial organization, and then hired by local municipal associations through an umpire in chief.\n\nFor the [[Little League World Series]], amateur umpires from around the world participate on a volunteer basis. Prospective Little League World Series umpires must participate at various levels of Little League All-Star tournaments, ranging from district to state to regional tournaments, prior to being accepted to work the World Series tournament.<ref name=\"LL umpires\">{{cite web |url=http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/index.asp |title=Umpires Home |publisher=[[Little League Baseball]] |accessdate=2007-05-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070425095910/http://www.littleleague.org/umpires/index.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-25}}</ref>\n\n==High school umpiring==\nIn the United States, many (if not most) high schools sponsor a baseball team.  Many high schools sponsor multiple baseball teams; for instance, \"varsity\" and \"junior varsity\" teams.  During the 2017-18 academic year there were 16,513 high schools sponsoring at least one baseball team, and 488,859 students participated on a high school baseball team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nfhs.org/ParticipationStatistics/ParticipationStatistics/|title=Participation Statistics|website=www.nfhs.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Thus, high school baseball is one of the most popular levels of baseball in the United States.  Unlike college athletics, there is no competitive national championship on the high school level.  And, unlike college athletics, umpires on the high school level are not administered by a national organization (such as the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]).  Rather, high school baseball is administered at the state level (usually by a statewide high school athletic association) and the qualifications for becoming and remaining a high school umpire are usually set by the entity overseeing high school baseball in each individual state.  For example, the [[Florida High School Athletic Association]] sets forth minimum requirements for being a high school umpire in Florida.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.becomeanofficial.org/sports/ba.asp|title=Become an FHSAA Official - Baseball|website=www.becomeanofficial.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Many statewide high school athletic associations contract with multiple local umpire associations throughout their state in which the local associations agree to train and provide umpires for high school games in each association's geographic area of the state in return for a \"booking fee\" being paid to the local associations by either the statewide high school association or by individual high schools.  The local associations also promise to train their umpires to meet the state high school association's minimum requirements for umpires.  For example, in Florida the Jacksonville Umpires Association trains and provides umpires for high school games in the [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jaxump.com/schools_division.html|title=About|website=www.jaxump.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\nThe specific requirements for becoming a high school umpire vary from state-to-state.  However, generally all states share the same basic minimum requirements.  First, a person trying to become an umpire must usually register with both the state high school athletic association and their local umpire association.  Upon registering, most states provide their umpires with a high school rulebook, casebook, and umpires' manual.  Second, most states require all umpires to attend clinics and meetings.  These clinics may focus on rules, umpire mechanics, or a combination of both.  Third, most states also require an umpire to pass a rules exam.  Finally, most states also require umpires to work a certain number of pre-season scrimmages prior to working regular season games.  As an example of these requirements, Georgia has an \"officials accountability program\" which sets forth the specific requirements for its interscholastic officials (including the attendance at clinics and camps and the passing of an examination) which can be reviewed [https://www.ghsa.net/sites/default/files/documents/officials/GHSA-Officiating-Handbook_2018-2019.pdf here].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghsa.net/ghsa-contest-officials-handbook-and-accountability-program|title=GHSA Contest Officials Handbook and Accountability Program {{!}} GHSA.net|website=www.ghsa.net|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\nAlthough high school baseball is administered at the state level, the various state high school athletic associations have voluntarily formed the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfhs.org/who-we-are/aboutus|title=AboutUs|website=www.nfhs.org|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>  Through the federation, most state athletic associations have agreed to use its rulebook.  Thus, while high school baseball is administered on a state level, almost all state associations use the same unique baseball rulebook (and the associated casebook and umpire manual) written specifically for the high school level.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfhs.com/p-1102-2019-baseball-rules-book.aspx?CategoryID=0&SectionID=0&ManufacturerID=0&DistributorID=0&GenreID=0&VectorID=0&|title=National Federation of State High School Associations - 2019 Baseball Rules Book|website=www.nfhs.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> As a result, if an individual umpire moves from one state to another state (s)he would likely be using the same rule set in his/her new state as was used in his/her former state.  However, that there are significant rule differences between the federation's rulebook compared to [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) and [[College baseball|NCAA]] rules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umpirebible.com/index.php/home/obr-fed-rule-differences|title=OBR-FED rule differences - UmpireBible|website=www.umpirebible.com|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref> Thus, individuals wanting to umpire on the high school level will have to learn a different set of rules than those they may be familiar with had they previously umpired in a youth league using the MLB or NCAA rulebooks.\n\nAlmost exclusively, high school umpires are paid on a per game basis.  As they are not salaried, they are not paid if they do not actually umpire a game.  The amount paid differs, often significantly, from state to state.  Most high school games are officiated by a two-umpire crew.<ref>[http://www.westernpiedmontbaseball.org/RULES%20&%20MECHANICS.htm], retrieved November 1, 2013</ref>   However, many states use three-umpire and four-umpire crews to officiate playoff games.\n\n==Professional umpire training and career development==\nBecoming a [[Major League Baseball]] umpire requires rigorous training, and very few succeed. Provided the individual makes satisfactory progress throughout, it typically takes from 7\u201310 years to achieve MLB status. First, a person desiring to become a professional umpire must attend one of two umpiring schools authorized by Major League Baseball: [[Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy]] or The [[Harry Wendelstedt Umpire School]].<ref name=\"MiLB umpires\">{{cite web |url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp?mc=_ump_schools |title=Where are the Professional Umpire Schools Located? |publisher=[[Minor League Baseball|MiLB]] |accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>   The former is owned and operated by [[National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues|Minor League Baseball]] while the latter is run by former and current Major League and Minor League umpires.  Both are located in [[Florida]]. There are no prerequisites for attending these schools; however, there is an [http://www.mlbuc.com Umpire Camp], run by Major League Baseball, that is generally considered a \"tool for success\" at either of these schools. These camps, offered as two separate one-week sessions, are held in November in Southern California. Top students at these camps are eligible to earn scholarships to either of the professional umpire schools in Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/camp/index.jsp?content=faqs|title=MLB Umpire Camps|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nAfter five weeks of training, each school sends its top students to the Minor League Baseball Umpire Development (MiLBUD) evaluation course also held in Florida.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\">{{cite web|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp?mc=_ump_career|title=Become an Umpire - MiLB.com Official Info - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}</ref> Minor League Baseball Umpire Development, \"is the entity which is responsible for the training, evaluation, and recommendation for promotion, retention, or release of all umpires in the Minor League Baseball system throughout the United States and Canada.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.milb.com/about/umpires|title=Minor League Baseball umpires|website=MiLB.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>  The actual number of students sent on to the evaluation course is determined by MiLBUD using input from the umpire schools.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/> Generally, the top 10 to 20 percent of each school's graduating class will advance to the evaluation course. The evaluation course is conducted by MiLBUD staff, some of whom are also instructors at the Minor League Baseball Umpire Training Academy.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/> The evaluation course generally lasts around 10 days. Depending on the number of available positions in the various minor leagues, some (but not all) of the evaluation course attendees will be assigned to a low level [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]]. Out of approximately 300 original umpire school students, about 30-35 will ultimately be offered jobs in Minor League Baseball after the evaluation course.\n\nProfessional umpires begin their careers in one of the Rookie or [[Class A (baseball)|Class \"A\"]] Short-Season leagues, with Class-A being divided into three levels (Short-Season, Long-Season and Advanced \"A\").<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/>  Top umpiring prospects will often begin their careers in a short-season \"A\" league (for example, the [[New York\u2013Penn League]]), but most will begin in a rookie league (for example, the [[Gulf Coast League]]).  Since 2008, some umpires who attend the evaluation course, but are not offered jobs in professional baseball may be offered jobs in the [[Coastal Plain League]] (a summer wood bat league for collegiate players).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coastalplain.com/about/Umpires|title=Coastal Plain League|website=Coastal Plain League|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>  During the season, umpires in the Coastal Plain League are evaluated by MiLBUD and they may earn a promotion to a Rookie professional league as a result of injuries or resignations by umpires at higher levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coastalplain.com/about/Umpires|title=Coastal Plain League|website=Coastal Plain League|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:David Rackley 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Umpire [[David Rackley]] working a [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Texas League]] game in 2006]]\nThroughout the season, all minor league umpires in Rookie leagues, Class-A, and Class-AA are evaluated by members of the MiLBUD staff.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\">{{cite web|url=http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/info/umpires.jsp|title=Umpires - MiLB.com Official Info - The Official Site of Minor League Baseball|website=MiLB.com}}</ref>  All umpires receive a detailed written evaluation of their performance after every season.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\"/>  In addition, all umpires (except those in the rookie or Short Season Class-A leagues) receive written mid-season evaluations.<ref name=\"web.minorleaguebaseball.com\"/>\n\nGenerally, an umpire is regarded as making adequate progress \"up the ranks\" if he advances up one level of Class \"A\" ball each year (thus earning promotion to Class AA after three to four years) and promotion to Class AAA after two to three years on the Class AA level. However, this is a very rough estimate and other factors not discussed (such as the number of retirements at higher levels) may dramatically affect these estimates. For example, many umpires saw rapid advancement in 1999 due to the mass resignation of many Major League umpires as a [[collective bargaining]] ploy.\n\nWhen promoted to the Class AAA level, an umpire's evaluation will also be conducted by the umpiring supervisory staff of Major League Baseball. In recent years, top AAA prospects, in addition to umpiring and being evaluated during the regular season (in either the [[International League|International]] or [[Pacific Coast League]]), have been required to umpire in the [[Arizona Fall League]] where they receive extensive training and evaluation by Major League Baseball staff.  Additionally, top minor league prospects will also be sent to umpire in winter leagues (during Major League and Minor League baseball's off-season) usually located in the Caribbean, Central America or South America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.closecallsports.com/2016/11/2016-17-winter-league-milb-umpires.html|title=2016-17 Winter League MiLB Umpire Rosters|last=Imber|first=Gil|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, top AAA prospects may also be rewarded with umpiring only Major League preseason games during [[spring training]] (in lieu of Class AAA games). Additionally, the very top prospects may umpire Major League regular season games on a limited basis as \"fill-in\" umpires (where the Class AAA umpire replaces a sick, injured or vacationing Major League umpire).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.closecallsports.com/2019/01/triple-call-up-and-fill-in-results-end.html|title=Triple-A Call-Up and Fill-In Results - 2018-19 Offseason|last=Imber|first=Gil|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\nFinally, upon the retirement (or firing) of a Major League umpire, a top Class AAA umpire will be promoted to Major League Baseball's permanent umpire staff. During this entire process, if an umpire is evaluated as no longer being a major-league prospect, he will be released, ending his professional career. In all, MiLBUD estimates that it will take an umpire seven to eight years of professional umpiring before he will be considered for a major league position.<ref name=\"minorleaguebaseball1\"/>\n\n{{As of|2018}}, major league umpires earn $150,000 to $450,000 per year depending on their experience, with a $340 [[per diem]] for hotel and meals.<ref name=brpaid>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2773321-how-much-are-mlb-umpires-paid |title=How Much Are MLB Umpires Paid? |first=Kerry |last=Miller |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=May 3, 2018 |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref> Minor league umpires earn from $2,000 to $3,900 per month during the season.<ref name=brpaid/> Amounts vary based on the umpire's classification and experience.\n\n{{As of|2018|3}}, there are 19 four-man crews in MLB, for a total of 76 full-time umpires; they are augmented by 16 Class AAA umpires eligible to umpire regular season games, yielding a total roster of 92 MLB umpires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/roster.jsp |title=Major League Umpire Roster |date=March 2018 |website=[[MLB.com]] |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tom Connolly 1916.jpg|thumb|right|Umpire [[Tom Connolly]] shown with the outside chest protector worn by AL home plate umpires for much of the 20th century]]\n\n==Uniform==\nUmpires are often referred as \"Blue\" because of the color of their uniforms. In the early days of baseball, umpire uniforms resembled suits (usually to keep them inconspicuous when in public) with the only difference being National League umpires wore an inside chest protector while American League umpires wore an outside (or \"balloon\") protector when calling balls and strikes.\n\nIn the 1960s, umpires were allowed to wear dress shirts that were light blue, and the American League umpires wore grey slacks with their blue coats, while National League umpires wore all blue coats and slacks. In 1970, the National League added a large patch on their coat and uniform with the league logo and a number on their left sleeve, along with a short-sleeved light blue shirt for hot summer games. The American League followed suit with the short sleeves in 1972, then in 1973 they wore a maroon blazer along with blue pants until 1979. In 1975, the American League umpire hats included the abbreviation \"AL\" (previous to that they included a shield for the AL). To celebrate the National League's 100th anniversary in 1976, the umpire blazers/light blue shirts included the league's centennial patch and the hats were designed in the \"pillbox\" style  with the year \"'76\" included on them. In 1977, the use of the outside (balloon) protector was outlawed for new umpires but grandfathered for existing umpires, with the last umpire that used the outside protector, [[Jerry Neudecker]], retiring in 1985. The use of ties with the blazers were gradually phased out; the last time they were worn in the World Series was in [[1975 World Series|1975]] and overall was in the [[1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] by [[George Maloney]], [[Terry Cooney]], and [[Nick Bremigan]]. In World Series games starting in [[1976 World Series|1976]], the umpires wore sweaters (light blue for National League umpires and off-white for American League umpires) instead of ties.\n\nIn 1980, Major League Baseball mandated that the umpires' uniforms be standardized, and they went to the American League pre-1973 style of blue blazers, grey slacks, and short sleeved light blue shirts; the American League began adding numbers to their umpire uniforms, with \"AL\" on their caps and National League umpires had \"NL\" on their caps. This style was pretty much the same (except for the use of windbreakers and sweaters later in the 1980s) through 1995. The league initials on the caps changed towards the late 1980s when the \"N\" and \"L\" were combined into a single letter, while the \"A\" and the \"L\" were interlocked.\n\nIn 1996, the button-down light blue shirt was replaced with a navy blue polo shirt with red and white trim on the collar and sleeve cuffs. The numbers were changed to red on the shirts, an \"N\" with the National League logo and an \"A\" with the American League logo on the hats. The American League used an optional red short-sleeved shirt (possibly a homage to the 1973-79 red blazers) that wasn't used by many umpires (the notable exceptions were [[Derryl Cousins]] and [[Dale Scott]], who frequently wore the red shirts while working home plate, even as their colleagues on the bases wore navy blue shirts). The National League added a light blue shirt in 1997, which became much more popular than the red shirts in the AL.\n\nBeginning in 2000, after the individual leagues' umpires were consolidated into a single staff, the 1996-99 uniform styles were carried over with \"MLB\" on the caps instead of the league designations. Since 2001, the uniforms switched to black blazers/windbreakers with grey slacks, with the hats now including the MLB logo (along with the short-sleeved light blue shirts), which remain relatively unchanged. The navy blue shirt was phased out in favor of black, and the light blue shirt was reintroduced after a brief experiment with gray. For the 2017 season, the umpires' jacket was black with light blue trim over the shoulders.\n\n==Famous umpires==\n{{see also|Honor Rolls of Baseball #Umpires|Baseball awards #Other individual awards}}\n\n[[File:Billklem.jpg|thumb|right|Longtime umpire [[Bill Klem]], a member of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]]]]\n\n===Hall of Fame===\nThe following ten umpires have been inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/umpires/umpiresinhof.shtml |title=Hall of Fame Umpires |website=[[Baseball Almanac]] |accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref>\n*Class of 1953 \u2013 [[Tom Connolly|Tommy Connolly]] (NL, 1898\u20131900; AL, 1901\u20131931) \n*Class of 1953 \u2013 [[Bill Klem]] ([[National League|NL]] 1905\u20131941)\n*Class of 1973 \u2013 [[Billy Evans]] ([[American League|AL]], 1906\u20131927) \n*Class of 1974 \u2013 [[Jocko Conlan]] ([[National League|NL]] 1941\u20131964) \n*Class of 1976 \u2013 [[Cal Hubbard]] ([[American League|AL]], 1936\u20131951) \n*Class of 1989 \u2013 [[Al Barlick]] ([[National League|NL]], 1940\u20131943, 1946\u20131955, 1958\u20131971) \n*Class of 1992 \u2013 [[Bill McGowan]] ([[American League|AL]], 1925\u20131954)\n*Class of 1999 \u2013 [[Nestor Chylak]] ([[American League|AL]], 1954\u20131978)  \n*Class of 2010 \u2013 [[Doug Harvey (umpire)|Doug Harvey]] ([[National League|NL]] 1962\u20131992) \n*Class of 2013 \u2013 [[Hank O'Day]] ([[National League|NL]], 1895, 1897\u20131911, 1913, 1915\u20131927)\n\nConlan and O'Day played in 128 and 232 major league games, respectively, prior to becoming professional umpires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/C/Pconlj102.htm|title=Jocko Conlan|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/O/Podayh101.htm|title=Hank O'Day|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref>\n\nSeveral ''player'' inductees to the Hall of Fame served as substitute umpires for a small number of games during the early years of baseball; these include [[Hughie Jennings]], [[Willie Keeler]], [[King Kelly]], and [[Chuck Klein]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/index.html#Umpires|title=The Directory of Umpires|accessdate=August 28, 2017 |work=Retrosheet.org}}</ref>  Additionally, Hall of Fame player inductees [[Tim Keefe]] and [[Ed Walsh]] umpired professionally in the major leagues after their playing careers ended.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Keefe|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/Pkeeft101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ed Walsh|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/W/Pwalse101.htm|work=Retrosheet.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Numbers retired by the National and American Leagues===\n{{see also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}\nLike players, umpires are identified by numbers on their uniforms. National League umpires began wearing numbers in 1970 (though they were assigned numbers in the 1960s) and American League umpires were assigned and began wearing uniform numbers in 1980. The National League umpires' numbers were initially assigned in alphabetical order ([[Al Barlick]] wearing number 1, [[Ken Burkhart]] number 2, etc.) from 1970 to 1978, which meant that an umpire's number could change each year depending on retirements and other staff changes. In 1979, the National League changed the numbering system and thereafter a number's umpire did not change from year to year. At first, as new umpires, they would be assigned higher numbers (for example, in 1979, [[Dave Pallone]], [[Steve Fields]], [[Fred Brocklander]], and [[Lanny Harris]] were assigned numbers 26 to 29 instead of available numbers between 1 and 25). The National League numbering practice changed again in the mid-1980s, when new umpires were assigned previously used numbers (for example, in 1982 [[Gerry Davis (umpire)|Gerry Davis]] was assigned number 12, previously worn by [[Andy Olsen]], and in 1985 [[Tom Hallion]] was assigned number 20, previously worn by [[Ed Vargo]].)\n\nThe American League's number assignments were largely random. [[Bill Haller]], the senior American League umpire in 1980, wore number 1 until his retirement following the [[1982 World Series]], but the number was never reassigned.\n\nIn 2000, the American League and National League umpiring staffs were merged into a unified staff under the auspices of Major League Baseball, and all numbers were made available, including the numbers that had been retired by one of the leagues. (For example, the American League had retired [[Lou DiMuro]]'s number 16 after his death, but it was made available to his son [[Mike DiMuro|Mike]] after the staffs were unified.) In the event of duplications, the more senior umpire was given the first choice. (For example, [[Al Clark (umpire)|Al Clark]] in the AL and [[Jerry Layne]] in the NL both wore the number 24, but because Clark had more seniority he was assigned 24 and Layne number 26. When Clark was relieved of his duties in 2000, Layne was able to obtain number 24.)\n\nFrom time to time, Major League Baseball retires those numbers for umpires who have given outstanding service to the game, or in honor of umpires who have died.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/umpires/feature.jsp?feature=retired_numbers/|title=Umpires: Feature|website=Major League Baseball}}</ref>\n\nSince unified umpiring crews were established in 2000, all numbers are available to Major League Baseball umpires, as each retired number was reserved per league. Only one umpire number has been retired since the current format was established, 42, because of the [[Major League Baseball]] policy instituted in 1997.\n\n* #1 [[Bill Klem]] ([[National League|NL]], 1905\u201341); currently worn by [[Bruce Dreckman]]\n* #2 [[Nick Bremigan]] ([[American League|AL]], 1974\u201389); currently worn by [[Dan Bellino]]\n* #2 [[Jocko Conlan]] ([[National League|NL]], 1941\u201364); worn by [[Jerry Crawford]] during his tenure in the NL (1977\u20131999)\n* #3 [[Al Barlick]] ([[National League|NL]], 1940\u201343, 1946\u201355, 1958\u201371); currently worn by [[Bill Welke]]\n* #9 [[Bill Kunkel (baseball)|Bill Kunkel]] ([[American League|AL]], 1968\u201384); also a National Basketball Association referee.

The leading '''n''' became attached to the article, changing it to '''an Oumper''' around 1475; this sort of linguistic shift is called [[false splitting]]. Thus today one says \"an umpire\" instead of \"a numpire\".\n\nThe word was applied to the officials of many sports other than baseball, including [[association football]] (where it has been superseded by ''referee'') and [[Umpire (cricket)|cricket]] (which still uses it).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Baseball}}\n*[[List of Major League Baseball umpires]]\n*[[Referee]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=Three and Two!

While this saved a tremendous amount of time, for 17 years the ''Wind Waker'' speedrun time was still significantly held back by there being no known way to skip a barrier that separated an area accessible very early in the game from the final dungeon.  However, on July 5, 2019, a way to skip the barrier was finally found using an actor unloading glitch, which involves filling up the game's [[dynamic memory]] to the point that actors fail to load, including the barrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wind Waker - Barrier Skip|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtc-RojbdyQ}}</ref>\n\nIn the months following this major discovery, the Any% record fell by over 2 and a half hours.

While this saved a tremendous amount of time, for 17 years the ''Wind Waker'' speedrun time was still significantly held back by there being no known way to skip a barrier that separated an area accessible very early in the game from the final dungeon.  However, on July 5, 2019, a way to skip the barrier was finally found using an actor unloading glitch, which involves filling up the game's [[dynamic memory]] to the point that actors fail to load, including the barrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Wind Waker - Barrier Skip|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtc-RojbdyQ}}</ref>\n\nIn the months following this major discovery, the Any% record fell by over 2 and a half hours.
