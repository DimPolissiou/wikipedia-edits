He first manifested his mathematical abilities while in secondary school, at Warsaw's ''Szko\u0142a Mazowiecka''.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], pp.17-18</ref> Nevertheless, he entered the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1918 intending to study [[biology]].<ref name=\"Feferman & Feferman, p.26\">[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], p.26</ref>\n\nAfter Poland regained independence in 1918, Warsaw University came under the leadership of [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski]] and [[Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski]] and quickly became a world-leading research institution in logic, foundational mathematics, and the philosophy of mathematics. Le\u015bniewski recognized Tarski's potential as a mathematician and encouraged him to abandon biology.<ref name=\"Feferman & Feferman, p.26\"/>  Henceforth Tarski attended courses taught by \u0141ukasiewicz, Sierpi\u0144ski, [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]] and [[Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski]], and in 1924 became the only person ever to complete a doctorate under Le\u015bniewski's supervision. His thesis was entitled ''O wyrazie pierwotnym logistyki'' (''On the Primitive Term of Logistic''; published 1923). Tarski and Le\u015bniewski soon grew cool to each other. However, in later life, Tarski reserved his warmest praise for [[Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski|Kotarbi\u0144ski]], which was reciprocated.\n\nIn 1923, Alfred Teitelbaum and his brother Wac\u0142aw changed their surname to \"Tarski\". The Tarski brothers also converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], Poland's dominant religion. Alfred did so even though he was an avowed [[atheism|atheist]].<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], p.294</ref><ref>\"Most of the Socialist Party members were also in favor of assimilation, and Tarski's political allegiance was socialist at the time. So, along with its being a practical move, becoming more Polish than Jewish was an ideological statement and was approved by many, though not all, of his colleagues. As to why Tarski, a professed atheist, converted, that just came with the territory and was part of the package: if you were going to be Polish then you had to say you were Catholic.\" Anita Burdman Feferman, Solomon Feferman, ''Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic'' (2004), page 39.</ref>\n\nAfter becoming the youngest person ever to complete a doctorate at Warsaw University, Tarski taught logic at the Polish Pedagogical Institute, mathematics and logic at the University, and served as \u0141ukasiewicz's assistant. Because these positions were poorly paid, Tarski also taught mathematics at a Warsaw secondary school;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.januszkorczak.ca/bulletins/Bulletin%20%235.pdf|title=The Newsletter of the Janusz Korczak Association of Canada|id=Number 5|date=September 2007|accessdate=8 February 2012}}</ref> before World War II, it was not uncommon for European intellectuals of research caliber to teach high school. Hence between 1923 and his departure for the United States in 1939, Tarski not only wrote several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground-breaking, but also did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high-school mathematics. In 1929 Tarski married fellow teacher Maria Witkowska, a Pole of Catholic background. She had worked as a courier for the army in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]]. They had two children; a son Jan who became a physicist, and a daughter Ina who married the mathematician [[Andrzej Ehrenfeucht]].<ref>Feferman & Feferman (2004), pp. 239\u2013242.</ref>\n\nTarski applied for a chair of philosophy at [[Lw\u00f3w University]], but on [[Bertrand Russell]]'s recommendation it was awarded to [[Leon Chwistek]].<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], p. 67</ref> In 1930, Tarski visited the [[University of Vienna]], lectured to [[Karl Menger]]'s colloquium, and met [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]. Thanks to a fellowship, he was able to return to Vienna during the first half of 1935 to work with Menger's research group. From Vienna he traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the [[Unity of Science]] movement, an outgrowth of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In 1937, Tarski applied for a chair at [[Pozna\u0144 University]] but the chair was abolished.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], pp. 102-103</ref> Tarski's ties to the Unity of Science movement likely saved his life, because they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress held in September 1939 at [[Harvard University]]. Thus he left Poland in August 1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the United States before the German and Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Tarski left reluctantly, because Le\u015bniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. Oblivious to the [[Nazi]] threat, he left his wife and children in Warsaw. He did not see them again until 1946. During the war, nearly all his Jewish extended family were murdered at the hands of the German occupying authorities.\n\nOnce in the United States, Tarski held a number of temporary teaching and research positions: Harvard University (1939), [[City College of New York]] (1940), and thanks to a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] (1942), where he again met G\u00f6del. In 1942, Tarski joined the Mathematics Department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he spent the rest of his career. Tarski became an American citizen in 1945.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], Chap. 5, pp. 124-149</ref> Although emeritus from 1968, he taught until 1973 and supervised Ph.D. candidates until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00159&toc.depth=1&toc.id=|title=Alfred Tarski, Mathematics: Berkeley|author1=Robert Vaught|author2=John Addison|author3=Benson Mates|author4=Julia Robinson |year=1985|publisher=University of California (System) Academic Senate|accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> At Berkeley, Tarski acquired a reputation as an astounding and demanding teacher, a fact noted by many observers:\n\n<blockquote>His seminars at Berkeley quickly became famous in the world of mathematical logic.

Tarski presided over the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], 1944&ndash;46, and the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science, 1956&ndash;57. He was also an honorary editor of ''[[Algebra Universalis]]''.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Tarski}}</ref>\n\n==Mathematician==\nTarski's mathematical interests were exceptionally broad. His collected papers run to about 2,500 pages, most of them on mathematics, not logic. For a concise survey of Tarski's mathematical and logical accomplishments by his former student Solomon Feferman, see \"Interludes I&ndash;VI\" in Feferman and Feferman.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], pp. 43-52, 69-75, 109-123, 189-195, 277-287, 334-342</ref>\n\nTarski's first paper, published when he was 19 years old, was on [[set theory]], a subject to which he returned throughout his life. In 1924, he and [[Stefan Banach]] proved that, if one accepts the [[Axiom of Choice]], a [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] can be cut into a finite number of pieces, and then reassembled into a ball of larger size, or alternatively it can be reassembled into two balls whose sizes each equal that of the original one. This result is now called the [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]].\n\nIn ''A decision method for elementary algebra and geometry'', Tarski showed, by the method of [[quantifier elimination]], that the [[first-order theory]] of the [[real number]]s under addition and multiplication is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]. (While this result appeared only in 1948, it dates back to 1930 and was mentioned in Tarski (1931).) This is a very curious result, because [[Alonzo Church]] proved in 1936 that [[Peano arithmetic]] (the theory  of [[natural number]]s) is ''not'' decidable. Peano arithmetic is also incomplete by [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]]. In his 1953 ''Undecidable theories'', Tarski et al. showed that many mathematical systems, including [[lattice theory]], abstract [[projective geometry]], and [[closure algebra]]s, are all undecidable. The theory of [[Abelian group]]s is decidable, but that of non-Abelian groups is not.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s, Tarski often taught high school [[geometry]]. Using some ideas of [[Mario Pieri]], in 1926 Tarski devised an original [[axiomatization]] for plane [[Euclidean geometry]], one considerably more concise than [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert's]]. [[Tarski's axioms]] form a first-order theory devoid of set theory, whose individuals are [[Point (geometry)|points]], and having only two primitive [[finitary relation|relations]]. In 1930, he proved this theory decidable because it can be mapped into another theory he had already proved decidable, namely his first-order theory of the real numbers.\n\nIn 1929 he showed that much of Euclidean [[solid geometry]] could be recast as a first-order theory whose individuals are ''spheres'' (a [[primitive notion]]), a single primitive binary relation \"is contained in\", and two axioms that, among other things, imply that containment [[partial order|partially orders]] the spheres. Relaxing the requirement that all individuals be spheres yields a formalization of [[mereology]] far easier to exposit than [[Lesniewski]]'s variant. Near the end of his life, Tarski wrote a very long letter, published as Tarski and Givant (1999), summarizing his work on geometry.\n\n''Cardinal Algebras'' studied algebras whose models include the arithmetic of [[cardinal number]]s. ''Ordinal Algebras'' sets out an algebra for the additive theory of [[order type]]s. Cardinal, but not ordinal, addition commutes.\n\nIn 1941, Tarski published an important paper on [[binary relation]]s, which began the work on [[relation algebra]] and its [[metamathematics]] that occupied Tarski and his students for much of the balance of his life. While that exploration (and the closely related work of [[Roger Lyndon]]) uncovered some important limitations of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation algebra can express most [[axiomatic set theory]] and [[Peano arithmetic]]. For an introduction to [[relation algebra]], see Maddux (2006). In the late 1940s, Tarski and his students devised [[cylindric algebra]]s, which are to [[first-order logic]] what the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] is to classical [[sentential logic]]. This work culminated in the two monographs by Tarski, Henkin, and Monk (1971, 1985).\n\n==Logician==\nTarski's student, Vaught, has ranked Tarski as one of the four greatest logicians of all time &mdash; along with Aristotle, [[Gottlob Frege]], and Kurt G\u00f6del.<ref name=FFintro/><ref name=\"Vaught\">{{cite journal|last=Vaught|first=Robert L.|date=Dec 1986|title=Alfred Tarski's Work in Model Theory|journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]|volume=51|issue=4|pages=869\u2013882|doi=10.2307/2273900|jstor=2273900}}</ref><ref name=\"Restall\">{{cite web|url=http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/|title=Great Moments in Logic |last=Restall|first=Greg|date=2002\u20132006|accessdate=2009-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206052240/http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/| archivedate= 6 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> <!-- Of these four, he was by far the most prolific author. MORE THAN ARISTOTLE???  PROVIDE Reference! --> However, Tarski often expressed great admiration for [[Logic of relatives|Charles Sanders Peirce]], particularly for his pioneering work in the [[Finitary relation|logic of relations]].\n\nTarski produced axioms for ''logical consequence'', and worked on [[deductive system]]s, the algebra of logic, and the theory of definability. His semantic methods, which culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeley students developed in the 1950s and 60s, radically transformed Hilbert's proof-theoretic metamathematics.\n\n<blockquote>In [Tarski's] view, metamathematics became similar to any mathematical discipline. Not only can its concepts and results be mathematized, but they actually can be integrated into mathematics. ... Tarski destroyed the borderline between metamathematics and mathematics. He objected to restricting the role of metamathematics to the foundations of mathematics.<ref name=\"Sinaceur\">{{cite journal|last=Sinaceur|first=Hourya|title=Alfred Tarski: Semantic Shift, Heuristic Shift in Metamathematics|journal=Synthese|volume=126|issue=1\u20132|pages=49\u201365|issn=0039-7857|doi=10.1023/A:1005268531418|year=2001|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01119489}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTarski's 1936 article \"On the concept of logical consequence\" argued that the conclusion of an argument will follow logically from its premises if and only if every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion. In 1937, he published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies. His high school and undergraduate teaching on logic and axiomatics culminated in a classic short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally in a 1941 English translation as ''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences''.\n\nTarski's 1969 \"Truth and proof\" considered both [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] and [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]], and mulled over their consequences for the axiomatic method in mathematics.\n\n==Truth in formalized languages==\n{{main|Semantic theory of truth}}\nIn 1933, Tarski published a very long paper in Polish, titled \"Poj\u0119cie prawdy w j\u0119zykach nauk dedukcyjnych\",<ref>Alfred Tarski, \"POJ\u0118CIE PRAWDY W J\u0118ZYKACH NAUK DEDUKCYJNYCH\", Towarszystwo Naukowe Warszawskie, Warszawa, 1933.

An English translation appeared in the 1956 first edition of the volume ''Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics''. This collection of papers from 1923 to 1938 is an event in 20th-century [[analytic philosophy]], a contribution to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semantics]], and the [[philosophy of language]]. For a brief discussion of its content, see [[Convention T]] (and also [[T-schema]]).\n\nSome recent philosophical debate examines the extent to which Tarski's theory of truth for formalized languages can be seen as a [[correspondence theory of truth]]. The debate centers on how to read Tarski's condition of material adequacy for a truth definition. That condition requires that the truth theory have the following as theorems for all sentences p of the language for which truth is being defined:\n\n: \"p\" is true [[if and only if]] p.\n\n(where p is the proposition expressed by \"p\")\n\nThe debate amounts to whether to read sentences of this form, such as\n\n<blockquote>\"Snow is white\" is true if and only if snow is white</blockquote>\n\nas expressing merely a [[deflationary theory of truth]] or as embodying [[truth]] as a more substantial property (see Kirkham 1992). It is important to realize that Tarski's theory of truth is for formalized languages, so  examples in natural language are not illustrations of the use of Tarski's theory of truth.\n\n==Logical consequence==\nIn 1936, Tarski published Polish and German versions of a lecture he had given the preceding year at the International Congress of Scientific Philosophy in Paris. <!-- (First appearance in English?) --> A new English translation of this paper, Tarski (2002), highlights the many differences between the German and Polish versions of the paper, and corrects a number of mistranslations in Tarski (1983).\n\nThis publication set out the modern [[model theory|model-theoretic]] definition of (semantic) logical consequence, or at least the basis for it. Whether Tarski's notion was entirely the modern one turns on whether he intended to admit models with varying domains (and in particular, models with domains of different [[cardinal number|cardinalities]]). This question is a matter of some debate in the current philosophical literature. [[John Etchemendy]] stimulated much of the recent discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.<ref>{{cite book|last=Etchemendy|first=John|title=The Concept of Logical Consequence|publisher=Stanford CA: CSLI Publications|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57586-194-4}}</ref>\n\nTarski ends by pointing out that his definition of logical consequence depends upon a division of terms into the logical and the extra-logical and he expresses some skepticism that any such objective division will be forthcoming. \"What are Logical Notions?\" can thus be viewed as continuing \"On the Concept of Logical Consequence\".\n\n==Work on logical notions==\nAnother theory of Tarski's attracting attention in the recent philosophical literature is that outlined in his \"What are Logical Notions?\" (Tarski 1986). This is the published version of a talk that he gave originally in 1966 in London and later in 1973 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; it was edited without his direct involvement by [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]]. It became the most cited paper in the journal ''History and Philosophy of Logic''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/showMostCitedArticles?journalCode=thpl20#.UkH58D_-kQs | title=History and Philosophy of Logic}}</ref>\n\nIn the talk, Tarski proposed a demarcation of the logical operations (which he calls \"notions\") from the non-logical. The suggested criteria were derived from the [[Erlangen programme]] of the German 19th century Mathematician, [[Felix Klein]]. Mautner, in 1946, and possibly an article by the Portuguese mathematician Sebastiao e Silva, anticipated Tarski in applying the Erlangen Program to logic.\n\nThat program classified the various types of geometry ([[Euclidean geometry]], [[affine geometry]], [[topology]], etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that every point of the space is associated with or mapped to one other point of the space. So, \"rotate 30 degrees\" and  \"magnify by a factor of 2\" are intuitive descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.\n\nAs the range of permissible transformations becomes broader, the range of objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by the application of the transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a [[polygon]] from an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.\n\nTarski's proposal was to demarcate the logical notions by considering all possible one-to-one transformations ([[automorphism]]s) of a domain onto itself. By domain is meant the [[universe of discourse]] of a model for the semantic theory of a logic. If one identifies the [[truth value]] True with the domain set and the truth-value False with the empty set, then the following operations are counted as logical under the proposal:\n\n# ''[[Truth-function]]s'': All truth-functions are admitted by the proposal. This includes, but is not limited to, all ''n''-ary truth-functions for finite ''n''. (It also admits of truth-functions with any infinite number of places.)\n# ''Individuals'': No individuals, provided the domain has at least two members.\n# ''Predicates'':\n#* the one-place total and null predicates, the former having all members of the domain in its extension and the latter having no members of the domain in its extension\n#* two-place total and null predicates, the former having the set of all ordered pairs of domain members as its extension and the latter with the empty set as extension\n#* the two-place identity predicate, with the set of all order-pairs <''a'',''a''> in its extension, where ''a'' is a member of the domain\n#* the two-place diversity predicate, with the set of all order pairs <''a'',''b''> where ''a'' and ''b'' are distinct members of the domain\n#* ''n''-ary predicates in general: all predicates definable from the identity predicate together with [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[disjunction]] and [[negation]] (up to any ordinality, finite or infinite)\n# ''[[Quantifier (logic)|Quantifiers]]'': Tarski explicitly discusses only monadic quantifiers and points out that all such numerical quantifiers are admitted under his proposal. These include the standard universal and existential quantifiers as well as numerical quantifiers such as \"Exactly four\", \"Finitely many\", \"Uncountably many\", and \"Between four and 9 million\", for example. While Tarski does not enter into the issue, it is also clear that polyadic quantifiers are admitted under the proposal. These are quantifiers like, given two predicates ''Fx'' and ''Gy'', \"More(''x, y'')\", which says \"More things have ''F'' than have ''G''.\"\n# ''Set-Theoretic relations'': Relations such as [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[Union (set theory)|union]] applied to [[subset]]s of the domain are logical in the present sense.\n# ''Set membership'': Tarski ended his lecture with a discussion of whether the set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given the reduction of (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, the question of whether most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along the lines of [[type theory]], but is extralogical if set theory is set out axiomatically, as in the canonical [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]].\n# ''Logical notions of higher order'': While Tarski confined his discussion to operations of first-order logic, there is nothing about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic. (Tarski likely restricted his attention to first-order notions as the talk was given to a non-technical audience.) So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are admitted as well.\n\nIn some ways the present proposal is the obverse of that of Lindenbaum and Tarski (1936), who proved that all the logical operations of Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' are invariant under one-to-one transformations of the domain onto itself. The present proposal is also employed in Tarski and Givant (1987).\n\nSolomon Feferman and Vann McGee further discussed Tarski's proposal in work published after his death. Feferman (1999) raises problems for the proposal and suggests a cure: replacing Tarski's preservation by automorphisms with preservation by arbitrary [[homomorphism]]s. In essence, this suggestion circumvents the difficulty Tarski's proposal has in dealing with sameness of logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman's proposal results in a radical restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski's original proposal. In particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard first-order logic without identity.\n\nMcGee (1996) provides a precise account of what operations are logical in the sense of Tarski's proposal in terms of expressibility in a language that extends first-order logic by allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions and disjunctions, and quantification over arbitrarily many variables. \"Arbitrarily\" includes a countable infinity.\n\n==Works==\n;Anthologies and collections\n* 1986.

He first manifested his mathematical abilities while in secondary school, at Warsaw's ''Szko\u0142a Mazowiecka''.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], pp.17-18</ref> Nevertheless, he entered the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1918 intending to study [[biology]].<ref name=\"Feferman & Feferman, p.26\">[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], p.26</ref>\n\nAfter Poland regained independence in 1918, Warsaw University came under the leadership of [[Jan \u0141ukasiewicz]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski]] and [[Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski]] and quickly became a world-leading research institution in logic, foundational mathematics, and the philosophy of mathematics. Le\u015bniewski recognized Tarski's potential as a mathematician and encouraged him to abandon biology.<ref name=\"Feferman & Feferman, p.26\"/>  Henceforth Tarski attended courses taught by \u0141ukasiewicz, Sierpi\u0144ski, [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]] and [[Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski]], and in 1924 became the only person ever to complete a doctorate under Le\u015bniewski's supervision. His thesis was entitled ''O wyrazie pierwotnym logistyki'' (''On the Primitive Term of Logistic''; published 1923). Tarski and Le\u015bniewski soon grew cool to each other. However, in later life, Tarski reserved his warmest praise for [[Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski|Kotarbi\u0144ski]], which was reciprocated.\n\nIn 1923, Alfred Teitelbaum and his brother Wac\u0142aw changed their surname to \"Tarski\". The Tarski brothers also converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], Poland's dominant religion. Alfred did so even though he was an avowed [[atheism|atheist]].<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], p.294</ref><ref>\"Most of the Socialist Party members were also in favor of assimilation, and Tarski's political allegiance was socialist at the time. So, along with its being a practical move, becoming more Polish than Jewish was an ideological statement and was approved by many, though not all, of his colleagues.

Because these positions were poorly paid, Tarski also taught mathematics at a Warsaw secondary school;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.januszkorczak.ca/bulletins/Bulletin%20%235.pdf|title=The Newsletter of the Janusz Korczak Association of Canada|id=Number 5|date=September 2007|accessdate=8 February 2012}}</ref> before World War II, it was not uncommon for European intellectuals of research caliber to teach high school. Hence between 1923 and his departure for the United States in 1939, Tarski not only wrote several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground-breaking, but also did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high-school mathematics. In 1929 Tarski married fellow teacher Maria Witkowska, a Pole of Catholic background. She had worked as a courier for the army in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]]. They had two children; a son Jan who became a physicist, and a daughter Ina who married the mathematician [[Andrzej Ehrenfeucht]].<ref>Feferman & Feferman (2004), pp. 239\u2013242.</ref>\n\nTarski applied for a chair of philosophy at [[Lw\u00f3w University]], but on [[Bertrand Russell]]'s recommendation it was awarded to [[Leon Chwistek]].<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], p. 67</ref> In 1930, Tarski visited the [[University of Vienna]], lectured to [[Karl Menger]]'s colloquium, and met [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]. Thanks to a fellowship, he was able to return to Vienna during the first half of 1935 to work with Menger's research group. From Vienna he traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the [[Unity of Science]] movement, an outgrowth of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In 1937, Tarski applied for a chair at [[Pozna\u0144 University]] but the chair was abolished.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], pp. 102-103</ref> Tarski's ties to the Unity of Science movement likely saved his life, because they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress held in September 1939 at [[Harvard University]]. Thus he left Poland in August 1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the United States before the German and Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Tarski left reluctantly, because Le\u015bniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. Oblivious to the [[Nazi]] threat, he left his wife and children in Warsaw. He did not see them again until 1946. During the war, nearly all his Jewish extended family were murdered at the hands of the German occupying authorities.\n\nOnce in the United States, Tarski held a number of temporary teaching and research positions: Harvard University (1939), [[City College of New York]] (1940), and thanks to a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] (1942), where he again met G\u00f6del. In 1942, Tarski joined the Mathematics Department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he spent the rest of his career. Tarski became an American citizen in 1945.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], Chap. 5, pp. 124-149</ref> Although emeritus from 1968, he taught until 1973 and supervised Ph.D. candidates until his death.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb4d5nb20m&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00159&toc.depth=1&toc.id=|title=Alfred Tarski, Mathematics: Berkeley|author1=Robert Vaught|author2=John Addison|author3=Benson Mates|author4=Julia Robinson |year=1985|publisher=University of California (System) Academic Senate|accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> At Berkeley, Tarski acquired a reputation as an awesome and demanding teacher, a fact noted by many observers:\n\n<blockquote>His seminars at Berkeley quickly became famous in the world of mathematical logic.

Tarski presided over the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], 1944&ndash;46, and the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science, 1956&ndash;57. He was also an honorary editor of ''[[Algebra Universalis]]''.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Tarski}}</ref>\n\n==Mathematician==\nTarski's mathematical interests were exceptionally broad. His collected papers run to about 2,500 pages, most of them on mathematics, not logic. For a concise survey of Tarski's mathematical and logical accomplishments by his former student Solomon Feferman, see \"Interludes I&ndash;VI\" in Feferman and Feferman.<ref>[[#F-F|Feferman & Feferman]], pp. 43-52, 69-75, 109-123, 189-195, 277-287, 334-342</ref>\n\nTarski's first paper, published when he was 19 years old, was on [[set theory]], a subject to which he returned throughout his life. In 1924, he and [[Stefan Banach]] proved that, if one accepts the [[Axiom of Choice]], a [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] can be cut into a finite number of pieces, and then reassembled into a ball of larger size, or alternatively it can be reassembled into two balls whose sizes each equal that of the original one. This result is now called the [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]].\n\nIn ''A decision method for elementary algebra and geometry'', Tarski showed, by the method of [[quantifier elimination]], that the [[first-order theory]] of the [[real number]]s under addition and multiplication is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]. (While this result appeared only in 1948, it dates back to 1930 and was mentioned in Tarski (1931).) This is a very curious result, because [[Alonzo Church]] proved in 1936 that [[Peano arithmetic]] (the theory  of [[natural number]]s) is ''not'' decidable. Peano arithmetic is also incomplete by [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]]. In his 1953 ''Undecidable theories'', Tarski et al. showed that many mathematical systems, including [[lattice theory]], abstract [[projective geometry]], and [[closure algebra]]s, are all undecidable. The theory of [[Abelian group]]s is decidable, but that of non-Abelian groups is not.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s, Tarski often taught high school [[geometry]]. Using some ideas of [[Mario Pieri]], in 1926 Tarski devised an original [[axiomatization]] for plane [[Euclidean geometry]], one considerably more concise than [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert's]]. [[Tarski's axioms]] form a first-order theory devoid of set theory, whose individuals are [[Point (geometry)|points]], and having only two primitive [[finitary relation|relations]]. In 1930, he proved this theory decidable because it can be mapped into another theory he had already proved decidable, namely his first-order theory of the real numbers.\n\nIn 1929 he showed that much of Euclidean [[solid geometry]] could be recast as a first-order theory whose individuals are ''spheres'' (a [[primitive notion]]), a single primitive binary relation \"is contained in\", and two axioms that, among other things, imply that containment [[partial order|partially orders]] the spheres. Relaxing the requirement that all individuals be spheres yields a formalization of [[mereology]] far easier to exposit than [[Lesniewski]]'s variant. Near the end of his life, Tarski wrote a very long letter, published as Tarski and Givant (1999), summarizing his work on geometry.\n\n''Cardinal Algebras'' studied algebras whose models include the arithmetic of [[cardinal number]]s. ''Ordinal Algebras'' sets out an algebra for the additive theory of [[order type]]s. Cardinal, but not ordinal, addition commutes.\n\nIn 1941, Tarski published an important paper on [[binary relation]]s, which began the work on [[relation algebra]] and its [[metamathematics]] that occupied Tarski and his students for much of the balance of his life. While that exploration (and the closely related work of [[Roger Lyndon]]) uncovered some important limitations of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation algebra can express most [[axiomatic set theory]] and [[Peano arithmetic]]. For an introduction to [[relation algebra]], see Maddux (2006). In the late 1940s, Tarski and his students devised [[cylindric algebra]]s, which are to [[first-order logic]] what the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] is to classical [[sentential logic]]. This work culminated in the two monographs by Tarski, Henkin, and Monk (1971, 1985).\n\n==Logician==\nTarski's student, Vaught, has ranked Tarski as one of the four greatest logicians of all time &mdash; along with Aristotle, [[Gottlob Frege]], and Kurt G\u00f6del.<ref name=FFintro/><ref name=\"Vaught\">{{cite journal|last=Vaught|first=Robert L.|date=Dec 1986|title=Alfred Tarski's Work in Model Theory|journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]|volume=51|issue=4|pages=869\u2013882|doi=10.2307/2273900|jstor=2273900}}</ref><ref name=\"Restall\">{{cite web|url=http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/|title=Great Moments in Logic |last=Restall|first=Greg|date=2002\u20132006|accessdate=2009-01-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206052240/http://consequently.org/writing/logicians/| archivedate= 6 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> <!-- Of these four, he was by far the most prolific author. MORE THAN ARISTOTLE???  PROVIDE Reference! --> However, Tarski often expressed great admiration for [[Logic of relatives|Charles Sanders Peirce]], particularly for his pioneering work in the [[Finitary relation|logic of relations]].\n\nTarski produced axioms for ''logical consequence'', and worked on [[deductive system]]s, the algebra of logic, and the theory of definability. His semantic methods, which culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeley students developed in the 1950s and 60s, radically transformed Hilbert's proof-theoretic metamathematics.\n\n<blockquote>In [Tarski's] view, metamathematics became similar to any mathematical discipline. Not only can its concepts and results be mathematized, but they actually can be integrated into mathematics. ... Tarski destroyed the borderline between metamathematics and mathematics. He objected to restricting the role of metamathematics to the foundations of mathematics.<ref name=\"Sinaceur\">{{cite journal|last=Sinaceur|first=Hourya|title=Alfred Tarski: Semantic Shift, Heuristic Shift in Metamathematics|journal=Synthese|volume=126|issue=1\u20132|pages=49\u201365|issn=0039-7857|doi=10.1023/A:1005268531418|year=2001|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01119489}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTarski's 1936 article \"On the concept of logical consequence\" argued that the conclusion of an argument will follow logically from its premises if and only if every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion. In 1937, he published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies. His high school and undergraduate teaching on logic and axiomatics culminated in a classic short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally in a 1941 English translation as ''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences''.\n\nTarski's 1969 \"Truth and proof\" considered both [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] and [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]], and mulled over their consequences for the axiomatic method in mathematics.\n\n==Truth in formalized languages==\n{{main|Semantic theory of truth}}\nIn 1933, Tarski published a very long paper in Polish, titled \"Poj\u0119cie prawdy w j\u0119zykach nauk dedukcyjnych\",<ref>Alfred Tarski, \"POJ\u0118CIE PRAWDY W J\u0118ZYKACH NAUK DEDUKCYJNYCH\", Towarszystwo Naukowe Warszawskie, Warszawa, 1933.

An English translation appeared in the 1956 first edition of the volume ''Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics''. This collection of papers from 1923 to 1938 is an event in 20th-century [[analytic philosophy]], a contribution to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], [[semantics]], and the [[philosophy of language]]. For a brief discussion of its content, see [[Convention T]] (and also [[T-schema]]).\n\nSome recent philosophical debate examines the extent to which Tarski's theory of truth for formalized languages can be seen as a [[correspondence theory of truth]]. The debate centers on how to read Tarski's condition of material adequacy for a truth definition. That condition requires that the truth theory have the following as theorems for all sentences p of the language for which truth is being defined:\n\n: \"p\" is true [[if and only if]] p.\n\n(where p is the proposition expressed by \"p\")\n\nThe debate amounts to whether to read sentences of this form, such as\n\n<blockquote>\"Snow is white\" is true if and only if snow is white</blockquote>\n\nas expressing merely a [[deflationary theory of truth]] or as embodying [[truth]] as a more substantial property (see Kirkham 1992). It is important to realize that Tarski's theory of truth is for formalized languages, so  examples in natural language are not illustrations of the use of Tarski's theory of truth.\n\n==Logical consequence==\nIn 1936, Tarski published Polish and German versions of a lecture he had given the preceding year at the International Congress of Scientific Philosophy in Paris. <!-- (First appearance in English?) --> A new English translation of this paper, Tarski (2002), highlights the many differences between the German and Polish versions of the paper, and corrects a number of mistranslations in Tarski (1983).\n\nThis publication set out the modern [[model theory|model-theoretic]] definition of (semantic) logical consequence, or at least the basis for it. Whether Tarski's notion was entirely the modern one turns on whether he intended to admit models with varying domains (and in particular, models with domains of different [[cardinal number|cardinalities]]). This question is a matter of some debate in the current philosophical literature. [[John Etchemendy]] stimulated much of the recent discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.<ref>{{cite book|last=Etchemendy|first=John|title=The Concept of Logical Consequence|publisher=Stanford CA: CSLI Publications|year=1999|isbn=978-1-57586-194-4}}</ref>\n\nTarski ends by pointing out that his definition of logical consequence depends upon a division of terms into the logical and the extra-logical and he expresses some skepticism that any such objective division will be forthcoming. \"What are Logical Notions?\" can thus be viewed as continuing \"On the Concept of Logical Consequence\".\n\n==Work on logical notions==\nAnother theory of Tarski's attracting attention in the recent philosophical literature is that outlined in his \"What are Logical Notions?\" (Tarski 1986). This is the published version of a talk that he gave originally in 1966 in London and later in 1973 in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]; it was edited without his direct involvement by [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]]. It became the most cited paper in the journal ''History and Philosophy of Logic''.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/showMostCitedArticles?journalCode=thpl20#.UkH58D_-kQs | title=History and Philosophy of Logic}}</ref>\n\nIn the talk, Tarski proposed a demarcation of the logical operations (which he calls \"notions\") from the non-logical. The suggested criteria were derived from the [[Erlangen programme]] of the German 19th century Mathematician, [[Felix Klein]]. Mautner, in 1946, and possibly an article by the Portuguese mathematician Sebastiao e Silva, anticipated Tarski in applying the Erlangen Program to logic.\n\nThat program classified the various types of geometry ([[Euclidean geometry]], [[affine geometry]], [[topology]], etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that every point of the space is associated with or mapped to one other point of the space. So, \"rotate 30 degrees\" and  \"magnify by a factor of 2\" are intuitive descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.\n\nAs the range of permissible transformations becomes broader, the range of objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by the application of the transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a [[polygon]] from an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.\n\nTarski's proposal was to demarcate the logical notions by considering all possible one-to-one transformations ([[automorphism]]s) of a domain onto itself. By domain is meant the [[universe of discourse]] of a model for the semantic theory of a logic. If one identifies the [[truth value]] True with the domain set and the truth-value False with the empty set, then the following operations are counted as logical under the proposal:\n\n# ''[[Truth-function]]s'': All truth-functions are admitted by the proposal. This includes, but is not limited to, all ''n''-ary truth-functions for finite ''n''. (It also admits of truth-functions with any infinite number of places.)\n# ''Individuals'': No individuals, provided the domain has at least two members.\n# ''Predicates'':\n#* the one-place total and null predicates, the former having all members of the domain in its extension and the latter having no members of the domain in its extension\n#* two-place total and null predicates, the former having the set of all ordered pairs of domain members as its extension and the latter with the empty set as extension\n#* the two-place identity predicate, with the set of all order-pairs <''a'',''a''> in its extension, where ''a'' is a member of the domain\n#* the two-place diversity predicate, with the set of all order pairs <''a'',''b''> where ''a'' and ''b'' are distinct members of the domain\n#* ''n''-ary predicates in general: all predicates definable from the identity predicate together with [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[disjunction]] and [[negation]] (up to any ordinality, finite or infinite)\n# ''[[Quantifier (logic)|Quantifiers]]'': Tarski explicitly discusses only monadic quantifiers and points out that all such numerical quantifiers are admitted under his proposal. These include the standard universal and existential quantifiers as well as numerical quantifiers such as \"Exactly four\", \"Finitely many\", \"Uncountably many\", and \"Between four and 9 million\", for example. While Tarski does not enter into the issue, it is also clear that polyadic quantifiers are admitted under the proposal. These are quantifiers like, given two predicates ''Fx'' and ''Gy'', \"More(''x, y'')\", which says \"More things have ''F'' than have ''G''.\"\n# ''Set-Theoretic relations'': Relations such as [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[Union (set theory)|union]] applied to [[subset]]s of the domain are logical in the present sense.\n# ''Set membership'': Tarski ended his lecture with a discussion of whether the set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given the reduction of (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, the question of whether most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along the lines of [[type theory]], but is extralogical if set theory is set out axiomatically, as in the canonical [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]].\n# ''Logical notions of higher order'': While Tarski confined his discussion to operations of first-order logic, there is nothing about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic. (Tarski likely restricted his attention to first-order notions as the talk was given to a non-technical audience.) So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are admitted as well.\n\nIn some ways the present proposal is the obverse of that of Lindenbaum and Tarski (1936), who proved that all the logical operations of Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' are invariant under one-to-one transformations of the domain onto itself. The present proposal is also employed in Tarski and Givant (1987).\n\nSolomon Feferman and Vann McGee further discussed Tarski's proposal in work published after his death. Feferman (1999) raises problems for the proposal and suggests a cure: replacing Tarski's preservation by automorphisms with preservation by arbitrary [[homomorphism]]s. In essence, this suggestion circumvents the difficulty Tarski's proposal has in dealing with sameness of logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman's proposal results in a radical restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski's original proposal. In particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard first-order logic without identity.\n\nMcGee (1996) provides a precise account of what operations are logical in the sense of Tarski's proposal in terms of expressibility in a language that extends first-order logic by allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions and disjunctions, and quantification over arbitrarily many variables. \"Arbitrarily\" includes a countable infinity.\n\n==Works==\n;Anthologies and collections\n* 1986.

He later signed for Qatari side [[Al Sadd SC|Al-Sadd]] in 2007, where he played only six months before transferring on loan to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in England. However, after Birmingham's [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]], Z\u00e1rate was loaned out again, this time to [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] in Italy, where he won the [[Coppa Italia]]. His move to Lazio was then made permanent for a fee of around \u20ac20&nbsp;million, with a \u20ac60&nbsp;million<ref name=repubblica/> buy-out clause.

In January 2016, Z\u00e1rate joined Italian club [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]. A year later, he joined [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] of the English [[Premier League]] on a two-and-a-half-year, \u00a32.3&nbsp;million deal.\n\nAt international level, Z\u00e1rate scored the winning goal as the [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina under-20 team]] won the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] final.\n\n==Club career==\n===V\u00e9lez Sarsfield===\nZ\u00e1rate began his club football career at [[Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez Sarsfield|V\u00e9lez Sarsfield]] where he had played since childhood. At age 17, considered too strong for the youth category, he was promoted to the first team with which he made his full debut on 21 April 2004 against [[Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed]].

He later signed for Qatari side [[Al Sadd SC|Al-Sadd]] in 2007, where he played only six months before transferring on loan to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in England. However, after Birmingham's [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]], Z\u00e1rate was loaned out again, this time to [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] in Italy, where he won the [[Coppa Italia]]. His move to Lazio was then made permanent for a fee of around \u20ac20&nbsp;million, with a \u20ac60&nbsp;million<ref name=repubblica/> buy-out clause. After a loan at [[Inter Milan]] and a brief return to V\u00e9lez Sarsfield, he joined [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] in 2014, spending the second half of his first season on loan at [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. In January 2016, Z\u00e1rate joined Italian club [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]].

After moving to Los Angeles in 1981 Jay broke into the LA session scene and played local stages with former Yes guitarist [[Peter Banks]]' band and National arenas with Danny Johnson and The Bandits supporting [[ZZ Top]]. In 1982, Schellen was invited to join English pop band [[Badfinger]] joining Tommy Evans, Joey Molland, Glen Sherba and Yes keyboardist [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]].\n\nIn 1984, Schellen joined Stone Fury, working with singer [[Lenny Wolf]] and guitarist [[Bruce Gowdy]]. From 1985 to 1991, he joined the [[melodic rock]] group [[Hurricane (American band)|Hurricane]]. Hurricane went on to record three records, ''Take What You Want'', ''Over the Edge'' and ''Slave to the Thrill'', 3 worldwide tours and posted two top ten [[MTV]] videos. In 1993, Schellen joined Gowdy in a new [[melodic rock]] project, [[Unruly Child]], releasing a self-titled CD. Schellen again worked with Gowdy in 1995, joining [[World Trade (band)|World Trade]] for their second album ''Euphoria'', alongside [[Billy Sherwood]] (later in Yes). Schellen and Sherwood were the only members of World Trade for appearances on two tribute albums released on the [[Magna Carta]] record label in 1995.\n\nIn 1995\u20131997, Schellen formed Sircle of Silence with singer [[David Reece]] (ex-[[Accept (band)|Accept]], ex-[[Bangalore Choir]]), guitarist Larry Farkas (ex-[[Vengeance Rising]], ex-[[Die Happy (band)|Die Happy]]) and bass guitarist [[Greg Chaisson]] (ex-[[Badlands (American band)|Badlands]]). In 1997, Schellen published his well regarded drum method book Rocking Independence. In 1998, he played in ''Heaven and Earth'' with former Hurricane bandmate [[Kelly Hansen]] and guitarist [[Stuart Saunders Smith]]. 1998-1999 saw a second Unruly Child album with Gowdy and Hansen. In 1999, Schellen played on Sherwood's debut solo album ''The Big Peace'', while the next year he recorded for Sherwood's project with Yes bassist [[Chris Squire]], ''[[Conspiracy (band)|Conspiracy]]''. In 2003, Schellen re-joined Conspiracy, recording ''The Unknown'', followed by a live-in-the-studio DVD recorded in 2004 and released in 2006. Schellen has continued to work with Sherwood on a number of other projects including joining progressive group [[Circa (band)|Circa]] in 2008 (replacing [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]]), thus re-joining [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]] again on keyboards and [[Jimmy Haun]] on guitars. They released ''Circa HQ'' in January 2009. He also worked with [[Yoso]] in the band's initial stages, again working with Sherwood and Kaye. In 2010 Jay joined Sherwood,  Jimmy Haun and Kaye again to perform \"Headsets\" in collaboration with legendary Rock and Roll DJ  [[Jim Ladd]] staged at the [[Laserium]] in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn 2004, Schellen with Sherwood worked on pre-production for [[Asia (band)|Asia]]'s album ''Silent Nation'' with [[Geoff Downes]] (another former Yes keyboardist). In August 2005, Schellen replaced [[Chris Slade]] as the drummer in [[Asia (band)|Asia]]. The group toured Europe extensively and released a live recording, however, in 2006, Downes left the line up for a reunion of the original founding members Asia quartet: Schellen and the other two Asia band members, singer [[John Payne (singer)|John Payne]] and guitarist [[Guthrie Govan]], formed a new band, [[GPS (band)|GPS]]. GPS released their debut CD ''Window to the Soul''. In 2008, [[Asia Featuring John Payne]] was formed with Payne, Govan, keyboardist [[Erik Norlander]], and Schellen on drums. An album was released under the new name of Dukes of the Orient. Unruly Child has also reunited.\n\nFrom September 2013, he was performing in the Las Vegas production of ''[[Raiding the Rock Vault]]'', initially alongside his Asia bandmate John Payne.\n\nIn 2016, Schellen temporarily replaced Yes drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] on their 2016 North American tour while White recovered from back surgery and continued to play with them alongside White through White's recovery until February 2017. For the February 2018 Cruise to the Edge shows, Schellen once again performed as second guest drummer to support White, who has been battling a bacterial infection in his joints since November 2017.\n\nSchellen plays dw drums, Remo drumheads, and Zildjian cymbals and sticks.\n\n==Discography==\n*Hurricane - ''Take What You Want''\n*Hurricane - ''Over the Edge''\n*Hurricane - ''[[Slave to the Thrill]]''\n*[[Unruly Child]] - ''Unruly Child''\n*[[World Trade (band)|World Trade]] - ''Euphoria''\n*[[Billy Sherwood]] - ''The Big Peace'' (1999)\n*[[Chris Squire]] & Billy Sherwood - ''Conspiracy''\n*[[Conspiracy (band)|Conspiracy]] - ''The Unknown''\n*[[Yes (band)|Yes]] - ''[[Topographic Drama \u2013 Live Across America]]'' (2017)\n*[[Peter Banks]] - ''[[Be Well, Be Safe, Be Lucky...

It is situated in [[Alaca]], [[\u00c7orum Province]], [[Turkey]], northeast of [[Bo\u011fazkale]] (formerly and more familiarly [[Bo\u011fazk\u00f6y]]), where the ancient capital city [[Hattusa]] of the [[Hittite Empire]] was situated. Its Hittite name is unknown: connections with [[Arinna]], Tawiniya, and [[Zippalanda]] have all been suggested.<ref>Gorny, Ronald L. \"Zippalanda and Ankuwa: The Geography of Central Anatolia in the Second Millennium B.

It has been continuously occupied ever since, until today's modern settlement in the form of a small village. The standing and distinguishing remains at Alacah\u00f6y\u00fck, however, such as the \"Sphinx Gate\", date from the [[Hittites|Hittite]] period that followed the Hatti, from the fourteenth century BC.\n\n[[FIle:Royal tomb, Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck 02.jpg|thumb|A royal tomb in Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck]]\n\nThirteen [[shaft grave|shaft-grave]] \"Royal Tombs\" (EBII, c. 2350\u20132150 BC) in Alacah\u00f6y\u00fck contained the dead in [[fetal position]] facing south. They were richly adorned with gold [[fibula]]e, diadems, and belt buckles and repouss\u00e9 gold-leaf figures.\n\nAccording to [[Trevor Bryce]]:\n<blockquote>\n\u2033There is a theory that the occupants of the tombs were not from the native Hattian population of central Anatolia, but were [[Kurgan hypothesis|Kurgan]] immigrants from the region of [[Maikop kurgan|Maikop]] in southern Russia, who spoke an [[Indo-European language]] and perhaps became rulers of the local Hattian population.\u2033<ref>Trevor Bryce, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E1aF0hq1GR8C&pg=PA21 ''The Routledge Handbook of the Peoples and Places of Ancient Western Asia: The Near East from the Early Bronze Age to the Fall of the Persian Empire''.] Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1134159080}} p. 21</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, [[Hittitologist]] J.G. Macqueen suggested that these tombs, while constructed by an Indo-European people, were not constructed by [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]]-speakers, such as Hittites:\n<blockquote>\n\"[...] there is no sign of any spread of this ''kurgan'' culture further south in Anatolia, so it cannot be linked to the spread of Hittite, to say nothing of Palaic or Luwian. The language of the rulers who were buried in the Alaca tombs, although probably Indo-European, was almost certainly not Proto-Hittite.\"<ref>Macqueen, J. G. ''The Hittites, and Their Contemporaries in Asia Minor, revised and enlarged, Ancient Peoples and Places series'', Thames and Hudson, 1996 {{ISBN|0-500-02108-2}} p. 32</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMany of the [[Hittite Art|artefacts]] discovered at Alacah\u00f6y\u00fck, including magnificent Hattian gold and bronze objects found in the Royal Tombs, are housed today in the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in [[Ankara]]. Among these artefacts are gold and [[electrum]] standing cups and other vessels. The most unusual are the [[Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck bronze standards]]; [[Bull (mythology)|bulls]] or [[Deer (mythology)|stags]] on pedestals whose purpose remains the subject of debate. The standards are cast in copper, many in the form of flat circles, half-circles or squares that are filled with an [[openwork]] network of cross bars, central crosses, and swastikas. [[Leonard Woolley]]<ref>Woolley 1961</ref> found that the Royal Tombs \"seem to belong to the end of a period, as marked by a stratum of destruction and the burning of the citadel. The culture which the tomb objects illustrate does not continue into the next historical phase, that of [[K\u00fcltepe]]\". Modern assessment<ref>Trevor Bryce, ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'' rev. ed., Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-928132-7}}</ref> finds that the site continued as a flourishing community to the end of the Late Bronze Age. There was also a sizable occupation in [[Phrygia]]n times.\n\n====Dams====\n\nA [[dam]], dating from 1240 BC, was announced to be reopened for use on September 23, 2006. The dam was ordered by King [[Tudhaliya IV]] in the name of the goddess [[Hebat]]. According to ancient Hittite tablets, a drought struck Anatolia in 1200 BC, prompting the King to import wheat from Egypt so that his land would avoid famine. Following this, the king ordered numerous dams to be built in central Anatolia, all but one of them becoming non-functional over time.

It is situated in [[Alaca]], [[\u00c7orum Province]], [[Turkey]], northeast of [[Bo\u011fazkale]] (formerly and more familiarly [[Bo\u011fazk\u00f6y]]), where the ancient capital city [[Hattusa]] of the [[Hittite Empire]] was situated. Its Hittite name is unknown: connections with [[Arinna]], Tawiniya, and [[Zippalanda]] have all been suggested.<ref>Gorny, Ronald L. \"Zippalanda and Ankuwa: The Geography of Central Anatolia in the Second Millennium B.

It has been continuously occupied ever since, until today's modern settlement in the form of a small village. The standing and distinguishing remains at Alacah\u00f6y\u00fck, however, such as the \"Sphinx Gate\", date from the [[Hittites|Hittite]] period that followed the Hatti, from the fourteenth century BC.\n\n[[FIle:Royal tomb, Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck 02.jpg|thumb|A royal tomb in Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck]]\n\nThirteen [[shaft grave|shaft-grave]] \"Royal Tombs\" (EBII, c. 2350\u20132150 BC) in Alacah\u00f6y\u00fck contained the dead in [[fetal position]] facing south. They were richly adorned with gold [[fibula]]e, diadems, and belt buckles and repouss\u00e9 gold-leaf figures.\n\nAccording to [[Trevor Bryce]]:\n<blockquote>\n\u2033There is a theory that the occupants of the tombs were not from the native Hattian population of central Anatolia, but were [[Kurgan hypothesis|Kurgan]] immigrants from the region of [[Maikop kurgan|Maikop]] in southern Russia, who spoke an [[Indo-European language]] and perhaps became rulers of the local Hattian population.\u2033<ref>Trevor Bryce, [https://books.google.com/books?id=E1aF0hq1GR8C&pg=PA21 ''The Routledge Handbook of the Peoples and Places of Ancient Western Asia: The Near East from the Early Bronze Age to the Fall of the Persian Empire''.] Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1134159080}} p. 21</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nHowever, [[Hittitologist]] J.G. Macqueen suggested that these tombs, while constructed by an Indo-European people, were not constructed by [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]]-speakers, such as Hittites:\n<blockquote>\n\"[...] there is no sign of any spread of this ''kurgan'' culture further south in Anatolia, so it cannot be linked to the spread of Hittite, to say nothing of Palaic or Luwian. The language of the rulers who were buried in the Alaca tombs, although probably Indo-European, was almost certainly not Proto-Hittite.\"<ref>Macqueen, J. G. ''The Hittites, and Their Contemporaries in Asia Minor, revised and enlarged, Ancient Peoples and Places series'', Thames and Hudson, 1996 {{ISBN|0-500-02108-2}} p. 32</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nMany of the [[Hittite Art|artefacts]] discovered at Alacah\u00f6y\u00fck, including magnificent Hattian gold and bronze objects found in the Royal Tombs, are housed today in the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]] in [[Ankara]]. Among these artefacts are gold and [[electrum]] standing cups and other vessels. The most unusual are the [[Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck bronze standards]]; [[Bull (mythology)|bulls]] or [[Deer (mythology)|stags]] on pedestals whose purpose remains the subject of debate. The standards are cast in copper, many in the form of flat circles, half-circles or squares that are filled with an [[openwork]] network of cross bars, central crosses, and swastikas. [[Leonard Woolley]]<ref>Woolley 1961</ref> found that the Royal Tombs \"seem to belong to the end of a period, as marked by a stratum of destruction and the burning of the citadel. The culture which the tomb objects illustrate does not continue into the next historical phase, that of [[K\u00fcltepe]]\". Modern assessment<ref>Trevor Bryce, ''The Kingdom of the Hittites'' rev. ed., Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-928132-7}}</ref> finds that the site continued as a flourishing community to the end of the Late Bronze Age. There was also a sizable occupation in [[Phrygia]]n times.\n\n====Dams====\n\nA [[dam]], dating from 1240 BC, was announced to be reopened for use on September 23, 2006. The dam was ordered by King [[Tudhaliya IV]] in the name of the goddess [[Hebat]]. According to ancient Hittite tablets, a drought struck Anatolia in 1200 BC, prompting the King to import wheat from Egypt so that his land would avoid famine. Following this, the king ordered numerous dams to be built in central Anatolia, all but one of them becoming non-functional over time.

There is no book saying 'the Fact of Evolution' \u2013 All the books say ''Theory of Evolution''.\" He further added, \"There is not a single statement in the Qur'an, which Science has proved wrong yet. Hypothesis go against the Qur'an \u2013 theories go against the Qur'an. There is not a single scientific fact, which is mentioned in the Holy Qur'an which goes against established science \u2013 It may go against theory.\"<ref name=\"hp10\" />\n\n===Criticism of media===\nNaik has called the [[mass media|media]] \"the most important tool rather the most dangerous weapon in the world, which converts black into white and a villain into a hero\". He suggested that, \"We should use the same media to remove the misconceptions, misquotations, misinterpretations, and misrepresentations about Islam.\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/> He claimed, [[western power]]s and [[western media|media]] play a double-standard strategy, who describe Muslims as [[extremist]]s and [[fundamentalist]]s to defame Islam.<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/><ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> He said, \"The maximum damage done to the image of Islam today is by the international media which is bombarding misconceptions about it day and night using an array of strategies. International media, be it print, audio, video, or online, use a number of strategies to malign Islam by first picking up the black sheep of the Muslim community, and portraying them as though they are exemplary Muslims.\" Naik also claimed the \"third and fourth\" strategy by international media is \"to pick a word from [[Quran]] or [[sunnah]] and mistranslate it\" and \"to malign Islam by saying something that does not belong to it\".<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nNaik also said, \"If a Muslim woman wears [[hijab]] or veil it is labeled as women subjugation, but if a [[nun]] does to the same it turns into a sign of respect and modesty. A 50-year-old Muslim marrying a 16-year-old girl (willingly) is a headline, but a 50-year-old non-Muslim raping a six-year-old girl appears as brief news or filler. They say Islam does not give [[Women's rights|rights to women]], and is an illogical [[religion]]. They portray Islam as the problem of humanity though it is the solution to all man's problems. The same applies to the misinterpreted words 'fundamentalist' and 'extremist' which are basically western words.<ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> A true Muslim must be an extremist in the correct direction, by being extremely kind, loving, tolerant, honest and just. While [[Indian people|Indians]] were [[Indian independence movement|fighting for their freedom]], the [[British government]] was labelling them as terrorists; same activity, same people, but two different labels. The same happened with Muslims who are labelled as terrorists in media, so we should look into backgrounds and reasons for an activity before labelling people.\" <ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nHe criticizes the portrayal of Muslims in films saying, \"Hundreds of movies were made in [[Hollywood]] to malign the image of Islam that a non-Muslim gets scared when he heard a Muslim saying '[[Allah Akbar]]', thinking that he is going to kill him. If anyone really wants to know how good Islam is, he or she has to study its authentic sources; the glorious [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] rather than looking to its followers ([[Muslim]]s) as is the case with a motorist whose reckless driving should be blamed for an accident rather than the latest [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes car]] he was driving. The best exemplary Muslim is the last and final messenger prophet [[Muhammad]], peace be upon him.\" He also criticized media for \"pick(ing) up Muslims who criticised Islam like [[Salman Rushdie]], and giv(ing) them awards\", saying, \"If a Muslim does something great, they may give him credit but ignore his religion or change his Muslim name like the Aristotle of the East, [[Avicenna]], whose real name was \"Ali Ibn Sina\".\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\n=== Other religions ===\n\n====Apostasy====\nNaik believes that Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|convert from Islam]] should not necessarily receive death sentences, but that under Islamic law those who leave Islam<ref name=\"hp10\" /> and then \"propagate the non-Islamic faith and speak against Islam\" should be put to death.<ref name=\"apostat4\">\n[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 \"Maldivian renounces Islam, gets attacked by Zakir Naik audience\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827113937/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 |date=27 August 2013}} May 2010.

These comments sparked outrage across Malaysian society, being criticised as inciting racial and religious hatred and disrupting the peace and harmony between communities. By 15 August, four government ministers called for revocation of Zakir Naik's permanent residency and for him to be extradited to India.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/outrage-malaysia-zakir-naik-suggests-chinese-expulsion-190814230715236.html |title=Outrage in Malaysia as Zakir Naik suggests Chinese expulsion |author=Amy Chew |work=Aljazeera |date=15 August 2019 |accessdate=19 August 2019 }}</ref> Citizens lodged a total of 115 police complaints against Naik.<ref name=\"Soo Wern Jun\"/>\n\nOn 16 August, Naik was questioned for about seven hours by the [[Royal Malaysia Police]] at Bukit Aman in Kuala Lumpur about his controversial statements, while PM Mahathir said that \"If he is found to be doing detrimental things to the country, it will be necessary for us to take away his permanent resident status.

He suggested that, \"We should use the same media to remove the misconceptions, misquotations, misinterpretations, and misrepresentations about Islam.\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/> He claimed, [[western power]]s and [[western media|media]] play a double-standard strategy, who describe Muslims as [[extremist]]s and [[fundamentalist]]s to defame Islam.<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/><ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> He said, \"The maximum damage done to the image of Islam today is by the international media which is bombarding misconceptions about it day and night using an array of strategies. International media, be it print, audio, video, or online, use a number of strategies to malign Islam by first picking up the black sheep of the Muslim community, and portraying them as though they are exemplary Muslims.\" Naik also claimed the \"third and fourth\" strategy by international media is \"to pick a word from [[Quran]] or [[sunnah]] and mistranslate it\" and \"to malign Islam by saying something that does not belong to it\".<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nNaik also said, \"If a Muslim woman wears [[hijab]] or veil it is labeled as women subjugation, but if a [[nun]] does to the same it turns into a sign of respect and modesty. A 50-year-old Muslim marrying a 16-year-old girl (willingly) is a headline, but a 50-year-old non-Muslim raping a six-year-old girl appears as brief news or filler. They say Islam does not give [[Women's rights|rights to women]], and is an illogical [[religion]]. They portray Islam as the problem of humanity though it is the solution to all man's problems. The same applies to the misinterpreted words 'fundamentalist' and 'extremist' which are basically western words.<ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> A true Muslim must be an extremist in the correct direction, by being extremely kind, loving, tolerant, honest and just. While [[Indian people|Indians]] were [[Indian independence movement|fighting for their freedom]], the [[British government]] was labelling them as terrorists; same activity, same people, but two different labels. The same happened with Muslims who are labelled as terrorists in media, so we should look into backgrounds and reasons for an activity before labelling people.\" <ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nHe criticizes the portrayal of Muslims in films saying, \"Hundreds of movies were made in [[Hollywood]] to malign the image of Islam that a non-Muslim gets scared when he heard a Muslim saying '[[Allah Akbar]]', thinking that he is going to kill him. If anyone really wants to know how good Islam is, he or she has to study its authentic sources; the glorious [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] rather than looking to its followers ([[Muslim]]s) as is the case with a motorist whose reckless driving should be blamed for an accident rather than the latest [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes car]] he was driving. The best exemplary Muslim is the last and final messenger prophet [[Muhammad]], peace be upon him.\" He also criticized media for \"pick(ing) up Muslims who criticised Islam like [[Salman Rushdie]], and giv(ing) them awards\", saying, \"If a Muslim does something great, they may give him credit but ignore his religion or change his Muslim name like the Aristotle of the East, [[Avicenna]], whose real name was \"Ali Ibn Sina\".\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\n=== Other religions ===\n\n====Apostasy====\nNaik believes that Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|convert from Islam]] should not necessarily receive death sentences, but that under Islamic law those who leave Islam<ref name=\"hp10\" /> and then \"propagate the non-Islamic faith and speak against Islam\" should be put to death.<ref name=\"apostat4\">\n[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 \"Maldivian renounces Islam, gets attacked by Zakir Naik audience\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827113937/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 |date=27 August 2013}} May 2010.

Lagos was the third president from the center-left [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy]] to have ruled Chile since 1990. He was succeeded on March 11, 2006 by Socialist [[Michelle Bachelet]], from the same coalition. Since May 2007 he has served as a [[Special Envoy on Climate Change]] for the [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].<ref name=UN07b>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.un.org/climatechange/2007highlevel/envoys.shtml\n|title=UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Appoints Special Envoys on Climate Change\n|publisher=[[United Nations]]\n|year=2007\n|accessdate=2007-08-03\n}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Early years==\nLagos was born in [[Santiago, Chile]]. He was the only child of Froil\u00e1n Lagos Sep\u00falveda (a farmer who died when his son was eight years old) and Emma Escobar Morales (who died in 2005). He attended primary school at Liceo Experimental Manuel de Salas and high school at the prestigious [[Instituto Nacional]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/chile/president-lagos.htm|title=Ricardo Froil\u00e1n Lagos Escobar|last=Pike|first=John|access-date=2017-12-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, Lagos married [[Carmen Weber]], with whom he had two children, Ricardo and Ximena. In 1969, he met [[Luisa Dur\u00e1n]] and they married in 1971. The couple shared the parenting of the children of Lagos' first marriage, the children of Dur\u00e1n's first marriage, Hern\u00e1n and Alejandro, and their only child together, Francisca.\n\nWhile in university Ricardo Lagos attended the lectures of historian [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]] whom he held in high esteem.<ref>{{cite book |last=G\u00f3ngora |first=\u00c1lvaro |last2=de la Taille |first2=Alexandrine|last3=Vial |first3=Gonzalo |author-link3=Gonzalo Vial Correa |date= |title=Jaime Eyzaguirre en su tiempo |url= |language=Spanish |location= |publisher=Zig-Zag |pages=173\u2013174 |isbn=}}</ref>\n\n==Academic and diplomatic career==\nAfter obtaining his law degree from the [[University of Chile]] in 1960, Lagos pursued a Ph.D. in Economics from [[Duke University]], which he completed in 1966. During that time he became a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the political science department until 1965. After his time in North Carolina, he kept ties with both universities. On his return to Chile, he was employed at the Institute of Economy of the University of Chile, directed by Carlos Massad. In 1967, he was named Director of the School of Political and Administrative Sciences, a position he held until 1973, when he became Secretary General of the University of Chile. Lagos subsequently began work as a professor of economics in the School of Law of the University, and between 1971 and 1972 he was Director of the Institute of Economy. He was later named Director of the Latin American Council of Social Sciences.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Lagos declared  himself an \"independent of the [[Left-wing politics|left]]\" and abandoned the Radical Party of Chile, which he had joined in 1961, when this party supported [[Jorge Alessandri]]'s government. Although he did not possess great diplomatic experience, he worked with Hern\u00e1n Santa Cruz as an ambassador to the [[United Nations]], where he presented an outstanding speech on the international financial crisis. During the speech, he strongly criticized the decision of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] on the nonconvertibility of the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] into [[gold]], a measurement that would end in the rounding up the Asian crisis. In 1972, President [[Salvador Allende]] appointed Lagos as the Chilean Ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Moscow]], but the appointment was never ratified by [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ricardo-Lagos|title=Ricardo Lagos {{!}} president of Chile|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}</ref> As a Regional Director of the training program of post graduate studies in social sciences, he was later put in charge of Project [[UNESCO]], of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) in [[Buenos Aires]]. As a public servant he also served Chile as a United Nations delegate with rank of ambassador at the 26th [[United Nations General Assembly]]. In addition, he was a delegate to the UN's 3rd Conference of Commerce and Development ([[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]]).\n\nSoon after the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup d'\u00e9tat]], he and his family were sent into exile in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], where he took the position of Secretary General of the [[Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences]] (FLACSO). He moved for a year to the United States, where he became visiting professor of the William R. Kenan chair for Latin American Studies at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. In 1975, he worked as a consultant for the  United Nations Development Programme.\n\nLagos returned to Chile in 1978, and worked for the Regional Program of Employment of the United Nations, PREALC. During the implementation of policies imposed by the [[International Monetary Fund]] his mission was to advise all the governments in the South American continent on the matter of employment.\n\n==Political career==\nDuring the 1980s, Lagos assumed a fundamental role in the fight for the recovery of democracy. In addition to being one of the leaders of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]], he became President of the Democratic Alliance, a force that grouped the majority of the democratic parties opposing the dictatorship of General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. In 1983, he decided to leave his position as international civil employee in the United Nations. In December of that year, he became president of the Democratic Alliance. In 1987, as the president of the Committee of the Left for Free Elections, he called on all citizens and parties to enroll  in the electoral registries to vote \"no\" in a 1988 national plebiscite on whether Pinochet should be allowed to remain president of Chile.\n\nLagos became the undisputed leader of Pinochet's opponents after appearing in [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]]'s first political debate show since the 1973 coup d'\u00e9tat, ''De cara al pa\u00eds'' (towards the country), where he stated; \"With the triumph of \"[[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|No]]\", the country will prevent General Pinochet from being 25 years in power, it will mark the start of the end of the dictatorship.\" Lagos then looked directly into the camera and accusingly raised his index finger to say directly to all viewers: {{quote|''General Pinochet has not been honest with the country... So I will remind you, General Pinochet, that on the day of the [[1980 Chilean constitutional referendum|1980 plebiscite]] you said that \"President Pinochet would not be a candidate in 1989\". ... And now, you promise the country another eight years, with [[Chile under Pinochet#Human rights violations|tortures, murders, and human rights violations]]. It seems to me inadmissible, that a Chilean can have so much hunger for power, to aim to stay 25 years in power! Never before has a Chilean done so. And you asked me to answer either Yes or No, and that's what I did. Please excuse me, [[Raquel Correa|Raquel]], but I'm speaking after being silent for 15 years already!''|Ricardo Lagos}}\n\nTo this day, in Chile the phrase \"Lagos' finger\" refers to this memorable event; on that night, many people were convinced that the man would not survive to see the next day.\n\nAfter the triumph of the ''No'' alternative and the subsequent resignation of Pinochet, Lagos declined to be a candidate for the presidency in spite of being the main leader of the opposition. Instead, he supported [[Patricio Aylwin]]'s candidacy and ran for a seat in the Senate for the Santiago-West district. On December 11, 1989, the day of the elections, he obtained the district's second majority. Nevertheless, he did not win a seat because his alliance's list did not double the vote of the second most voted list; this being a requisite in the Chilean electoral system created by Pinochet.\n\nIn 1990, Lagos was named Minister of Education by President Patricio Aylwin. In this position, he initiated reform aimed at increasing equality in access and improving education levels. In June 1993, he pushed for the notion of using primary elections in order to select the [[Concertaci\u00f3n]] coalition's candidate for the following presidential election. He lost this primary to [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], who went on to become President of Chile. In 1994, Frei himself named Lagos Minister of Public Works. In this role, he developed an innovating system of road concessions, integrated the private sector in the construction of works and its later operation. During the Frei administration, he continued to be a leader of opinion and was a sure option for the following presidential election. His status was later ratified by his appointment as one of the members of the ''Committee of Twelve Distinguished Members'' of the [[Socialist International]], which he shared with such personalities as [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] and [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]]. This committee was set up to process proposals for the renovation of the [[social democracy|social democratic]] thought for the 21st century.\n\nIn 1999, Lagos resigned as minister in order to begin his presidential campaign. In the primaries, he defeated senator [[Andr\u00e9s Zald\u00edvar]], of the [[Christian Democratic Party]] to become the Concertaci\u00f3n's sole presidential candidate. In the first round of the presidential election in December of the same year, he defeated right-wing candidate [[Joaqu\u00edn Lav\u00edn]], by only 30,000 votes. Since he failed to obtain an absolute majority, as is required to be elected President, a presidential runoff was subsequently held in January 2000 for the first time ever in Chile. Winning 51.3 percent of the vote, Lagos became the new President of Chile.\n\n==Presidency==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Ricardo Lagos.jpg|thumb|left|Ricardo Lagos in a campaign photograph]] -->\n\n===Internal issues===\nDuring the first year of his term in office, Lagos had to confront a high level of unemployment, generated by the political instability of the region, in a process that began to revert during the end of 2003 . He also promised to keep the budget deficit in check and interest rates and inflation low.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/18/world/man-ricardo-lagos-escobar-chilean-socialist-clinton-blair-mold.html|title=Ricardo Lagos Escobar \u2013 A Chilean Socialist in the Clinton-Blair Mold|last=Krauss|first=Clifford|date=2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Lagos enjoyed great popular support, bordering on 55%, and ending around 60-70% during the last six months of his term. The policy of proximity with people was pronounced in the opening of the doors of the [[Palacio de La Moneda]], that had remained closed since the 1973 coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\nBeginning in 2002, his government had to face suspicions of political corruption due to the prosecution of one of his ministers, Carlos Cruz, and of other civil employees of the Public Works Ministry, in the denominated MOP-GATE case. [[Gloria Ana Chevesich]], the judge in charge of this case, discovered that ministers, undersecretaries and other officials of exclusive confidence of the President, received additional payments to their regular remuneration: the so-called \"extra payments\". This irregularity was acknowledged by Lagos, who specified that the practice had also developed during the governments of Frei Ruiz-Tagle and Aylwin. The official position of the government consisted of not acknowledging the criminal nature of these practices and establishing a legal reform that increased the pay of ministers and undersecretaries of the government, a matter that was approved in its legislative proceeding.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n[[File:Ricardo lagos with bush.jpg|thumb|290px|Ricardo Lagos with former [[United States|US]] president [[George W. Bush]]]]\n\nDuring 2004, Lagos faced a series of tensions in his relation with other South American countries, caused by recurring Bolivian aspirations for [[Atacama border dispute|access to the sea]]. This situation was linked with the power crisis taking place in [[Argentina]], an important supplier of natural gas to Chile. In bilateral meetings between Bolivian President [[Carlos Mesa]] and Argentine President [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]], the former agreed to the sale of Bolivian gas to Argentina under the condition that \"not a single gas molecule be sold to Chile\". Additionally, the [[Venezuela]]n President, [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], has supported in various instances the Bolivian sea claim, causing a diplomatic impass\u00e9 between Chile and Venezuela. The tension between both governments had dissipated during July 2004.\n\n===Legacy===\nDuring Lagos' presidency, Free Trade Agreements were signed with the [[European Community]], the [[United States]], [[South Korea]], the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]] (though some of his supporters in the center-left [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy]] consider that these agreements may have negative effects on the country); the incidence of extreme poverty was significantly reduced;<ref>South America, Central America and the Caribbean 2002</ref> the legal workweek was reduced from 48 to 45 hours;<ref>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2010/twerp_925.pdf</ref> improvements were made in infrastructure and transport; an unemployment insurance scheme was created; as well as the AUGE health program guaranteeing coverage for a number of medical conditions; the ''Chile Barrio'' housing program; the ''Chile Solidario'' program;<ref>Attacking inequality in the health sector: a synthesis of evidence and tool by Abdo Yazbeck</ref> compulsory schooling was extended to 12 years; the first divorce law in Chile was approved;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/ricardo-lagos-41058|title=Ricardo Lagos|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-19}}</ref> monetary compensation to victims of torture under the Pinochet regime identified in the [[Valech Report]] was authorized; and, recently, a recast [[Constitution of Chile|constitution]] was signed.

His appointment was and still is very controversial among Chilean environmental groups who questioned his track record on the matter, claiming that he 'showed an utter lack of consideration for the environment, promoted policies against environmental sustainability and favored the interests of big economic groups, even defending crimes against nature internationally', favouring large corporations every single time there was a clash between local communities, environmental concerns and perceived economic benefits.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.radiomundoreal.fm/rmr/?q=en/node/22661\n |title       = Environmentalist Organizations Reject Ricardo Lagos' Appointment as UN Special Envoy for Climate Change\n |publisher   = Real World Radio\n |date        = 2007-05-24\n |accessdate  = 2007-08-04\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013929/http://www.radiomundoreal.fm/rmr/?q=en%2Fnode%2F22661\n |archivedate = 2007-09-27\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://diario.elmercurio.com/2007/05/07/nacional/nacional/noticias/2A2A33CF-D72A-47E1-A5AD-10246196DFE7.htm?id=%7b2A2A33CF-D72A-47E1-A5AD-10246196DFE7%7dje\n |title=La carta que busca frenar a Lagos ante la ONU\n|publisher=[[El Mercurio]] via the [[Internet Archive]]\n|date=2007-05-07\n|accessdate=2007-08-04\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070518095630/http://diario.elmercurio.com/2007/05/07/nacional/nacional/noticias/2A2A33CF-D72A-47E1-A5AD-10246196DFE7.htm?id=%7b2A2A33CF-D72A-47E1-A5AD-10246196DFE7%7dje |archivedate = 2007-05-18}}</ref>\n\nOn January 14, 2017, Lagos accepted the Party for Democracy's nomination to run for president in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ricardo Lagos, ex-Chile president, runs to lead country again|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-politics-lagos-idUSKBN14Y0T0?il=0|accessdate=15 January 2017|work=Reuters|date=14 January 2017}}</ref> However, he withdrew soon after the Party for Democracy, publicly backed  Alejandro Guillier.

He was the only child of Froil\u00e1n Lagos Sep\u00falveda (a farmer who died when his son was eight years old) and Emma Escobar Morales (who died in 2005). He attended primary school at Liceo Experimental Manuel de Salas and high school at the prestigious [[Instituto Nacional]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/chile/president-lagos.htm|title=Ricardo Froil\u00e1n Lagos Escobar|last=Pike|first=John|access-date=2017-12-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, Lagos married [[Carmen Weber]], with whom he had two children, Ricardo and Ximena.

The couple shared the parenting of the children of Lagos' first marriage, the children of Dur\u00e1n's first marriage, Hern\u00e1n and Alejandro, and their only child together, Francisca.\n\nWhile in university Ricardo Lagos attended the lectures of historian [[Jaime Eyzaguirre]] whom he held in high esteem.<ref>{{cite book |last=G\u00f3ngora |first=\u00c1lvaro |last2=de la Taille |first2=Alexandrine|last3=Vial |first3=Gonzalo |author-link3=Gonzalo Vial Correa |date= |title=Jaime Eyzaguirre en su tiempo |url= |language=Spanish |location= |publisher=Zig-Zag |pages=173\u2013174 |isbn=}}</ref>\n\n==Academic and diplomatic career==\nAfter obtaining his law degree from the [[University of Chile]] in 1960, Lagos pursued a Ph.D. in Economics from [[Duke University]], which he completed in 1966. During that time he became a visiting professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the political science department until 1965. After his time in North Carolina, he kept ties with both universities. On his return to Chile, he was employed at the Institute of Economy of the University of Chile, directed by Carlos Massad. In 1967, he was named Director of the School of Political and Administrative Sciences, a position he held until 1973, when he became Secretary General of the University of Chile. Lagos subsequently began work as a professor of economics in the School of Law of the University, and between 1971 and 1972 he was Director of the Institute of Economy. He was later named Director of the Latin American Council of Social Sciences.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Lagos declared  himself an \"independent of the [[Left-wing politics|left]]\" and abandoned the Radical Party of Chile, which he had joined in 1961, when this party supported [[Jorge Alessandri]]'s government. Although he did not possess great diplomatic experience, he worked with Hern\u00e1n Santa Cruz as an ambassador to the [[United Nations]], where he presented an outstanding speech on the international financial crisis. During the speech, he strongly criticized the decision of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]] on the nonconvertibility of the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] into [[gold]], a measurement that would end in the rounding up the Asian crisis. In 1972, President [[Salvador Allende]] appointed Lagos as the Chilean Ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Moscow]], but the appointment was never ratified by [[National Congress of Chile|Congress]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ricardo-Lagos|title=Ricardo Lagos {{!}} president of Chile|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}</ref> As a Regional Director of the training program of post graduate studies in social sciences, he was later put in charge of Project [[UNESCO]], of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) in [[Buenos Aires]]. As a public servant he also served Chile as a United Nations delegate with rank of ambassador at the 26th [[United Nations General Assembly]]. In addition, he was a delegate to the UN's 3rd Conference of Commerce and Development ([[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]]).\n\nSoon after the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup d'\u00e9tat]], he and his family were sent into exile in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], where he took the position of Secretary General of the [[Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences]] (FLACSO). He moved for a year to the United States, where he became visiting professor of the William R. Kenan chair for Latin American Studies at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. In 1975, he worked as a consultant for the  United Nations Development Programme.\n\nLagos returned to Chile in 1978, and worked for the Regional Program of Employment of the United Nations, PREALC. During the implementation of policies imposed by the [[International Monetary Fund]] his mission was to advise all the governments in the South American continent on the matter of employment.\n\n==Political career==\nDuring the 1980s, Lagos assumed a fundamental role in the fight for the recovery of democracy. In addition to being one of the leaders of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]], he became President of the Democratic Alliance, a force that grouped the majority of the democratic parties opposing the dictatorship of General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. In 1983, he decided to leave his position as international civil employee in the United Nations. In December of that year, he became president of the Democratic Alliance. In 1987, as the president of the Committee of the Left for Free Elections, he called on all citizens and parties to enroll  in the electoral registries to vote \"no\" in a 1988 national plebiscite on whether Pinochet should be allowed to remain president of Chile.\n\nLagos became the undisputed leader of Pinochet's opponents after appearing in [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]]'s first political debate show since the 1973 coup d'\u00e9tat, ''De cara al pa\u00eds'' (towards the country), where he stated; \"With the triumph of \"[[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|No]]\", the country will prevent General Pinochet from being 25 years in power, it will mark the start of the end of the dictatorship.\" Lagos then looked directly into the camera and accusingly raised his index finger to say directly to all viewers: {{quote|''General Pinochet has not been honest with the country... So I will remind you, General Pinochet, that on the day of the [[1980 Chilean constitutional referendum|1980 plebiscite]] you said that \"President Pinochet would not be a candidate in 1989\". ... And now, you promise the country another eight years, with [[Chile under Pinochet#Human rights violations|tortures, murders, and human rights violations]]. It seems to me inadmissible, that a Chilean can have so much hunger for power, to aim to stay 25 years in power! Never before has a Chilean done so. And you asked me to answer either Yes or No, and that's what I did. Please excuse me, [[Raquel Correa|Raquel]], but I'm speaking after being silent for 15 years already!''|Ricardo Lagos}}\n\nTo this day, in Chile the phrase \"Lagos' finger\" refers to this memorable event; on that night, many people were convinced that the man would not survive to see the next day.\n\nAfter the triumph of the ''No'' alternative and the subsequent resignation of Pinochet, Lagos declined to be a candidate for the presidency in spite of being the main leader of the opposition. Instead, he supported [[Patricio Aylwin]]'s candidacy and ran for a seat in the Senate for the Santiago-West district. On December 11, 1989, the day of the elections, he obtained the district's second majority. Nevertheless, he did not win a seat because his alliance's list did not double the vote of the second most voted list; this being a requisite in the Chilean electoral system created by Pinochet.\n\nIn 1990, Lagos was named Minister of Education by President Patricio Aylwin. In this position, he initiated reform aimed at increasing equality in access and improving education levels. In June 1993, he pushed for the notion of using primary elections in order to select the [[Concertaci\u00f3n]] coalition's candidate for the following presidential election. He lost this primary to [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], who went on to become President of Chile. In 1994, Frei himself named Lagos Minister of Public Works. In this role, he developed an innovating system of road concessions, integrated the private sector in the construction of works and its later operation. During the Frei administration, he continued to be a leader of opinion and was a sure option for the following presidential election. His status was later ratified by his appointment as one of the members of the ''Committee of Twelve Distinguished Members'' of the [[Socialist International]], which he shared with such personalities as [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] and [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]]. This committee was set up to process proposals for the renovation of the [[social democracy|social democratic]] thought for the 21st century.\n\nIn 1999, Lagos resigned as minister in order to begin his presidential campaign. In the primaries, he defeated senator [[Andr\u00e9s Zald\u00edvar]], of the [[Christian Democratic Party]] to become the Concertaci\u00f3n's sole presidential candidate. In the first round of the presidential election in December of the same year, he defeated right-wing candidate [[Joaqu\u00edn Lav\u00edn]], by only 30,000 votes. Since he failed to obtain an absolute majority, as is required to be elected President, a presidential runoff was subsequently held in January 2000 for the first time ever in Chile. Winning 51.3 percent of the vote, Lagos became the new President of Chile.\n\n==Presidency==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Ricardo Lagos.jpg|thumb|left|Ricardo Lagos in a campaign photograph]] -->\n\n===Internal issues===\nDuring the first year of his term in office, Lagos had to confront a high level of unemployment, generated by the political instability of the region, in a process that began to revert during the end of 2003 . He also promised to keep the budget deficit in check and interest rates and inflation low.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/18/world/man-ricardo-lagos-escobar-chilean-socialist-clinton-blair-mold.html|title=Ricardo Lagos Escobar \u2013 A Chilean Socialist in the Clinton-Blair Mold|last=Krauss|first=Clifford|date=2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Lagos enjoyed great popular support, bordering on 55%, and ending around 60-70% during the last six months of his term. The policy of proximity with people was pronounced in the opening of the doors of the [[Palacio de La Moneda]], that had remained closed since the 1973 coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\nBeginning in 2002, his government had to face suspicions of political corruption due to the prosecution of one of his ministers, Carlos Cruz, and of other civil employees of the Public Works Ministry, in the denominated MOP-GATE case. [[Gloria Ana Chevesich]], the judge in charge of this case, discovered that ministers, undersecretaries and other officials of exclusive confidence of the President, received additional payments to their regular remuneration: the so-called \"extra payments\". This irregularity was acknowledged by Lagos, who specified that the practice had also developed during the governments of Frei Ruiz-Tagle and Aylwin. The official position of the government consisted of not acknowledging the criminal nature of these practices and establishing a legal reform that increased the pay of ministers and undersecretaries of the government, a matter that was approved in its legislative proceeding.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n[[File:Ricardo lagos with bush.jpg|thumb|290px|Ricardo Lagos with former [[United States|US]] president [[George W. Bush]]]]\n\nDuring 2004, Lagos faced a series of tensions in his relation with other South American countries, caused by recurring Bolivian aspirations for [[Atacama border dispute|access to the sea]]. This situation was linked with the power crisis taking place in [[Argentina]], an important supplier of natural gas to Chile. In bilateral meetings between Bolivian President [[Carlos Mesa]] and Argentine President [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]], the former agreed to the sale of Bolivian gas to Argentina under the condition that \"not a single gas molecule be sold to Chile\". Additionally, the [[Venezuela]]n President, [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]], has supported in various instances the Bolivian sea claim, causing a diplomatic impass\u00e9 between Chile and Venezuela. The tension between both governments had dissipated during July 2004.\n\n===Legacy===\nDuring Lagos' presidency, Free Trade Agreements were signed with the [[European Community]], the [[United States]], [[South Korea]], the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]] (though some of his supporters in the center-left [[Coalition of Parties for Democracy]] consider that these agreements may have negative effects on the country); the incidence of extreme poverty was significantly reduced;<ref>South America, Central America and the Caribbean 2002</ref> the legal workweek was reduced from 48 to 45 hours;<ref>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/workingpapers/2010/twerp_925.pdf</ref> improvements were made in infrastructure and transport; an unemployment insurance scheme was created; as well as the AUGE health program guaranteeing coverage for a number of medical conditions; the ''Chile Barrio'' housing program; the ''Chile Solidario'' program;<ref>Attacking inequality in the health sector: a synthesis of evidence and tool by Abdo Yazbeck</ref> compulsory schooling was extended to 12 years; the first divorce law in Chile was approved;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/ricardo-lagos-41058|title=Ricardo Lagos|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-19}}</ref> monetary compensation to victims of torture under the Pinochet regime identified in the [[Valech Report]] was authorized; and, recently, a recast [[Constitution of Chile|constitution]] was signed.

He also assumed co-chairmanship of the [[Inter-American Dialogue]]'s Board of Directors.\n\nOn May 2, 2007, Lagos, along with [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] and [[Han Seung-soo]], was named by [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] as a [[Special Envoy on Climate Change]]. His appointment was and still is very controversial among Chilean environmental groups who questioned his track record on the matter, claiming that he 'showed an utter lack of consideration for the environment, promoted policies against environmental sustainability and favored the interests of big economic groups, even defending crimes against nature internationally', favouring large corporations every single time there was a clash between local communities, environmental concerns and perceived economic benefits.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.radiomundoreal.fm/rmr/?q=en/node/22661\n |title       = Environmentalist Organizations Reject Ricardo Lagos' Appointment as UN Special Envoy for Climate Change\n |publisher   = Real World Radio\n |date        = 2007-05-24\n |accessdate  = 2007-08-04\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013929/http://www.radiomundoreal.fm/rmr/?q=en%2Fnode%2F22661\n |archivedate = 2007-09-27\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://diario.elmercurio.com/2007/05/07/nacional/nacional/noticias/2A2A33CF-D72A-47E1-A5AD-10246196DFE7.htm?id=%7b2A2A33CF-D72A-47E1-A5AD-10246196DFE7%7dje\n |title=La carta que busca frenar a Lagos ante la ONU\n|publisher=[[El Mercurio]] via the [[Internet Archive]]\n|date=2007-05-07\n|accessdate=2007-08-04\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070518095630/http://diario.elmercurio.com/2007/05/07/nacional/nacional/noticias/2A2A33CF-D72A-47E1-A5AD-10246196DFE7.htm?id=%7b2A2A33CF-D72A-47E1-A5AD-10246196DFE7%7dje |archivedate = 2007-05-18}}</ref>\n\nOn January 14, 2017, Lagos accepted the Party for Democracy's nomination to run for president in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ricardo Lagos, ex-Chile president, runs to lead country again|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chile-politics-lagos-idUSKBN14Y0T0?il=0|accessdate=15 January 2017|work=Reuters|date=14 January 2017}}</ref> However, he withdrew soon after the Party for Democracy, publicly backed  Alejandro Guillier.

However, the archa is not supposed to be planted near the home, because it is believed gradually to sap the energy from human beings living close-by.\n\n==Geography==\nThe park covers about 200 square kilometers, and its altitude ranges from about 1,500 meters at the entrance to a maximum of 4,895 meters at [[Peak Semenova Tian-Shanski]], the highest peak in the Kyrgyz Ala-tau range of the Tian Shan. There are more than 20 small and large [[glacier]]s and some 50 mountain peaks within the park.\n\nTwo smaller rivers, the Adygene and the Ak-Sai, originate from these glaciers' melting waters. The Adygene gorge is a wooded valley with waterfalls, springs and abundant [[trout]].\n\nThe park includes the gorge of the [[Ala-Archa River]] and the mountains surrounding it.\n\n==Biosphere==\nA small reservoir on the Kargay-Bulak river was built to study the Amu Darya trout.  Other wildlife includes the very rare [[snow leopard]] (in Kyrgyz: \"ilbirs\") on the alpine meadows and snowfields above 2,500 m elevation, wild goats, roe deer and [[marmot]]s.\n\nThe snow leopard has been photographed by the park's camera for the first time in May 2017.<ref>[https://akipress.com/news:592155/ Camera traps in Ala-Archa national park record snow leopard for first time], ''Akipress.com'', 6 May 2017</ref>\n\nMany plants can be found in the park, including the [[Crocus alatavicus]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Hayes |title=KYRGYZSTAN |url=http://www.kewguild.org.uk/media/pdfs/v15s113p257-57.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=kewguild.org.uk |accessdate=11 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019021947/http://www.kewguild.org.uk/media/pdfs/v15s113p257-57.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Kyrgyzstan Ala Archa National Park 01.jpg|Ala Archa River\nImage:Kyrgyzstan Ala Archa National Park 03.jpg|Ala Archa National Park\nImage:Kyrgyzstan Ala Archa National Park 05.jpg|A boulder field at Ala Archa National Park\nImage:Ala Archa 2.JPG|At Ala Archa National Park\nImage:Ala Archa 3.JPG|At Ala Archa National Park\nImage:Ala Archa 5.JPG|At Ala Archa National Park\nImage:Ala Archa 8.JPG|At Ala Archa National Park\n</gallery>\n\n==Tourism==\nThe park is a destination point for weekend [[picnic]]kers, [[Hiking|hikers]], horse trekkers, [[Skiing|skiers]] as well as [[Mountaineering|mountain climbers]] looking for ice, rock and mixed routes. The park is open year round, although the most popular season is late summer and early fall. Every May 1, hundreds of people camp out in the valley and climb [[Mount Komsomolets]] for the Alpinada festival.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThere is a nominal fee for entering the park. Past the gate, the road continues 12&nbsp;km to a small collection of buildings, including one newly renovated lodge. At the end of the road, up a trail to the left (East), lies the Ak-Sai Glacier, where remains of a Soviet climbing base indicate the high quality [[mountaineering]] within the park.

However, the archa is not supposed to be planted near the home, because it is believed gradually to sap the energy from human beings living close-by.\n\n==Geography==\nThe park covers about 200 square kilometers, and its altitude ranges from about 1,500 meters at the entrance to a maximum of 4,895 meters at [[Peak Semenova Tian-Shanski]], the highest peak in the Kyrgyz Ala-tau range of the Tian Shan. There are more than 20 small and large [[glacier]]s and some 50 mountain peaks within the park.\n\nTwo smaller rivers, the Adygene and the Ak-Sai, originate from these glaciers' melting waters. The Adygene gorge is a wooded valley with waterfalls, springs and abundant [[trout]].\n\nThe park includes the gorge of the [[Ala-Archa River]] and the mountains surrounding it.\n\n==Biosphere==\nA small reservoir on the Kargay-Bulak river was built to study the Amu Darya trout.  Other wildlife includes the very rare [[Snow leopard|snow leopard]] (in Kyrgyz: \"ilbirs\") on the alpine meadows and snowfields above 2,500 m elevation, wild goats, roe deer and [[marmot]]s.\n\nThe snow leopard has been photographed by the park's camera for the first time in May 2017.<ref>[https://akipress.com/news:592155/ Camera traps in Ala-Archa national park record snow leopard for first time], ''Akipress.com'', 6 May 2017</ref>\n\nMany plants can be found in the park, including the [[Crocus alatavicus]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Patrick |last=Hayes |title=KYRGYZSTAN |url=http://www.kewguild.org.uk/media/pdfs/v15s113p257-57.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=kewguild.org.uk |accessdate=11 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019021947/http://www.kewguild.org.uk/media/pdfs/v15s113p257-57.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Kyrgyzstan Ala Archa National Park 01.jpg|Ala Archa River\nImage:Kyrgyzstan Ala Archa National Park 03.jpg|Ala Archa National Park\nImage:Kyrgyzstan Ala Archa National Park 05.jpg|A boulder field at Ala Archa National Park\nImage:Ala Archa 2.JPG|At Ala Archa National Park\nImage:Ala Archa 3.JPG|At Ala Archa National Park\nImage:Ala Archa 5.JPG|At Ala Archa National Park\nImage:Ala Archa 8.JPG|At Ala Archa National Park\n</gallery>\n\n==Tourism==\nThe park is a destination point for weekend [[picnic]]kers, [[Hiking|hikers]], horse trekkers, [[Skiing|skiers]] as well as [[Mountaineering|mountain climbers]] looking for ice, rock and mixed routes. The park is open year round, although the most popular season is late summer and early fall. Every May 1, hundreds of people camp out in the valley and climb [[Mount Komsomolets]] for the Alpinada festival.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nThere is a nominal fee for entering the park. Past the gate, the road continues 12&nbsp;km to a small collection of buildings, including one newly renovated lodge. At the end of the road, up a trail to the left (East), lies the Ak-Sai Glacier, where remains of a Soviet climbing base indicate the high quality [[mountaineering]] within the park. The region's most famous peaks rise from the Ak-Sai glacier, including [[Korona peak|Korona]] (4860m) and Free Korea (4740m).
