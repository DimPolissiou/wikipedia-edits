He played music for much of his life but received little recognition before the early 1990s. In the latter half of that decade, Burnside recorded and toured with [[Jon Spencer]], garnering [[Crossover music|crossover]] appeal and introducing his music to a new fan base in the [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[garage rock]] scenes.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1926&ndash;1959: Early years===\nBurnside was born in 1926<ref name=\"amg\">{{cite web |url= {{AllMusic| class=artist| id=p33736| pure_url=yes}} |title=R.L.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[fantasy (genre)|fantasy]] world [[Middle-earth]] who closely resemble [[tree]]s. They are similar to the [[talking tree]]s in folklore around the world. Their name is derived from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] word for [[giant]].\n\nThe Ents appear in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as ancient shepherds of the forest and allies of the free peoples of Middle-earth during the [[War of the Ring]]. The Ent who figures most prominently in the book is [[Treebeard]], who (credibly) claims to be the oldest creature in Middle-earth. At the time ''The Lord of the Rings'' takes place, there are no young Ents (Entings) because the Entwives (female Ents) were lost. The Ents are akin to '''Huorns''', whom Treebeard describes as a transitional form of trees which become animated or, conversely, as Ents who grow more \"treelike\" over time.<ref name=\"Huorn1\" group=T>{{ME-ref|ttt|\"Flotsam and Jetsam\", p. 551, \"Treebeard\", p.457}}</ref>\n\nInspired by Tolkien and similar traditions, animated or [[anthropomorphic]] tree creatures appear in a variety of media and works of fantasy.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"Ent\" was taken from the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ([[Old English]]) word ''[[wikt:ent|ent]]'' or ''eoten'', meaning \"giant\".

Whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, was difficult to say. At any rate the arms, at a short distance from the trunk, were not wrinkled, but covered with a brown smooth skin. The large feet had seven toes each. The lower part of the long face was covered with a sweeping grey beard, bushy, almost twiggy at the roots, thin and mossy at the ends. But at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes. These deep eyes were now surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating.<ref name=\"TTT book 3 ch 4\" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 3, chapter 4: \"Treebeard\".</ref>}}\n\nEnts are an old race that appeared in [[Middle-earth]] when the [[dwarves (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] did. They were apparently created by [[Eru Il\u00favatar]] at the behest of [[Yavanna]]: when she learned of [[Aul\u00eb]]'s children, the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], she foresaw that they would fell trees, and desired creatures to serve as Shepherds of the Trees to protect the forests from Dwarves and other perils. Although the Ents were sentient beings from the time of their awakening, they did not know how to speak until the Elves taught them. Treebeard said that the Elves \"cured us of dumbness\", that it was a great gift that could not be forgotten. (\"They always wished to talk to everything, the old Elves did.\")<ref name=\"TTT book 3 ch 4\" group=T/> In the [[Third Age]] of Middle-earth, the forest of [[Fangorn]] was the only place known still to be inhabited by Ents, although the Ent-like Huorns may have survived elsewhere, as in the [[Old Forest]].\n\nEnts exhibit wide variation in personal traits (height, heft, colouring, even the number of digits), as they came to resemble somewhat the specific types of trees that they shepherded. [[Bregalad|Quickbeam]], for example, guarded [[Sorbus aucuparia|rowan]] trees and bore some resemblance to rowans: tall and slender, smooth-skinned, with ruddy lips and grey-green hair. Some ents, such as Treebeard, were like\n\n{{quote|[[European beech|beech]]-trees or [[English oak|oaks]]. But there were other kinds. Some recalled the [[Castanea sativa|chestnut]]: brown-skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs.

Their skin is extraordinarily tough, and very much like wood; they can erode stone extremely rapidly, in the manner of tree roots, but they are vulnerable to fire and chopping blows from axes. Ents are also an extremely patient and cautious race, with a sense of time more suited to trees than short-lived mortals. For example, in the Entmoot regarding the attack on Isengard, their three-day deliberation was considered by some to be \"hasty\".\n\nEnts are tall and very strong, capable of tearing apart rock and stone (though they use their full strength only when they are \"roused\"). Tolkien describes them as tossing great slabs of stone about, and ripping down the walls of Isengard \"like bread-crust\".<ref name=\"TTT book 3 ch 9\" group=T>''The Two Towers'', book 3, chapter 9: \"Flotsam and Jetsam\".</ref> [[Treebeard]] boasted of their strength to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]; he said that Ents were much more powerful than [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Trolls]], which [[Morgoth]] made in the [[First Age]] in mockery of Ents.\n\nThe book further lays out the power of Ents; their bark-like skin and flesh make them difficult to harm even with axes, and a single punch from an Ent can kill; although they do hurl stones, they otherwise do not use weapons.\n\nThe [[Sindarin]] word for Ent is ''Onod'' (plural ''Enyd'').

She replied, \"They will delve in the earth, and the things that grow and live upon the earth they will not heed. Many a tree shall feel the bite of their iron without pity.\"<ref name=silm2 group=T>''The Silmarillion'', chapter 2: \"Of Aul\u00eb and Yavanna\"</ref> She went to [[Manw\u00eb]] and appealed to him to protect the trees, and they realized that Ents, too, were part of the [[Ainulindal\u00eb|Song of Creation]]. Yavanna then warned Aul\u00eb, \"Now let thy children beware! For there shall walk a power in the forests whose wrath they will arouse at their peril.\"<ref name=silm2 group=T/> The Ents are called \"the Shepherds of the Trees\". [[Treebeard]] tells of a time when much of [[Eriador]] was forested and part of his domain, but these immense forests dwindled over time. Treebeard's statement is corroborated by [[Elrond]]: \"Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to [[Dunland]] west of Isengard.\"<ref name=\"FOTR book 2 ch 2\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2, chapter 2: \"The Council of Elrond\".</ref> Of this vast forest, according to Treebeard, Fangorn forest was \"just the East End\".<ref name = \"TTT book 3 ch 4\" group=T/>\n\nThere is only a single reference in ''The Silmarillion'' to the Onodrim in [[Beleriand]]. When [[Beren]] Erchamion and a force of [[Green Elves]] waylay the force of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] returning from the sack of [[Doriath]], the Dwarves are routed and scatter into the wood\u2014where the Shepherds of the Trees ensure that none escape.\n\n===Entwives===\nTreebeard says that the Entwives began to move farther away from the Ents because they liked to plant and control things, while the Ents preferred forests and liked to let things take their natural course. The Entwives moved away to the region that would later become the Brown Lands across the Great River [[Anduin]], although the male Ents still visited them. The Entwives, unlike the Ents, interacted with the race of [[Men (Middle-earth)|Men]] and taught them much about the art of agriculture.\n\nThe Entwives lived in peace until their gardens were destroyed by [[Sauron]], whereupon the Entwives themselves disappeared. The Ents looked for them but never found them. It was sung by the Elves (as the Ents were content simply to \"chant their beautiful names\")<ref name=\"TTT book 3 ch 4\" group=T/> that one day the Ents and Entwives would find each other. Indeed, in ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Treebeard implored the Hobbits not to forget to send word to him if they \"hear any news\" of the Entwives \"in your land\".<ref name=\"ROTK book 6 ch 6\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, chapter 6: \"Many Partings\".</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', [[Samwise Gamgee]] mentions his cousin Hal claims to have seen a treelike giant, which resembled an elm not only in size but also in actual appearance, in the north of the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]].<ref name=\"FOTR book 1 ch 2\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 1, chapter 2: \"The Shadow of the Past\".</ref> During the Fangorn episode, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] told Treebeard about the Shire. Treebeard said that the Entwives would have liked that land. This, combined with the giant-sighting by Sam's cousin Hal mentioned above, has led to some speculation by readers that the Entwives may have lived near the Shire. Tolkien himself spent much time considering what actually happened to the Entwives (at one point saying that even he did not know), but eventually he stated in ''Letters'' #144: \"I think that in fact the Entwives have disappeared for good, being destroyed with their gardens in the War of the Last Alliance...some may have fled east, or even have become enslaved...\"<ref name=\"Letters 144\" group=T>{{cite book |title=[[The Letters of J.

Tolkien |editor=Carpenter, Humphrey with Christopher Tolkien |year=1981 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin/Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-04-826005-3 }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the story after [[Aragorn]] is crowned king, he promised Treebeard that the Ents could prosper again and spread to new lands with the threat of [[Mordor]] gone, and renew their search for the Entwives.\nHowever, Treebeard lamented that forests may spread but the Ents would not, and he predicted that the few remaining Ents would remain in Fangorn forest until they slowly dwindled in number or became \"treeish\", saying: \"Sheep get like shepherds, and shepherds get like sheep. [...] But it is quicker and closer, with trees and Ents.\"<ref name=\"TTT book 3 ch 4\" group=T/>\n\n===Entings===\nAlthough never seen and only briefly mentioned, Entings are young Ents. There are almost no descriptions of Entings, but it can be presumed from descriptions of Quickbeam (a young and hasty Ent) and Treebeard's comments about younger Ents as being more \"bendy\" than older ones, that they are much like saplings and perhaps even seedlings at their youngest. It is not at all made clear if they are born similar to the trees they shepherd, or they become that way, or even how they are born at all.\n\nAccording to Treebeard there are no Entings upon Middle-earth at the time of the Third Age, and there have not been any for quite some time. And there will never be any more Entings afterwards either \"as there are no Entwives\".\n\n===Fate===\nWhile Ents are extremely long-lived, they are not immortal in the same sense as the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]]: they age with the passage of time, albeit very slowly. (At the ''Entmoot'', the hobbits notice, from their appearance, that the Ents vary in age. Also, when invited to sit down, Treebeard tells Merry and Pippin that he is not very 'bendable', while a much younger Ent, Quickbeam, could 'bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind'.) While they do not die of old age, older Ents often become 'treeish', settling down in one place and growing roots and leaves. Eventually, they may cease to be conscious and become trees entirely.\n\n===The Last March of the Ents===\n{{further|Isengard|Battle of Helm's Deep}}\n\nIn ''[[The Two Towers]]'', the second volume of Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the Ents \u2013 usually a very patient, deliberate people \u2013 become roused with their long simmering anger at [[Saruman]], whose armies are cutting down large numbers of their trees. They convene an '''Entmoot''', a meeting of the Ents of Fangorn forest at Derndingle.\n\nAfter lengthy deliberation (three days; though from the perspective of the Ents this was almost no time at all), they march on Saruman's fortress at [[Isengard]] - 'the last march of the Ents'. Led by Treebeard, the oldest Ent, and accompanied by the [[hobbit]]s [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]], the Ents numbered about 50, plus an army of Huorns. They destroy Isengard in an all-out assault, ripping down the wall around it, eventually becoming so enraged that the power of their voices alone causes great destruction (\"If the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] had risen in wrath and fallen on the hills with storm, it could have worked no greater ruin\"<ref name=\"TTT book 3 ch 8\" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 3, chapter 8: \"The Road to Isengard\".</ref>) and trap Saruman in the tower of [[Orthanc]]. \n\n[[File:Wandeling over het Hulshorsterzand-Hulshorsterheide 07-03-2020.

The main Ent character, and the first encountered by the readers and the hobbits, is [[Treebeard|Fangorn]] (Treebeard). The other ents are Beechbone, Bregalad, Fimbrethil, Finglas, and Fladrif. The Ents had all readily adopted Elvish [[Sindarin]] names, and Tolkien provides their English names as translations from the Sindarin.\n<div id=\"Fangorn\">\n\n* Fangorn: Also known as [[Treebeard]]. By the end of the [[Third Age]], he, Skinbark, and Leaflock were the last remaining of the first Ents who appeared in [[Middle-earth]] sometime in the [[First Age]], and as such, were among the oldest of creatures. In the long passage of time, the domain of the Ents was gradually reduced to [[Fangorn]] forest, named after Treebeard's [[Sindarin]] name.</div>\n<div id=\"Finglas\">\n* Finglas: Translated from the Elvish as Leaflock. By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Leaflock had become sleepy and treeish. He began to stand alone in a meadow and doze during the summer. At first, he would awake in wintertime, but eventually he remained in place year-round. He was covered in leafy hair. (It is not clear whether or not Tolkien derived the name from [[Finglas]] in Dublin, Ireland, or whether the name is merely coincidental.)</div>\n<div id=\"Fladrif\">\n* Fladrif: Translated from the Elvish as Skinbark. He lived on the mountain slopes west of [[Isengard]]. [[Saruman]]'s [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]] ravaged this area, cutting down trees and killing Ents. Skinbark himself was wounded by them. He retreated far up the mountain slopes to live among the [[birch]]es that he favoured and refused to come down. The 'f' at the end of ''Fladrif'' is pronounced \"as in English ''of''\".<ref group=T>J. R. R.

His injury, or possibly death, angered the rest of the Ents.</div>\n<div id=\"Bregalad\">\n* Bregalad: Also known as Quickbeam, Bregalad was a relatively young Ent at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], roughly \"middle aged\" and not nearly as old as [[Treebeard]] (though he was a full adult; there had been no Ent children since the disappearance of the Entwives). Bregalad guarded [[rowan]] trees, and he resembled a rowan himself. The word \"quickbeam\" is an English dialect word for the rowan tree. His [[Sindarin]] name (Bregalad) translates roughly as \"Quickbeam\" (from ''bragol'' \"sudden\" and ''galad'' \"light\"), although interestingly, there is a double meaning in his English name, as the word \"beam\" itself used to mean \"tree\" and still means a large building-timber, cognate with German ''Baum''. He received this name when he said \"yes\" before another Ent had finished asking a question; this showed that he was unusually \"hasty\" for his race. At the Entmoot, Bregalad lived up to his reputation for hastiness; he was the first to decide to attack [[Isengard]], since [[Saruman]]'s [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] had destroyed many of his rowan groves. Seeing that Bregalad's mind was already made up, Treebeard sent him to watch over and care for [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]], while the debate among the other Ents continued for days. He later played an important role in the attack on Isengard, nearly capturing Saruman himself.</div>\n<div id=\"Fimbrethil\">\n* Fimbrethil: [[Treebeard]]'s long-lost wife, also known as Wandlimb the lightfooted. The pair were beloved since before even [[Morgoth]] first arose in power during the youth of the world. Translated, her name meant according to the ''1966 Index'' 'slim-birch' (according to Appendix F 'slender-beech'). As with all of the other [[Ent#Entwives|Entwives]], Fimbrethil had been missing since Sauron's forces destroyed the gardens of the Entwives during the [[Second Age]]. At the time of the War of the Ring, Treebeard had not seen his beloved Fimbrethil for over three millennia.</div>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Treant.png|thumb|upright|A \"treant\" from ''[[World of Warcraft]]'']]\n\n===In music===\n[[The Fall of Troy (band)|The Fall of Troy]] has a song entitled \"The Last March of the Ents\" on their self-titled debut album released in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-fall-of-troy-mw0000322295|title=The Fall of Troy at AllMusic}}</ref>\n\n===Statue===\nPermission was granted for a [[statue]] of [[Treebeard]] by [[Tim Tolkien]], near his great-uncle J.

Their name is derived from the [[Anglo-Saxon]] word for [[giant]].\n\nThe Ents appear in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as ancient shepherds of the forest and allies of the free peoples of Middle-earth during the [[War of the Ring]]. The Ent who figures most prominently in the book is [[Treebeard]], who (credibly) claims to be the oldest creature in Middle-earth. At the time ''The Lord of the Rings'' takes place, there are no young Ents (Entings) because the Entwives (female Ents) were lost. The Ents are akin to '''Huorns''', whom Treebeard describes as a transitional form of trees which become animated or, conversely, as Ents who grow more \"treelike\" over time.<ref name=\"Huorn1\" group=T>{{ME-ref|ttt|\"Flotsam and Jetsam\", p. 551, \"Treebeard\", p.457}}</ref>\n\nInspired by Tolkien and similar traditions, animated or [[anthropomorphic]] tree creatures appear in a variety of media and works of fantasy.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"Ent\" was taken from the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ([[Old English]]) word ''[[wikt:ent|ent]]'' or ''eoten'', meaning \"giant\".

At any rate the arms, at a short distance from the trunk, were not wrinkled, but covered with a brown smooth skin. The large feet had seven toes each.

They were apparently created by [[Eru Il\u00favatar]] at the behest of [[Yavanna]]: when she learned of [[Aul\u00eb]]'s children, the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]], she foresaw that they would fell trees, and desired creatures to serve as Shepherds of the Trees to protect the forests from Dwarves and other perils. Although the Ents were sentient beings from the time of their awakening, they did not know how to speak until the Elves taught them. Treebeard said that the Elves \"cured us of dumbness\", that it was a great gift that could not be forgotten. (\"They always wished to talk to everything, the old Elves did.\")<ref name=\"TTT book 3 ch 4\" group=T/> In the [[Third Age]] of Middle-earth, the forest of [[Fangorn]] was the only place known still to be inhabited by Ents, although the Ent-like Huorns may have survived elsewhere, as in the [[Old Forest]].\n\nEnts exhibit wide variation in personal traits (height, heft, colouring, even the number of digits), as they came to resemble somewhat the specific types of trees that they shepherded. [[Bregalad|Quickbeam]], for example, guarded [[Sorbus aucuparia|rowan]] trees and bore some resemblance to rowans: tall and slender, smooth-skinned, with ruddy lips and grey-green hair. Some ents, such as Treebeard, were like\n\n{{quote|[[European beech|beech]]-trees or [[English oak|oaks]]. But there were other kinds.

Their skin is extraordinarily tough, and very much like wood; they can erode stone extremely rapidly, in the manner of tree roots, but they are vulnerable to fire and chopping blows from axes. Ents are also an extremely patient and cautious race, with a sense of time more suited to trees than short-lived mortals. For example, in the Entmoot regarding the attack on Isengard, their three-day deliberation was considered by some to be \"hasty\".\n\nEnts are tall and very strong, capable of tearing apart rock and stone (though they use their full strength only when they are \"roused\").

After the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] were put to sleep by [[Eru Il\u00favatar|Eru]] to await the coming of the Elves, [[Aul\u00eb]] told his wife [[Yavanna]], \"the lover of all things that grow in the earth,\"<ref group=T>''[[The Silmarillion]]'', [[Valaquenta]]</ref> of the Dwarves. She replied, \"They will delve in the earth, and the things that grow and live upon the earth they will not heed.  Many a tree shall feel the bite of their iron without pity.\"<ref name=silm2 group=T>''The Silmarillion'', chapter 2: \"Of Aul\u00eb and Yavanna\"</ref>  She went to [[Manw\u00eb]] and appealed to him to protect the trees, and they realized that Ents, too, were part of the [[Ainulindal\u00eb|Song of Creation]].  Yavanna then warned Aul\u00eb, \"Now let thy children beware! For there shall walk a power in the forests whose wrath they will arouse at their peril.\"<ref name=silm2 group=T/> The Ents are called \"the Shepherds of the Trees\". [[Treebeard]] tells of a time when much of [[Eriador]] was forested and part of his domain, but these immense forests dwindled over time. Treebeard's statement is corroborated by [[Elrond]]: \"Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to [[Dunland]] west of Isengard.\"<ref name=\"FOTR book 2 ch 2\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2, chapter 2: \"The Council of Elrond\".</ref> Of this vast forest, according to Treebeard, Fangorn forest was \"just the East End\".<ref name = \"TTT book 3 ch 4\" group=T/>\n\nThere is only a single reference in ''The Silmarillion'' to the Onodrim in [[Beleriand]]. When [[Beren]] Erchamion and a force of [[Green Elves]] waylay the force of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] returning from the sack of [[Doriath]], the Dwarves are routed and scatter into the wood\u2014where the Shepherds of the Trees ensure that none escape.\n\n===Entwives===\nTreebeard says that the Entwives began to move farther away from the Ents because they liked to plant and control things, while the Ents preferred forests and liked to let things take their natural course. The Entwives moved away to the region that would later become the Brown Lands across the Great River [[Anduin]], although the male Ents still visited them. The Entwives, unlike the Ents, interacted with the race of [[Men (Middle-earth)|Men]] and taught them much about the art of agriculture.\n\nThe Entwives lived in peace until their gardens were destroyed by [[Sauron]], whereupon the Entwives themselves disappeared. The Ents looked for them but never found them. It was sung by the Elves (as the Ents were content simply to \"chant their beautiful names\")<ref name=\"TTT book 3 ch 4\"  group=T/> that one day the Ents and Entwives would find each other. Indeed, in ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Treebeard implored the Hobbits not to forget to send word to him if they \"hear any news\" of the Entwives \"in your land\".<ref name=\"ROTK book 6 ch 6\" group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, chapter 6: \"Many Partings\".</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', [[Samwise Gamgee]] mentions his cousin Hal claims to have seen a treelike giant, which resembled an elm not only in size but also in actual appearance, in the north of the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]].<ref name=\"FOTR book 1 ch 2\" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 1, chapter 2: \"The Shadow of the Past\".</ref> During the Fangorn episode, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] told Treebeard about the Shire. Treebeard said that the Entwives would have liked that land. This, combined with the giant-sighting by Sam's cousin Hal mentioned above, has led to some speculation by readers that the Entwives may have lived near the Shire. Tolkien himself spent much time considering what actually happened to the Entwives (at one point saying that even he did not know), but eventually he stated in ''Letters'' #144: \"I think that in fact the Entwives have disappeared for good, being destroyed with their gardens in the War of the Last Alliance...some may have fled east, or even have become enslaved...\"<ref name=\"Letters 144\" group=T>{{cite book |title=[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]] |last=Tolkien |first=J. R. R. |authorlink=J. R. R. Tolkien |editor=Carpenter, Humphrey with Christopher Tolkien |year=1981 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin/Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-04-826005-3 }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the story after [[Aragorn]] is crowned king, he promised Treebeard that the Ents could prosper again and spread to new lands with the threat of [[Mordor]] gone, and renew their search for the Entwives.\nHowever, Treebeard lamented that forests may spread but the Ents would not, and he predicted that the few remaining Ents would remain in Fangorn forest until they slowly dwindled in number or became \"treeish\", saying: \"Sheep get like shepherds, and shepherds get like sheep. [...] But it is quicker and closer, with trees and Ents.\"<ref name=\"TTT book 3 ch 4\" group=T/>\n\n===Entings===\nAlthough never seen and only briefly mentioned, Entings are young Ents. There are almost no descriptions of Entings, but it can be presumed from descriptions of Quickbeam (a young and hasty Ent) and Treebeard's comments about younger Ents as being more \"bendy\" than older ones, that they are much like saplings and perhaps even seedlings at their youngest. It is not at all made clear if they are born similar to the trees they shepherd, or they become that way, or even how they are born at all.\n\nAccording to Treebeard there are no Entings upon Middle-earth at the time of the Third Age, and there have not been any for quite some time. And there will never be any more Entings afterwards either \"as there are no Entwives\".\n\n===Fate===\nWhile Ents are extremely long-lived, they are not immortal in the same sense as the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]]: they age with the passage of time, albeit very slowly. (At the ''Entmoot'', the hobbits notice, from their appearance, that the Ents vary in age. Also, when invited to sit down, Treebeard tells Merry and Pippin that he is not very 'bendable', while a much younger Ent, Quickbeam, could 'bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind'.) While they do not die of old age, older Ents often become 'treeish', settling down in one place and growing roots and leaves. Eventually, they may cease to be conscious and become trees entirely.\n\n===The Last March of the Ents===\n{{further|Isengard|Battle of Helm's Deep}}\n\nIn ''[[The Two Towers]]'', the second volume of Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the Ents \u2013 usually a very patient, deliberate people \u2013 become roused with their long simmering anger at [[Saruman]], whose armies are cutting down large numbers of their trees. They convene an '''Entmoot''', a meeting of the Ents of Fangorn forest at Derndingle.\n\nAfter lengthy deliberation (three days; though from the perspective of the Ents this was almost no time at all), they march on Saruman's fortress at [[Isengard]] - 'the last march of the Ents'. Led by Treebeard, the oldest Ent, and accompanied by the [[hobbit]]s [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]], the Ents numbered about 50, plus an army of Huorns. They destroy Isengard in an all-out assault, ripping down the wall around it, eventually becoming so enraged that the power of their voices alone causes great destruction (\"If the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] had risen in wrath and fallen on the hills with storm, it could have worked no greater ruin\"<ref name=\"TTT book 3 ch 8\" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 3, chapter 8: \"The Road to Isengard\".</ref>) and trap Saruman in the tower of [[Orthanc]]. \n\n[[File:Wandeling over het Hulshorsterzand-Hulshorsterheide 07-03-2020.

The main Ent character, and the first encountered by the readers and the hobbits, is [[Treebeard|Fangorn]] (Treebeard). The other ents are Beechbone, Bregalad, Fimbrethil, Finglas, and Fladrif. The Ents had all readily adopted Elvish [[Sindarin]] names, and Tolkien provides their English names as translations from the Sindarin.\n<div id=\"Fangorn\">\n\n* Fangorn: Also known as [[Treebeard]]. By the end of the [[Third Age]], he, Skinbark, and Leaflock were the last remaining of the first Ents who appeared in [[Middle-earth]] sometime in the [[First Age]], and as such, were among the oldest of creatures. In the long passage of time, the domain of the Ents was gradually reduced to [[Fangorn]] forest, named after Treebeard's [[Sindarin]] name.</div>\n<div id=\"Finglas\">\n* Finglas: Translated from the Elvish as Leaflock. By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], Leaflock had become sleepy and treeish. He began to stand alone in a meadow and doze during the summer. At first, he would awake in wintertime, but eventually he remained in place year-round. He was covered in leafy hair. (It is not clear whether or not Tolkien derived the name from [[Finglas]] in Dublin, Ireland, or whether the name is merely coincidental.)</div>\n<div id=\"Fladrif\">\n* Fladrif: Translated from the Elvish as Skinbark. He lived on the mountain slopes west of [[Isengard]]. [[Saruman]]'s [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]] ravaged this area, cutting down trees and killing Ents. Skinbark himself was wounded by them. He retreated far up the mountain slopes to live among the [[birch]]es that he favoured and refused to come down. The 'f' at the end of ''Fladrif'' is pronounced \"as in English ''of''\".<ref group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1955), ''[[The Return of the King]]'', 2nd edition (1966), George Allen & Unwin, appendix E(I) p. 391, entry for 'F'; {{ISBN|0 04 823047 2}}</ref></div>\n<div id=\"Beechbone\">\n* Beechbone: An Ent who was burned by Saruman's devices, though his ultimate fate is only implied. His injury, or possibly death, angered the rest of the Ents.</div>\n<div id=\"Bregalad\">\n* Bregalad: Also known as Quickbeam, Bregalad was a relatively young Ent at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], roughly \"middle aged\" and not nearly as old as [[Treebeard]] (though he was a full adult; there had been no Ent children since the disappearance of the Entwives). Bregalad guarded [[rowan]] trees, and he resembled a rowan himself. The word \"quickbeam\" is an English dialect word for the rowan tree. His [[Sindarin]] name (Bregalad) translates roughly as \"Quickbeam\" (from ''bragol'' \"sudden\" and ''galad'' \"light\"), although interestingly, there is a double meaning in his English name, as the word \"beam\" itself used to mean \"tree\" and still means a large building-timber, cognate with German ''Baum''. He received this name when he said \"yes\" before another Ent had finished asking a question; this showed that he was unusually \"hasty\" for his race. At the Entmoot, Bregalad lived up to his reputation for hastiness; he was the first to decide to attack [[Isengard]], since [[Saruman]]'s [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] had destroyed many of his rowan groves. Seeing that Bregalad's mind was already made up, Treebeard sent him to watch over and care for [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]], while the debate among the other Ents continued for days.  He later played an important role in the attack on Isengard, nearly capturing Saruman himself.</div>\n<div id=\"Fimbrethil\">\n* Fimbrethil: [[Treebeard]]'s long-lost wife, also known as Wandlimb the lightfooted. The pair were beloved since before even [[Morgoth]] first arose in power during the youth of the world. Translated, her name meant according to the ''1966 Index'' 'slim-birch' (according to Appendix F 'slender-beech'). As with all of the other [[Ent#Entwives|Entwives]], Fimbrethil had been missing since Sauron's forces destroyed the gardens of the Entwives during the [[Second Age]]. At the time of the War of the Ring, Treebeard had not seen his beloved Fimbrethil for over three millennia.</div>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Treant.png|thumb|upright|A \"treant\" from ''[[World of Warcraft]]'']]\n\n===In music===\n[[The Fall of Troy (band)|The Fall of Troy]] has a song entitled \"The Last March of the Ents\" on their self-titled debut album released in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-fall-of-troy-mw0000322295|title=The Fall of Troy at AllMusic}}</ref>\n\n===Statue===\nPermission was granted for a [[statue]] of [[Treebeard]] by [[Tim Tolkien]], near his great-uncle J.

The tour included dates in 14 countries and was widely documented in the media due to frontwoman [[Courtney Love]]'s raucous stage behavior throughout, which divided critics. \n\nInitially planned to begin in the early summer of 1994, the tour was postponed after the death of the band's bassist, [[Kristen Pfaff]], on June 16 that year. In August, the band hired Canadian bassist [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], and commenced the tour, with their first date being the 1994 [[Reading Festival]]. The tour was also highly anticipated as it marked Love's first public performance since the suicide of her husband, [[Kurt Cobain]], in April. During the first week of the band's North American dates, Hole opened for [[Nine Inch Nails]] (who were simultaneously on the [[Self Destruct Tour]]) before proceeding as a headlining act. Supporting acts included [[Madder Rose]] and [[Veruca Salt]].\n\nThe tour was subject of a series of legal troubles for Love as well, involving physical altercations between herself, crowd members, and other musicians. In addition to Love receiving [[death threat]]s at some performances, she was arrested twice during the tour, and pleaded guilty to punching [[Kathleen Hanna]] at a [[Lollapalooza]] date. She was also unsuccessfully sued by two male concertgoers who alleged she struck them during a performance in Florida in March 1995.\n\n==Overview==\nDays after the release of [[Hole (band)|Hole]]'s second album, ''[[Live Through This]]'', frontwoman [[Courtney Love]]'s husband, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]], committed suicide in their Seattle home.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kurt Cobain's Final Tour|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a19776/kurt-cobains-final-tour-0296/|date=February 1996|author=Dickinson, Amy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906185607/https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a19776/kurt-cobains-final-tour-0296/|archive-date=September 6, 2015}}</ref> The ''Live Through This'' Tour was slated to begin in the summer of 1994, but was temporarily halted after the death of the band's bassist, [[Kristen Pfaff]], of a [[heroin]] overdose.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=https://ew.com/article/1994/07/08/hole-bassist-kristen-pfaff-found-dead/|title=Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff found dead|author=Hajari, Nisid|date=July 8, 1994|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180929225935/https://ew.com/article/1994/07/08/hole-bassist-kristen-pfaff-found-dead/|archive-date=September 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Los Angeles, California|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/38011086/the_los_angeles_times/|title=Love and Hole Ready to Roll?|p=57|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\nOn August 19, 1994\u2014one week before the band's scheduled debut performance at the [[Reading Festival]]\u2014the group hired [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], a Canadian bassist from [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|location=Vancouver, British Columbia|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/38011302/the_vancouver_sun/|title=Montreal woman to join Love's band|date=August 19, 1994|p=36|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> The first week of the tour after the Reading Festival had Hole as a supporting act for [[Nine Inch Nails]] before they embarked as a headliner for the following concerts.<ref name=ward/> In 1995, the band made appearances at several [[Big Day Out]] festival dates, and went on to join [[Lollapalooza]] in North America, performing with the traveling festival throughout the summer of 1995 alongside [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Cypress Hill]].<ref name=considine/> \n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Courtney Love 1995 by Andrzej Liguz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Love performing with Hole at the 1995 [[Big Day Out]], Melbourne]]\nCritical response to the ''Live Through This'' Tour varied, with some local critics lambasting Love's performances.

The tour included dates in 14 countries and was widely documented in the media due to frontwoman [[Courtney Love]]'s raucous stage behavior throughout, which divided critics. \n\nInitially planned to begin in the early summer of 1994, the tour was postponed after the death of the band's bassist, [[Kristen Pfaff]], on June 16 that year. In August, the band hired Canadian bassist [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], and commenced the tour, with their first date being the 1994 [[Reading Festival]]. The tour was also highly anticipated as it marked Love's first public performance since the suicide of her husband, [[Kurt Cobain]], in April. During the first week of the band's North American dates, Hole opened for [[Nine Inch Nails]] (who were simultaneously on the [[Self Destruct Tour]]) before proceeding as a headlining act. Supporting acts included [[Madder Rose]] and [[Veruca Salt]].\n\nThe tour was subject of a series of legal troubles for Love as well, involving physical altercations between herself, crowd members, and other musicians. In addition to Love receiving [[death threat]]s at some performances, she was arrested twice during the tour, and pleaded guilty to punching [[Kathleen Hanna]] at a [[Lollapalooza]] date. She was also unsuccessfully sued by two male concertgoers who alleged she struck them during a performance in Florida in March 1995.\n\n==Overview==\nDays after the release of [[Hole (band)|Hole]]'s second album, ''[[Live Through This]]'', frontwoman [[Courtney Love]]'s husband, [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]], committed suicide in their Seattle home.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kurt Cobain's Final Tour|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a19776/kurt-cobains-final-tour-0296/|date=February 1996|author=Dickinson, Amy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906185607/https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a19776/kurt-cobains-final-tour-0296/|archive-date=September 6, 2015}}</ref> The ''Live Through This'' Tour was slated to begin in the summer of 1994, but was temporarily halted after the death of the band's bassist, [[Kristen Pfaff]], of a [[heroin]] overdose.<ref>{{cite web|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=https://ew.com/article/1994/07/08/hole-bassist-kristen-pfaff-found-dead/|title=Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff found dead|author=Hajari, Nisid|date=July 8, 1994|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180929225935/https://ew.com/article/1994/07/08/hole-bassist-kristen-pfaff-found-dead/|archive-date=September 29, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Los Angeles, California|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/38011086/the_los_angeles_times/|title=Love and Hole Ready to Roll?|p=57|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>\n\nOn August 19, 1994\u2014one week before the band's scheduled debut performance at the [[Reading Festival]]\u2014the group hired [[Melissa Auf der Maur]], a Canadian bassist from [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|location=Vancouver, British Columbia|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/38011302/the_vancouver_sun/|title=Montreal woman to join Love's band|date=August 19, 1994|p=36|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> The first week of the tour after the Reading Festival had Hole as a supporting act for [[Nine Inch Nails]] before they embarked as a headliner for the following concerts.<ref name=ward/> In 1995, the band made appearances at several [[Big Day Out]] festival dates, and went on to join [[Lollapalooza]] in North America, performing with the traveling festival throughout the summer of 1995 alongside [[Sonic Youth]] and [[Cypress Hill]].<ref name=considine/> \n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Courtney Love 1995 by Andrzej Liguz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Love performing with Hole at the 1995 [[Big Day Out]], Melbourne]]\nCritical response to the ''Live Through This'' Tour varied, with some local critics lambasting Love's performances.

It is also the [[sports governing body|governing body]] for the sport of [[Australian rules football]] in [[South Australia]].\n\nOriginally formed as the South Australian Football Association on 30 April 1877, the SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code in Australia and one of the [[Oldest football competitions|oldest football competitions in the world]], forming just a few years after the [[United Hospitals Challenge Cup]] (1874), the oldest [[rugby football]] competition, and over a decade before [[The Football League]], although later than the [[FA Cup]] (soccer).\n\nConsisting of a single division competition, since 2014 the season has been an 18-round \"home-and-away\" (regular) season from April to September. The top five teams play-off in a final series culminating in the grand final for the Thomas Seymour Hill Premiership Trophy.  The grand final had traditionally been held at [[Football Park]] in October, generally the week after the [[AFL Grand Final]], though this was altered ahead of the [[2014 SANFL season|2014 season]] resulting in [[Adelaide Oval]] hosting the grand final in the penultimate weekend of September.\n\nThe league owned the sub-licences for South Australia's two AFL clubs \u2013 [[Adelaide Football Club]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club]] until March 2014, when [[South Australian Football Commission]] reached an agreement with the Adelaide and Port Adelaide football clubs \u2013 endorsed by the AFL \u2013 which will see the two AFL licences transferred to the clubs in return for payments totalling more than $18&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.sanfl.com.au/news/sanfl_news/2415/ SA FOOTBALL COMMISSION AND AFL AGREE TO TRANSFER OF CROWS AND POWER LICENCES]</ref>\n\nThe league is also responsible for the management of all levels of football in the state. This includes junior football, country football, amateur football and specific programs rolled out across schools, indigenous communities (including the APY Lands in the state's north) and newly arrived migrant communities.\n\nThe SANFL owns [[Football Park]], formerly the largest stadium in South Australia. The stadium, which opened in 1974, was primarily used for [[Australian Football League]] matches up until 2013 and had a capacity of over 51,000 prior to being demolished. The stadium was the headquarters for the league from 1974\u20132013. The SANFL competition is the second highest attended Australian rules football league behind the AFL.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Before 1877 ===\n{{Further information|Australian rules football in South Australia}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n\n| image1 = Adelaide SAFA logo.jpg \n | width1 = 120\n | alt1 =  \n | caption1 = The original [[Adelaide Football Club (SAFA)|Adelaide F.C.]], formed in 1860, was the first in South Australia\n | image2 = Bucks_Flat,_Glanville_Hall_Estate.jpg\n | width2 = 170 \n | alt2 =  \n | caption2  = {{AFL Por}} played its early games at Glanville Hall Estate from 1870 to 1879\n | footer = \n}}\n\nThe first recorded game of any \"football\" in South Australia was that of 'Caid' played in Thebarton by people of the local Irish community in 1843 to celebrate St Patrick's Day.

Norwood, South Adelaide and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] together won 23 of the first 24 premierships. South Park, Willunga, North Adelaide, Prince Alfred College, Gawler, Kapunda, Bankers, Woodville, and Victorian all left the Association within the first 10 years.  By 1886, the Association had been reduced from 12 to four clubs.\n\nThe Association experienced a resurgence in the late 1880s and early 1890s.  The addition of North Adelaide (1893), West Adelaide and West Torrens (1897) and only the demise of Adelaide (1893), meant the Association comprised six clubs by the turn of the century.

In 1907, the Association changed its name to the South Australian Football League.\n\nNorwood and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] continued their domination of the league, and were joined by West Adelaide and North Adelaide; between them, the four clubs won all premierships between 1901 and 1913.  West Adelaide followed three straight wooden spoons from 1904\u201306 with four out of the five premierships from 1908\u20131912, the most successful period in West Adelaide's history.\n\nThe SANFL maintained competition for the first two years of World War I, 1914 and 1915, with Sturt winning their first premiership in 1915, but from 1916 the competition was suspended and did not resume until 1919.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1908_West_Adelaide_premiership_team.jpg|{{SANFL WestA}} won four SAFL premierships and two [[Championship of Australia|Championships of Australia]] between 1908 and 1912.\nFile:PortAdelaide1914.jpg|{{SANFL Por}} went through the [[1914 SAFL season]] undefeated. \nFile:PortAdelaideOval.JPG|{{AFL Por}} was [[Championship of Australia|Champion of Australia]] 3 times between 1910 and 1914.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1916\u20131945: Inter war years ===\nSturt won the first premiership of the post-World War I era, beating North Adelaide in the Challenge Final replay.  [[Glenelg Football Club|Glenelg]] became the newest addition to the league in 1921 and started poorly with five consecutive wooden spoons.  In 1927, the South Australian Football League was renamed the South Australian National Football League.  Port Adelaide won five premierships in the period 1919\u20131939, appearing in 12 grand finals.\n\nThe SANFL continued normal competition for the first few years of World War II, but from 1942 to 1944 operated on a reduced basis with clubs merged on a geographical basis \u2013 Port Adelaide / West Torrens, West Adelaide / Glenelg, Sturt / South Adelaide and Norwood / North Adelaide.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Norwood_vs_Port_Adelaide,_1929_SANFL_Grand_Final,_Adelaide_Oval.jpg|Pictured above is the [[1929 SANFL Grand Final]] between {{SANFL Por}} and {{SANFL Nor}} who by this time had well and truly become the leagues premier rivals. <br/>See [[Port Adelaide-Norwood SANFL rivalry]].\nFile:Ken Farmer SANFL.jpg|[[Ken Farmer]] kicked a record 1,417 goals.\nFile:Ian_McKay_Spectacular_Mark.jpg|[[Ian McKay (footballer)|Ian McKay]] leaps for a spectacular mark in the [[1952 SANFL Grand Final]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1946\u20131969: Port Adelaide and Sturt rivalry ===\nStraight after the War Sturt won their Second Premiership.

This record also matched Norwood's six in a row in 1883, set before the advent of regular Grand Finals.\n\n[[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] continued their dominance of the competition in the early 1960s with three more premierships by 1965.  In 1964 the SANFL admitted two new clubs, [[Central District Football Club|Central District]] and [[Woodville Football Club|Woodville]].  Both clubs performed poorly, and many questioned the purpose of introducing two more teams, in particular Woodville, who were closely surrounded by existing clubs, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and West Torrens.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  A resurgent Sturt under coach [[Jack Oatey]] won five straight premierships from 1966\u201370, sharing a fierce rivalry with [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] whom they met in four consecutive Grand Finals.\n\n=== 1970\u20131979: Golden Era ===\n[[File:Barrie_Robran_Statue.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Barrie Robran]] helped [[North Adelaide Football Club|North]] become 1972 [[1972 Championship of Australia|Champions of Australia]]]]\nSturt began the 1970s by defeating Glenelg in a rain-affected Grand Final by 21 points. North Adelaide secured back-to-back premiership victories over [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] in 1971 and 1972 and defeated VFL premier Carlton by one point in the end-of-season [[Championship of Australia]] match.  [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] continued their success, winning two premierships themselves (1977, 1979), and finishing lower than 3rd only once for the decade. Other premiership winning clubs in the 1970s were Sturt (1970, 1974, 1976), Glenelg (1973), and Norwood (1975, 1978). On 4 May 1974, Central District and North Adelaide played the first game at newly opened Football Park at [[West Lakes, South Australia|West Lakes]].  SANFL moved its administration to the new stadium, and 58,042 attended the first Grand Final at the ground later that year, with Sturt defeating Glenelg by 15 points despite kicking into a stiff breeze in the last quarter after leading by 5 points at three-quarter time. The 1975 season was highlighted by Glenelg's score of 49.23 (317) against Central District, with a winning margin of 238 points which was larger, at that time, than the previous highest score ever recorded by a side in a single game. In 1976, Sturt defeated Grand Final favourites [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] by 41 points in front of a record ticketed Football Park crowd of 66,897. Norwood won the 1978 premiership in their centenary year by beating Sturt in the Grand Final by one point after Sturt had lost just one game for the entire season. During the 1970s, an increasing number of SANFL players moved to Victoria to play in the VFL competition.\n\n=== 1980\u20131989: VFL leaves ANFC and expands whilst SANFL struggles  ===\n[[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], Norwood and Glenelg dominated the SANFL in the 1980s, accounting for eight premierships. The exodus of quality players to the VFL continued in the 1980s.  In 1981 the VFL rejected a SANFL bid to enter a composite South Australian team to its competition.  The SANFL introduced a player retention scheme in 1988 in an attempt to maintain the quality of the competition in the face of falling attendances.  Night football was introduced in 1984 after floodlights were installed at Football Park.\n\n=== 1990\u20131999: Adelaide and Port Adelaide AFL entry ===\n[[File:Graham_Cornes.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Graham Cornes]] was {{SANFL Gle}} coach in 1990 and became {{AFL Ade}}'s first coach in the AFL the following year]]\nOn 31 July 1990, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] surprised the SANFL by making an independent bid to join the AFL.  The SANFL was left with little option but to submit its own bid to enter the AFL.  In a thirty-minute meeting{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the SANFL formed the Adelaide Football Club.  While [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] had by far the largest supporter base in South Australia, it could not compete with the SANFL's offer of a composite club and the use of Football Park, and in November 1990, following a legal battle, the AFL announced the Adelaide Football Club had been granted a licence and would enter the competition in 1991.\n\nThe Adelaide Crows debuted in 1991 wearing the state colours of navy blue, red and yellow.  While the Adelaide Crows enjoyed crowds of over 40,000 every week and dominated local media coverage, crowds at local SANFL matches suffered substantially. Port Adelaide dominated the SANFL in this time, winning 7 premierships in the 9 years from 1988 to 1996.\n\nIn 1994 after a tender process put to all the SANFL clubs, the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]] secured a licence to enter the AFL. Port Adelaide chose the nickname of 'Power' since 'Magpies' was already used by Collingwood. [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] wished to maintain its presence (as the Magpies) in the SANFL, which was agreed to on the basis that Port Adelaide's SANFL and AFL entities operate independently. The club in the SANFL was renamed \"Port Adelaide Magpies Football Club\" to reflect this separation.\n\n=== 2000\u20132009: Central District domination ===\n[[File:As-east.jpg|thumb|right|{{SANFL Cen}}'s won nine Grand Finals at [[Football Park]] between 2000 and 2010]]\nThere was a changing of the guard as the new century started. For more than 100 years one of [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], Norwood, North Adelaide or Sturt appeared in every Grand Final. The year 2000 saw the two newest teams Central District and Woodville-West Torrens played off in the Grand Final. Central District appeared in every Grand Final from 2000 to 2011, collecting nine premierships (2000-1, 2003\u20135, 2007\u20132010).  Only Sturt (2002) and Woodville-West Torrens (2006 & 2011) interrupted Centrals' run during this period. Under-age divisions were restructured, with under 17 and under 19 competitions dissolved in favour of under 16 and under 18 leagues, the latter coming into line with Victoria's TAC Cup competition and under the sponsorship of McDonald's would be known as the Macca's Cup. The former would become the Macca's Shield, the season length is around half that of the other levels of competition. Night games would become a feature at Elizabeth Oval, with Central District hosting Saturday night matches from 2006.\n\n=== 2010\u2013present: AFL clubs gain independence and the league returns to Adelaide Oval ===\nCentral District appeared in the 2010 & 2011 Grand Finals, with a victory over Norwood for their ninth flag then a loss to Woodville-West Torrens. The 2012 season saw them exit the finals in straight sets after defeats by West Adelaide and then North Adelaide. The 2012 and 2013 premierships were both won by Norwood, firstly defeating West Adelaide by 49 points to win their 28th flag and then subsequently defeating North Adelaide by 40 points for their 29th flag. This was the first time Norwood had won back to back flags for 90 years, when coincidentally they also beat West Adelaide (1922) and North Adelaide (1923).\n\n[[File:Adelaide Oval, 2014.jpg|thumb|left|The 2014 SANFL Grand Final was the first time since 1973 that a premiership was decided at [[Adelaide Oval]]]]\nWith Norwood and Elizabeth's night match experiment largely successful and popular, West Adelaide (2010), South Adelaide (2011) and Glenelg (2012) would follow suit by installing their own lighting systems at their respective grounds while Woodville-West Torrens had hoped to play under lights at Thebarton Oval, which to date have only done so once in 2012 during their premiership defence.\n\nIn 2011, AFL-based Port Adelaide and SANFL-based Port Adelaide Magpies merged to address losses at both clubs, however in 2013 the club announced that the Magpies would officially become the reserves team for Port's AFL players, joining the Adelaide Football Club in fielding a reserves team in the SANFL in time for the 2014 season. These moves caused some furore in some fan circles. The 2013 Grand Final was the last SANFL match at AAMI Stadium, with SANFL league headquarters to remain at AAMI but the finals to return to the new and improved Adelaide Oval from 2014. Ahead of the 2014 season, the AFL-based [[Adelaide Football Club]] were granted a licence to field a [[reserve team]] in the competition, increasing the number of teams in the league to 10.\n\nAs a result of the Magpies becoming the Power's reserve team, and the inclusion of the Crows reserves team in the SANFL in 2014, the other SANFL clubs will lose their AFL contracted players as those contracted to the Crows or Power will move to play exclusively for those clubs in either league. Norwood's dominance of the competition would end in the 2015 season, eliminated at the first week of the finals as West Adelaide ended a 32-year premiership drought with their five-goal defeat of Woodville-West Torrens in the Grand Final.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:left\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Those recruited to these AFL clubs who had not previously played for an SANFL club were allocated to a club by means of a \"mini-draft\", or played as a \"guest player\" if they were not playing for their Adelaide based AFL club, and their SANFL club had a bye. AFL club listed players were required to play a minimum of five SANFL games for their club through the season to be eligible to play in the SANFL finals. This rule had been in effect since the Crows first entered the AFL in [[1991 AFL season|1991]].\n\nFrom the 2014 season onwards and on a year-by-year reviewable basis, Adelaide and Port Adelaide will have reserves teams in the SANFL league division. The latter will play as the Magpies and maintain their records and history as Port Adelaide Football Club,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} with 15 dedicated SANFL players and the rest to be made up of Power-listed players.

Hill Premiership Trophy''', named after administrator [[Thomas Seymour Hill]].\n\nThe '''Stanley H. Lewis Memorial Trophy''', awarded annually since 1962, recognises the best combined record in all levels of SANFL competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanley H. Lewis Trophy|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/awards/stanley_h_lewis_trophy/|publisher=SANFL|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> The trophy is awarded to the best performed club across three grades of the competition \u2013 League, Reserves and Under 18, with 100 points allocated for a league win, 50 points for a reserves win and 50 points for an Under 18 win. In the event of a draw, half of the points allocated for a win in that grade are awarded to each club involved.<ref>{{cite web|title=North Adelaide wins 2014 Stanley H. Lewis Trophy|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/news/sanfl_news/2673/|publisher=SANFL|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Individual ===\n\nThe [[Magarey Medal]] is awarded to the fairest and most brilliant player in the SANFL each season and is the oldest individual football award in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/the_sanfl/history_of_the_sanfl/|title=History of the SANFL}}</ref>\n\nThe medal was originated by and is named after [[William Ashley Magarey]] who, in 1897, was the inaugural chairman of the South Australian Football Association (as the SANFL was then known). In 1898, in an effort to stamp out rough play and improve respect of umpires, Magarey instituted the medal to be awarded to the player deemed by umpires to be the fairest and most brilliant for that season. The inaugural winner of the medal was Norwood's [[Alby Green]]. Magarey presented every medal until he died in 1929, with West Adelaide's [[Robert Snell]] the last to receive the medal during Magarey's life. The [[Magarey Medal]] is still awarded to the [[best and fairest|fairest and most brilliant]] SANFL player each season. The [[Reserves Magarey Medal]] recognises the standout performers in the seconds or Reserves. It is not unusual for the Reserves Magarey winner to play only half a season in the 'seconds' and the rest of the season in their club's league team.\n\nThe [[Ken Farmer Medal]], much like the Coleman Medal in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], is awarded to the league player with the most goals in a season. Named after North Adelaide and South Australia's most prolific goal-kicker [[Ken Farmer]] who ended his SANFL career with a still record 1,417 goals, the medal was introduced in 1981 after Farmer's death, with Port Adelaide's [[Tim Evans (footballer)|Tim Evans]] winning the inaugural award. Evans kicked 1,019 goals in premiership matches for the Magpies between 1975 and 1986, and is the only player other than Farmer who has kicked over 1,000 goals in the SANFL.\n\nThere are also the McCallum and Tomkins Medals, which up until the 2008 season were awarded to the best and fairest players of the U-17 and U-19 divisions respectively. These awards were merged in 2009 when the two under-age competitions were replaced with an U-18's league, similar to those adopted in the [[West Australian Football League]] and the VFL's [[TAC Cup]]. The first winner of the newly created McCallum-Tomkins Medal was South Adelaide's Luke Bowd.\n\nThe [[Jack Oatey Medal]] is awarded to the player voted best on ground in the SANFL Grand Final, first awarded in the 1981 premiership decider to [[Russell Ebert]] of Port Adelaide. In the same year, the [[Fos Williams Medal]] was also commissioned to recognise the standout performer for South Australia in interstate football, the first of which was awarded to [[Peter Carey (Australian rules footballer)|Peter Carey]] of Glenelg. \n\nDespite State of Origin football disappearing from the AFL calendar in 1999, the medal continues to be awarded to the best player for the SANFL representative team in interstate football.\n\nThe [[Bob Shearman|R.O. Shearman Medal]], since its inception in 2000, is awarded to the player voted by the League's senior coaches on a 5\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 basis each game of the home-and-away season.<ref>[http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/news/2014-09-01/summerton-wins-coaches-award Summerton wins 2014 R.O. Shearman Medal as voted by the League's coaches]</ref>\n\nThe [[Bob Quinn (Australian footballer)|Bob Quinn]] Medal is awarded to the player voted best afield in the [[Anzac Day]] matches between the Grand Finalists of the previous year. Commissioned in 2002, the medal was first won by [[James Gowans (Australian footballer)|James Gowans]] of Central District.\n\nAlso in 2002, the SANFL created the [[South Australian Football Hall of Fame]] to recognise the players, coaches, umpires, administrators and journalists who had made a significant contribution in the SANFL. The inaugural class of 2002 saw 113 inductees into the Hall of Fame and included such greats as Russell Ebert, Ken Farmer, [[Barrie Robran]], [[Malcolm Blight]], [[Fos Williams]], [[Brian Faehse]], [[Lindsay Head]], [[Neil Kerley]], [[Rick Davies (footballer)|Rick Davies]] and [[Jack Oatey]].\n\n==SANFL Women's==\n{{main|SANFL Women's League}}\nIn February 2017, the SANFL followed the example of [[VFL Women's]] (Victoria) and created a state-based [[women's Australian rules football]] competition replicating its men's league. The SANFLW expanded over the following two years and is now played by eight of the SANFL clubs (Adelaide and Port Adelaide do not feature) from February to May each year. Due to the timing of the league, most SANFLW are not contracted to clubs in the semi-professional [[AFL Women's]] national competition. [[South Adelaide Football Club|South Adelaide]] are the current league premiers.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[:Category:South Australian National Football League clubs|List of SANFL clubs]]\n* [[:Category:South Australian National Football League players|List of SANFL players]]\n* [[List of SANFL records]]\n* [[List of Magarey Medallists]]\n* [[South Australian Football Hall of Fame]]\n* [[:Category:SANFL Grand Finals|SANFL Grand Finals]]\n* [[List of SANFL wooden spoons]]\n\n==Sources==\n*http://www.australianfootball.com/\n*http://www.footysa.com\n*http://www.sanfl.com.au/\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20151004020459/http://australianfootball.com/seasons/season/SANFL/2013 2013 SANFL Season]\n*[http://www.sanfl.com.au The official SANFL website]\n\n===Club websites===\n*[http://www.afc.com.au/ Adelaide]\n*[http://www.cdfc.com.au/ Central District]\n*[http://www.glenelgfc.com.au/ Glenelg]\n*[http://www.nafc.com.au/ North Adelaide]\n*[http://www.norwoodfc.com.au Norwood]\n*[http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/sanfl Port Adelaide]\n*[http://www.sturtfc.com.au/ Sturt]\n*[http://www.safc.com.au/ South Adelaide]\n*[http://www.westadelaidefc.com.au/ West Adelaide]\n*[http://www.wwtfc.com.au/ Woodville \u2013 West Torrens]\n\n{{South Australian National Football League}}\n{{SANFL grounds}}\n{{SANFL seasons}}\n{{Aussie Rules in South Australia}}\n\n[[Category:South Australian National Football League| ]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football governing bodies]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football competitions in South Australia]]\n[[Category:1877 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sports leagues established in 1877]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n{{Infobox sports league\n| title           = SANFL\n| current_season  = 2019 SANFL season\n| last_season     = \n| upcoming_season = \n| logo            = SANFL logo.svg \n| pixels          = 150px\n| caption         = \n| formerly        = South Australian Football Association <br/><small>(1877\u20131906) </small><br> South Australian Football League <br/><small>(1907\u20131927)</small>\n| replaced        =\n| sport           = Australian rules football\n| founded         = 30 April 1877\n| owner           = \n| ceo             = Jake Parkinson\n| director        = \n| president       =\n| commissioner    =\n| fame            = <!--what the league is famous for...the \"claim to fame\"...avoid use if possible-->\n| motto           = \n| inaugural       = [[1877 SAFA season|1877]]\n| teams           = 10\n| singles         = \n| country         = Australia\n| venue           = \n| continent       = <!-- or | continents = -->\n| folded          = \n| champion        = [[Glenelg Football Club|Glenelg]]<br/>(5th premiership)\n| most_champs     = [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]]<br/>(36 premierships)\n| qualification   = \n| tv              = [[Seven Network]]<br/>[[Fox Footy]]\n| sponsor         = Statewide Super\n| related_comps   = \n| founder         = \n| levels          = \n| promotion       =\n| relegation      =\n| domestic_cup    =\n| website         = [http://www.sanfl.com.au/ www.sanfl.com.au]\n| footnotes       =\n}}\n\nThe '''South Australian National Football League''', or '''SANFL''' ({{IPAc-en|'|s|\u00e6|n|f|\u0259l}} or ''S-A-N-F-L''),<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/local-footy-sa/sanfl/new-logo-new-brand-as-sanfl-strives-to-strengthen-image-in-state-football/news-story/99204940295d478b2262300ecf5c9aad|title=New logo, new brand as SANFL strives to strengthen image in State football|last=Rucci|first=Michelangelo|date=24 February 2016|work=The Advertiser|access-date=}}</ref> is an [[Australian rules football]] league based in the Australian state of [[South Australia]]. It is also the [[sports governing body|governing body]] for the sport of [[Australian rules football]] in [[South Australia]].\n\nOriginally formed as the South Australian Football Association on 30 April 1877, the SANFL is the oldest surviving football league of any code in Australia and one of the [[Oldest football competitions|oldest football competitions in the world]], forming just a few years after the [[United Hospitals Challenge Cup]] (1874), the oldest [[rugby football]] competition, and over a decade before [[The Football League]], although later than the [[FA Cup]] (soccer).\n\nConsisting of a single division competition, since 2014 the season has been an 18-round \"home-and-away\" (regular) season from April to September. The top five teams play-off in a final series culminating in the grand final for the Thomas Seymour Hill Premiership Trophy.  The grand final had traditionally been held at [[Football Park]] in October, generally the week after the [[AFL Grand Final]], though this was altered ahead of the [[2014 SANFL season|2014 season]] resulting in [[Adelaide Oval]] hosting the grand final in the penultimate weekend of September.\n\nThe league owned the sub-licences for South Australia's two AFL clubs \u2013 [[Adelaide Football Club]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club]] until March 2014, when [[South Australian Football Commission]] reached an agreement with the Adelaide and Port Adelaide football clubs \u2013 endorsed by the AFL \u2013 which will see the two AFL licences transferred to the clubs in return for payments totalling more than $18&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.sanfl.com.au/news/sanfl_news/2415/ SA FOOTBALL COMMISSION AND AFL AGREE TO TRANSFER OF CROWS AND POWER LICENCES]</ref>\n\nThe league is also responsible for the management of all levels of football in the state. This includes junior football, country football, amateur football and specific programs rolled out across schools, indigenous communities (including the APY Lands in the state's north) and newly arrived migrant communities.\n\nThe SANFL owns [[Football Park]], formerly the largest stadium in South Australia. The stadium, which opened in 1974, was primarily used for [[Australian Football League]] matches up until 2013 and had a capacity of over 51,000 prior to being demolished. The stadium was the headquarters for the league from 1974\u20132013. The SANFL competition is the second highest attended Australian rules football league behind the AFL.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Before 1877 ===\n{{Further information|Australian rules football in South Australia}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n\n| image1 = Adelaide SAFA logo.jpg \n | width1 = 120\n | alt1 =  \n | caption1 = The original [[Adelaide Football Club (SAFA)|Adelaide F.C.]], formed in 1860, was the first in South Australia\n | image2 = Bucks_Flat,_Glanville_Hall_Estate.jpg\n | width2 = 170 \n | alt2 =  \n | caption2  = {{AFL Por}} played its early games at Glanville Hall Estate from 1870 to 1879\n | footer = \n}}\n\nThe first recorded game of any \"football\" in South Australia was that of 'Caid' played in Thebarton by people of the local Irish community in 1843 to celebrate St Patrick's Day.

The South Australian Football Association was formed at a meeting at the Prince Alfred Hotel in [[King William Street, Adelaide]]<ref>4 Quarters, Issue No.4, pg 49, September/October 2008, Slattery Media</ref> on 30 April 1877,<ref>Page 5 of '<nowiki/>'''League Football in South Australia'''' (circa 1978).

The inaugural 1877 season was contested by 8 clubs: South Park, Willunga, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], Adelaide, North Adelaide, Gawler, Bankers, Woodville, South Adelaide and Victorian.\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n! colspan=\"8\" |Founding clubs\n|-\n|[[Adelaide Football Club (SAFA)|Adelaide]]\n|Bankers\n|[[Kensington Football Club|Kensington]]\n|[[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]]\n|[[South Adelaide Football Club|South Adelaide]]\n|[[South Park Football Club (SAFA)|South Park]]\n|[[Victorian Football Club (SAFA)|Victorian]]\n|Woodville\n|}\n</center>\n\nNorwood joined the Association the following season in 1878, and went on to win the next six premierships.  Norwood, South Adelaide and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] together won 23 of the first 24 premierships. South Park, Willunga, North Adelaide, Prince Alfred College, Gawler, Kapunda, Bankers, Woodville, and Victorian all left the Association within the first 10 years.  By 1886, the Association had been reduced from 12 to four clubs.\n\nThe Association experienced a resurgence in the late 1880s and early 1890s.  The addition of North Adelaide (1893), West Adelaide and West Torrens (1897) and only the demise of Adelaide (1893), meant the Association comprised six clubs by the turn of the century. In 1898, the [[Magarey Medal]] was awarded to the fairest and most brilliant player for the first time.\n\nIn 1899, after a period of declining public interest in football due to the long term inequality between the traditional clubs ([[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], South Adelaide and Norwood) and the younger clubs (West Adelaide, West Torrens and North Adelaide), the SAFA introduced [[zoning (Australian rules football)|electorate football]], meaning that players were allocated to clubs based on the district in which they resided.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Adelaide Observer|location=Adelaide, SA|title=The Football Difficult|date=6 May 1899|page=19}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:South_Adelaide_1877_premiership_team.png|{{SANFL SthA}} was a strong club in early years winning 8 premierships in the 19th century (1885 South Adelaide team pictured).\nFile:Norwood_premiership_team_1878.png|The {{SANFL Nor}} Football Club won six premierships in a row from its establishment in 1878 to 1883 (1878 Norwood team pictured).\nFile:AlfredTopsyWaldron.JPG|[[Alfred Waldron (footballer)|Alfred Waldron]] was an early star.\nFile:Albert_Green_Norwood.jpg|[[Alby Green]] won the competition's first [[Magarey Medal]] in 1898.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1901\u20131915: Pre war years ===\n[[Sturt Football Club|Sturt]] joined the Association in 1901, but performed poorly initially, finishing last in its first three seasons.  In 1902, Port Adelaide adopted its now famous black and white colours.  In 1907, the Association changed its name to the South Australian Football League.\n\nNorwood and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] continued their domination of the league, and were joined by West Adelaide and North Adelaide; between them, the four clubs won all premierships between 1901 and 1913.  West Adelaide followed three straight wooden spoons from 1904\u201306 with four out of the five premierships from 1908\u20131912, the most successful period in West Adelaide's history.\n\nThe SANFL maintained competition for the first two years of World War I, 1914 and 1915, with Sturt winning their first premiership in 1915, but from 1916 the competition was suspended and did not resume until 1919.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:1908_West_Adelaide_premiership_team.jpg|{{SANFL WestA}} won four SAFL premierships and two [[Championship of Australia|Championships of Australia]] between 1908 and 1912.\nFile:PortAdelaide1914.jpg|{{SANFL Por}} went through the [[1914 SAFL season]] undefeated. \nFile:PortAdelaideOval.JPG|{{AFL Por}} was [[Championship of Australia|Champion of Australia]] 3 times between 1910 and 1914.\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1916\u20131945: Inter war years ===\nSturt won the first premiership of the post-World War I era, beating North Adelaide in the Challenge Final replay.  [[Glenelg Football Club|Glenelg]] became the newest addition to the league in 1921 and started poorly with five consecutive wooden spoons.  In 1927, the South Australian Football League was renamed the South Australian National Football League.  Port Adelaide won five premierships in the period 1919\u20131939, appearing in 12 grand finals.\n\nThe SANFL continued normal competition for the first few years of World War II, but from 1942 to 1944 operated on a reduced basis with clubs merged on a geographical basis \u2013 Port Adelaide / West Torrens, West Adelaide / Glenelg, Sturt / South Adelaide and Norwood / North Adelaide.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Norwood_vs_Port_Adelaide,_1929_SANFL_Grand_Final,_Adelaide_Oval.jpg|Pictured above is the [[1929 SANFL Grand Final]] between {{SANFL Por}} and {{SANFL Nor}} who by this time had well and truly become the leagues premier rivals. <br/>See [[Port Adelaide-Norwood SANFL rivalry]].\nFile:Ken Farmer SANFL.jpg|[[Ken Farmer]] kicked a record 1,417 goals.\nFile:Ian_McKay_Spectacular_Mark.jpg|[[Ian McKay (footballer)|Ian McKay]] leaps for a spectacular mark in the [[1952 SANFL Grand Final]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== 1946\u20131969: Port Adelaide and Sturt rivalry ===\nStraight after the War Sturt won their Second Premiership. The next three years were dominated by Norwood. [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], led by [[Fos Williams]], dominated the 1950s winning seven premierships, including a record setting six Grand Final wins in a row from 1954\u201359. This record also matched Norwood's six in a row in 1883, set before the advent of regular Grand Finals.\n\n[[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] continued their dominance of the competition in the early 1960s with three more premierships by 1965.  In 1964 the SANFL admitted two new clubs, [[Central District Football Club|Central District]] and [[Woodville Football Club|Woodville]].  Both clubs performed poorly, and many questioned the purpose of introducing two more teams, in particular Woodville, who were closely surrounded by existing clubs, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and West Torrens.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  A resurgent Sturt under coach [[Jack Oatey]] won five straight premierships from 1966\u201370, sharing a fierce rivalry with [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] whom they met in four consecutive Grand Finals.\n\n=== 1970\u20131979: Golden Era ===\n[[File:Barrie_Robran_Statue.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Barrie Robran]] helped [[North Adelaide Football Club|North]] become 1972 [[1972 Championship of Australia|Champions of Australia]]]]\nSturt began the 1970s by defeating Glenelg in a rain-affected Grand Final by 21 points. North Adelaide secured back-to-back premiership victories over [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] in 1971 and 1972 and defeated VFL premier Carlton by one point in the end-of-season [[Championship of Australia]] match.  [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] continued their success, winning two premierships themselves (1977, 1979), and finishing lower than 3rd only once for the decade. Other premiership winning clubs in the 1970s were Sturt (1970, 1974, 1976), Glenelg (1973), and Norwood (1975, 1978). On 4 May 1974, Central District and North Adelaide played the first game at newly opened Football Park at [[West Lakes, South Australia|West Lakes]].  SANFL moved its administration to the new stadium, and 58,042 attended the first Grand Final at the ground later that year, with Sturt defeating Glenelg by 15 points despite kicking into a stiff breeze in the last quarter after leading by 5 points at three-quarter time. The 1975 season was highlighted by Glenelg's score of 49.23 (317) against Central District, with a winning margin of 238 points which was larger, at that time, than the previous highest score ever recorded by a side in a single game. In 1976, Sturt defeated Grand Final favourites [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] by 41 points in front of a record ticketed Football Park crowd of 66,897. Norwood won the 1978 premiership in their centenary year by beating Sturt in the Grand Final by one point after Sturt had lost just one game for the entire season. During the 1970s, an increasing number of SANFL players moved to Victoria to play in the VFL competition.\n\n=== 1980\u20131989: VFL leaves ANFC and expands whilst SANFL struggles  ===\n[[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], Norwood and Glenelg dominated the SANFL in the 1980s, accounting for eight premierships. The exodus of quality players to the VFL continued in the 1980s.  In 1981 the VFL rejected a SANFL bid to enter a composite South Australian team to its competition.  The SANFL introduced a player retention scheme in 1988 in an attempt to maintain the quality of the competition in the face of falling attendances.  Night football was introduced in 1984 after floodlights were installed at Football Park.\n\n=== 1990\u20131999: Adelaide and Port Adelaide AFL entry ===\n[[File:Graham_Cornes.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Graham Cornes]] was {{SANFL Gle}} coach in 1990 and became {{AFL Ade}}'s first coach in the AFL the following year]]\nOn 31 July 1990, [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] surprised the SANFL by making an independent bid to join the AFL.  The SANFL was left with little option but to submit its own bid to enter the AFL.  In a thirty-minute meeting{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the SANFL formed the Adelaide Football Club.  While [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] had by far the largest supporter base in South Australia, it could not compete with the SANFL's offer of a composite club and the use of Football Park, and in November 1990, following a legal battle, the AFL announced the Adelaide Football Club had been granted a licence and would enter the competition in 1991.\n\nThe Adelaide Crows debuted in 1991 wearing the state colours of navy blue, red and yellow.  While the Adelaide Crows enjoyed crowds of over 40,000 every week and dominated local media coverage, crowds at local SANFL matches suffered substantially. Port Adelaide dominated the SANFL in this time, winning 7 premierships in the 9 years from 1988 to 1996.\n\nIn 1994 after a tender process put to all the SANFL clubs, the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]] secured a licence to enter the AFL. Port Adelaide chose the nickname of 'Power' since 'Magpies' was already used by Collingwood. [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] wished to maintain its presence (as the Magpies) in the SANFL, which was agreed to on the basis that Port Adelaide's SANFL and AFL entities operate independently. The club in the SANFL was renamed \"Port Adelaide Magpies Football Club\" to reflect this separation.\n\n=== 2000\u20132009: Central District domination ===\n[[File:As-east.jpg|thumb|right|{{SANFL Cen}}'s won nine Grand Finals at [[Football Park]] between 2000 and 2010]]\nThere was a changing of the guard as the new century started. For more than 100 years one of [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], Norwood, North Adelaide or Sturt appeared in every Grand Final. The year 2000 saw the two newest teams Central District and Woodville-West Torrens played off in the Grand Final. Central District appeared in every Grand Final from 2000 to 2011, collecting nine premierships (2000-1, 2003\u20135, 2007\u20132010).  Only Sturt (2002) and Woodville-West Torrens (2006 & 2011) interrupted Centrals' run during this period. Under-age divisions were restructured, with under 17 and under 19 competitions dissolved in favour of under 16 and under 18 leagues, the latter coming into line with Victoria's TAC Cup competition and under the sponsorship of McDonald's would be known as the Macca's Cup. The former would become the Macca's Shield, the season length is around half that of the other levels of competition. Night games would become a feature at Elizabeth Oval, with Central District hosting Saturday night matches from 2006.\n\n=== 2010\u2013present: AFL clubs gain independence and the league returns to Adelaide Oval ===\nCentral District appeared in the 2010 & 2011 Grand Finals, with a victory over Norwood for their ninth flag then a loss to Woodville-West Torrens. The 2012 season saw them exit the finals in straight sets after defeats by West Adelaide and then North Adelaide. The 2012 and 2013 premierships were both won by Norwood, firstly defeating West Adelaide by 49 points to win their 28th flag and then subsequently defeating North Adelaide by 40 points for their 29th flag. This was the first time Norwood had won back to back flags for 90 years, when coincidentally they also beat West Adelaide (1922) and North Adelaide (1923).\n\n[[File:Adelaide Oval, 2014.jpg|thumb|left|The 2014 SANFL Grand Final was the first time since 1973 that a premiership was decided at [[Adelaide Oval]]]]\nWith Norwood and Elizabeth's night match experiment largely successful and popular, West Adelaide (2010), South Adelaide (2011) and Glenelg (2012) would follow suit by installing their own lighting systems at their respective grounds while Woodville-West Torrens had hoped to play under lights at Thebarton Oval, which to date have only done so once in 2012 during their premiership defence.\n\nIn 2011, AFL-based Port Adelaide and SANFL-based Port Adelaide Magpies merged to address losses at both clubs, however in 2013 the club announced that the Magpies would officially become the reserves team for Port's AFL players, joining the Adelaide Football Club in fielding a reserves team in the SANFL in time for the 2014 season. These moves caused some furore in some fan circles. The 2013 Grand Final was the last SANFL match at AAMI Stadium, with SANFL league headquarters to remain at AAMI but the finals to return to the new and improved Adelaide Oval from 2014. Ahead of the 2014 season, the AFL-based [[Adelaide Football Club]] were granted a licence to field a [[reserve team]] in the competition, increasing the number of teams in the league to 10.\n\nAs a result of the Magpies becoming the Power's reserve team, and the inclusion of the Crows reserves team in the SANFL in 2014, the other SANFL clubs will lose their AFL contracted players as those contracted to the Crows or Power will move to play exclusively for those clubs in either league. Norwood's dominance of the competition would end in the 2015 season, eliminated at the first week of the finals as West Adelaide ended a 32-year premiership drought with their five-goal defeat of Woodville-West Torrens in the Grand Final.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:left\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Those recruited to these AFL clubs who had not previously played for an SANFL club were allocated to a club by means of a \"mini-draft\", or played as a \"guest player\" if they were not playing for their Adelaide based AFL club, and their SANFL club had a bye. AFL club listed players were required to play a minimum of five SANFL games for their club through the season to be eligible to play in the SANFL finals. This rule had been in effect since the Crows first entered the AFL in [[1991 AFL season|1991]].\n\nFrom the 2014 season onwards and on a year-by-year reviewable basis, Adelaide and Port Adelaide will have reserves teams in the SANFL league division. The latter will play as the Magpies and maintain their records and history as Port Adelaide Football Club,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} with 15 dedicated SANFL players and the rest to be made up of Power-listed players. While the Crows will not take part in the other levels of competition, the SANFL reserves division will see a Magpies team under the banner of an \"Academy\" team, made up of players aged between 18\u201322 and any players from that pool of 15 that may be demoted. This season will also be the last that the Magpies are involved at SANFL Under-18's & 16's competitions.\n\n=== Former clubs ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Club \n!Nickname \n!\n!Home ground \n!Established\n!Dissolved\n!Left\n!First season\n!Premierships \n|- \n| '''[[Adelaide Football Club (SAFA)|Adelaide (Original)]]''' || \n|[[File:Adelaide SAFA design.jpg|16x16px]]\n| [[Adelaide Oval]]\n|1860\n|1893\n|n/a\n|| [[1877 SAFA season|1877]] ||1\n|- \n| '''[[Bankers Football Club|Bankers]]''' ||Bankers\n|\n|\n|1877\n|1877\n|n/a\n|| [[1877 SAFA season|1877]] ||0\n|-\n|'''[[Gawler Football Club|Gawler]]'''\n|Albions / Tigers\n|[[File:Balmain colours.svg|16px]]\n|Gawler Oval\n|1868\n|n/a\n|1890\n|[[1887 SAFA season|1887]]\n|0\n|-\n|'''[[Kapunda Football Club|Kapunda]]*'''\n|Bombers\n|[[File:EssendonDesign.svg|16px]]\n|Dutton Park\n|1866\n|n/a\n|1878\n|[[1877 SAFA season|1877]]*\n|n/a\n|- \n| [[Kensington Football Club|'''Kensington''']] ||\n|{{colour box|Red}}\n| [[Kensington Oval, Adelaide|Kensington Oval]] \n|1871\n|1881\n|n/a\n|| [[1877 SAFA season|<nowiki/>]] [[1921 SAFL season|1877]] ||0\n|-\n|[[Royal Park Football Club|'''Royal Park''']]\n|\n|\n|\n|1880\n|1882\n|1882\n|[[1882 SAFA season|1882]]\n|0\n|- \n|'''[[South Park Football Club (SAFA)|South Park]]'''||\n|{{colour box|aqua}}\n|\n|1877\n|1884\n|n/a\n|| [[1877 SAFA season|<nowiki/>]] [[1921 SAFL season|<nowiki/>]] [[1888 SAFA season|1877]] ||0\n|- \n| '''[[Victorian Football Club (SAFA)|Victorian]]''' ||Bumblebees\n|[[File:Victorian SANFL Icon.jpg|16x16px]] \n|Montefiore Oval\n|1877\n|1884\n|n/a\n|| [[1877 SAFA season|<nowiki/>]] [[1921 SAFL season|<nowiki/>]] [[1888 SAFA season|<nowiki/>]] [[1878 SAFA season|1877]] ||1\n|-\n|'''[[West Adelaide Football Club (1878\u20131887)|West Adelaide (1878\u20131887)]]'''\n|Butchers\n|\n|\n|1878\n|1887\n|n/a\n|[[1887 SAFA season|1887]]\n|0\n|-\n|[[Woodville-West Torrens Eagles|'''West Torrens''']]\n|Eagles\n|\n|[[Thebarton Oval]]\n|1897\n|1991\n|n/a\n|[[1897 SAFA season|1897]]\n|4\n|- \n|'''[[Willunga Football Club|Willunga]]*'''||\n|{{colour box|White}}\n|\n|1874\n|n/a\n|1885|| [[1877 SAFA season|1877]]* ||n/a\n|-\n|'''[[Woodville Football Club (1868\u20131877)|Woodville (1868\u20131877)]]'''\n|\n|{{colour box|Black}}\n|\n|1868\n|1877\n|n/a\n|[[1877 SAFA season|1877]]\n|0\n|- \n|'''[[Woodville Football Club|Woodville (1938\u20131990)]]'''||Woodpeckers / Warriors\n|[[File:Woodville Warriors design.jpg|16x16px]]\n| [[Woodville Oval]] \n|1938\n|1991\n|n/a\n||[[1964 SANFL season|1964]]||0\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" |*Indicates that the club was an affiliate member who played games against SANFL clubs but did not contest the premiership.\n|- \n|-\n|}\n\n==Venues==\nGames are generally hosted at suburban grounds throughout Adelaide.<center>\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n![[Adelaide]]\n!

Hill Premiership Trophy''', named after administrator [[Thomas Seymour Hill]].\n\nThe '''Stanley H. Lewis Memorial Trophy''', awarded annually since 1962, recognises the best combined record in all levels of SANFL competition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanley H. Lewis Trophy|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/awards/stanley_h_lewis_trophy/|publisher=SANFL|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> The trophy is awarded to the best performed club across three grades of the competition \u2013 League, Reserves and Under 18, with 100 points allocated for a league win, 50 points for a reserves win and 50 points for an Under 18 win. In the event of a draw, half of the points allocated for a win in that grade are awarded to each club involved.<ref>{{cite web|title=North Adelaide wins 2014 Stanley H. Lewis Trophy|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/news/sanfl_news/2673/|publisher=SANFL|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Individual ===\n\nThe [[Magarey Medal]] is awarded to the fairest and most brilliant player in the SANFL each season and is the oldest individual football award in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfl.com.au/the_sanfl/history_of_the_sanfl/|title=History of the SANFL}}</ref>\n\nThe medal was originated by and is named after [[William Ashley Magarey]] who, in 1897, was the inaugural chairman of the South Australian Football Association (as the SANFL was then known). In 1898, in an effort to stamp out rough play and improve respect of umpires, Magarey instituted the medal to be awarded to the player deemed by umpires to be the fairest and most brilliant for that season. The inaugural winner of the medal was Norwood's [[Alby Green]]. Magarey presented every medal until he died in 1929, with West Adelaide's [[Robert Snell]] the last to receive the medal during Magarey's life. The [[Magarey Medal]] is still awarded to the [[best and fairest|fairest and most brilliant]] SANFL player each season. The [[Reserves Magarey Medal]] recognises the standout performers in the seconds or Reserves. It is not unusual for the Reserves Magarey winner to play only half a season in the 'seconds' and the rest of the season in their club's league team.\n\nThe [[Ken Farmer Medal]], much like the Coleman Medal in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]], is awarded to the league player with the most goals in a season. Named after North Adelaide and South Australia's most prolific goal-kicker [[Ken Farmer]] who ended his SANFL career with a still record 1,417 goals, the medal was introduced in 1981 after Farmer's death, with Port Adelaide's [[Tim Evans (footballer)|Tim Evans]] winning the inaugural award. Evans kicked 1,019 goals in premiership matches for the Magpies between 1975 and 1986, and is the only player other than Farmer who has kicked over 1,000 goals in the SANFL.\n\nThere are also the McCallum and Tomkins Medals, which up until the 2008 season were awarded to the best and fairest players of the U-17 and U-19 divisions respectively. These awards were merged in 2009 when the two under-age competitions were replaced with an U-18's league, similar to those adopted in the [[West Australian Football League]] and the VFL's [[TAC Cup]]. The first winner of the newly created McCallum-Tomkins Medal was South Adelaide's Luke Bowd.\n\nThe [[Jack Oatey Medal]] is awarded to the player voted best on ground in the SANFL Grand Final, first awarded in the 1981 premiership decider to [[Russell Ebert]] of Port Adelaide. In the same year, the [[Fos Williams Medal]] was also commissioned to recognise the standout performer for South Australia in interstate football, the first of which was awarded to [[Peter Carey (Australian rules footballer)|Peter Carey]] of Glenelg. \n\nDespite State of Origin football disappearing from the AFL calendar in 1999, the medal continues to be awarded to the best player for the SANFL representative team in interstate football.\n\nThe [[Bob Shearman|R.O. Shearman Medal]], since its inception in 2000, is awarded to the player voted by the League's senior coaches on a 5\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 basis each game of the home-and-away season.<ref>[http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/news/2014-09-01/summerton-wins-coaches-award Summerton wins 2014 R.O. Shearman Medal as voted by the League's coaches]</ref>\n\nThe [[Bob Quinn (Australian footballer)|Bob Quinn]] Medal is awarded to the player voted best afield in the [[Anzac Day]] matches between the Grand Finalists of the previous year. Commissioned in 2002, the medal was first won by [[James Gowans (Australian footballer)|James Gowans]] of Central District.\n\nAlso in 2002, the SANFL created the [[South Australian Football Hall of Fame]] to recognise the players, coaches, umpires, administrators and journalists who had made a significant contribution in the SANFL. The inaugural class of 2002 saw 113 inductees into the Hall of Fame and included such greats as Russell Ebert, Ken Farmer, [[Barrie Robran]], [[Malcolm Blight]], [[Fos Williams]], [[Brian Faehse]], [[Lindsay Head]], [[Neil Kerley]], [[Rick Davies (footballer)|Rick Davies]] and [[Jack Oatey]].\n\n==SANFL Women's==\n{{main|SANFL Women's League}}\nIn February 2017, the SANFL followed the example of [[VFL Women's]] (Victoria) and created a state-based [[women's Australian rules football]] competition replicating its men's league. The SANFLW expanded over the following two years and is now played by eight of the SANFL clubs (Adelaide and Port Adelaide do not feature) from February to May each year. Due to the timing of the league, most SANFLW are not contracted to clubs in the semi-professional [[AFL Women's]] national competition. [[South Adelaide Football Club|South Adelaide]] are the current league premiers.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[:Category:South Australian National Football League clubs|List of SANFL clubs]]\n* [[:Category:South Australian National Football League players|List of SANFL players]]\n* [[List of SANFL records]]\n* [[List of Magarey Medallists]]\n* [[South Australian Football Hall of Fame]]\n* [[:Category:SANFL Grand Finals|SANFL Grand Finals]]\n* [[List of SANFL wooden spoons]]\n\n==Sources==\n*http://www.australianfootball.com/\n*http://www.footysa.com\n*http://www.sanfl.com.au/\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20151004020459/http://australianfootball.com/seasons/season/SANFL/2013 2013 SANFL Season]\n*[http://www.sanfl.com.au The official SANFL website]\n\n===Club websites===\n*[http://www.afc.com.au/ Adelaide]\n*[http://www.cdfc.com.au/ Central District]\n*[http://www.glenelgfc.com.au/ Glenelg]\n*[http://www.nafc.com.au/ North Adelaide]\n*[http://www.norwoodfc.com.au Norwood]\n*[http://www.portadelaidefc.com.au/sanfl Port Adelaide]\n*[http://www.sturtfc.com.au/ Sturt]\n*[http://www.safc.com.au/ South Adelaide]\n*[http://www.westadelaidefc.com.au/ West Adelaide]\n*[http://www.wwtfc.com.au/ Woodville \u2013 West Torrens]\n\n{{South Australian National Football League}}\n{{SANFL grounds}}\n{{SANFL seasons}}\n{{Aussie Rules in South Australia}}\n\n[[Category:South Australian National Football League| ]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football governing bodies]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football competitions in South Australia]]\n[[Category:1877 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Sports leagues established in 1877]]\n", "name_user": "CharVixen", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVenues", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian_National_Football_League"}
