Historically, Carrollton has been a commercial center for several mostly rural counties in both Georgia and Alabama. It is the home of the [[University of West Georgia]] and [[West Georgia Technical College]]. The 2018 United States Census estimates placed the city's population at 26,443.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\" />\n\n==Geography==\nCarrollton is located near the center of Carroll County at {{Coord|33|34|51|N|85|4|36|W|type:city}} (33.580912, -85.076704).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The [[Little Tallapoosa River]] flows through the northwestern part of the city.

In 1829, the justices voted to move the county seat from the site it occupied near the present community of Sandhill, to a new site about {{convert|8|mi|0}} to the southwest.<ref name=\"Bonner\">Bonner, James C. (1970). ''Georgia's Last Frontier: The Development of Carroll County''. The University of Georgia Press.</ref>\n\nThe original intention was to call the new county seat \"Troupville\", in honor of former governor [[George Troup]], but Troup was not popular with the state government of the time, so the [[Georgia General Assembly]] incorporated the town as Carrollton, in December 1829. The name was in honor of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], the last living signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].<ref name=\"Bonner\"/><ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.kenkrakow.com/gpn/c.pdf | title=Georgia Place-Names: Their History and Origins | publisher=Winship Press | author=Krakow, Kenneth K. | year=1975 | location=Macon, GA | pages=35 | isbn=0-915430-00-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1830, the town was surveyed and lots were laid out, with the central feature being the town square,<ref name=\"Bonner\"/> which was later named Adamson Square, for local judge and congressman [[William C. Adamson]].\n\nAlthough it was the county seat and the main market town for most of Carroll County, transportation of both goods and passengers was difficult until the coming of the railroad in 1874, so Carrollton remained largely a frontier town until well after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"Bonner\"/>\n\nThe coming of the railroad brought new prosperity to Carrollton. Farmers were able to bring their crops, mostly [[cotton]], to town for shipment to distant markets, and obtain the fertilizers and agricultural supplies they needed. At the same time, consumer goods were more readily available than ever before.<ref name=\"Bonner\"/>\n\nThe railroad also encouraged the growth of the fledgling industrial ventures, especially in the [[textile]] industry, in and around Carrollton. These early textile mills, mostly [[Hydropower|water powered]], served as the basis for a textile industry that helped ensure the town's prosperity well into the 20th century.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, Carrollton boasted running water and had electric lighting and telephone service. The town began paving its streets in 1918.<ref name=\"Bonner\"/>\n\nIn 1906, Carrollton was chosen as the site of the Fourth District Agricultural and Mechanical School, which became West Georgia College in 1934, and is now a 12,834-student university, the [[University of West Georgia]]. In May 1964 [[Robert F. Kennedy]] visited Carrollton for the dedication of Kennedy Chapel on the university campus.<ref name=\"UWG\">Bonner, J.C., Myron W. House, James W. Mathews (1998).

State University of West Georgia Foundation.</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Carrollton,Georgia-Panoramic.jpg|1200px|Panoramic of Carrollton's Adamson Square c. 1912}}\n\nCarrollton remained an agricultural and textile manufacturing center throughout the first half of the 20th century, but as the local production of cotton declined and the population became more urban, other industries began to take on a greater prominence.<ref name=\"Bonner\"/> Most notable is the Southwire Company. Founded in Carrollton in 1950, Southwire is now one of the world's largest manufacturers of wire and cable and is the largest privately owned wire manufacturer, with more than 1,500 local employees and 5,000 employees worldwide.<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.southwire.com/processGetArticle.do?commonId=bf99aba544bbef00VgnVCM1000002702a8c0____/ Over 50 Years of Quality and Service.] Southwire Company. Retrieved 7/30/07.</ref>\n\nThis diversification of industry has continued into the 21st century, aided in part by Carrollton's ready access to [[Interstate 20]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. The city's major employers presently include companies in the airline, construction, power distribution, poultry, software, home entertainment, and healthcare industries, among others.<ref>[http://www2.carroll-ga.org/economic%20profile%202007.pdf/ Carroll County Location and Land Facts.

Carrollton featured in the 1983 TV movie ''[[Murder in Coweta County#Film|Murder in Coweta County]]'', although the Carrollton scenes were not actually filmed there. Other films shot in the Carrollton area include ''[[Conjurer (film)|Conjurer]]'' with [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]], ''The Way Home'' with [[Dean Cain]], and ''Between Love and a Hard Place'' with [[Bern Nadette Stanis]]. Carrollton was the home of actress [[Susan Hayward]].<ref name=\"UWG\"/>\n\nOn August 21, 1995, [[Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529]] crashed near Carrollton.

The theater board had authorized use of the venue and appropriated $2,500 for the show, which was already in rehearsal.

The record for snowfall is 10-11\", which fell on December 8 and 9, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/ffc/20171208_Winter_Storm|title=December 8 - 9, 2017 Heavy Snow Event|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|last=Service|website=www.weather.gov}}</ref> The previous record for biggest snow was in March 1993 during the [[Blizzard of 1993]] with {{convert|4|to|6|in}} of snow. During the storm [[thundersnow]] was reported. On Christmas Day 2010 Carrollton had its first [[white Christmas (weather)|white Christmas]] in 17 years.      \n                                                                        \n[[Thunderstorm]]s, a few of them severe, can occur during the spring and summer months. The main risk from these storms comes from [[lightning]] strikes. Any [[tornado]]es produced by these storms tend to be small and highly localized. An [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF3]] tornado hit an area about {{convert|10|mi|0}} west of Carrollton on February 26, 2008. Some of the same areas hit by the February 2008 tornadoes were also hit by the Mother's Day tornadoes on May 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/ffc/torfotos51108b|title=Mother's Day Tornado Outbreak in Georgia - May 11, 2008|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|last=Service|website=www.weather.gov}}</ref> The Mother's Day Tornadoes did extensive damage to many homes and businesses. In April 2017, a tornado hit Carrollton, destroying a fire station and damaging numerous homes and vehicles. The tornado also hit on the campus of the University of West Georgia.\n\nPossibly the most significant severe weather risk comes from [[hurricane]]s that strike the [[Florida Panhandle]]. These storms track northward through Alabama as tropical storms, and some have brought high winds, heavy rainfall, and the occasional tornado to the Carrollton area, resulting in significant property damage. In October 1995 [[Hurricane Opal]] slammed the Florida panhandle then moved north into Alabama and then east into Georgia. The Carrollton area was hit with tropical storm force winds killing one person when a tree came down into a mobile home. Some area residents were without electricity for almost two weeks. In 2005 a feeder band from [[Hurricane Katrina]] produced a tornado that killed one person just south of Carrollton. Flooding is also a concern for the area. In September 2009, up to a foot of rain fell in some areas, flooding many homes, washing away roads and bridges, and claiming the lives of ten people in Georgia.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010915155936/http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/reports/billionz.html /Billion Dollar US Weather Disasters.] National Climatic Data Center (NOAA).

Historically, Carrollton has been a commercial center for several mostly rural counties in both Georgia and Alabama. It is the home of the [[University of West Georgia]] and [[West Georgia Technical College]]. The 2018 United States Census estimates placed the city's population at 26,443.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\" />\n\n==Geography==\nCarrollton is located near the center of Carroll County at {{Coord|33|34|51|N|85|4|36|W|type:city}} (33.580912, -85.076704).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The [[Little Tallapoosa River]] flows through the northwestern part of the city.

In 1829, the justices voted to move the county seat from the site it occupied near the present community of Sandhill, to a new site about {{convert|8|mi|0}} to the southwest.<ref name=\"Bonner\">Bonner, James C. (1970). ''Georgia's Last Frontier: The Development of Carroll County''. The University of Georgia Press.</ref>\n\nThe original intention was to call the new county seat \"Troupville\", in honor of former governor [[George Troup]], but Troup was not popular with the state government of the time, so the [[Georgia General Assembly]] incorporated the town as Carrollton, in December 1829. The name was in honor of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], the last living signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].<ref name=\"Bonner\"/><ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.kenkrakow.com/gpn/c.pdf | title=Georgia Place-Names: Their History and Origins | publisher=Winship Press | author=Krakow, Kenneth K. | year=1975 | location=Macon, GA | pages=35 | isbn=0-915430-00-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1830, the town was surveyed and lots were laid out, with the central feature being the town square,<ref name=\"Bonner\"/> which was later named Adamson Square, for local judge and congressman [[William C. Adamson]].\n\nAlthough it was the county seat and the main market town for most of Carroll County, transportation of both goods and passengers was difficult until the coming of the railroad in 1874, so Carrollton remained largely a frontier town until well after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"Bonner\"/>\n\nThe coming of the railroad brought new prosperity to Carrollton. Farmers were able to bring their crops, mostly [[cotton]], to town for shipment to distant markets, and obtain the fertilizers and agricultural supplies they needed. At the same time, consumer goods were more readily available than ever before.<ref name=\"Bonner\"/>\n\nThe railroad also encouraged the growth of the fledgling industrial ventures, especially in the [[textile]] industry, in and around Carrollton. These early textile mills, mostly [[Hydropower|water powered]], served as the basis for a textile industry that helped ensure the town's prosperity well into the 20th century.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, Carrollton boasted running water and had electric lighting and telephone service. The town began paving its streets in 1918.<ref name=\"Bonner\"/>\n\nIn 1906, Carrollton was chosen as the site of the Fourth District Agricultural and Mechanical School, which became West Georgia College in 1934, and is now a 12,834-student university, the [[University of West Georgia]]. In May 1964 [[Robert F. Kennedy]] visited Carrollton for the dedication of Kennedy Chapel on the university campus.<ref name=\"UWG\">Bonner, J.C., Myron W. House, James W. Mathews (1998).

Founded in Carrollton in 1950, Southwire is now one of the world's largest manufacturers of wire and cable and is the largest privately owned wire manufacturer, with more than 1,500 local employees and 5,000 employees worldwide.<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.southwire.com/processGetArticle.do?commonId=bf99aba544bbef00VgnVCM1000002702a8c0____/ Over 50 Years of Quality and Service.] Southwire Company. Retrieved 7/30/07.</ref>\n\nThis diversification of industry has continued into the 21st century, aided in part by Carrollton's ready access to [[Interstate 20]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. The city's major employers presently include companies in the airline, construction, power distribution, poultry, software, home entertainment, and healthcare industries, among others.<ref>[http://www2.carroll-ga.org/economic%20profile%202007.pdf/ Carroll County Location and Land Facts.

Carrollton featured in the 1983 TV movie ''[[Murder in Coweta County#Film|Murder in Coweta County]]'', although the Carrollton scenes were not actually filmed there. Other films shot in the Carrollton area include ''[[Conjurer (film)|Conjurer]]'' with [[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]], ''The Way Home'' with [[Dean Cain]], and ''Between Love and a Hard Place'' with [[Bern Nadette Stanis]]. Carrollton was the home of actress [[Susan Hayward]].<ref name=\"UWG\"/>\n\nOn August 21, 1995, [[Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529]] crashed near Carrollton. Nine of the 29 passengers and crew on board were killed as a result of the accident.\n\nThe city attracted news media attention amidst allegations of [[censorship]] in September 2011 when the mayor overruled the board of the city-owned Carrollton Cultural Arts Center in order to ban as \"very offensive\" the live stage musical ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' that had been scheduled for a run just before Halloween. The theater board had authorized use of the venue and appropriated $2,500 for the show, which was already in rehearsal.

The main risk from these storms comes from [[lightning]] strikes. Any [[tornado]]es produced by these storms tend to be small and highly localized. An [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF3]] tornado hit an area about {{convert|10|mi|0}} west of Carrollton on February 26, 2008. Some of the same areas hit by the February 2008 tornadoes were also hit by the Mother's Day tornadoes on May 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.weather.gov/ffc/torfotos51108b|title=Mother's Day Tornado Outbreak in Georgia - May 11, 2008|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|last=Service|website=www.weather.gov}}</ref> The Mother's Day Tornadoes did extensive damage to many homes and businesses. In April 2017, a tornado hit Carrollton, destroying a fire station and damaging numerous homes and vehicles. The tornado also hit on the campus of the University of West Georgia.\n\nPossibly the most significant severe weather risk comes from [[hurricane]]s that strike the [[Florida Panhandle]]. These storms track northward through Alabama as tropical storms, and some have brought high winds, heavy rainfall, and the occasional tornado to the Carrollton area, resulting in significant property damage. In October 1995 [[Hurricane Opal]] slammed the Florida panhandle then moved north into Alabama and then east into Georgia. The Carrollton area was hit with tropical storm force winds killing one person when a tree came down into a mobile home. Some area residents were without electricity for almost two weeks.

It was the only county in Virginia to vote for [[William Howard Taft]] during the 1912 election, and the only Democrat to carry the county in a presidential election since 1896 has been [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in 1932.<ref>Menendez, Albert J.; ''The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004'', pp. 323, 326, 329 {{ISBN|0786422173}}</ref> Since 1980 no Democrat has gained forty percent of the county's vote, and [[Hillary Clinton]] even with Virginian [[Timothy Kaine]] on the ticket gained less than twenty percent in the 2016 election. Democratic Senatorial candidate [[Mark Warner]] did however carry Carroll County in his landslide [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 2008|2008 victory]].\n\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential elections results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|date=|website=uselectionatlas.org}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

Managed lanes are by definition a congestion management strategy and have benefits that are only fully realized in the context of frequent traffic congestion that causes significant travel time delays and uncertainty over trip time reliability. Although there is no broadly accepted definition of what constitutes traffic congestion, congestion is generally identified as a breakdown in the flow of traffic and a reduction in vehicle speeds caused by traffic demand approaching or exceeding available roadway capacity. These situations generally correspond to a level of service of D or worse (on a scale A-F, with A being highest) and average travel speeds of 30&nbsp;mph or less, although this does not mean that other scenarios are not suitable for managed lane strategies.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nThe specific characteristics of the traffic demand that exists in a corridor are particularly important when considering managed lane strategies. Traffic demand on urban roadways is typically variable and changes depending on the time of day, day of the week, and by season. It is common for demand in some radial corridors to be highly directional, with demand for facilities leading into a central business district often being highest in the morning peak periods and demand for outbound directions being highest in the afternoon periods. These patterns cause an imbalance of demand that require solutions that are flexible in their ability to accommodate variable and directional traffic volumes. Routes that connect suburban trips may exhibit bi-directional demand and be congested for more prolonged periods, so the selected concept needs to recognize this. Demand may exist for one particular mode, say transit for a radial corridor, and not for another. Each type of demand should be separately analyzed, even if they will share the managed lane facility.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n==Strategies for implementation==\n[[File:Managed lane applications.jpg|thumb|Types of managed lanes grouped by strategy and complexity]]\nStrategies for managing lanes typically fall into one of three categories. These include vehicle eligibility restrictions, access control, and pricing. Most managed lane implementation incorporate the application of multiple management strategies. In the United States, managed lanes are almost always located within the right-of-way of [[limited-access highway|freeways]], often on the left or \"high speed\" side of the mainlanes, but sometimes on the right lane or shoulder lane for short distances. Agencies often combine lane management strategies and applications of various [[intelligent transportation systems]] (ITS) and traffic control devices to address both safety and operation needs. Examples include:<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n*Employing static signing to notify drivers of eligibility to use a dedicated lane and times indicating when restrictions are in place.\n*Utilizing overhead lane control signals and/or changeable message signs to accommodate highly directional demand on reversible or contraflow lanes.\n*Employing access treatment and lane separation strategies to manage the speed differential often associated with managed lanes.\n*Increasing the level of automated and on-site monitoring, enforcement and incident response capability to help assure travel time reliability and safe operations.\n*Implementing variable pricing through electronic tags that vary tolls by time of day or by demand to more efficiently utilize lane capacity.\n\nAlthough managed lanes have traditionally been added as new capacity, the concept does not explicitly require capacity expansion. Instead, the focus of managed lanes is to preserve a reliable trip that is viewed as a preferable alternative over congestion that exists in the general purpose lanes. Therefore, the correct objective for managed lanes is not necessarily congestion relief, but rather, improved management of congestion that provides relief to users and non-users.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nThe rationale of implementation does not suggest that incorporation of managed lanes should be a stand-alone strategy. Indeed, the best applications are ones in which managed lanes are an integral component of a comprehensive congestion management program incorporating an array of other treatments and strategies. These treatments may include [[ramp metering]], incident management, [[traffic demand management]] (TDM) such as [[Peer-to-peer ridesharing|rideshare]] promotion, and associated programs that are both complementary and synergistic to overall regional mobility goals. For example, restricted lanes for buses and carpools only make sense and draw sufficient patronage when parallel programs including transit services, park-and-ride lots and rideshare matching are implemented. Ramp and connector metering offers the opportunity to provide bypass lanes for transit and other rideshare modes to attract demand.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nThe rationale for application is predicated on an understanding of the specific operational problem evidenced and forecasted to exist. The design should not define the operational need, but rather respond to the intended operation and attempt to fit within the specific corridor constraints that are often present. For example, highly directional congestion (i.e., inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening) may be addressed by a variety of different treatments such as concurrent, reversible or contraflow operations, and each will require a different design that may or may not fit within the corridor. The presence of congestion in both directions during the same daily commute may suggest only a bi-directional, concurrent flow operation (e.g., one dedicated lane operating in each direction) is appropriate. Similarly, the specific operational attributes of how many hours the managed lane is active, where access is applied and who can use it are determined in successive levels of evaluating the observed and forecast operational problems.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n==Types of managed lanes==\n\n===Eligibility restrictions===\nOne of the most commonly used lane management tools for the past 40 years is restricting use based on vehicle eligibility. Eligibility can be defined in terms of vehicle type (i.e. buses, trucks, motorcycles, or hybrids) or by the number of occupants in a passenger vehicle, such as two or more (HOV 2+) or three or more (HOV 3+) in a vehicle. The latter definition represents the vast majority of managed lanes found in the US and Canada: HOV lanes.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n====HOV lanes====\n{{main|High-occupancy vehicle lanes}}\nHigh-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes provide preferential treatment for transit, vanpools, carpools, and other designated vehicles by typically dedicating a lane or portion of the roadway for their exclusive use. The primary goal of HOV lanes is to increase the people moving capacity of a corridor and allow for more efficient use of freeways by increasing the number of occupants per vehicle. This is accomplished by providing travel time savings and reliability for high occupancy modes to incentivize carpooling and the use of transit.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nHOV lanes are present on more than 1200 North American freeway route-miles (1900&nbsp;route-kilometers), and are by far the most common form of managed lane. All HOV lanes accommodate buses, and sometimes other vehicles such as motorcycles and hybrids since the combined demand of each of these modes can usually be accommodated by a single lane. The majority of HOV facilities exist as single lanes that are concurrent with adjacent general purpose freeway lanes. Most commonly, HOV lanes are separated from mixed use lanes by a painted stripe or buffer, although some are separated by a physical barrier, either fixed or moveable. Depending on the design, HOV lanes may have continuous access to concurrent flow lanes or traffic may only be able to enter and exit at designated access locations. Some HOV lanes are reversible to serve directional demands at different times of the day; these facilities are separated by a permanent barrier and are accessed via exclusive ramps. Contraflow HOV lanes borrow an off-peak direction lane for peak commute purposes, and they use placement of pylons or moveable barriers to safely segregate oncoming [[traffic flow]].<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nHOV lanes have also been added to highway onramps to bypass [[ramp meter]]s, allowing HOV vehicles and buses to access the highway without queuing for the ramp meter. Such ramp lanes are known as HOV bypass ramps.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n====Bus lanes====\n{{main|Bus lane}}\n[[File:Gyeongbu Expressway Bus Only Lane.JPG|thumb|A dedicated bus lane (HOV&nbsp;9+) on the [[Gyeongbu Expressway]] in [[South Korea]]]]\nBus lanes are lanes exclusively reserved for buses. The term busway is commonly used to refer to facilities that are reserved for exclusive use by buses. A bus-lane, more commonly located on a major arterial or roadway on separate right-of-way, is usually a component of a [[Bus Rapid Transit]] (BRT) system and as a result the terms bus-lane, busway, and BRT are sometimes used synonymously. However, there is a distinction between a lane dedicated to exclusive use by buses and BRT, which may include various operational improvements and station design features to provide high quality service for express bus trips. The type of service may also be substantially different, focused on limited express stops en route or point-to-point nonstop service.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nBus operation needs today are normally addressed and integrated into HOV lanes on freeway corridors that experience high levels of congestion and have high use or potential for bus transit services. The purpose of bus lanes and supporting facilities (e.g., transit stations, park-and-ride lots and direct access treatments) is to provide more reliable bus service by cutting down the delay that buses would have to otherwise incur in congested traffic, thereby increasing service efficiency by allowing more peak trips by the same bus and providing patrons a faster trip. Bus-lanes on freeway corridors are usually shared with HOVs and other designated vehicles since buses generally use little capacity. An example is the I-110 Harbor Transitway that carries buses and HOV-2+ vehicles in the median of the freeway. There are six bus stations along the Transitway that serve many bus routes including a BRT route. Although the Transitway serves all types of HOVs and will soon incorporate solo vehicle pricing, it includes several sections where bus-only lanes and separate roadways into stations for buses exist. Houston has a similar approach to serving express bus transit on reversible HOV lanes and express toll lanes with direct access ramps connecting stations and park-and-ride lots.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n====Truck lanes and lane restrictions====\n{{further|Truck lane restriction|Climbing lane}}\nSeparated roadways for [[truck]]s are uncommon. One example is the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], the northern portion of which features completely separated dual roadways, one reserved for passenger cars only, and the other open to both commercial and non-commercial traffic. Access ramps are provided to both roadways at major interchanges (Figure 12). Light trucks are considered as eligible vehicles on some HOV lanes if they carry the requisite persons. Restricted geometrics on many existing concurrent leftmost median lanes limit opportunities to serve large commercial trucks, and sight distance and other freeway lane prohibitions typically mean these vehicles cannot use leftmost lane treatments unless a separate roadway is provided with a minimum of two travel lanes. There are truck lanes on European motorways leading in and out of the ports in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. In the US, dedicated roadways for trucks are being studied and in at least several cases proposed, but no freeway examples currently exist in the US. Missouri is currently considering using dedicated roadways for trucks on I-70 across the state, and several U.S. port cities are examining truck lanes and roadways. Climbing lanes for trucks typically are built to improve safe operations on grades by separating slow moving heavy vehicles from the rest of traffic.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n[[File:Truck bypass lanes for I-15 and I-405 interchange.jpg|thumb|Truck lanes on [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] to bypass the interchange with [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]] in Southern California]]\nInterchange bypass lanes for trucks have been implemented in Southern California and Portland, Oregon, to improve safety by routing trucks around a major interchange typically containing left hand ramps. This design approach improves the merge condition affecting traffic operations at the interchange. Similar ramp options are provided for trucks on this separate roadway system as are provided for the mainlanes.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nFar more common on US highways are lane restrictions which prohibit trucks from driving in certain lanes of a highway, typically the left-most lane. At least three travel lanes are normally needed to implement truck lane restrictions. Many US states have adopted this type of lane restriction because it promotes a more orderly mix of traffic and thereby improves throughput, increases sight distance in leftmost lanes, generally improves safety, and still permits the orderly movement of trucks.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n===Toll managed lanes===\n{{further|High-occupancy toll lane}}\n[[File:MUTCD R3-48.svg|thumb|Sign for express toll lanes, compliant with the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]]]\nToll managed lanes use tolling, with [[electronic toll collection]], to manage the traffic flow of the managed lane. The most general form of toll managed lanes are ''express toll lanes'' (ETL), which have variable tolls to maintain a higher throughput or speed in the ETL lane compared with the other lanes of the highway. ETLs are essentially access restricted tollroads within the freeway right-of-way that are actively managed to preserve free-flow operating conditions.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/> The tolls are frequently changed to maintain a steady flow of traffic; in some cases, the goal of toll fluctuations is to maintain a minimum speed on the ETLs (e.g. 55&nbsp;mph/85&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://i4ultimate.com/project-info/faqs/|website=I-4 Ultimate|publisher=Florida Department of Transportation|accessdate=7 July 2015|date=2014-07-09}}</ref> As the lanes approach their capacity, tolls are increased to discourage vehicles from entering the ETLs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fortunas|first1=Jennifer|title=Providing Opportunities through Managed Lanes|url=http://www.dot.state.fl.us/trafficoperations/Newsletters/2013/2013-Mar.pdf|website=Florida Department of Transportation|publisher=Florida Department of Transportation--Traffic Engineering and Operations Office|accessdate=7 July 2015|date=March 2013}}</ref>\n\nA common variant of ETLs are [[high-occupancy toll lane|high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes]]. HOT lanes are free for high-occupancy vehicles, while vehicles with fewer passengers pay a toll. Some types of vehicles may be exempt from tolls, such as [[hybrid vehicle]]s (including single-occupant hybrid vehicles in HOT lanes), registered carpools (on ETLs), and motorcycles. Some toll managed lanes may only be tolled at certain times or charge different rates for high-occupancy vehicles.\n\nToll managed lanes are sometimes included in a highway reconstruction project to not only improve traffic, but also to fund the construction project itself (including improvements to existing lanes) through [[public-private partnership]]s (P3). In such highway reconstruction projects, the government transport agency tenders a P3 project in which a private consortium of companies designs, finances, and rebuilds a section of highway after which they are given a concession (e.g. 40 years) to operate the toll managed lanes, receiving fixed payouts from the relevant government transport agency for meeting performance criteria. These payments are used to repay the loans made by the private consortium, which keeps any excess as profit.\n\n===Dynamic lanes===\nThe number and directionality of freeway lanes and shoulders can be dynamically managed to serve variable traffic patterns.\n\n====Reversible and contraflow lanes====\n{{main|Reversible lane|Contraflow lane}}\n[[File:Interstate 279.JPG|thumb|Reversible HOV lanes in the center of [[Interstate 279]] near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]]]\nReversible lanes and contraflow lanes are commonly employed when there is little or no available right-of-way for the width of a highway to be increased. These types of managed lanes increase the highway's capacity in the direction of the flow of these lanes, which is typically the direction of travel of the majority of traffic during peak hours (e.g. into a city center in the morning, out of a city center in afternoons/evenings). Reversible lanes along expressways are typically separated from other traffic lanes by concrete barriers and incorporate multiple gates or barriers to prevent traffic traveling in the opposite direction from entering these lanes. Contraflow lanes are typically one or two lanes on one side of a dual-carriageway on which the direction of travel is reversed during certain hours. Contraflow lanes are generally separated from opposing traffic by plastic pylons or moveable jersey barriers.\n\nA limitation of implementing a reversible flow design is that it cannot serve congestion that may be present in the off-peak traffic direction. If such is the case, then some users, such as deadheading transit buses that need trip reliability to make a second peak direction run during the commute period, will be adversely impacted. All freeway reversible lanes must be separated by \"Jersey\" barriers in a high-speed roadway setting (which is not the case on arterial treatments). They are typically constructed in the median of freeway facilities and may be one, two or more lanes wide. These characteristics have several associated advantages and disadvantages. A facility that changes direction to serve morning and afternoon traffic can be an efficient solution since it allocates capacity specifically to the most congested direction of travel. Reversible lanes offer a much higher guaranteed level of service for transit since side friction from adjacent traffic is removed. Some locales, notably Houston, implemented reversible lanes to address the peak direction alone since width was not available to address both directions of travel. Adapting a reversible flow lane or roadway into a freeway typically requires rebuilding most bridges with center columns. A disadvantage of reversible lanes is the ongoing cost of daily surveillance and lane/ramp reversal activities. These treatments must be designed to prevent wrong way movements, requiring extensive and redundant ITS and traffic control device treatments for each opening, plus a staff compliment who must visually inspect the roadway prior to each opening period. Tolling and enforcement is made easier by the barrier environment in which a single field location can be identified to monitor and/or toll all traffic flow.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n====Use of shoulders====\nThe use of a highway's [[shoulder (road)|shoulder]] during peak hours has been implemented in some locations, both in the US and Europe. The use of shoulders as travel lanes varies in practice, including use by buses only, use as an HOV lane, use for all vehicles, and use as an ETL/HOT lane.\n\nOn [[Massachusetts State Route 3]] and [[Interstate 93|I-93]] and [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area, all vehicles are permitted on shoulders during peak periods only. Similarly, in Virginia on [[Interstate 66 in Virginia|I-66]], the shoulder carries general purpose traffic from 5:30\u201311:00 AM (eastbound) and 2:00\u20138:00 PM (westbound); however, during this time, the interior general purpose lane is open to HOV traffic only. I-66 uses extensive traffic signals and signage in order to communicate the active times of service. In the Seattle area, the right shoulder on the [[U.S. Route 2 in Washington|US 2]] trestle near [[Everett, Washington|Everett]] is opened to all traffic in the eastbound direction during the afternoon peak period. A similar operation is provided on [[Interstate H1|H1]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] in the morning peak on the right shoulder.<ref name=\"FHWA Report Congress\">{{Cite report|url=http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop10023/chap2.htm|title=Efficient Use of Highway Capacity Summary Report to Congress|last=|first=|date=May 2010|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|accessdate=2015-07-07|chapter=Chapter 2: Context and Findings}}</ref>\n\nThe use of freeway right side breakdown shoulders by buses is permitted in several states. The Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area has the most bus-only shoulders in the United States. Early implementations of bus-only use of shoulders in the region were limited to arterial roads, but the concept was soon expanded to freeways after they were shown to be safe and hugely successful. As of 2006, there were {{convert|271|mi}} bus-only shoulders on freeways in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. The [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] has instituted a series of guidelines that govern the use of freeway shoulders by buses. These guidelines allow buses to use the shoulder only when mainline speeds are less than {{convert|35|mph}} and prohibit buses from exceeding the speed of adjacent traffic by more than {{convert|15|mph|abbr=on}}, up to a maximum speed of {{convert|35|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/> A similar law was passed in Colorado in early 2016 for the RTD [[Flatiron Flyer]] bus route on U.S. 36 along the Denver-Boulder corridor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/29/u-s-36-flatiron-flyer-can-drive-on-shoulders/|title=U.S. 36 Flatiron Flyer can drive on shoulders|date=2016-04-29|website=The Denver Post|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Include-USGov\n|agency=[[Federal Highway Administration]] (United States)\n|article=Freeway Management and Operations Handbook (Chapter 8: Managed Lanes; January 2011)\n|url=http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freewaymgmt/publications/frwy_mgmt_handbook/revision/jan2011/mgdlaneschp8/sec8.htm\n|accessdate=2015-07-07}}\n\n{{Include-USGov\n|agency=[[Federal Highway Administration]] (United States)\n|article=Efficient Use of Highway Capacity Summary: Report to Congress (Chapter 2: Context and Findings; May 2010)\n|url=http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freewaymgmt/publications/frwy_mgmt_handbook/revision/jan2011/mgdlaneschp8/sec8.htm\n|accessdate=2015-07-07}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://managed-lanes.tamu.edu/ Managed lanes mini-site] \u2014 Information about managed lanes from [[Texas Transportation Institute]]\n*[http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freewaymgmt/managed_lanes.htm Managed lanes] \u2014 overview and resources from US Federal Highway Administration\n\n{{Road types}}\n\n[[Category:Road traffic management]]\n[[Category:Road infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Sustainable transport]]\n[[Category:Intelligent transportation systems]]\n[[Category:Road congestion charge schemes]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:404HOV lane.png|thumb|An HOV lane on [[Ontario Highway 404]] incentivizes higher-occupancy vehicles by providing a quicker commute during peak hours]]\nA '''managed lane''' is a type of highway [[lane]] that is operated with a [[traffic management|management scheme]], such as lane use restrictions or [[road pricing|variable tolling]], to [[traffic optimization|optimize traffic flow]], vehicle throughput, or both.

These include vehicle eligibility restrictions, access control, and pricing. Most managed lane implementation incorporate the application of multiple management strategies. In the United States, managed lanes are almost always located within the right-of-way of [[limited-access highway|freeways]], often on the left or \"high speed\" side of the mainlanes, but sometimes on the right lane or shoulder lane for short distances. Agencies often combine lane management strategies and applications of various [[intelligent transportation systems]] (ITS) and traffic control devices to address both safety and operation needs. Examples include:<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n*Employing static signing to notify drivers of eligibility to use a dedicated lane and times indicating when restrictions are in place.\n*Utilizing overhead lane control signals and/or changeable message signs to accommodate highly directional demand on reversible or contraflow lanes.\n*Employing access treatment and lane separation strategies to manage the speed differential often associated with managed lanes.\n*Increasing the level of automated and on-site monitoring, enforcement and incident response capability to help assure travel time reliability and safe operations.\n*Implementing variable pricing through electronic tags that vary tolls by time of day or by demand to more efficiently utilize lane capacity.\n\nAlthough managed lanes have traditionally been added as new capacity, the concept does not explicitly require capacity expansion. Instead, the focus of managed lanes is to preserve a reliable trip that is viewed as a preferable alternative over congestion that exists in the general purpose lanes. Therefore, the correct objective for managed lanes is not necessarily congestion relief, but rather, improved management of congestion that provides relief to users and non-users.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nThe rationale of implementation does not suggest that incorporation of managed lanes should be a stand-alone strategy. Indeed, the best applications are ones in which managed lanes are an integral component of a comprehensive congestion management program incorporating an array of other treatments and strategies. These treatments may include [[ramp metering]], incident management, [[traffic demand management]] (TDM) such as [[Peer-to-peer ridesharing|rideshare]] promotion, and associated programs that are both complementary and synergistic to overall regional mobility goals. For example, restricted lanes for buses and carpools only make sense and draw sufficient patronage when parallel programs including transit services, park-and-ride lots and rideshare matching are implemented. Ramp and connector metering offers the opportunity to provide bypass lanes for transit and other rideshare modes to attract demand.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nThe rationale for application is predicated on an understanding of the specific operational problem evidenced and forecasted to exist. The design should not define the operational need, but rather respond to the intended operation and attempt to fit within the specific corridor constraints that are often present. For example, highly directional congestion (i.e., inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening) may be addressed by a variety of different treatments such as concurrent, reversible or contraflow operations, and each will require a different design that may or may not fit within the corridor. The presence of congestion in both directions during the same daily commute may suggest only a bi-directional, concurrent flow operation (e.g., one dedicated lane operating in each direction) is appropriate. Similarly, the specific operational attributes of how many hours the managed lane is active, where access is applied and who can use it are determined in successive levels of evaluating the observed and forecast operational problems.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n==Types of managed lanes==\n\n===Eligibility restrictions===\nOne of the most commonly used lane management tools for the past 40 years is restricting use based on vehicle eligibility. Eligibility can be defined in terms of vehicle type (i.e. buses, trucks, motorcycles, or hybrids) or by the number of occupants in a passenger vehicle, such as two or more (HOV 2+) or three or more (HOV 3+) in a vehicle. The latter definition represents the vast majority of managed lanes found in the US and Canada: HOV lanes.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n====HOV lanes====\n{{main|High-occupancy vehicle lanes}}\nHigh-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes provide preferential treatment for transit, vanpools, carpools, and other designated vehicles by typically dedicating a lane or portion of the roadway for their exclusive use. The primary goal of HOV lanes is to increase the people moving capacity of a corridor and allow for more efficient use of freeways by increasing the number of occupants per vehicle. This is accomplished by providing travel time savings and reliability for high occupancy modes to incentivize carpooling and the use of transit.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nHOV lanes are present on more than 1200 North American freeway route-miles (1900&nbsp;route-kilometers), and are by far the most common form of managed lane. All HOV lanes accommodate buses, and sometimes other vehicles such as motorcycles and hybrids since the combined demand of each of these modes can usually be accommodated by a single lane. The majority of HOV facilities exist as single lanes that are concurrent with adjacent general purpose freeway lanes. Most commonly, HOV lanes are separated from mixed use lanes by a painted stripe or buffer, although some are separated by a physical barrier, either fixed or moveable. Depending on the design, HOV lanes may have continuous access to concurrent flow lanes or traffic may only be able to enter and exit at designated access locations. Some HOV lanes are reversible to serve directional demands at different times of the day; these facilities are separated by a permanent barrier and are accessed via exclusive ramps. Contraflow HOV lanes borrow an off-peak direction lane for peak commute purposes, and they use placement of pylons or moveable barriers to safely segregate oncoming [[traffic flow]].<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nHOV lanes have also been added to highway onramps to bypass [[ramp meter]]s, allowing HOV vehicles and buses to access the highway without queuing for the ramp meter. Such ramp lanes are known as HOV bypass ramps.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n====Bus lanes====\n{{main|Bus lane}}\n[[File:Gyeongbu Expressway Bus Only Lane.JPG|thumb|A dedicated bus lane (HOV&nbsp;9+) on the [[Gyeongbu Expressway]] in [[South Korea]]]]\nBus lanes are lanes exclusively reserved for buses. The term busway is commonly used to refer to facilities that are reserved for exclusive use by buses. A bus-lane, more commonly located on a major arterial or roadway on separate right-of-way, is usually a component of a [[Bus Rapid Transit]] (BRT) system and as a result the terms bus-lane, busway, and BRT are sometimes used synonymously. However, there is a distinction between a lane dedicated to exclusive use by buses and BRT, which may include various operational improvements and station design features to provide high quality service for express bus trips. The type of service may also be substantially different, focused on limited express stops en route or point-to-point nonstop service.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nBus operation needs today are normally addressed and integrated into HOV lanes on freeway corridors that experience high levels of congestion and have high use or potential for bus transit services. The purpose of bus lanes and supporting facilities (e.g., transit stations, park-and-ride lots and direct access treatments) is to provide more reliable bus service by cutting down the delay that buses would have to otherwise incur in congested traffic, thereby increasing service efficiency by allowing more peak trips by the same bus and providing patrons a faster trip. Bus-lanes on freeway corridors are usually shared with HOVs and other designated vehicles since buses generally use little capacity. An example is the I-110 Harbor Transitway that carries buses and HOV-2+ vehicles in the median of the freeway. There are six bus stations along the Transitway that serve many bus routes including a BRT route. Although the Transitway serves all types of HOVs and will soon incorporate solo vehicle pricing, it includes several sections where bus-only lanes and separate roadways into stations for buses exist. Houston has a similar approach to serving express bus transit on reversible HOV lanes and express toll lanes with direct access ramps connecting stations and park-and-ride lots.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n====Truck lanes and lane restrictions====\n{{further|Truck lane restriction|Climbing lane}}\nSeparated roadways for [[truck]]s are uncommon. One example is the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], the northern portion of which features completely separated dual roadways, one reserved for passenger cars only, and the other open to both commercial and non-commercial traffic. Access ramps are provided to both roadways at major interchanges (Figure 12). Light trucks are considered as eligible vehicles on some HOV lanes if they carry the requisite persons. Restricted geometrics on many existing concurrent leftmost median lanes limit opportunities to serve large commercial trucks, and sight distance and other freeway lane prohibitions typically mean these vehicles cannot use leftmost lane treatments unless a separate roadway is provided with a minimum of two travel lanes. There are truck lanes on European motorways leading in and out of the ports in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. In the US, dedicated roadways for trucks are being studied and in at least several cases proposed, but no freeway examples currently exist in the US. Missouri is currently considering using dedicated roadways for trucks on I-70 across the state, and several U.S. port cities are examining truck lanes and roadways. Climbing lanes for trucks typically are built to improve safe operations on grades by separating slow moving heavy vehicles from the rest of traffic.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n[[File:Truck bypass lanes for I-15 and I-405 interchange.jpg|thumb|Truck lanes on [[Interstate 15 in California|Interstate 15]] to bypass the interchange with [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]] in Southern California]]\nInterchange bypass lanes for trucks have been implemented in Southern California and Portland, Oregon, to improve safety by routing trucks around a major interchange typically containing left hand ramps. This design approach improves the merge condition affecting traffic operations at the interchange. Similar ramp options are provided for trucks on this separate roadway system as are provided for the mainlanes.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\nFar more common on US highways are lane restrictions which prohibit trucks from driving in certain lanes of a highway, typically the left-most lane. At least three travel lanes are normally needed to implement truck lane restrictions. Many US states have adopted this type of lane restriction because it promotes a more orderly mix of traffic and thereby improves throughput, increases sight distance in leftmost lanes, generally improves safety, and still permits the orderly movement of trucks.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n===Toll managed lanes===\n{{further|High-occupancy toll lane}}\n[[File:MUTCD R3-48.svg|thumb|Sign for express toll lanes, compliant with the [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]]]\nToll managed lanes use tolling, with [[electronic toll collection]], to manage the traffic flow of the managed lane. The most general form of toll managed lanes are ''express toll lanes'' (ETL), which have variable tolls to maintain a higher throughput or speed in the ETL lane compared with the other lanes of the highway. ETLs are essentially access restricted tollroads within the freeway right-of-way that are actively managed to preserve free-flow operating conditions.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/> The tolls are frequently changed to maintain a steady flow of traffic; in some cases, the goal of toll fluctuations is to maintain a minimum speed on the ETLs (e.g. 55&nbsp;mph/85&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://i4ultimate.com/project-info/faqs/|website=I-4 Ultimate|publisher=Florida Department of Transportation|accessdate=7 July 2015|date=2014-07-09}}</ref> As the lanes approach their capacity, tolls are increased to discourage vehicles from entering the ETLs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fortunas|first1=Jennifer|title=Providing Opportunities through Managed Lanes|url=http://www.dot.state.fl.us/trafficoperations/Newsletters/2013/2013-Mar.pdf|website=Florida Department of Transportation|publisher=Florida Department of Transportation--Traffic Engineering and Operations Office|accessdate=7 July 2015|date=March 2013}}</ref>\n\nA common variant of ETLs are [[high-occupancy toll lane|high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes]]. HOT lanes are free for high-occupancy vehicles, while vehicles with fewer passengers pay a toll. Some types of vehicles may be exempt from tolls, such as [[hybrid vehicle]]s (including single-occupant hybrid vehicles in HOT lanes), registered carpools (on ETLs), and motorcycles. Some toll managed lanes may only be tolled at certain times or charge different rates for high-occupancy vehicles.\n\nToll managed lanes are sometimes included in a highway reconstruction project to not only improve traffic, but also to fund the construction project itself (including improvements to existing lanes) through [[public-private partnership]]s (P3). In such highway reconstruction projects, the government transport agency tenders a P3 project in which a private consortium of companies designs, finances, and rebuilds a section of highway after which they are given a concession (e.g. 40 years) to operate the toll managed lanes, receiving fixed payouts from the relevant government transport agency for meeting performance criteria. These payments are used to repay the loans made by the private consortium, which keeps any excess as profit.\n\n===Dynamic lanes===\nThe number and directionality of freeway lanes and shoulders can be dynamically managed to serve variable traffic patterns.\n\n====Reversible and contraflow lanes====\n{{main|Reversible lane|Contraflow lane}}\n[[File:Interstate 279.JPG|thumb|Reversible HOV lanes in the center of [[Interstate 279]] near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]]]\nReversible lanes and contraflow lanes are commonly employed when there is little or no available right-of-way for the width of a highway to be increased. These types of managed lanes increase the highway's capacity in the direction of the flow of these lanes, which is typically the direction of travel of the majority of traffic during peak hours (e.g. into a city center in the morning, out of a city center in afternoons/evenings). Reversible lanes along expressways are typically separated from other traffic lanes by concrete barriers and incorporate multiple gates or barriers to prevent traffic traveling in the opposite direction from entering these lanes. Contraflow lanes are typically one or two lanes on one side of a dual-carriageway on which the direction of travel is reversed during certain hours. Contraflow lanes are generally separated from opposing traffic by plastic pylons or moveable jersey barriers.\n\nA limitation of implementing a reversible flow design is that it cannot serve congestion that may be present in the off-peak traffic direction. If such is the case, then some users, such as deadheading transit buses that need trip reliability to make a second peak direction run during the commute period, will be adversely impacted. All freeway reversible lanes must be separated by \"Jersey\" barriers in a high-speed roadway setting (which is not the case on arterial treatments). They are typically constructed in the median of freeway facilities and may be one, two or more lanes wide. These characteristics have several associated advantages and disadvantages. A facility that changes direction to serve morning and afternoon traffic can be an efficient solution since it allocates capacity specifically to the most congested direction of travel. Reversible lanes offer a much higher guaranteed level of service for transit since side friction from adjacent traffic is removed. Some locales, notably Houston, implemented reversible lanes to address the peak direction alone since width was not available to address both directions of travel. Adapting a reversible flow lane or roadway into a freeway typically requires rebuilding most bridges with center columns. A disadvantage of reversible lanes is the ongoing cost of daily surveillance and lane/ramp reversal activities. These treatments must be designed to prevent wrong way movements, requiring extensive and redundant ITS and traffic control device treatments for each opening, plus a staff compliment who must visually inspect the roadway prior to each opening period. Tolling and enforcement is made easier by the barrier environment in which a single field location can be identified to monitor and/or toll all traffic flow.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/>\n\n====Use of shoulders====\nThe use of a highway's [[shoulder (road)|shoulder]] during peak hours has been implemented in some locations, both in the US and Europe. The use of shoulders as travel lanes varies in practice, including use by buses only, use as an HOV lane, use for all vehicles, and use as an ETL/HOT lane.\n\nOn [[Massachusetts State Route 3]] and [[Interstate 93|I-93]] and [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area, all vehicles are permitted on shoulders during peak periods only. Similarly, in Virginia on [[Interstate 66 in Virginia|I-66]], the shoulder carries general purpose traffic from 5:30\u201311:00 AM (eastbound) and 2:00\u20138:00 PM (westbound); however, during this time, the interior general purpose lane is open to HOV traffic only. I-66 uses extensive traffic signals and signage in order to communicate the active times of service. In the Seattle area, the right shoulder on the [[U.S. Route 2 in Washington|US 2]] trestle near [[Everett, Washington|Everett]] is opened to all traffic in the eastbound direction during the afternoon peak period. A similar operation is provided on [[Interstate H1|H1]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] in the morning peak on the right shoulder.<ref name=\"FHWA Report Congress\">{{Cite report|url=http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop10023/chap2.htm|title=Efficient Use of Highway Capacity Summary Report to Congress|last=|first=|date=May 2010|publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]]|issue=|doi=|volume=|pmid=|accessdate=2015-07-07|chapter=Chapter 2: Context and Findings}}</ref>\n\nThe use of freeway right side breakdown shoulders by buses is permitted in several states. The Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area has the most bus-only shoulders in the United States. Early implementations of bus-only use of shoulders in the region were limited to arterial roads, but the concept was soon expanded to freeways after they were shown to be safe and hugely successful. As of 2006, there were {{convert|271|mi}} bus-only shoulders on freeways in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area. The [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] has instituted a series of guidelines that govern the use of freeway shoulders by buses. These guidelines allow buses to use the shoulder only when mainline speeds are less than {{convert|35|mph}} and prohibit buses from exceeding the speed of adjacent traffic by more than {{convert|15|mph|abbr=on}}, up to a maximum speed of {{convert|35|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"FHWA: Handbook 2011\"/> A similar law was passed in Colorado in early 2016 for the RTD [[Flatiron Flyer]] bus route on U.S. 36 along the Denver-Boulder corridor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/29/u-s-36-flatiron-flyer-can-drive-on-shoulders/|title=U.S. 36 Flatiron Flyer can drive on shoulders|date=2016-04-29|website=The Denver Post|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Include-USGov\n|agency=[[Federal Highway Administration]] (United States)\n|article=Freeway Management and Operations Handbook (Chapter 8: Managed Lanes; January 2011)\n|url=http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freewaymgmt/publications/frwy_mgmt_handbook/revision/jan2011/mgdlaneschp8/sec8.htm\n|accessdate=2015-07-07}}\n\n{{Include-USGov\n|agency=[[Federal Highway Administration]] (United States)\n|article=Efficient Use of Highway Capacity Summary: Report to Congress (Chapter 2: Context and Findings; May 2010)\n|url=http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freewaymgmt/publications/frwy_mgmt_handbook/revision/jan2011/mgdlaneschp8/sec8.htm\n|accessdate=2015-07-07}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://managed-lanes.tamu.edu/ Managed lanes mini-site] \u2014 Information about managed lanes from [[Texas Transportation Institute]]\n*[http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freewaymgmt/managed_lanes.htm Managed lanes] \u2014 overview and resources from US Federal Highway Administration\n\n{{Road types}}\n\n[[Category:Road traffic management]]\n[[Category:Road infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Sustainable transport]]\n[[Category:Intelligent transportation systems]]\n[[Category:Road congestion charge schemes]]\n", "name_user": "Hack1119", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTruck lanes and lane restrictions:I-15 doesn't intersect I-405", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_lane"}

Most [[Developed country|developed countries]] do not allow a deduction for interest on personal loans, so countries that allow a home mortgage interest deduction have created an exception to those rules. The [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[United States]] each allow the full deduction. In [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], and [[Ireland]], only a minor part of mortgage interest is deductible.\n\n== Status in countries ==\n\n=== Canada ===\nCanadian federal income tax does not allow a deduction from taxable income for interest on loans secured by the taxpayer's personal residence, but homes used in businesses as a landlord who owns a rental residential property can deduct interest as any other reasonable business expense. The difference being the deduction is allowed only when the property is not used for the taxpayer's personal use but is used as in any other type of business.<ref>https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tax-resources/tax-deductions/is-interest-deductible.jsp</ref> However, there may be additional exclusions for [[passive activity]] losses.\n\nAn indirect method, known as the Smith Manoeuvre, for making interest on mortgage for personal residence tax deductible in Canada is through an asset swap, whereby the homebuyer sells his existing investments, purchases a house in full or in part by the sale, gets a mortgage on the house, and finally, buys back his investments with the money from the mortgage.<ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/mortgages-and-rates/the-smith-maneuver-a-canadian-mortgage-tax-deductible-plan/article12059456/</ref> The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled in 2001 in the Singleton v.

In 1987 it was 73%. In 1993 it was 50% and in 1998 it was 46%. From 1998 to 2001 it was reduced to 32%. It is the plan that in 2019 it will be 25,5%.\n\n=== France ===\nFrance does not allow a home mortgage interest deduction.

The deduction is available only when the construction is complete or you have possession of the property. Interest of pre-construction period is deductible in five equal installments. The first installment is deductible in the year in which construction of property is completed or property acquired.

The total cost of the deduction will fall from $59.9 billion to $25 billion\u2014a drop of about 58 percent.* }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, there are additional tax incentives for home ownership.  For example, taxpayers are allowed an exclusion of up to $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of real property if the owner used it as primary residence for two of the five years before the date of sale.  Economists have demonstrated that high-cost high-income areas receive most of the tax benefit.  For example, [[San Francisco, California]] receives $26,385 per home while [[El Paso, Texas]] receives $2,153 per home, a 1,225% difference.<ref>See Table 4 in {{cite journal |first=Todd |last=Sinai |first2=Joseph |last2=Gyourko |year=2004 |title=The (Un)changing Geographical Distribution of Housing Tax Benefits: 1980\u20132000 |journal=Tax Policy and the Economy |volume=18 |pages=175\u2013208 |doi=10.1086/tpe.18.20061889 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1057&context=real-estate_papers }}</ref> The five highest income metros receive 87% of tax inflows, with over half going into California alone.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gyourko |first=Joseph |first2=Todd |last2=Sinai |title=The Spatial Distribution of Housing\u2010Related Ordinary Income Tax Benefits |journal=Real Estate Economics |volume=31 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=527\u2013575 |doi=10.1046/j.1080-8620.2003.00076.x |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/real-estate_papers/44 }}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\n\nThe standard justification for the deduction is that it gives an [[incentive]] for home ownership,<ref name=Lowenstein2006/> but most economists believe the deduction is bad policy and is counterproductive.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matthews |first1=Dylan |title=America\u2019s biggest housing program is run by the IRS, and it\u2019s a huge giveaway to rich people |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/11/9901144/mortgage-interest-deduction |website=Vox |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> They note that it increases inequality, is an unnecessary market distortion, and contributes to housing unaffordability.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Casselman |first1=Ben |title=The Tax Deductions Economists Hate |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-tax-deductions-economists-hate/ |website=FiveThirtyEight |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Association of Realtors]] strongly opposes eliminating the mortgage interest deduction, claiming, \"Housing is the engine that drives the economy, and to even mention reducing the tax benefits of home ownership could endanger property values.
