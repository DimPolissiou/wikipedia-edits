It was written by Winwood and [[Will Jennings]] and produced by [[Russ Titelman]] and Winwood. The female vocals on the song were performed by [[Chaka Khan]], who also appeared in the promotional music video.\n\n\"Higher Love\" was Winwood's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hit, topping the chart for one week. It was preceded by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\" and followed by \"[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)|Venus]]\" by [[Bananarama]]. The song also spent four weeks atop the US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Album Rock Tracks]] chart and earned two [[Grammy Award]]s, for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. It also peaked at number 13 in the United Kingdom, Winwood's highest charting solo hit there, and reached number one in Canada for a week.\n\n[[Whitney Houston]] covered the song in 1990 and it was included as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of her third studio album ''[[I'm Your Baby Tonight]]''. [[Nick Jonas]] recorded the song for his 2005 debut solo album ''[[Nicholas Jonas (album)|Nicholas Jonas]]''. [[James Vincent McMorrow]] covered the song in 2011, on his first album \"Early in the Morning\". In June 2019, Norwegian DJ [[Kygo]] reworked Houston's cover into a [[tropical house]] track and it was released as a single worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/whitney-houstons-first-posthumous-release-in-seven-years-announced-as-kygo-collaboration-higher-love__26740/|title=Whitney Houston's first posthumous release in seven years announced as Kygo collaboration Higher Love|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|last=White|first=Jack|date=27 June 2019|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref> and on August 21, 2019, their version hit number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's Dance Club Songs chart, making it Houston's highest-charting posthumous release to date.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]], which uses the shorter single version, was shot in June 1986 by directors [[Peter Kagan]] and [[Paula Greif]]. The same duo shot an almost identical video for [[Duran Duran]]'s \"[[Notorious (Duran Duran song)|Notorious]]\" in November of that year; coincidentally, both videos were nominated for several awards at the 1987 [[MTV Video Music Award]]s though neither won.

It is also Houston's first posthumous top 10 hit. She had last reached the top ten with the number five hit \"[[Million Dollar Bill]]\" in October 2009. Therefore, \"Higher Love\" became her highest-charting single in the UK since 1999 when \"[[My Love Is Your Love (song)|My Love Is Your Love]]\" peaked at number two. In Scotland, the song peaked at number one. \n\nSince its release, \"Higher Love\" has reached the top five in Croatia, Flanders, Ireland, Israel, Latvia, Norway, Slovakia, and Slovenia, plus the top ten in the Netherlands, Hungary, Sweden and Switzerland.

They are impressed to see a 1980s [[aerobics]] class led by an instructor played by Canadian actress [[Vanessa Morgan]]. After initially being shooed away, the male lead walks into the room and suddenly wears a 1980s aerobics outfit. He starts dancing with the female lead and is eventually joined by his male companions. The video has brief snippets of Whitney Houston's \"[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody]]\" music video showing on a TV along with posters of her from the 1987 ''[[Whitney (album)|Whitney]]'' album on the wall. In the end, the instructor is accidentally kicked in the face by one of the dancers and wakes up in a present-day restaurant, revealing that the 1980s aerobics class was just a dream and that the male lead is actually the waiter at the restaurant she's in.\n\n===Personnel===\n* Whitney Houston \u2013 lead vocals, backing vocals/arrangement, vocal production\n* Narada Michael Walden \u2013 backing vocals arrangement, producer, arranger\n* Kygo \u2013 producer, remixer, arranger\n* Claytoven Richardson, Cynthia Shiloh, Greg \"Gigi\" Gonaway, Jeanie Tracy, Larry Batiste<br>Raz Kennedy, Skyler Jett, Sylvester Jackson, Tina Thompson, Renee Cattaneo \u2013 backing vocals\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Winwood|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/280672/steve-winwood/chart}}</ref> It was the first single released from his fourth solo LP, ''[[Back in the High Life]]''. It was written by Winwood and [[Will Jennings]] and produced by [[Russ Titelman]] and Winwood. The female vocals on the song were performed by [[Chaka Khan]], who also appeared in the promotional music video.\n\n\"Higher Love\" was Winwood's first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hit, topping the chart for one week. It was preceded by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"[[Papa Don't Preach]]\" and followed by \"[[Venus (Shocking Blue song)|Venus]]\" by [[Bananarama]]. The song also spent four weeks atop the US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Album Rock Tracks]] chart and earned two [[Grammy Award]]s, for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. It also peaked at number 13 in the United Kingdom, Winwood's highest charting solo hit there, and reached number one in Canada for a week.\n\n[[Whitney Houston]] covered the song in 1990 and it was included as a bonus track on the Japanese edition of her third studio album ''[[I'm Your Baby Tonight]]''. [[Nick Jonas]] recorded the song for his 2005 debut solo album ''[[Nicholas Jonas (album)|Nicholas Jonas]]''. [[James Vincent McMorrow]] covered the song in 2011, on his first album \"Early in the Morning\". In June 2019, Norwegian DJ [[Kygo]] reworked Houston's cover into a [[tropical house]] track and it was released as a single worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/whitney-houstons-first-posthumous-release-in-seven-years-announced-as-kygo-collaboration-higher-love__26740/|title=Whitney Houston's first posthumous release in seven years announced as Kygo collaboration Higher Love|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|last=White|first=Jack|date=27 June 2019|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref> and on August 21, 2019, their version hit number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's Dance Club Songs chart, making it Houston's highest-charting posthumous release to date.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]], which uses the shorter single version, was shot in June 1986 by directors [[Peter Kagan]] and [[Paula Greif]].

The song was released to [[streaming media|streaming]] and [[music download|digital download]] formats on 28 June 2019 by the label [[RCA Records]]. The song marks Houston's first posthumous release in two and a half years, following the song \"[[Memories (Hugh Hopper song)#Siti Nurhaliza and Whitney Houston version|Memories]]\", which was released as a duet with Malaysian singer [[Siti Nurhaliza]] in December 2016.\n\nHouston's cover of the Winwood track was originally featured on the Japanese edition of her third studio album, ''[[I'm Your Baby Tonight]]'' (1990). This version of the track was produced by American musician [[Narada Michael Walden]], and therefore Walden is credited as a producer of \"Higher Love\" alongside Kygo.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/whitney-houstons-first-posthumous-release-in-seven-years-announced-as-kygo-collaboration-higher-love__26740/ | title=Whitney Houston's first posthumous release in seven years announced as Kygo collaboration Higher Love | date=27 June 2019 | publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] | accessdate=27 June 2019 | author=White, Jack}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.vg.no/rampelys/musikk/i/kJBeJk/kygo-whitney-houston-er-sant | title=Kygo + Whitney Houston er sant! | work=[[Verdens Gang|VG]] | date=26 June 2019 | accessdate=27 June 2019 | author=\u00d8stb\u00f8, Stein | language=Norwegian}}</ref> Houston performed her rendition of \"Higher Love\" at the 14 dates of her 1990 [[Feels So Right Tour]] in Japan.\n\nIn the UK, \"Higher Love\" was a commercial success, surpassing the Winwood version in terms of chart performance. It peaked at number two in the [[UK Singles Chart]], making it Kygo's third top ten hit and first top five hit there, and Houston's eighteenth top ten hit. It is also Houston's first posthumous top 10 hit. She had last reached the top ten with the number five hit \"[[Million Dollar Bill]]\" in October 2009. Therefore, \"Higher Love\" became her highest-charting single in the UK since 1999 when \"[[My Love Is Your Love (song)|My Love Is Your Love]]\" peaked at number two. In Scotland, the song peaked at number one. \n\nSince its release, \"Higher Love\" has reached the top five in Croatia, Flanders, Ireland, Israel, Latvia, Norway, Slovakia, and Slovenia, plus the top ten in the Netherlands, Hungary, Sweden and Switzerland. It also hit the top twenty charts in Australia, Austria, China, Czech Republic and Wallonia. In the U.S., \"Higher Love\" debuted at number 63 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, with 6.6 million US streams in its first week<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8518917/whitney-houston-first-hot-100-debut-10-years-kygo-higher-love|title=Whitney Houston Earns First Hot 100 Debut in 10 Years With Kygo Collab 'Higher Love'|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>; it was also its peak position.

They are impressed to see a 1980s [[aerobics]] class led by an instructor played by Canadian actress [[Vanessa Morgan]]. After initially being shooed away, the male lead walks into the room and suddenly wears a 1980s aerobics outfit. He starts dancing with the female lead and is eventually joined by his male companions. The video has brief snippets of Whitney Houston's \"[[I Wanna Dance with Somebody]]\" music video showing on a TV along with posters of her from the 1987 ''[[Whitney (album)|Whitney]]'' album on the wall. In the end, the instructor is accidentally kicked in the face by one of the dancers and wakes up in a present-day restaurant, revealing that the 1980s aerobics class was just a dream and that the male lead is actually the waiter at the restaurant she's in.\n\n===Personnel===\n* Whitney Houston \u2013 lead vocals, backing vocals/arrangement, vocal production\n* Narada Michael Walden \u2013 backing vocals arrangement, producer, arranger\n* Kygo \u2013 producer, remixer, arranger\n* Claytoven Richardson, Cynthia Shiloh, Greg \"Gigi\" Gonaway, Jeanie Tracy, Larry Batiste<br>Raz Kennedy, Skyler Jett, Sylvester Jackson, Tina Thompson, Renee Cattaneo \u2013 backing vocals\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It is a style guide for the use of [[physical quantities]] and units of [[measurement]], formulas involving them, and their corresponding units, in scientific and educational documents for worldwide use. In most countries, the notations used in mathematics and science textbooks at schools and universities follow closely the guidelines in this standard.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe ISO/IEC 80000 family of standards was completed with the publication of Part 1 in November 2009.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=46202 Standards Catalogue TC/12 Quantities and Units]</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nIn 2019, ISO/IEC 80000 comprises 13 parts, two of which (parts 6 and 13) were developed by IEC.

Units that form part of the standard but not the SI include the units of information storage ([[bit]] and [[byte]]), units of entropy ([[shannon (unit)|shannon]], [[nat (unit)|natural unit of information]] and [[hartley (unit)|hartley]]), the [[Erlang (unit)|erlang]] (a unit of traffic intensity) and units of level ([[neper]] and [[decibel]]).  The standard includes all [[SI prefix]]es as well as the [[binary prefix]]es kibi-, mebi-, gibi-, etc., originally introduced by the [[IEC 60027-2|International Electrotechnical Commission]] to standardise binary multiples of byte such as [[mebibyte]] (MiB), for {{val|1024}}<sup>2</sup> bytes, to distinguish them from their decimal counterparts such as megabyte (MB), for precisely one million ({{val|1000}}<sup>2</sup>) bytes.  In the standard, the application of the binary prefixes is not limited to units of information storage.  For example, a frequency ten octaves above one hertz, i.e., 2<sup>10</sup> Hz ({{val|1024|u=Hz}}), is one kibihertz (1 KiHz).\n\nThese [[binary prefix]]es were standardized first in a 1999 addendum to [[IEC 60027|IEC 60027-2]].\nThe harmonized IEC 80000-13:2008 standard cancels and replaces subclauses 3.8 and 3.9 of IEC 60027-2:2005, which had defined the prefixes for binary multiples. The only significant change in IEC 80000-13 is the addition of explicit definitions for some quantities.\n\n==See also==\n*[[International vocabulary of metrology|International Vocabulary of Metrology]]\n*[[SI|International System of Units]]\n*[[BIPM]]&nbsp;\u2013 publishes freely available information on SI units\n*[[NIST]]&nbsp;\u2013 official U.S. representative for SI; publishes freely available guide to use of SI\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/ BIPM SI Brochure]\n*[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=46202 ISO TC12 standards]&nbsp;\u2013 Quantities, units, symbols, conversion factors\n*[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/contents.html NIST Special Publication 330]&nbsp;\u2013 The International System of Units\n*[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/contents.html NIST Special Publication 811]&nbsp;\u2013 Guide for the Use of the International System  of Units\n\n{{ISO standards}}\n{{List of International Electrotechnical Commission standards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:ISO IEC 80000}}\n[[Category:Physical quantities|+]]\n[[Category:Measurement]]\n[[Category:ISO/IEC standards|#80000]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=November 2013}}\n'''ISO 80000''' or '''IEC 80000''' is an [[international standard]] promulgated jointly by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]  (IEC).\n\nThe standard introduces the [[International System of Quantities]] (ISQ).

For example, a frequency ten octaves above one hertz, i.e., 2<sup>10</sup> Hz ({{val|1024|u=Hz}}), is one kibihertz (1 KiHz).\n\nThese [[binary prefix]]es were standardized first in a 1999 addendum to [[IEC 60027|IEC 60027-2]].\nThe harmonized IEC 80000-13:2008 standard cancels and replaces subclauses 3.8 and 3.9 of IEC 60027-2:2005, which had defined the prefixes for binary multiples. The only significant change in IEC 80000-13 is the addition of explicit definitions for some quantities.\n\n==See also==\n*[[International vocabulary of metrology|International Vocabulary of Metrology]]\n*[[SI|International System of Units]]\n*[[BIPM]]&nbsp;\u2013 publishes freely available information on SI units\n*[[NIST]]&nbsp;\u2013 official U.S. representative for SI; publishes freely available guide to use of SI\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/ BIPM SI Brochure]\n*[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_tc_browse.htm?commid=46202 ISO TC12 standards]&nbsp;\u2013 Quantities, units, symbols, conversion factors\n*[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/contents.html NIST Special Publication 330]&nbsp;\u2013 The International System of Units\n*[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/contents.html NIST Special Publication 811]&nbsp;\u2013 Guide for the Use of the International System  of Units\n\n{{ISO standards}}\n{{List of International Electrotechnical Commission standards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:ISO IEC 80000}}\n[[Category:Physical quantities|+]]\n[[Category:Measurement]]\n[[Category:ISO/IEC standards|#80000]]\n", "name_user": "Dondervogel 2", "label": "safe", "comment": "also developed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_80000"}
