The filming took place during the summer of 1973, during three nights of concerts at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, with additional footage shot at [[Shepperton Studios]]. The film premiered three years later on 20 October 1976 at Cinema I in New York, on 22 October 1976 at Fox Wilshire in Los Angeles, and at Warner West End Cinema in London two weeks later.<ref name=\"Welch2\">Chris Welch (1994) ''Led Zeppelin'', London: Orion Books. {{ISBN|1-85797-930-3}}, pp. 68-69, 83.</ref> It was accompanied by [[The Song Remains the Same (album)|a soundtrack album of the same name]]. The DVD of the film was released on 31 December 1999.\n\nPromotional materials stated that the film was \"the band's special way of giving their millions of friends what they had been clamouring for&nbsp;\u2013 a personal and private tour of Led Zeppelin. For the first time the world has a front row seat on Led Zeppelin.\"\n\nA reissue of the film, including previously unreleased footage as a bonus, was released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc on 20 November 2007, by [[Warner Home Video]].<ref name=\"fall-releases\">[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1050472/led-zeppelin-readies-fall-reissue-bonanza Led Zeppelin Readies Fall Reissue Bonanza]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSince late 1969, Led Zeppelin had been planning on filming one of their live performances for a projected movie documentary of the band. The group's manager, [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], believed that they would be better served by the big screen than by television, because he regarded the sound quality of the latter as unsatisfactory. The first attempt was the filming (by Peter Whitehead and [[Stanley Dorfman]]) of Led Zeppelin's [[Royal Albert Hall]] performance on 9 January 1970,  but the band thought they appeared dated when they viewed the edited footage several months later, and the film was shelved (this footage was later remastered and featured on the 2003 release ''[[Led Zeppelin (DVD)|Led Zeppelin DVD]]'').\n\nOn the morning of 20 July 1973, during the band's concert tour of the US, Peter Grant made contact with American-born director [[Joe Massot]]. Massot was already known to Grant as he and his wife had moved into a house in [[Berkshire]] in 1970, where they made friends with their neighbours, Led Zeppelin guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] and his girlfriend Charlotte Martin.<ref name=welch/> Grant had previously turned down offers by Massot to make a film of the band, but with the huge success of the band's current tour, Grant changed his mind and offered him the job of director. As Grant recalled:\n\n<blockquote>It all started in the Sheraton Hotel, Boston. We'd talked about a film for years and Jimmy had known Joe Massot was interested&nbsp;\u2013 so we called them and over they came. It was all very quickly arranged.<ref name=lewispallett>Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) ''Led Zeppelin: The Concert File'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7119-5307-9}}, p. 90.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMassot hurriedly assembled a crew in time for Led Zeppelin's last leg of the tour starting on 23 July 1973, in Baltimore. He subsequently filmed the group's three concert performances at [[Madison Square Garden]] on the nights of 27, 28, and 29 July 1973. The film was entirely financed by the band and shot on 35mm with a 24-track quadraphonic sound recording. The live footage in the US alone cost $85,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Original filming==\nThe plans to film the shows at Madison Square Garden were threatened when the local trades union tried to block the British film crew from working. After the band's attorneys negotiated with the union, the crew was allowed to film the concerts.<ref name=welch>Welch, Chris (2002) ''Peter Grant: The Man Who Led Zeppelin'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7119-9195-8}}, pp. 112-138.</ref>\n\nThe footage of the band arriving at the airport in their private jet airliner, ''[[The Starship]]'', and travelling in the motor cavalcade to the concert was filmed in Pittsburgh, before their show at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] on 24 July 1973.<ref name=welch/>\n\nFor the band's three New York performances, two band members, [[Robert Plant]] and [[John Bonham]], wore exactly the same clothes to facilitate seamless editing of the film, but [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and Jimmy Page wore different sets of attire on some of the nights, which created continuity problems. Page is seen wearing a different dragon suit in \"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\" and the \"[[Celebration Day]]\" remaster. In an interview from 1997, Jones said that the reason he didn't wear the same stage clothes was that he asked the crew if they would be filming on those nights and was told no. \"I'd think 'not to worry, I'll save the shirt I wore the previous night for the next filming'. Then what would happen is that I'd get onstage and see the cameras ready to roll.\"\n\nAs Led Zeppelin's popularity soared throughout the 1970s, Peter Grant became increasingly notorious for being brutally protective of his band and their finances; ''The Song Remains the Same'' captures one such exchange between him and a concert promoter. When [[Warner Bros.]] approved the film they did so on the provison that expletives would be '[[Bleep censor|bleeped]]' out. Clifton took the optical print and removed the words, and the film was given an appropriate rating. However, on every other print, the words were retained and were fully audible.<ref name=welch/>\n\nIn the scene where Peter Grant is driven to the police station to be questioned about the theft from the safe deposit box at the [[The Drake Hotel, New York|Drake Hotel]], he has his arm outside the police car. According to an interview conducted in 1989, he explained the reason he wasn't handcuffed was that the policeman driving the car used to be a drummer in a semi-professional band which had supported [[the Yardbirds]] on one of its US college tours in the late-1960s. Grant had at the time been manager of the Yardbirds.<ref name=welch/>  The money stolen from the safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel was never recovered, and while no one has ever been charged,<ref name=crowe>Liner notes by [[Cameron Crowe]] for ''[[The Song Remains the Same (album)|The Song Remains the Same]]'', reissued version, 2007.</ref> it is alleged that a staff member of the hotel quit their job and fled to Jamaica soon after the theft.\n\nScenes of young fans attempting to buy tickets, an unruly fan being ejected by security, and Grant berating the promoter for receiving kickbacks were all shot at the [[Baltimore Civic Center]] on 23 July 1973. Grant purportedly recommended the \"Dazed and Confused\" sequence wherein the camera zooms into Page's eyes and cuts to the scene.<ref name=welch/>\n\nSome unused backstage shots filmed at Baltimore and at Pittsburgh later found their way into the promotional video for \"[[Travelling Riverside Blues]]\", released in 1990.\n\n==Subsequent filming and release==\nDissatisfied with the progress of the film, Grant had Massot removed from the project and Australian director [[Peter Clifton]] was hired in his place in early 1974. Massot was offered a few thousand pounds in compensation. Peter Grant later sent someone to Massot's house to collect the film. However, Massot had hidden the film elsewhere and so instead an expensive editing machine owned by Massot was taken as collateral.

The filming took place during the summer of 1973, during three nights of concerts at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, with additional footage shot at [[Shepperton Studios]]. The film premiered three years later on 20 October 1976 at Cinema I in New York, on 22 October 1976 at Fox Wilshire in Los Angeles, and at Warner West End Cinema in London two weeks later.<ref name=\"Welch2\">Chris Welch (1994) ''Led Zeppelin'', London: Orion Books. {{ISBN|1-85797-930-3}}, pp. 68-69, 83.</ref> It was accompanied by [[The Song Remains the Same (album)|a soundtrack album of the same name]]. The DVD of the film was released on 31 December 1999.\n\nPromotional materials stated that the film was \"the band's special way of giving their millions of friends what they had been clamouring for&nbsp;\u2013 a personal and private tour of Led Zeppelin. For the first time the world has a front row seat on Led Zeppelin.\"\n\nA reissue of the film, including previously unreleased footage as a bonus, was released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc on 20 November 2007, by [[Warner Home Video]].<ref name=\"fall-releases\">[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1050472/led-zeppelin-readies-fall-reissue-bonanza Led Zeppelin Readies Fall Reissue Bonanza]</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSince late 1969, Led Zeppelin had been planning on filming one of their live performances for a projected movie documentary of the band. The group's manager, [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], believed that they would be better served by the big screen than by television, because he regarded the sound quality of the latter as unsatisfactory. The first attempt was the filming (by Peter Whitehead and [[Stanley Dorfman]]) of Led Zeppelin's [[Royal Albert Hall]] performance on 9 January 1970,  but the band thought they appeared dated when they viewed the edited footage several months later, and the film was shelved (this footage was later remastered and featured on the 2003 release ''[[Led Zeppelin (DVD)|Led Zeppelin DVD]]'').\n\nOn the morning of 20 July 1973, during the band's concert tour of the US, Peter Grant made contact with American-born director [[Joe Massot]]. Massot was already known to Grant as he and his wife had moved into a house in [[Berkshire]] in 1970, where they made friends with their neighbours, Led Zeppelin guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] and his girlfriend Charlotte Martin.<ref name=welch/> Grant had previously turned down offers by Massot to make a film of the band, but with the huge success of the band's current tour, Grant changed his mind and offered him the job of director. As Grant recalled:\n\n<blockquote>It all started in the Sheraton Hotel, Boston. We'd talked about a film for years and Jimmy had known Joe Massot was interested&nbsp;\u2013 so we called them and over they came. It was all very quickly arranged.<ref name=lewispallett>Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) ''Led Zeppelin: The Concert File'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7119-5307-9}}, p. 90.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMassot hurriedly assembled a crew in time for Led Zeppelin's last leg of the tour starting on 23 July 1973, in Baltimore. He subsequently filmed the group's three concert performances at [[Madison Square Garden]] on the nights of 27, 28, and 29 July 1973. The film was entirely financed by the band and shot on 35mm with a 24-track quadraphonic sound recording. The live footage in the US alone cost $85,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Original filming==\nThe plans to film the shows at Madison Square Garden were threatened when the local trades union tried to block the British film crew from working. After the band's attorneys negotiated with the union, the crew was allowed to film the concerts.<ref name=welch>Welch, Chris (2002) ''Peter Grant: The Man Who Led Zeppelin'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7119-9195-8}}, pp. 112-138.</ref>\n\nThe footage of the band arriving at the airport in their private jet airliner, ''[[The Starship]]'', and travelling in the motor cavalcade to the concert was filmed in Pittsburgh, before their show at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] on 24 July 1973.<ref name=welch/>\n\nFor the band's three New York performances, two band members, [[Robert Plant]] and [[John Bonham]], wore exactly the same clothes to facilitate seamless editing of the film, but [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and Jimmy Page wore different sets of attire on some of the nights, which created continuity problems. Page is seen wearing a different dragon suit in \"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\" and the \"[[Celebration Day]]\" remaster. In an interview from 1997, Jones said that the reason he didn't wear the same stage clothes was that he asked the crew if they would be filming on those nights and was told no. \"I'd think 'not to worry, I'll save the shirt I wore the previous night for the next filming'. Then what would happen is that I'd get onstage and see the cameras ready to roll.\"\n\nAs Led Zeppelin's popularity soared throughout the 1970s, Peter Grant became increasingly notorious for being brutally protective of his band and their finances; ''The Song Remains the Same'' captures one such exchange between him and a concert promoter. When [[Warner Bros.]] approved the film they did so on the provison that expletives would be '[[Bleep censor|bleeped]]' out. Clifton took the optical print and removed the words, and the film was given an appropriate rating. However, on every other print, the words were retained and were fully audible.<ref name=welch/>\n\nIn the scene where Peter Grant is driven to the police station to be questioned about the theft from the safe deposit box at the [[The Drake Hotel, New York|Drake Hotel]], he has his arm outside the police car. According to an interview conducted in 1989, he explained the reason he wasn't handcuffed was that the policeman driving the car used to be a drummer in a semi-professional band which had supported [[the Yardbirds]] on one of its US college tours in the late-1960s. Grant had at the time been manager of the Yardbirds.<ref name=welch/>  The money stolen from the safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel was never recovered, and while no one has ever been charged,<ref name=crowe>Liner notes by [[Cameron Crowe]] for ''[[The Song Remains the Same (album)|The Song Remains the Same]]'', reissued version, 2007.</ref> it is alleged that a staff member of the hotel quit their job and fled to Jamaica soon after the theft.\n\nScenes of young fans attempting to buy tickets, an unruly fan being ejected by security, and Grant berating the promoter for receiving kickbacks were all shot at the [[Baltimore Civic Center]] on 23 July 1973. Grant purportedly recommended the \"Dazed and Confused\" sequence wherein the camera zooms into Page's eyes and cuts to the scene.<ref name=welch/>\n\nSome unused backstage shots filmed at Baltimore and at Pittsburgh later found their way into the promotional video for \"[[Travelling Riverside Blues]]\", released in 1990.\n\n==Subsequent filming and release==\nDissatisfied with the progress of the film, Grant had Massot removed from the project and Australian director [[Peter Clifton]] was hired in his place in early 1974. Massot was offered a few thousand pounds in compensation. Peter Grant later sent someone to Massot's house to collect the film. However, Massot had hidden the film elsewhere and so instead an expensive editing machine owned by Massot was taken as collateral. Massot served a writ, leading to a period of stalemate which was finally broken when Grant and Led Zeppelin's lawyer Steve Weiss agreed to pay Massot the money he was owed, after which he delivered the film to the band.<ref name=welch/> Massot was not invited to attend the premiere of the film at New York but he attended anyway, buying a ticket from a scalper outside the theatre.<ref name=welch/>\n\nClifton, realising that there were crucial holes in the concert footage, suggested that the entire show be recreated at [[Shepperton Studios]] in August 1974, on a mock-up of the Madison Square Garden stage. Close-ups and distance footage of the band members could then be slipped into the live sequences, which made up the bulk of the concert footage seen in the film.

The DVD features newly remixed and fully remastered sound, 5.1 Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound from original master tracks, and includes more than 40&nbsp;minutes of added bonus material, including never-before-released performance footage of \"[[Over the Hills and Far Away (Led Zeppelin song)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]\" and \"[[Celebration Day]]\", plus performances of \"[[Misty Mountain Hop]]\" and \"[[The Ocean (Led Zeppelin song)|The Ocean]]\", a rare 1976 [[BBC]] interview with Robert Plant and Peter Grant, vintage TV footage from the [[The Drake Hotel, New York|Drake Hotel]] robbery during the New York concert stand, and a [[Cameron Crowe]] radio show. This version was released on standard DVDs as well as [[Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]].\n\nA Collector's Edition box set including a T-shirt with the original album cover, placards from the New York shows, and several glossy photographs was released as well.\n\nDue to legal complications, the band decided not to change the video portion of the original movie for the rerelease.<ref name=\"crowe\"/>  Instead, sound engineer [[Kevin Shirley]] created an entirely new mix of the three 1973 Madison Square Garden concerts so that the audio portion of the film would better match the on-screen visuals.  The audio on the new CD release is nearly identical to the soundtrack of the new DVD release.  One difference is that the songs included on the CDs that were not featured in the original movie are included as bonus tracks on the DVD.<ref>Tom Watson, [http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/003887.html Kevin Shirley Talks about Revisiting Led Zeppelin's The Song Remains The Same], ''Modern Guitars Magazine'', 16 October 2007.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411091308/http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/003887.html |date=April 11, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.thegardentapes.co.uk/tgt.html The Garden Tapes] - a study of sources of the live material and the edits for release on this film.\n* {{IMDb title|0075244|The Song Remains the Same}}\n* {{Allmovie title|158994|The Song Remains the Same}}\n\n{{Led Zeppelin}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Song Remains the Same, The}}\n[[Category:1976 films]]\n[[Category:1999 video albums]]\n[[Category:Led Zeppelin video albums]]\n[[Category:Concert films]]\n[[Category:Films set in New York City]]\n[[Category:Films set in Pittsburgh]]\n[[Category:Live video albums]]\n[[Category:Warner Bros. films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Joe Massot]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Peter Clifton]]\n", "name_user": "SilkTork", "label": "safe", "comment": "Ertegun", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Song_Remains_the_Same_(film)"}

The protesters began tipping over police cars, violently resisting arrest, and began building [[barricade]]s after the police withdrew due to the unforeseen resistance.

These two dates combined often result in a [[long weekend]] called {{lang|pl|Maj\u00f3wka}}, which may last for up to 9 days from 28 April to 6 May, at the cost of taking only 3 days off.

After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], 1 May continues to be an official public holiday, but without any state organized events or parades. Most people celebrate together with friends and family, organising [[picnic]]s and [[barbecue]]s.

The following year, after the [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|seizure of power]], the May Day celebrations were boycotted by [[Mensheviks]], [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] and [[anarchism in Russia|anarchists]]. It became an important official holiday of the Soviet Union, celebrated with elaborate popular parade in the centre of the major cities. The biggest celebration was traditionally organized in [[Red Square]], where the [[General Secretary of the CPSU]] and other party and government leaders stood atop [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] and waved to the crowds. Until 1969, the holiday was marked by [[military parade]]s throughout the [[RSFSR]] and the union republics.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/parades-may-day.htm</ref> In 1991, which preceded the last year that demonstrations were held in Red Square, May Day grew into high-spirited political action. Around 50,000 people participated in a rally in Red Square in 1991 after which the tradition was interrupted for 13 years. In the early post-Soviet period the holiday turned into massive political gatherings of supporters of radically minded politicians. For instance, an action dubbed as \"a rally of communist-oriented organisations\" was held in Red Square in 1992. The rally began with performance of the Soviet Union anthem and raising the Red Flag and ended with appeals from the leader of opposition movement Working Moscow, Viktor Anpilov, \"for early dismissal of President Boris Yeltsin, ousting [[Moscow Mayor]] [[Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov|Gavriil Popov]] from power and putting the latter on trial\". Since 1992, May Day is officially called \"The Day of Spring and Labour\", and remains a major holiday in present-day Russia.\n\nSince 2014 a national civil parade is held on that day on Red Square with similar events held in major cities and regional capitals.\n\n====Serbia====\nIn Serbia, 1 May (and also 2 May) is a day off work and a day out of school. It is one of the major popular holidays, and the only official holiday from socialist times that is still officially celebrated. People celebrate it all over the country. By tradition 1 May is celebrated by countryside picnics and outdoor barbecues. May is marked by warm weather in Serbia.

The crowd went to hear speeches by the leading figures in the [[Swedish labour movement]] such as [[Hjalmar Branting]] (later [[prime minister]]), [[August Palm]] and [[Hinke Bergegren]].

This is equal in practice to an official public holiday, but is not based on federal law and cantonal regulations may differ in details.\n* In the canton of [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] it is an official half-day holiday (starting at 12 noon).\n* In the canton of {{lang|fr|[[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]]|italic=no}}, public servants get the afternoon off, many companies follow this practice.\n* In the canton of {{lang|de|[[Aargau]]|italic=no}} it is not an official holiday, but most employees get the afternoon off.\n* In the municipalities of {{lang|de|[[Hildisrieden]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|de|[[Sch\u00fcpfheim]]|italic=no}} (both in the canton of [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]]) as well as in {{lang|de|[[Muotathal]]|italic=no}} (canton of {{lang|de|[[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]]|italic=no}}), 1 May is an official public holiday, but as commemoration day of the local [[patron saint]], not as Labour Day.

The crowd was the biggest in Turkish workers' history with the number of people approximating 500,000. In the next two years, provocations and confusion continued and peaked before the 1980 coup d'etat. The Workers' Day holiday was cancelled once again. Still, demonstrations continued with small crowds, and in 1996, three people were killed by police bullets, and a plain-clothes man who spied in the crowd was revealed and lynched by workers. On the same evening, a video broadcast on TV showed that two participants in the demonstration were lynched by far right-wing nationalist groups and this lynching occurred in front of police forces who were watching the scene with happy faces. Thus, 1 May 1996 has been remembered by workers' movements.<ref name=\"marksist.com\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the 30th anniversary of the [[Taksim square massacre]], leftist workers' unions wanted to commemorate the massacre in Taksim square.

Saint Joseph is the [[patron saint]] of workers and craftsmen, among others.<ref name='Saint Joseph'>{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-joseph/|title=Saint Joseph|accessdate=5 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], May Day became the occasion for large military parades in [[Red Square]] by the [[Soviet Union]] and attended by the top leaders of the [[Kremlin]], especially the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]], atop [[Lenin's Mausoleum]]. It became an enduring symbol of that period.\n\nToday, the majority of countries around the world celebrate a workers' day on 1 May.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Africa===\n\n====Algeria====\nIn Algeria, 1 May is a public holiday celebrated as Labour Day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Practical information to go on holidays to Algier with Travel by Air France |url=https://www.airfrance.co.uk/travel-guide/algiers/practical-information |website=AirFrance |accessdate=7 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Angola====\n1 May is recognized as public holiday in Angola and called Workers' Day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Angola: World Marks International Workers' Day |url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201305010715.html}}</ref>\n\n====Egypt====\n[[File:DSC 1498 (5676929076).jpg|thumb|Egyptian Communist Party flags in [[Tahrir Square]]]] {{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n1 May is known as Labour Day and is considered a paid holiday.

The protesters began tipping over police cars, violently resisting arrest, and began building [[barricade]]s after the police withdrew due to the unforeseen resistance. Cars were set on fire, shops plundered and burned to the ground. The police eventually ended the riots the following night.

People often travel, and {{lang|pl|Maj\u00f3wka}} is unofficially considered the start of barbecuing season in Poland.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nBetween these two, on 2 May, there is a patriotic holiday, the Day of the Polish Flag ({{lang|pl|[[:pl:Dzie\u0144 Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej|Dzie\u0144 Flagi Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej]]}}), introduced by a Parliamentary Act of 20 February 2004. The day, however, does not force paid time off.\n\nIn Soviet times, streets, places, squares, parks and also factories were frequently named in honor of International Workers' Day, such as [[1 Maja Coal Mine]] in {{lang|pl|[[Wodzis\u0142aw \u015al\u0105ski]]|italic=no}}.\n\n====Portugal====\nIn Portugal, the 1 May celebration ({{lang-pt|Primeiro de Maio}}) was surpressed during the dictatorship of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and [[Marcelo Caetano]]s [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime. The first workers' day demonstration was held a week after the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 25 April 1974. It is still the largest demonstration in the history of Portugal. It is used as an opportunity for workers and  workers' groups to voice their discontent over working conditions in demonstrations across Portugal, the largest being held in Lisbon. It is an official public holiday.<ref>{{cite web |title=Why is May 1st a holiday in Portugal? |url=https://algarvedailynews.com/news/11578-why-is-may-1st-a-holiday-in-portugal |website=algarvedailynews.com |accessdate=16 October 2019 |language=en-gb}}</ref>\n\n====Romania====\n[[File:002 State and party leaders celebrating May 1.jpg|thumb|Delegates of the Romanian Communist Party on 1 May 1965.]]\nIn Romania, 1 May, known as the '''International Labour Day''' ({{lang-ro|Ziua interna\u021bional\u0103 a muncii}}), the '''International Workers' Day''' ({{lang|ro|Ziua interna\u021bional\u0103 a oamenilor muncii}}), or simply '''1/First of May''' ({{lang|ro|1/\u00cent\u00e2i Mai}}),  is an official [[public holidays in Romania|public holiday]]. During the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]], like in all former Eastern Bloc countries, the day was marked by large state-organized parades in most towns and cities. After the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], 1 May continues to be an official public holiday, but without any state organized events or parades. Most people celebrate together with friends and family, organising [[picnic]]s and [[barbecue]]s. It is also the first day of the year when people, especially those from the southeastern part of the country including the capital [[Bucharest]], go to spend the day in one of the [[Romanian Black Sea resorts]].\n\n====Russia====\n[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u041a\u0420\u041f-\u0420\u041f\u041a \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438.jpg|thumb|Russian Communist Workers' Party demonstration on 1 May 2008 in Izhevsk.]]\n\nMay Day was celebrated illegally in Russia until the [[February Revolution]] enabled the first legal celebration in 1917. The following year, after the [[Bolshevik]] [[October Revolution|seizure of power]], the May Day celebrations were boycotted by [[Mensheviks]], [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]] and [[anarchism in Russia|anarchists]]. It became an important official holiday of the Soviet Union, celebrated with elaborate popular parade in the centre of the major cities. The biggest celebration was traditionally organized in [[Red Square]], where the [[General Secretary of the CPSU]] and other party and government leaders stood atop [[Lenin's Mausoleum]] and waved to the crowds. Until 1969, the holiday was marked by [[military parade]]s throughout the [[RSFSR]] and the union republics.<ref>https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/parades-may-day.htm</ref> In 1991, which preceded the last year that demonstrations were held in Red Square, May Day grew into high-spirited political action. Around 50,000 people participated in a rally in Red Square in 1991 after which the tradition was interrupted for 13 years. In the early post-Soviet period the holiday turned into massive political gatherings of supporters of radically minded politicians. For instance, an action dubbed as \"a rally of communist-oriented organisations\" was held in Red Square in 1992. The rally began with performance of the Soviet Union anthem and raising the Red Flag and ended with appeals from the leader of opposition movement Working Moscow, Viktor Anpilov, \"for early dismissal of President Boris Yeltsin, ousting [[Moscow Mayor]] [[Gavriil Kharitonovich Popov|Gavriil Popov]] from power and putting the latter on trial\". Since 1992, May Day is officially called \"The Day of Spring and Labour\", and remains a major holiday in present-day Russia.\n\nSince 2014 a national civil parade is held on that day on Red Square with similar events held in major cities and regional capitals.\n\n====Serbia====\nIn Serbia, 1 May (and also 2 May) is a day off work and a day out of school. It is one of the major popular holidays, and the only official holiday from socialist times that is still officially celebrated. People celebrate it all over the country. By tradition 1 May is celebrated by countryside picnics and outdoor barbecues. May is marked by warm weather in Serbia. In [[Belgrade]], the capital, most people go to {{lang|sr|[[Avala]]|italic=no}} or {{lang|sr|[[Ko\u0161utnjak]]|italic=no}}, which are parks located in {{lang|sr|Rakovica|italic=no}} and {{lang|sr|\u010cukarica|italic=no}}. People go around the country to enjoy nature. A major religious holiday of {{lang|sr|[[Djurdjevdan]]|italic=no}} is on 6 May so quite often days off work are given to connect these two holidays and weekend, creating a small spring break. 1 May is celebrated by most of the population regardless of political views.\n\n====Slovakia====\nIn Slovakia, 1 May is an official holiday. Celebrations are held surrounding workers' day but are also connected with the commemoration of the [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|entry of the Slovak Republic into the European Union]] (1 May 2004).<ref>{{cite web |last1=a.s |first1=Petit Press |title=May Day celebrated in style |url=https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20005065/may-day-celebrated-in-style.html |website=spectator.sme.sk |language=en |date=7 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Slovenia====\nIn Slovenia, 1 May and 2 May are public holidays.

The first May Day celebration gathered more than 50,000 people in central Stockholm. The crowd went to hear speeches by the leading figures in the [[Swedish labour movement]] such as [[Hjalmar Branting]] (later [[prime minister]]), [[August Palm]] and [[Hinke Bergegren]]. During [[World War I]] the demonstrations mainly had a peace message and the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal Party]] also joined the demonstrations. The [[8-hour working day]] and [[women's suffrage]] were the principal themes during the troubled times after World War I.\n\nRecognizing the central contributions of workers and international worker solidarity in Swedish social, economic, political and cultural development, May Day demonstrations are an important part of Swedish politics and culture for social democrats, left parties, and unions.

Still, demonstrations continued with small crowds, and in 1996, three people were killed by police bullets, and a plain-clothes man who spied in the crowd was revealed and lynched by workers. On the same evening, a video broadcast on TV showed that two participants in the demonstration were lynched by far right-wing nationalist groups and this lynching occurred in front of police forces who were watching the scene with happy faces.

wikidata|income_class_ordinal}} [[{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people{{PH census|current}} making it the [[List of cities in the Philippines|fourth-most populous city]] in the [[Philippines]].\n\nIt is divided into two geographical locations with a total combined area of 5,333.40 hectares. It was formerly  part of the [[Rizal|Province of Rizal]] of the Philippines' [[Southern Tagalog|Southern Luzon Region]]. It comprises what is known as the [[Administrative divisions of Metro Manila#Districts|CAMANAVA]] area along with cities [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]].\n\nSouth Caloocan is bordered by [[Manila]], [[Quezon City]], [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]]. North Caloocan shares its border with Quezon City, Valenzuela and [[Marilao]], [[Meycauayan]] and [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]].\n\n==Name==\nCaloocan as a [[toponym]] comes from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] root word ''lo-ok''; ''kalook-lookan'' (or ''kaloob-looban'') means \"innermost area\". The city's name is colloquially spelled as '''Kalookan'''.\n\nThere is a mixed preference over the preferred spelling of the city's name. Variation, and the apparent confusion over the spelling, came about during the early 1970s, when a resolution was adopted by the municipal board, requiring the city departments to use the name \"Kalookan.\" The execution of the said resolution was interrupted when the country was placed under [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|a martial law]] in September 1972. After the restoration of city and municipal councils, then-city councilor Aurora Asistio-Henson filed Resolution No. 006, amending the previous resolution and seeking to promote [[Filipino nationalism]] by requiring all residents and all offices and establishments in the city, \"whether public or private,\" to spell the name of the city as \"Kalookan.\" According to Henson, the \"Filipinized spelling\" provides essence and significance to the city's history, and she added that it should be used \"in the city hall, the barangay halls, public markets, and other places for the information and guidance of all concerned.\" Nevertheless this change in spelling was denounced by the city residents, business owners, and officials. Former legislator and mayor Virgilio Robles declared the move illegal because it lacked congressional approval. He added that the city's name is spelled as \"Caloocan\" as shown in the city charter. The general inclination of spelling in the city is \"Caloocan\" and not \"Kalookan,\" despite the existing city ordinance, although confusion has led to varied spelling choices of many businesses throughout the city. The official logo has the city's name spelled as \"Caloocan,\" and such spelling is favored by many barangays and public and private schools in the city. \"Kalookan\" is preferred by the [[Makati]]-based Directories of the Philippines Corporation (DPC), while many national newspapers and magazines, and mapmakers like the [[Mandaluyong]]-based HYDN Publishing favor \"Caloocan.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/10/19/opinion/confusion-over-spelling-caloocan-or-kalookan/687279/ |title=Confusion over spelling: Caloocan or Kalookan? |work=[[The Manila Times]] |date=October 19, 2004 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/opinion/pieces/166-which-is-which-caloocan-or-kalookan |title=Which is which, Caloocan or Kalookan? |work=[[Philippine News Agency]] |last=Samonte |first=Severino |date=December 6, 2018 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Philippine Revolution}}\n\n[[File:Old manila map with caloocan.jpg|200x200px|thumb|Old map of Manila and nearby areas including (south) Caloocan.]]\n[[File:20th Kansas Volunteers marching through Caloocan at night.jpg|225px|left|thumb|The ammunition train and reserves of the 20th Kansas Volunteers, Col. Frederick R. Funston, marching through Caloocan at night after the battle of February 10.]]\n\nOriginally, Caloocan was the area where the old town of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] and  [[Malabon|Tambobong]] met, located along the shores of Dagat-Dagatan, a crescent-shaped inland lagoon to the west. The settlement along the shore was called \u201cAromahan\u201d, or \u201cEspina\u201d to the Spaniards, and was separated from Manila Bay by a narrow ridge from Tondo towards an opening in [[Navotas|Kinabutasan]] leading to the sea. \n\nBy the late 1700s, the fishermen of Aromahan has expanded towards a hill east of Dagat-Dagatan. This naturally stony hill was called \u201cKaloogan\u201d, meaning \u201cinterior territory\u201d, which evolved from the old Tagalog word \u201cloog\u201d (synonymous with \u201cloob\u201d or \u201cinside\u201d). The \"g\" sound could have shifted to the \u201ck\u201d sound in Tagalog phonetics (e.g. baksak > bagsak) leading to the present name of the city. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Joaquin |first1=Agapito |title=The Role of Kalookan in the Nation's Quest for Freedom |url=http://68.171.43.119/kalookan/P1A1C2A.htm |accessdate=26 April 2020}}</ref>With Aromahan relegated to the periphery, this hilltop area was also settled by oppressed people from Tondo, becoming the new center of the community by 1802. To the east was a vast stretch of [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon-covered]] land,  Eventually called \u201cKalaanan\u201d, meaning flat grassland in old Tagalog, this area is now generally known as Grace Park.  \n\nCaloocan became a municipality when it was separated from Tondo in 1815. Its original territory extended to the foothills of [[Marikina]], [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]] to the east; [[Tinajeros, Malabon|Tinajeros]], [[Tanza, Navotas|Tanza]], and Tala rivers to the north; [[San Francisco del Monte]], [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampalok]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]] and Tondo in the south; and Dagat-dagatan and Aromahan to the west. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caloocancity.gov.ph/departments-offices1/26-about-us |title=About Us |website=www.caloocancity.gov.ph |access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> The local government building was set up on the relatively well-settled portion just above Libis Espina. The old Aromahan chapel was finally abandoned and a new [[Caloocan Cathedral|church was built]] facing the municipal hall. To escape the Spanish authorities, many from the area abandoned the town proper and sought refuge in the grasslands of [[Balingasa|Balintawak]] and Pugad-Lawin, in which the people fought the landlords of Hacienda de Maysilo for terrestrial rights, which went on for almost a hundred years <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>.\n\nThe city is historically significant because it was the center of activities for the [[Katipunan]], the secret militant society that launched the [[Philippine Revolution]] during the Spanish occupation of the Philippines. In a house in Caloocan, secret meetings were held by [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] and his men, and it was in the city's perimeters where the first armed encounter took place between the Katipunan and the Spaniards. The revolution erupted after the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin|\u201cCry of Balintawak\u201d]] led by Andres Bonifacio against their oppressors on August 30, 1896.\n\nIn 1899, the people of Caloocan showed resistance to coming to terms with the Americans, who were bent on extending their supremacy over the country. The men of Caloocan fought the new invaders on February 23, 1899, however victory eluded the local troops on the pretext of [[Antonio Luna|Antonio Luna\u2019s]] rift with [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo\u2019s]] loyalists <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>. The city then saw heavy fighting in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], at the [[Battle of Caloocan]] and the [[Second Battle of Caloocan]].\n\nIn 1901, during the formation of the province of Rizal, Caloocan was included in its matrix. [[Novaliches]] became part of Caloocan pursuant to Act 942, as amended by Act 984 and Act 1008 of the [[Philippine Commission]], which was transferred in 1949 for the formation of [[Quezon City]].\n\nIn 1961, after Republic Act No. 3278 was approved by the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] and the plebiscite was conducted. Caloocan was officially inducted into cityhood on February 16, 1962\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n===Territorial changes===\n\n[[File:Territorial changes of Caloocan.png|thumb|Territorial changes of Caloocan. Green: existing territorial boundaries. Blue: Detached by Commonwealth Act 602 (1939). Yellow: Detached by Republic Act 392 (1949).]]\nCaloocan once encompassed a much larger, contiguous area. The districts of [[Barangays of Quezon City|Balintawak]], [[Quezon City#La Loma|La Loma]] and [[Quezon City#Novaliches|Novaliches]] were once part of Caloocan. Balintawak is a historic district because it was the original site of the \"Cry of Pugad Lawin\" (Unang Sigaw sa Balintawak) at a location called \"Kang-kong\" near Tandang Sora's house. Novaliches was an expansive sector with some hillsides that served as meeting places and hideouts for [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] and the ''Katipunan''.\n\nBy the 1920s there was a consolidation of several municipalities. Caloocan annexed the neighbouring town of Novaliches, as stated in the Act 942, as amended by Acts 984 and 1008 of the Philippine Commission, bringing its total area to about 15,000 hectares. When [[Quezon City]] was created in 1939, Caloocan ceded 1,500 hectares of land from the barrios or sitios of Balintaw\u00e1k, Balingasa, Kaingin, Kangkong, La Loma, Malamig, Matalahib, Masambong, Galas, San Isidro, San Jos\u00e9, Santol and Tatalon. Instead of opposing the transfer, Caloocan residents willingly gave the land in the belief it will benefit the country's new [[capital city]].\n\nHowever, in 1949, Congress passed Republic Act No. 392, which redefined the Caloocan-Quezon City boundary. The barrios of Baesa, Talipap\u00e2, San Bartolom\u00e9, Pasong Tam\u00f3, Novaliches, Banlat, Kabuyao, Pugad Lawin, Bagbag, Pasong Putik, which once belonged to Novaliches and had an area of about 8,100 hectares, were excised from Caloocan. The remaining portion of the Novaliches is now called North Caloocan. This split Caloocan into two parts: a southern section that is more urbanised, and a northern section that became suburban-rural.\n\n==Geography==\nCaloocan is divided into two non-contiguous areas with a total combined area of 53.334 square kilometers. Southern Caloocan, with an area of 13.625 square kilometers, is bordered on the south by [[Manila]], on the east by [[Quezon City]], and on the north-northwest by [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]]. Northern Caloocan, with an area of 39.709 square kilometers, shares its border on the south-southeast by [[Quezon City]], on the southwest by [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]], and on the north by [[Marilao]], [[Meycauayan]] and [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]].<ref name=\"Caloocan City History\" /> \n===Topography===\nSouth Caloocan, where most commercial and industrial establishments are found, lies on generally flat and highly accessible land, with slopes ranging from 0-3%. The topography gradually changes into gently to moderately sloping to rolling along the [[North Luzon Expressway]], with slopes ranging from 3-18%. The highest point at 35.00 meters above sea level can be found in this area, while the lowest point is in the southern part of Dagat-Dagatan at about 0.993 meters above mean sea level.<ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\">http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>\n\nNorth Caloocan is characterized with gently to steeply undulating to rolling topography with slopes ranging from 3-18%, mostly seen in the northern and central portion, gradually transforming into a southward trend of flat lands down to the southwestern tip of the boundary. Being accessible to major roads, many industrial and residential subdivisions have been developed in this near-level land.<ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\" />\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Topo Map Caloocan South.png|100x100px|thumb|Elevation map of south Caloocan]]\n[[File:Topo Map Caloocan North.png|100x100px|thumb|Elevation map of north Caloocan]]\nThe geologic formation of the two portions of Caloocan City varies in type and characteristics. and are specifically classified as quaternary [[alluvium]], [[tuff]] and tuffaceous sediment, [[pyroclastic flow]] deposit, and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]]. The formation on the eastern half of Metropolitan Manila extending to the coastline of Manila Bay and including a greater part of South Caloocan, is the quaternary [[alluvium]] - consisting of unconsolidated stream\u2010deposited sediments that includes sand, silt, clay or gravel.<ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\" />\n\nEastward of South Caloocan, large areas consisting of [[tuff]] and tuffaceous sediment can be traced, spreading towards the whole eastern side of Metropolitan Manila. [[Pyroclastic flow]] deposit or [[igneous rocks]] formed by the lithification of ash flow are likewise present in northern fringes of South Caloocan and in most parts of North Caloocan. On the northeast borders of North Caloocan, [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate rocks]] were traced, crossing Tala Estate and extending to the province of Bulacan and the La Mesa Watershed. <ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\" />\n\nSoil found in both areas of Caloocan City predominantly falls under the Novaliches Series, covering 96% of the total land area of the city. The Novaliches Series is composed of reddish brown soil, friable in consistency and granular in structure. Spherical concretions are present in the subsoil and underneath are tuffaceous material of varying degrees of disintegration and weathering. Tuffaceous material is exposed by extensive erosion in some places.<ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\" />\n\n===Surface Drainages===\nCaloocan City has surface waters that either have natural course (creeks and rivers) or constructed to serve as drainages to remove excess water from soil surfaces. South Caloocan has about a total of 5.0 km length of open drainage canals that serve mainly the reclamation area comprising Kaunlaran Village (Dagat-Dagatan Development Project) and nearly 11.3 km length of natural surface water coursing through the different natural river systems. These include the [[Tullahan River|Tinajeros-Tullahan River]] along the Caloocan-Valenzuela boundary; Maligaya Creek within [[La Loma Cemetery]] and crossing [[Rizal Avenue|Rizal Avenue Extension]]; Casili Creek which terminates in Estero de Maypajo, and Cantarilla/Panaca creek along the Caloocan-Malabon boundary. In North Caloocan, all surface waters consist of natural streams, the longest being the  Meycauayan-Marilao River dividing Caloocan and Bulacan. Others include the Bagong Silang River, Tala, Camarin, Pasong Malapad, and Bagumbong Creeks crossing multiple subdivisions, for a total of 52.7 km length within the City\u2019s territorial boundaries.<ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\" />\n\n===Barangays===\n[[File:South_Caloocan_Barangay_Map_with_Area_Names.png|250x250px|thumb|Barangays of South Caloocan with corresponding area names]]\n[[File:North_Caloocan_Barangay_Map_with_Area_Names.png|250x250px|thumb|Barangays of North Caloocan with corresponding area names]]\n\nCaloocan is has 188 [[barangay]]s divided into 2 legislative districts divided by [[Samson Road]] and [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]. District 1 is composed of 70 barangays, which include Barangays 1-4, 77-85 and 132-188, while  District 2 is composed of 118 barangays, which include Barangays 5 to 76 and 86 to 131.<ref name=\"Caloocan City History\" /> The city uses a hybrid system for its barangays, further dividing the cities into 16 Zones. Among the cities in Metro Manila, only Manila, Pasay and Caloocan implement the so-called \"Zone Systems\". A zone is a group of barangays in a district. Although a zone is considered a subdivision in the local government units, the people do not elect a leader for the zone in a popular election similar to the normal barangay or local elections as the system is merely for statistical purposes. Further, all barangays have their corresponding numbers but only a few \u2014 mostly in the northern part \u2014 have corresponding names. However, names of barrios and districts do not necessarily coincide with barangay perimeters. Barangays in southern Caloocan are smaller compared to their northern counterparts.\n\nIn 1989, Republic Act 6714 called for reducing the 70 barangays constituting the first congressional district of Caloocan City to only thirty (30) barangays, while the 118 barangays composing the second congressional district of Caloocan City were to be reduced to thirty (30) barangays. It was presumably defeated in the plebiscite that followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1989/02/28/republic-act-no-6714/|title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6714 AN ACT MERGING, DIVIDING, AND/OR REVIVING THE DIFFERENT BARANGAYS IN CALOOCAN CITY AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES|last=|first=|date=February 28, 1989|website=Official Gazette of the Philippines.|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBarangay Bagong Silang (176) is the most populous barangay in the country with a population of 246,515 people or 16% of the total population of Caloocan City.{{PH census|2015}} This was due to the continuous influx of informal settler families through relocation programs since the 1970s.

wikidata|income_class_ordinal}} [[{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}} of the Philippines|{{PH wikidata|settlement_text}}]] in {{PH wikidata|province}}, {{PH wikidata|country}}. According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people{{PH census|current}} making it the [[List of cities in the Philippines|fourth-most populous city]] in the [[Philippines]].\n\nIt is divided into two geographical locations with a total combined area of 5,333.40 hectares. It was formerly  part of the [[Rizal|Province of Rizal]] of the Philippines' [[Southern Tagalog|Southern Luzon Region]]. It comprises what is known as the [[Administrative divisions of Metro Manila#Districts|CAMANAVA]] area along with cities [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]].\n\nSouth Caloocan is bordered by [[Manila]], [[Quezon City]], [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Metro Manila|Valenzuela]]. North Caloocan shares its border with Quezon City, Valenzuela and [[Marilao]], [[Meycauayan]] and [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]].\n\n==Name==\nCaloocan as a [[toponym]] comes from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] root word ''lo-ok''; ''kalook-lookan'' (or ''kaloob-looban'') means \"innermost area\". The city's name is colloquially spelled as '''Kalookan'''.\n\nThere is a mixed preference over the preferred spelling of the city's name. Variation, and the apparent confusion over the spelling, came about during the early 1970s, when a resolution was adopted by the municipal board, requiring the city departments to use the name \"Kalookan.\" The execution of the said resolution was interrupted when the country was placed under [[Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos|a martial law]] in September 1972. After the restoration of city and municipal councils, then-city councilor Aurora Asistio-Henson filed Resolution No. 006, amending the previous resolution and seeking to promote [[Filipino nationalism]] by requiring all residents and all offices and establishments in the city, \"whether public or private,\" to spell the name of the city as \"Kalookan.\" According to Henson, the \"Filipinized spelling\" provides essence and significance to the city's history, and she added that it should be used \"in the city hall, the barangay halls, public markets, and other places for the information and guidance of all concerned.\" Nevertheless this change in spelling was denounced by the city residents, business owners, and officials. Former legislator and mayor Virgilio Robles declared the move illegal because it lacked congressional approval. He added that the city's name is spelled as \"Caloocan\" as shown in the city charter. The general inclination of spelling in the city is \"Caloocan\" and not \"Kalookan,\" despite the existing city ordinance, although confusion has led to varied spelling choices of many businesses throughout the city. The official logo has the city's name spelled as \"Caloocan,\" and such spelling is favored by many barangays and public and private schools in the city. \"Kalookan\" is preferred by the [[Makati]]-based Directories of the Philippines Corporation (DPC), while many national newspapers and magazines, and mapmakers like the [[Mandaluyong]]-based HYDN Publishing favor \"Caloocan.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2004/10/19/opinion/confusion-over-spelling-caloocan-or-kalookan/687279/ |title=Confusion over spelling: Caloocan or Kalookan? |work=[[The Manila Times]] |date=October 19, 2004 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/opinion/pieces/166-which-is-which-caloocan-or-kalookan |title=Which is which, Caloocan or Kalookan? |work=[[Philippine News Agency]] |last=Samonte |first=Severino |date=December 6, 2018 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Philippine Revolution}}\n\n[[File:Old manila map with caloocan.jpg|200x200px|thumb|Old map of Manila and nearby areas including (south) Caloocan.]]\n[[File:20th Kansas Volunteers marching through Caloocan at night.jpg|225px|left|thumb|The ammunition train and reserves of the 20th Kansas Volunteers, Col.

The settlement along the shore was called \u201cAromahan\u201d, or \u201cEspina\u201d to the Spaniards, and was separated from Manila Bay by a narrow ridge from Tondo towards an opening in [[Navotas|Kinabutasan]] leading to the sea. \n\nBy the late 1700s, the fishermen of Aromahan has expanded towards a hill east of Dagat-Dagatan. This naturally stony hill was called \u201cKaloogan\u201d, meaning \u201cinterior territory\u201d, which evolved from the old Tagalog word \u201cloog\u201d (synonymous with \u201cloob\u201d or \u201cinside\u201d). The \"g\" sound could have shifted to the \u201ck\u201d sound in Tagalog phonetics (e.g. baksak > bagsak) leading to the present name of the city. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Joaquin |first1=Agapito |title=The Role of Kalookan in the Nation's Quest for Freedom |url=http://68.171.43.119/kalookan/P1A1C2A.htm |accessdate=26 April 2020}}</ref>With Aromahan relegated to the periphery, this hilltop area was also settled by oppressed people from Tondo, becoming the new center of the community by 1802. To the east was a vast stretch of [[Imperata cylindrica|cogon-covered]] land,  Eventually called \u201cKalaanan\u201d, meaning flat grassland in old Tagalog, this area is now generally known as Grace Park.  \n\nCaloocan became a municipality when it was separated from Tondo in 1815. Its original territory extended to the foothills of [[Marikina]], [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]] to the east; [[Tinajeros, Malabon|Tinajeros]], [[Tanza, Navotas|Tanza]], and Tala rivers to the north; [[San Francisco del Monte]], [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampalok]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]] and Tondo in the south; and Dagat-dagatan and Aromahan to the west. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caloocancity.gov.ph/departments-offices1/26-about-us |title=About Us |website=www.caloocancity.gov.ph |access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> The local government building was set up on the relatively well-settled portion just above Libis Espina. The old Aromahan chapel was finally abandoned and a new [[Caloocan Cathedral|church was built]] facing the municipal hall. To escape the Spanish authorities, many from the area abandoned the town proper and sought refuge in the grasslands of [[Balingasa|Balintawak]] and Pugad-Lawin, in which the people fought the landlords of Hacienda de Maysilo for terrestrial rights, which went on for almost a hundred years <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>.\n\nThe city is historically significant because it was the center of activities for the [[Katipunan]], the secret militant society that launched the [[Philippine Revolution]] during the Spanish occupation of the Philippines. In a house in Caloocan, secret meetings were held by [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] and his men, and it was in the city's perimeters where the first armed encounter took place between the Katipunan and the Spaniards. The revolution erupted after the [[Cry of Pugad Lawin|\u201cCry of Balintawak\u201d]] led by Andres Bonifacio against their oppressors on August 30, 1896.\n\nIn 1899, the people of Caloocan showed resistance to coming to terms with the Americans, who were bent on extending their supremacy over the country. The men of Caloocan fought the new invaders on February 23, 1899, however victory eluded the local troops on the pretext of [[Antonio Luna|Antonio Luna\u2019s]] rift with [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo\u2019s]] loyalists <ref>http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>. The city then saw heavy fighting in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], at the [[Battle of Caloocan]] and the [[Second Battle of Caloocan]].\n\nIn 1901, during the formation of the province of Rizal, Caloocan was included in its matrix. [[Novaliches]] became part of Caloocan pursuant to Act 942, as amended by Act 984 and Act 1008 of the [[Philippine Commission]], which was transferred in 1949 for the formation of [[Quezon City]].\n\nIn 1961, after Republic Act No. 3278 was approved by the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] and the plebiscite was conducted. Caloocan was officially inducted into cityhood on February 16, 1962\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n===Territorial changes===\n\n[[File:Territorial changes of Caloocan.png|thumb|Territorial changes of Caloocan. Green: existing territorial boundaries. Blue: Detached by Commonwealth Act 602 (1939). Yellow: Detached by Republic Act 392 (1949).]]\nCaloocan once encompassed a much larger, contiguous area. The districts of [[Barangays of Quezon City|Balintawak]], [[Quezon City#La Loma|La Loma]] and [[Quezon City#Novaliches|Novaliches]] were once part of Caloocan. Balintawak is a historic district because it was the original site of the \"Cry of Pugad Lawin\" (Unang Sigaw sa Balintawak) at a location called \"Kang-kong\" near Tandang Sora's house. Novaliches was an expansive sector with some hillsides that served as meeting places and hideouts for [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] and the ''Katipunan''.\n\nBy the 1920s there was a consolidation of several municipalities. Caloocan annexed the neighbouring town of Novaliches, as stated in the Act 942, as amended by Acts 984 and 1008 of the Philippine Commission, bringing its total area to about 15,000 hectares. When [[Quezon City]] was created in 1939, Caloocan ceded 1,500 hectares of land from the barrios or sitios of Balintaw\u00e1k, Balingasa, Kaingin, Kangkong, La Loma, Malamig, Matalahib, Masambong, Galas, San Isidro, San Jos\u00e9, Santol and Tatalon. Instead of opposing the transfer, Caloocan residents willingly gave the land in the belief it will benefit the country's new [[capital city]].\n\nHowever, in 1949, Congress passed Republic Act No. 392, which redefined the Caloocan-Quezon City boundary. The barrios of Baesa, Talipap\u00e2, San Bartolom\u00e9, Pasong Tam\u00f3, Novaliches, Banlat, Kabuyao, Pugad Lawin, Bagbag, Pasong Putik, which once belonged to Novaliches and had an area of about 8,100 hectares, were excised from Caloocan. The remaining portion of the Novaliches is now called North Caloocan. This split Caloocan into two parts: a southern section that is more urbanised, and a northern section that became suburban-rural.\n\n==Geography==\nCaloocan is divided into two non-contiguous areas with a total combined area of 53.334 square kilometers. Southern Caloocan, with an area of 13.625 square kilometers, is bordered on the south by [[Manila]], on the east by [[Quezon City]], and on the north-northwest by [[Malabon]], [[Navotas]] and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]]. Northern Caloocan, with an area of 39.709 square kilometers, shares its border on the south-southeast by [[Quezon City]], on the southwest by [[Valenzuela, Philippines|Valenzuela]], and on the north by [[Marilao]], [[Meycauayan]] and [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]].<ref name=\"Caloocan City History\">http://caloocancity.gov.ph/26-about-us/298-history2</ref>\n\n===Topography===\nSouth Caloocan, where most commercial and industrial establishments are found, lies on generally flat and highly accessible land, with slopes ranging from 0-3%. The topography gradually changes into gently to moderately sloping to rolling along the [[North Luzon Expressway]], with slopes ranging from 3-18%. The highest point at 35.00 meters above sea level can be found in this area, while the lowest point is in the southern part of Dagat-Dagatan at about 0.993 meters above mean sea level.<ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\">http://caloocancity.gov.ph/images/pdfs/Caloocan-City-2017-2025-LCCAP.pdf</ref>\n\nNorth Caloocan is characterized with gently to steeply undulating to rolling topography with slopes ranging from 3-18%, mostly seen in the northern and central portion, gradually transforming into a southward trend of flat lands down to the southwestern tip of the boundary. Being accessible to major roads, many industrial and residential subdivisions have been developed in this near-level land.<ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\" />\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Topo Map Caloocan South.png|100x100px|thumb|Elevation map of south Caloocan]]\n[[File:Topo Map Caloocan North.png|100x100px|thumb|Elevation map of north Caloocan]]\nThe geologic formation of the two portions of Caloocan City varies in type and characteristics. and are specifically classified as quaternary [[alluvium]], [[tuff]] and tuffaceous sediment, [[pyroclastic flow]] deposit, and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]]. The formation on the eastern half of Metropolitan Manila extending to the coastline of Manila Bay and including a greater part of South Caloocan, is the quaternary [[alluvium]] - consisting of unconsolidated stream\u2010deposited sediments that includes sand, silt, clay or gravel.<ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\" />\n\nEastward of South Caloocan, large areas consisting of [[tuff]] and tuffaceous sediment can be traced, spreading towards the whole eastern side of Metropolitan Manila. [[Pyroclastic flow]] deposit or [[igneous rocks]] formed by the lithification of ash flow are likewise present in northern fringes of South Caloocan and in most parts of North Caloocan. On the northeast borders of North Caloocan, [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate rocks]] were traced, crossing Tala Estate and extending to the province of Bulacan and the La Mesa Watershed. <ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\" />\n\nSoil found in both areas of Caloocan City predominantly falls under the Novaliches Series, covering 96% of the total land area of the city. The Novaliches Series is composed of reddish brown soil, friable in consistency and granular in structure. Spherical concretions are present in the subsoil and underneath are tuffaceous material of varying degrees of disintegration and weathering. Tuffaceous material is exposed by extensive erosion in some places.<ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\" />\n\n===Surface Drainages===\nCaloocan City has surface waters that either have natural course (creeks and rivers) or constructed to serve as drainages to remove excess water from soil surfaces. South Caloocan has about a total of 5.0 km length of open drainage canals that serve mainly the reclamation area comprising Kaunlaran Village (Dagat-Dagatan Development Project) and nearly 11.3 km length of natural surface water coursing through the different natural river systems. These include the [[Tullahan River|Tinajeros-Tullahan River]] along the Caloocan-Valenzuela boundary; Maligaya Creek within [[La Loma Cemetery]] and crossing [[Rizal Avenue|Rizal Avenue Extension]]; Casili Creek which terminates in Estero de Maypajo, and Cantarilla/Panaca creek along the Caloocan-Malabon boundary. In North Caloocan, all surface waters consist of natural streams, the longest being the  Meycauayan-Marilao River dividing Caloocan and Bulacan. Others include the Bagong Silang River, Tala, Camarin, Pasong Malapad, and Bagumbong Creeks crossing multiple subdivisions, for a total of 52.7 km length within the City\u2019s territorial boundaries.<ref name=\"Caloocan City 2017-2025 Local Climate Change Action Plan\" />\n\n===Barangays===\n[[File:South_Caloocan_Barangay_Map_with_Area_Names.png|250x250px|thumb|Barangays of South Caloocan with corresponding area names]]\n[[File:North_Caloocan_Barangay_Map_with_Area_Names.png|250x250px|thumb|Barangays of North Caloocan with corresponding area names]]\n\nCaloocan is has 188 [[barangay]]s divided into 2 legislative districts divided by [[Samson Road]] and [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]. District 1 is composed of 70 barangays, which include Barangays 1-4, 77-85 and 132-188, while  District 2 is composed of 118 barangays, which include Barangays 5 to 76 and 86 to 131.<ref name=\"Caloocan City History\" /> The city uses a hybrid system for its barangays, further dividing the cities into 16 Zones. Among the cities in Metro Manila, only Manila, Pasay and Caloocan implement the so-called \"Zone Systems\". A zone is a group of barangays in a district. Although a zone is considered a subdivision in the local government units, the people do not elect a leader for the zone in a popular election similar to the normal barangay or local elections as the system is merely for statistical purposes. Further, all barangays have their corresponding numbers but only a few \u2014 mostly in the northern part \u2014 have corresponding names. However, names of barrios and districts do not necessarily coincide with barangay perimeters. Barangays in southern Caloocan are smaller compared to their northern counterparts.\n\nIn 1989, Republic Act 6714 called for reducing the 70 barangays constituting the first congressional district of Caloocan City to only thirty (30) barangays, while the 118 barangays composing the second congressional district of Caloocan City were to be reduced to thirty (30) barangays. It was presumably defeated in the plebiscite that followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1989/02/28/republic-act-no-6714/|title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6714 AN ACT MERGING, DIVIDING, AND/OR REVIVING THE DIFFERENT BARANGAYS IN CALOOCAN CITY AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES|last=|first=|date=February 28, 1989|website=Official Gazette of the Philippines.|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nBarangay Bagong Silang (176) is the most populous barangay in the country with a population of 246,515 people or 16% of the total population of Caloocan City.{{PH census|2015}} This was due to the continuous influx of informal settler families through relocation programs since the 1970s.
