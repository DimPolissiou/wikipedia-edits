Sans is initially introduced as a [[comic relief]] character but is eventually revealed to be one of the most knowledgeable characters in the game. He is depicted as a short, paunchy skeleton who wears a blue jacket, black basketball shorts with a white lining, pink slippers and a white t-shirt. He is also seen with pink slippers in ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' in his Mii costume. His name is based on the [[Comic Sans]] font, which is used for most of his in-game dialogue. The character was praised by critics for his dialogue and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fight]]. His popularity with fans inspired several user-created [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] and other types of projects, such as Underswap, Errortale, Inktale, or VSCOTale by tiktok user @sansfangirl to name a few. He likes to crack jokes and tell puns throughout ''Undertale'', unless the player does the no mercy route, where the player fights Sans in his boss fight. \n\nA version of the character also appears as brief cameo in the related game ''[[Deltarune]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/undertale-fans-already-have-theories-about-whats-going-1830165547|title=Undertale Fans Already Have Theories About What's Going On In Deltarune|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|date=November 1, 2018|website=Kotaku|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Sans' likeness also appears as a customizable skin for the Mii Gunner character in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

He clarifies that he has no interest in capturing humans, unlike Papyrus, who he describes as a \"human-hunting FANATIC.\" After helping the player hide from Papyrus, Sans follows his brother throughout most of the forest, commentating on his puzzles and even contributing a word search, much to Papyrus' dismay. As the story proceeds, Sans continues to be a regular source of comic relief, performing such antics as attempting to sell the player fried snow. Later in the game, Sans invites the player to go eat at a restaurant with him. As he talks, he explains how he befriended a woman (who is actually [[Toriel]]) behind the large door in Snowdin who shared an equal love for puns as he did. He explains how he made a promise not to kill any humans who come to the Underground and states if he didn't make that promise the player would have been dead where they stand. He also notes that a flower (evidently Flowey) had recently been speaking with Papyrus.\n\nSans makes one more appearance in the \"Judgement Hall\", where he reveals the true meaning of the \"EXP\" and \"LOVE\" values that the player has accumulated through the game: 'Execution Points' and 'Level of Violence', respectively. He judges the player for how high their EXP and LOVE values are before disappearing and letting the player proceed to fight the king, Asgore. After the player defeats Asgore (and Flowey, who attacks the player after Asgore's defeat) and leaves the Underground, Sans calls them to inform them of what occurred after their departure, having different dialogue depending on the player's actions in game.\n\nIf the player finishes the game without killing any monsters and befriending them, Sans appears after Asgore's defeat along with the other main characters, only to be captured by [[Flowey]] and have his soul absorbed along with most of the game's other monsters. However, he is restored after the reborn Asriel Dreemurr is defeated, being set free with everyone else and being able to leave the Underground.\n\nHowever, Sans' behavior changes completely if the player opts to kill every monster they encounter. He threatens the player with a \"bad time\" if they proceed with their actions before the Papyrus boss fight. If the player ignores Sans' warning and continues slaughtering every monster they encounter, he eventually confronts the player in the Judgement Hall to prevent them from destroying the world, acting as the route's [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]]. Sans puts up a fierce fight but is eventually slain by the player, allowing them to finish the route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/undertale-the-kotaku-review-1739735669|title=Undertale: The Kotaku Review|website=Kotaku}}</ref>\n\n===In ''Deltarune''===\nIn chapter one of ''[[Deltarune]]'', Sans is found standing outside his shop.

The film was originally to be a six-part television series called ''Sophiatown Short Stories'', but Maseko could not get the funding. The lead roles of Henry Nxumalo and ''Drum'' main photographer [[J\u00fcrgen Schadeberg]] were played by American actors [[Taye Diggs]] and [[Gabriel Mann]], while most of the rest of the cast were South African actors.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2004, and did the rounds of international film festivals before going on general release in South Africa in July 2006. It was released in Europe, but failed to get a distributor for the USA where it went straight to DVD.\n\nThe film was generally well received critically. Most of the negative reviews were based on the quality of Maseko's directing and Jason Filardi's screenwriting. It was awarded Best South African Film at the [[Durban International Film Festival]], and director Maseko gained the top prize at the [[Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou]] (FESPACO).\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is based on real events and real people and is set in the mid-1950s freehold township of [[Sophiatown]], [[Johannesburg]]&mdash; one of the few areas in South Africa where blacks could own property and drink alcoholic beverages. ''Drum'' begins with the central character, sportswriter [[Henry Nxumalo]], reporting on a boxing match with [[Nelson Mandela]]. Nxumalo leaves his wife Florence at home while going out into his community's night life and has an affair with a female singer. He works for ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' magazine, which was \"the first black lifestyle magazine in Africa.\"<ref name=\"swood\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001434701&anonymousId=-1702984527332281337&src=bchallenge|title=Drum Review|last=Wood|first=Sura|date=2005-11-04|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |accessdate=2009-01-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The magazine was financed by whites and had a multiracial staff; it was popular among the black community. ''Drum'''s British editor, [[James R. A. Bailey|Jim Bailey]] (Jason Flemyng), asks Nxumalo to write on the township crime scene, and Nxumalo, while at first unwilling, finally agrees. While on the job, he encounters Slim (Zola), a gang leader, that he had previously met in [[shebeen|illegal township drinking places]], and witnesses him kill a man in Sophiatown.\n\nInitially Nxumalo stays away from political articles, but eventually writes about more than entertainment after his wife and Mandela encourage him. When a young man goes missing at a [[Boer]] farm and is feared enslaved, Nxumalo decides to investigate [[undercover]]. He gets employment as a labourer at the farm, where he is treated like a slave and nearly killed. He becomes a celebrity when his story is published, further reinforced by getting himself in prison and reporting about its conditions. Nxumalo decides that his destiny is to be a [[muckraker]] and, with the help of the German photographer J\u00fcrgen Schadeberg (Gabriel Mann), ventures on more risky investigations.\n\nNxumalo frequently fights the racism and [[apartheid]] that is beginning to creep into his hometown. He tries to tackle stories important to his society's well-being. However, he is no match to the plan to evict residents and ultimately destroy Sophiatown. Constantly harassed by the government, at the end of the film he is stabbed to death. The attacker has never been identified.\n\n==Cast==\nAmerican actor [[Taye Diggs]] played the lead role of investigative journalist [[Henry Nxumalo]], with fellow American actor [[Gabriel Mann]] as his photographer [[J\u00fcrgen Schadeberg]], and South African Moshidi Motshegwa as his wife, Florence Nxumalo. The South African short-story author, [[Can Themba]], who also worked with Nxumalo at ''Drum'' magazine, was played by the little-known South African actor, Tumisho Masha. Apart from the British actor [[Jason Flemyng]] who took the part of Jim Bailey, the ex-R.A.F. pilot who owned ''Drum'', the rest of the parts were taken by South African actors, the best known being [[Zola (entertainer)|Zola]] (credited as Bonginkosi Dlamini) playing the part of Slim, the Sophiatown gang leader.\n\nNotable people portrayed in the film include [[Nelson Mandela]], played by [[Lindani Nkosi]]; jazz columnist [[Todd Matshikiza]] played by Fezile Mpela; and the writer [[Casey Motsisi]] played by Thapelo Mokoena.\n\nAptly portraying the music of the day, ([[Manhattan Brothers]]) was a fresh new outfit, formally approved by [[Miriam Makeba]] and Joe Mogotsi, the Junior Manhattan Brothers from Ladysmith, Kwa Zulu Natal.\n\n==Production==\n''Drum'' is [[Zola Maseko]]'s first feature film.

Kline, who gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, was mainly concerned with the film's \"rather clumsy\" direction and screenwriting. Maseko directed with \"energy and verve,\" though his \"struggles to capture the human drama\" led to the impression that ''Drum'' was \"a clunky TV movie, with awkward camera angles, wonky editing and clumsy sound recording.\" Filardi was guilty of a dialogue which \"echoes with cliches, while contrived plotting put characters into situations that may be true, but they feel corny and movie-like.\" Kline also criticised the wide variety of political issues that characterised the film, though added that \"maybe this helps us begin to understand what life must have been like under such an oppressive government.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowsonthewall.co.uk/04/art-s.htm#drum|title=Shadows Arthouse Films 2004: Drum|last=Kline|first=Rich|date=2004-10-31|work=Shadows on the Wall|accessdate=2009-01-12}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most critical reviews was by Francesca Dinglasan of ''Boxoffice Magazine''.

The film was originally to be a six-part television series called ''Sophiatown Short Stories'', but Maseko could not get the funding. The lead roles of Henry Nxumalo and ''Drum'' main photographer [[J\u00fcrgen Schadeberg]] were played by American actors [[Taye Diggs]] and [[Gabriel Mann]], while most of the rest of the cast were South African actors.\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in September 2004, and did the rounds of international film festivals before going on general release in South Africa in July 2006. It was released in Europe, but failed to get a distributor for the USA where it went straight to DVD.\n\nThe film was generally well received critically. Most of the negative reviews were based on the quality of Maseko's directing and Jason Filardi's screenwriting. It was awarded Best South African Film at the [[Durban International Film Festival]], and director Maseko gained the top prize at the [[Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou]] (FESPACO).\n\n==Plot==\nThe story is based on real events and real people and is set in the mid-1950s freehold township of [[Sophiatown]], [[Johannesburg]]&mdash; one of the few areas in South Africa where blacks could own property and drink alcoholic beverages. ''Drum'' begins with the central character, sportswriter [[Henry Nxumalo]], reporting on a boxing match with [[Nelson Mandela]]. Nxumalo leaves his wife Florence at home while going out into his community's night life and has an affair with a female singer. He works for ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' magazine, which was \"the first black lifestyle magazine in Africa.\"<ref name=\"swood\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001434701&anonymousId=-1702984527332281337&src=bchallenge|title=Drum Review|last=Wood|first=Sura|date=2005-11-04|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |accessdate=2009-01-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The magazine was financed by whites and had a multiracial staff; it was popular among the black community. ''Drum'''s British editor, [[James R. A. Bailey|Jim Bailey]] (Jason Flemyng), asks Nxumalo to write on the township crime scene, and Nxumalo, while at first unwilling, finally agrees. While on the job, he encounters Slim (Zola), a gang leader, that he had previously met in [[shebeen|illegal township drinking places]], and witnesses him kill a man in Sophiatown.\n\nInitially Nxumalo stays away from political articles, but eventually writes about more than entertainment after his wife and Mandela encourage him. When a young man goes missing at a [[Boer]] farm and is feared enslaved, Nxumalo decides to investigate [[undercover]]. He gets employment as a labourer at the farm, where he is treated like a slave and nearly killed. He becomes a celebrity when his story is published, further reinforced by getting himself in prison and reporting about its conditions. Nxumalo decides that his destiny is to be a [[muckracker]] and, with the help of the German photographer J\u00fcrgen Schadeberg (Gabriel Mann), ventures on more risky investigations.\n\nNxumalo frequently fights the racism and [[apartheid]] that is beginning to creep into his hometown. He tries to tackle stories important to his society's well-being. However, he is no match to the plan to evict residents and ultimately destroy Sophiatown. Constantly harassed by the government, at the end of the film he is stabbed to death. The attacker has never been identified.\n\n==Cast==\nAmerican actor [[Taye Diggs]] played the lead role of investigative journalist [[Henry Nxumalo]], with fellow American actor [[Gabriel Mann]] as his photographer [[J\u00fcrgen Schadeberg]], and South African Moshidi Motshegwa as his wife, Florence Nxumalo. The South African short-story author, [[Can Themba]], who also worked with Nxumalo at ''Drum'' magazine, was played by the little-known South African actor, Tumisho Masha. Apart from the British actor [[Jason Flemyng]] who took the part of Jim Bailey, the ex-R.A.F. pilot who owned ''Drum'', the rest of the parts were taken by South African actors, the best known being [[Zola (entertainer)|Zola]] (credited as Bonginkosi Dlamini) playing the part of Slim, the Sophiatown gang leader.\n\nNotable people portrayed in the film include [[Nelson Mandela]], played by [[Lindani Nkosi]]; jazz columnist [[Todd Matshikiza]] played by Fezile Mpela; and the writer [[Casey Motsisi]] played by Thapelo Mokoena.\n\nAptly portraying the music of the day, ([[Manhattan Brothers]]) was a fresh new outfit, formally approved by [[Miriam Makeba]] and Joe Mogotsi, the Junior Manhattan Brothers from Ladysmith, Kwa Zulu Natal.\n\n==Production==\n''Drum'' is [[Zola Maseko]]'s first feature film. He originally wanted to tell Sophiatown's story in a six-part television series called ''Sophiatown Short Stories''.

Kline, who gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, was mainly concerned with the film's \"rather clumsy\" direction and screenwriting. Maseko directed with \"energy and verve,\" though his \"struggles to capture the human drama\" led to the impression that ''Drum'' was \"a clunky TV movie, with awkward camera angles, wonky editing and clumsy sound recording.\" Filardi was guilty of a dialogue which \"echoes with cliches, while contrived plotting put characters into situations that may be true, but they feel corny and movie-like.\" Kline also criticised the wide variety of political issues that characterised the film, though added that \"maybe this helps us begin to understand what life must have been like under such an oppressive government.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowsonthewall.co.uk/04/art-s.htm#drum|title=Shadows Arthouse Films 2004: Drum|last=Kline|first=Rich|date=2004-10-31|work=Shadows on the Wall|accessdate=2009-01-12}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most critical reviews was by Francesca Dinglasan of ''Boxoffice Magazine''. Dinglasan, who gave ''Drum'' 2.5 out of 5 stars, was unimpressed by the \"unoriginal plotting techniques to convey the story of an investigative journalist attempting to expose racial injustices in a society coming to grips with the newly introduced edicts of apartheid.\" Although Diggs's acting was \"engaging\", according to her the film \"depends on just a few too many big-screen cliches and predictable plot turns.\" The \"richly designed sets and costumes\" were not able to overcome the less-than-satisfactory\" ''Drum''.<ref name=boxoffice/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*''Drum: The Making of a Magazine'', Jonathan Ball Publishers, 31 Aug 2005, {{ISBN|1-86842-211-9}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{AllRovi movie|314096|Drum}}\n* {{IMDb title|0379765|Drum}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|drum_2004}}\n\n{{Zola Maseko}}\n\n{{good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drum (2004 Film)}}\n[[Category:Apartheid films]]\n[[Category:2004 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American political drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s political drama films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:German-language films]]\n[[Category:Afrikaans-language films]]\n[[Category:South African films]]\n[[Category:South African drama films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in South Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Mandarax", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_(2004_film)"}

When the train makes an unexpected stop, a man named Larry approaches them selling souvenirs. Seeing Mr. Burns, he compares his face with an old photo and notes the resemblance. Suddenly the train pulls away, leaving Larry behind. While on their way home from visiting a cider mill, the [[Simpson family|Simpsons]] see Larry hitchhiking and give him a ride. They take him to Burns' mansion, where Larry reveals that he is the old man's son.\n\nBurns admits that Larry was the result of a one-night stand with the daughter of a former flame at a college reunion. At first, he is overjoyed to have a son and treats him as his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]]. He takes him to fancy parties and tries to enroll him at Yale, but Larry's oafish behavior embarrasses him. Larry starts working alongside [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] in Sector 7G at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] and they become friends. Larry invites Homer to dinner at the mansion, where Burns &mdash; no longer able to contain his displeasure at Larry's boorishness &mdash; says he wishes he had no son.\n\nAfter Homer convinces Larry to fake a kidnapping so that Burns will admit that he loves his son, he moves into the Simpsons' basement. Homer tells Burns that he can have Larry back if he admits that he loves him. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] discovers the plan and convinces Homer and Larry to abandon it, but they are spotted as they leave the house.\n\nHomer and Larry are chased into a cinema, where they climb atop the marquee and have a brief standoff with the police. Homer gives a heartfelt speech to justify Larry's actions and Burns forgives them for the hoax, but explains he cannot be the family whom Larry needs. Larry understands and reveals he has a wife and children back home who are probably worried about him. Burns and Larry say their goodbyes and the people of Springfield party outside the cinema.\n<ref name=officialsite/><ref name=\"Simpsguide\">{{cite book |last=Martyn |first=Warren |author2=Adrian Wood |title=I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Books |isbn=0-7535-0495-2 |pages=}}</ref><ref name=\"book\">{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |editor1-first=Ray |editor1-last=Richmond |editor1-link=Ray Richmond |editor2-first=Antonia |editor2-last=Coffman |title=[[The Simpsons episode guides#The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family|The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]] |edition=1st |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperPerennial]] |lccn=98141857 |ol=433519M |oclc=37796735 |isbn=978-0-06-095252-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/simpsonscomplete00groe/page/236 236] |ref={{harvid|Richmond & Coffman|1997}} }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:RodneyDangerfield1978.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Rodney Dangerfield]] voiced Larry Burns, whose [[Model sheet|character design]] was a mix between him and Mr. Burns.]]\n[[Ian Maxtone-Graham]] wrote the episode and it was his first writing credit for ''The Simpsons'', although he had served as a consultant on the show for several months.<ref name=\"Graham\">{{cite video |people=Maxtone-Graham, Ian |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode \"Burns, Baby Burns\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Maxtone-Graham had previously worked with showrunners [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] on a game show and the two had wanted to hire him as a writer on ''The Simpsons''.<ref name=\"Weinstein\">{{cite video |people=Weinstein, Josh |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode \"Burns, Baby Burns\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The episode started out as a story about Mr. Burns and [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] both being stationed in Paris during [[World War II]] and falling in love with the same woman, who had a love child.

When the train makes an unexpected stop, a man named Larry approaches them selling souvenirs. Seeing Mr. Burns, he compares his face with an old photo and notes the resemblance. Suddenly the train pulls away, leaving Larry behind. While on their way home from visiting a cider mill, the [[Simpson family|Simpsons]] see Larry hitchhiking and give him a ride. They take him to Burns' mansion, where Larry reveals that he is the old man's son.\n\nBurns admits that Larry was the result of a one-night stand with the daughter of a former flame at a college reunion. At first, he is overjoyed to have a son and treats him as his [[Mentorship|prot\u00e9g\u00e9]]. He takes him to fancy parties and tries to enroll him at Yale, but Larry's oafish behavior embarrasses him. Larry starts working alongside [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] in Sector 7G at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] and they become friends. Larry invites Homer to dinner at the mansion, where Burns &mdash; no longer able to contain his displeasure at Larry's boorishness &mdash; says he wishes he had no son.\n\nAfter Homer convinces Larry to fake a kidnapping so that Burns will admit that he loves his son, he moves into the Simpsons' basement. Homer tells Burns that he can have Larry back if he admits that he loves him. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] discovers the plan and convinces Homer and Larry to abandon it, but they are spotted as they leave the house.\n\nHomer and Larry are chased into a cinema, where they climb atop the marquee and have a brief standoff with the police. Homer gives a heartfelt speech to justify Larry's actions and Burns forgives them for the hoax, but explains he cannot be the family whom Larry needs. Larry understands and reveals he has a wife and children back home who are probably worried about him. Burns and Larry say their goodbyes and the people of Springfield party outside the cinema.\n<ref name=officialsite/><ref name=\"Simpsguide\">{{cite book |last=Martyn |first=Warren |author2=Adrian Wood |title=I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide |year=2000 |publisher=Virgin Books |isbn=0-7535-0495-2 |pages=}}</ref><ref name=\"book\">{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |editor1-first=Ray |editor1-last=Richmond |editor1-link=Ray Richmond |editor2-first=Antonia |editor2-last=Coffman |title=[[The Simpsons episode guides#The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family|The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]] |edition=1st |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperPerennial]] |lccn=98141857 |ol=433519M |oclc=37796735 |isbn=978-0-06-095252-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/simpsonscomplete00groe/page/236 236] |ref={{harvid|Richmond & Coffman|1997}} }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:RodneyDangerfield1978.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Rodney Dangerfield]] voiced Larry Burns, whose [[Model sheet|character design]] was a mix between him and Mr. Burns.]]\n[[Ian Maxtone-Graham]] wrote the episode and it was his first writing credit for ''The Simpsons'', although he had served as a consultant on the show for several months.<ref name=\"Graham\">{{cite video |people=Maxtone-Graham, Ian |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode \"Burns, Baby Burns\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Maxtone-Graham had previously worked with showrunners [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]] on a game show and the two had wanted to hire him as a writer on ''The Simpsons''.<ref name=\"Weinstein\">{{cite video |people=Weinstein, Josh |date=2006 |title=The Simpsons season 8 DVD commentary for the episode \"Burns, Baby Burns\" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The episode started out as a story about Mr. Burns and [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]] both being stationed in Paris during [[World War II]] and falling in love with the same woman, who had a love child.
