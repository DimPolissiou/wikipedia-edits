The fifth bus contained eleven passengers who were foreign nationals, had no next of kin, or were otherwise individuals no one would report as missing. The buses were contracted by Unified Dynamic Systems (UDS), a large corporation involved in many industries. After getting some information from a translator, Michaela locates a farm where UDS is experimenting on the eleven passengers, but she and Jared are chased away by armed men. Ben confronts Vance about the missing passengers, believing the NSA is behind their disappearance and threatens to tell the press. Although Vance has dossiers on the eleven passengers showing they are accounted for, he leads a team to investigate the farm location.

Following an Xer meeting, Simon advises Jared to keep an eye on Billy as he can be a loose cannon. Michaela and Drea witness Jared leaving the bar and kissing Tamara. After Drea infiltrate the bar and interacts with Billy, Michaela finds that Billy has had some arrest records. As the ruined nightclub is used for memorials, Ben's latest Calling takes him to a zen mediation center. When he brings Olive, another chanting Calling leads them underground where they find TJ still alive underground. With a warrant from Judge Trilling, Michaela secretly plants a bug in the bar, obtains evidence Jared is working with the Xers, and gives it to Bowers. Bowers privately shares the information with Jared. Saanvi kisses her former lover and fellow doctor, Alex, in a park.

Michaela states that she won't continue until she gets a [[union representative]] by her side. Jared confronts Simon about the situation, and Simon says Michaela is a threat who must be disposed of. Cal's latest Calling is shared with Ben, Grace, and a recuperating TJ, where they try to build something during what appears to be a thunderstorm outside. Thanks to some clues, they managed to pull together a makeshift ship's rigging, which briefly places them on an ancient boat from which they see Flight 828 in the sky; they also learn that the ancient mariners who tried to get rid of the Callings went mad. Alex is able to get a counter-agent injected into Saanvi as she advises her to be careful.

Shortly after, Adrian rescues a kayaker from the river. At the hospital, Ben has to make a choice to save Grace or the baby as the specialist surgeon hasn't arrived yet, and he chooses Grace (against her wishes).

Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of [[Panagiotis Kavvadias]] of 1885\u201390. The findings of this dig allowed [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]], then director of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by D\u00f6rpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed.<ref>W.

This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885\u201390 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.<ref>P.

However, the excavations of [[Bert Hodge Hill]] led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of [[Cimon|Kimon]] after 468&nbsp;BC.<ref>B.H. Hill, \"The Older Parthenon\", ''AJA', XVI, 1912, 535\u201358</ref> Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step D\u00f6rpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was in fact the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at {{convert|23.51|x|66.888|m|2|lk=on}}.\n\nOne difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation the archaeological method of [[seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to discuss and make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925\u201333.<ref>B. Graef, E. Langlotz, ''Die Antiken Vasen von der Akropolis zu Athen'', Berlin 1925\u201333</ref> This inspired American archaeologist [[William Bell Dinsmoor]] to attempt to supply limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis. Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495&nbsp;BC, contradicting the early date given by D\u00f6rpfeld.<ref>W. Dinsmoor, \"The Date of the Older Parthenon\", ''AJA'', XXXVIII, 1934, 408\u201348</ref> Further, Dinsmoor denied that there were two proto-Parthenons, and held that the only pre-Periclean temple was what D\u00f6rpfeld referred to as Parthenon II.

The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today \u2013 the Parthenon, the [[Propylaia]], the [[Erechtheion]] and the temple of [[Athena Nike]] \u2013 were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of the artist [[Phidias]], who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects [[Ictinos]] and [[Callicrates]] began their work in 447 BC, and the building was substantially completed by 432. However, work on the decorations continued until at least 431.\n\n[[File:Parthenon restoration.gif|thumb|Parthenon animation showing the building in the past and in present day]]\nThe Parthenon was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the Pentelic marble. If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools -- picks, points, punches, chisels and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nA big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who traveled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a very specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel around and work where they were needed.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nOther craftsmen also were necessary in the building of the Parthenon, specifically carpenters and metalworkers. Unskilled laborers also had key roles in the building of the Parthenon. These laborers loaded and unloaded the marble blocks and moved the blocks from place to place. In order to complete a project like the Parthenon, a number of different laborers were needed, and each played a critical role in constructing the final building.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Parthenon plan.png|thumb|right|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]\n\nThe Parthenon is a [[peripteral]] [[octastyle]] [[Doric order|Doric]] temple with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] architectural features. It stands on a platform or [[stylobate]] of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of [[post and lintel]] construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an [[entablature]]. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and 17 on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the ''[[cella]],'' which is divided into two compartments. At either end of the building the [[gable]] is finished with a triangular [[pediment]] originally occupied by sculpted figures. The columns are of the [[Doric order|Doric order,]] with simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a [[frieze]] of carved pictorial panels ([[Metope (architecture)|metopes]]), separated by formal architectural [[triglyph]]s, typical of the Doric order. Around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns runs a continuous sculptured [[frieze]] in low relief. This element of the architecture is [[Ionic order|Ionic]] in style rather than Doric.<ref>Banister Fletcher, ''History of architecture on the Comparative Method'', pp. 119\u2013123</ref>\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are {{convert|69.5|by|30.9|m|ft}}. The cella was 29.8&nbsp;meters long by 19.2&nbsp;meters wide (97.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;63.0&nbsp;ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure {{convert|1.9|m|ft}} in diameter and are {{convert|10.4|m|ft}} high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column containing 20 flutes. (A flute is the [[wikt:concave|concave]] shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as [[imbrex and tegula|imbrices and tegulae]].<ref>{{cite book|title=American Architect and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIdMAAAAYAAJ|year=1892|publisher=American Architect}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Tegula.html|title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Roman Architecture \u2014 Roof Tiles (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=8 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. The temple, wrote [[John Julius Cooper]], \"Enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built. Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns.\"<ref>John Julius Norwich, ''Great Architecture of the World'', 2001, p. 63</ref><!-- If we must have this quote let's at least get it right. --> ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the slight swelling, of {{convert|4|cm}}, in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,<ref>And in the surviving foundations of the preceding Older Parthenon (Penrose, ''Principles of Athenian Architecture'' 2nd ed. ch. II.3, plate 9).</ref> it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outward, but they actually lean slightly inward so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly {{convert|2400|m|mi}} above the center of the Parthenon<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.architecturerevived.com/how-greek-temples-correct-visual-distortion/ |title = How Greek Temples Correct Visual Distortion \u2013 Architecture Revived}}</ref>. Since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: \"All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.<ref>Penrose ''op. cit.'' pp. 32\u201334, found the difference motivated by economies of labour; Gorham P. Stevens, \"Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon\" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''66'''.3 (July 1962:337\u2013338).</ref>\n\nIt is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these \"optical refinements\" was. They may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion.\"<ref>Archeologists discuss similarly curved architecture and offer the theory.

In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves. But the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.<ref name=SmithMag>{{Citation|last=Hadingham|first=Evan|year=February 2008|title=Unlocking Mysteries of the Parthenon |publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|location= Washington, DC|page=42}}</ref>\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its fa\u00e7ade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the [[golden ratio]].<ref>Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., \"Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis,\" ''Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46, 1998.</ref> However, such theories have been discredited by more recent studies, which have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.<ref>{{cite journal|author=George Markowsky|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|title=Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 1992|access-date=4 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408200850/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|archive-date=8 April 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|authorlink=Mario Livio|title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World's Most Astonishing Number|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUARfgWRH14C|origyear=2002|edition=First trade paperback|year=2003|publisher=[[Random House|Broadway Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-7679-0816-3|pages=74\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Sculpture==\n[[File:British Museum (8375482047).jpg|thumb|Group from the east pediment, [[British Museum]].]]\nThe cella of the Parthenon housed the [[Athena Parthenos|chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos]] sculpted by [[Phidias]] and dedicated in 439 or 438&nbsp;BC.

In the ''[[opisthodomos]]'' (the back room of the cella) were stored the monetary contributions of the Delian League, of which Athens was the leading member.\n\nOnly a very small number of the sculptures remain ''in situ''; most of the surviving sculptures are today (controversially) in the [[British Museum]] in London (as with the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles]]) and the [[Acropolis Museum]] in Athens, with a few pieces in the [[Louvre]], [[National Museum of Denmark]], and museums in Rome, [[Vienna]], and [[Palermo]].<ref>For comprehensive drawings showing the location of each piece today, see: [https://www.academia.edu/2543561/The_Parthenon= \"The Parthenon\", in ''Strolling Through Athens''], City of Athens, 2004, pp. 112\u2013119.</ref>\n\n===Metopes===\n{{Main|Metopes of the Parthenon}}\n[[File:Parthenon XL.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the West metopes]]\n\nThe frieze of the Parthenon's entablature contained 92 [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]], 14 each on the east and west sides, 32 each on the north and south sides.

These were the first serious negotiations for several years, and there were hopes that the two sides may move a step closer to a resolution.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6578661.stm Talks Due on Elgin Marbles Return], BBC News</ref>\n\n==Restoration==\n[[File:Restoration work Parthenon facade Acropolis Athens Greece.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration works in 2015]]\nIn 1975, the Greek government began a concerted effort to restore the Parthenon and other Acropolis structures. After some delay, a Committee for the Conservation of the Acropolis Monuments was established in 1983.<ref>[http://www.arcchip.cz/w09/w09_lambrinou.pdf Lina Lambrinou, \"State of the Art: \u2018Parthenon of Athens: A Challenge Throughout History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003065235/http://www.arcchip.cz/w09/w09_lambrinou.pdf |date=3 October 2008 }} (pdf file) with bibliography of interim conservation reports;</ref> The project later attracted funding and technical assistance from the [[European Union]]. An archaeological committee thoroughly documented every [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] remaining on the site, and architects assisted with [[computer model]]s to determine their original locations. Particularly important and fragile sculptures were transferred to the Acropolis Museum. A crane was installed for moving marble blocks; the crane was designed to fold away beneath the roofline when not in use. In some cases, prior re-constructions were found to be incorrect. These were dismantled, and a careful process of restoration began.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081003065234/http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/papers/Athens2007/FP111.pdf \"The Surface Conservation Project\"] (pdf file). Once they had been conserved, the West Frieze blocks were moved to the museum, and copies cast in artificial stone were reinstalled in their places.</ref> Originally, various blocks were held together by elongated iron '''H''' pins that were completely coated in lead, which protected the iron from corrosion. Stabilizing pins added in the 19th century were not so coated, and corroded. Since the corrosion product (rust) is expansive, the expansion caused further damage by cracking the marble.<ref>{{cite magazine |title =Unlocking the Mysteries of the Parthenon |author=Hadingham, Evan |magazine=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/parthenon.html |accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right\n | headerimage=[[File:Dionysos pediment Parthenon BM.jpg|210px]]\n | video1 = [http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html Sculpture from the Parthenon's East Pediment], [[Smarthistory]]<ref name=\"smarth\">{{cite web | title =Sculpture from the Parthenon's East Pediment | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html | accessdate =18 March 2013 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130304063318/http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html | archive-date =4 March 2013 | url-status =dead | df =dmy-all }}</ref> }}\n* [[Palermo Fragment]]\n* [[Ancient Greek architecture]]\n* [[Ancient Greek temple]]\n* [[List of Ancient Greek temples]]\n* [[List of megalithic sites]]\n* [[National Monument of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]]\n* [[Walhalla temple]] [[Regensburg]] \u2013 Exterior modeled on the Parthenon, but interior is a hall of fame for distinguished Germans\n* [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] \u2013 Full-scale replica\n* [[Temple of Hephaestus]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Printed sources===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Burkert|title=Greek Religion|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-36281-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/greekreligion0000burk}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Connelly |first=Joan Breton|authorlink=Joan Breton Connelly|date=1 January 1996|title=Parthenon and Parthenoi: A Mythological Interpretation of the Parthenon Frieze |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=100 |issue=1 |doi=10.2307/506297 |jstor=506297 |pages=53\u201380}}\n* {{cite book | last = Connelly | first = Joan Breton | title = The Parthenon Enigma: A New Understanding of the West's Most Iconic Building and the People who Made It | publisher = Random House | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-307-47659-3 | author-link = Joan Breton Connelly | url = https://archive.org/details/parthenonenigma0000conn | url-access = registration }}\n* {{cite book | last = D'Ooge | first = Martin Luther | title = The Acropolis of Athens | url = https://archive.org/details/acropolisofathen00dooguoft | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1909}}\n* {{cite book |last=Frazer |first= Sir James George|title=The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=The King of the Woods|isbn=978-0-19-283541-3}}\n* {{cite book | last = Freely | first = John | title = Strolling Through Athens: Fourteen Unforgettable Walks through Europe's Oldest City | publisher = Tauris Parke Paperbacks | year = 2004 | edition=2 |isbn = 978-1-85043-595-2}}\n* {{cite book | last = Hollis | first = Edward | title = The Secret Lives of Buildings: From the Ruins of the Parthenon to the Vegas Strip in Thirteen Stories | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-8050-8785-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/secretlivesofbui0000holl }}\n* {{cite book |last=Hurwit |first=Jeffrey M. |title=The Athenian Acropolis: History, Mythology, and Archeology from the Neolithic Era to the Present |year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42834-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hurwit|first=Jeffrey M.|title=Periklean Athens and Its Legacy: Problems and Perspectives|year=2005|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-70622-4|editor=Judith M.

Further physical evidence of this structure was revealed with the excavations of [[Panagiotis Kavvadias]] of 1885\u201390. The findings of this dig allowed [[Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld]], then director of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], to assert that there existed a distinct substructure to the original Parthenon, called Parthenon I by D\u00f6rpfeld, not immediately below the present edifice as had been previously assumed.<ref>W. D\u00f6rpfeld, \"Der aeltere Parthenon\", ''Ath. Mitteilungen'', XVII, 1892, pp. 158\u2013189 and W.

This platform was smaller and slightly to the north of the final Parthenon, indicating that it was built for a wholly different building, now completely covered over. This picture was somewhat complicated by the publication of the final report on the 1885\u201390 excavations, indicating that the substructure was contemporary with the Kimonian walls, and implying a later date for the first temple.<ref>P.

However, the excavations of [[Bert Hodge Hill]] led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of [[Cimon|Kimon]] after 468&nbsp;BC.<ref>B.H. Hill, \"The Older Parthenon\", ''AJA', XVI, 1912, 535\u201358</ref> Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step D\u00f6rpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was in fact the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at {{convert|23.51|x|66.888|m|2|lk=on}}.\n\nOne difficulty in dating the proto-Parthenon is that at the time of the 1885 excavation the archaeological method of [[seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] was not fully developed; the careless digging and refilling of the site led to a loss of much valuable information. An attempt to discuss and make sense of the potsherds found on the Acropolis came with the two-volume study by Graef and Langlotz published in 1925\u201333.<ref>B. Graef, E. Langlotz, ''Die Antiken Vasen von der Akropolis zu Athen'', Berlin 1925\u201333</ref> This inspired American archaeologist [[William Bell Dinsmoor]] to attempt to supply limiting dates for the temple platform and the five walls hidden under the re-terracing of the Acropolis. Dinsmoor concluded that the latest possible date for Parthenon I was no earlier than 495&nbsp;BC, contradicting the early date given by D\u00f6rpfeld.<ref>W. Dinsmoor, \"The Date of the Older Parthenon\", ''AJA'', XXXVIII, 1934, 408\u201348</ref> Further, Dinsmoor denied that there were two proto-Parthenons, and held that the only pre-Periclean temple was what D\u00f6rpfeld referred to as Parthenon II. Dinsmoor and D\u00f6rpfeld exchanged views in the ''American Journal of Archaeology'' in 1935.<ref>W. D\u00f6rpfeld, \"Parthenon I, II, III\", ''AJA'', XXXIX, 1935, 497\u2013507, and W.

The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today \u2013 the Parthenon, the [[Propylaia]], the [[Erechtheion]] and the temple of [[Athena Nike]] \u2013 were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of the artist [[Phidias]], who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects [[Ictinos]] and [[Callicrates]] began their work in 447 BC, and the building was substantially completed by 432. However, work on the decorations continued until at least 431.\n\n[[File:Parthenon restoration.gif|thumb|Parthenon animation showing the building in the past and in present day]]\nThe Parthenon was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the Pentelic marble. If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools -- picks, points, punches, chisels and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nA big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who traveled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a very specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel around and work where they were needed.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nOther craftsmen also were necessary in the building of the Parthenon, specifically carpenters and metalworkers. Unskilled laborers also had key roles in the building of the Parthenon. These laborers loaded and unloaded the marble blocks and moved the blocks from place to place. In order to complete a project like the Parthenon, a number of different laborers were needed, and each played a critical role in constructing the final building.<ref>Woodford, S. (2008). The Parthenon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Parthenon plan.png|thumb|right|Floor plan of the Parthenon]]\n\nThe Parthenon is a [[peripteral]] [[octastyle]] [[Doric order|Doric]] temple with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] architectural features. It stands on a platform or [[stylobate]] of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of [[post and lintel]] construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an [[entablature]]. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and 17 on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the ''[[cella]],'' which is divided into two compartments. At either end of the building the [[gable]] is finished with a triangular [[pediment]] originally occupied by sculpted figures. The columns are of the [[Doric order|Doric order,]] with simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a [[frieze]] of carved pictorial panels ([[Metope (architecture)|metopes]]), separated by formal architectural [[triglyph]]s, typical of the Doric order. Around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns runs a continuous sculptured [[frieze]] in low relief. This element of the architecture is [[Ionic order|Ionic]] in style rather than Doric.<ref>Banister Fletcher, ''History of architecture on the Comparative Method'', pp. 119\u2013123</ref>\n\nMeasured at the stylobate, the dimensions of the base of the Parthenon are {{convert|69.5|by|30.9|m|ft}}. The cella was 29.8&nbsp;meters long by 19.2&nbsp;meters wide (97.8&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;63.0&nbsp;ft). On the exterior, the Doric columns measure {{convert|1.9|m|ft}} in diameter and are {{convert|10.4|m|ft}} high. The corner columns are slightly larger in diameter. The Parthenon had 46 outer columns and 23 inner columns in total, each column containing 20 flutes. (A flute is the [[wikt:concave|concave]] shaft carved into the column form.) The roof was covered with large overlapping marble tiles known as [[imbrex and tegula|imbrices and tegulae]].<ref>{{cite book|title=American Architect and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIdMAAAAYAAJ|year=1892|publisher=American Architect}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Tegula.html|title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Roman Architecture \u2014 Roof Tiles (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|website=penelope.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=8 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. The temple, wrote [[John Julius Cooper]], \"Enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built. Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the [[naos (architecture)|naos]] walls and the ''entasis'' of the columns.\"<ref>John Julius Norwich, ''Great Architecture of the World'', 2001, p. 63</ref><!-- If we must have this quote let's at least get it right. --> ''[[Entasis]]'' refers to the slight swelling, of {{convert|4|cm}}, in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,<ref>And in the surviving foundations of the preceding Older Parthenon (Penrose, ''Principles of Athenian Architecture'' 2nd ed. ch. II.3, plate 9).</ref> it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outward, but they actually lean slightly inward so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly {{convert|2400|m|mi}} above the center of the Parthenon<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.architecturerevived.com/how-greek-temples-correct-visual-distortion/ |title = How Greek Temples Correct Visual Distortion \u2013 Architecture Revived}}</ref>. Since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the [[architrave]] and roof above: \"All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves\", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.<ref>Penrose ''op. cit.'' pp. 32\u201334, found the difference motivated by economies of labour; Gorham P. Stevens, \"Concerning the Impressiveness of the Parthenon\" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''66'''.3 (July 1962:337\u2013338).</ref>\n\nIt is not universally agreed what the intended effect of these \"optical refinements\" was. They may serve as a sort of \"reverse optical illusion.\"<ref>Archeologists discuss similarly curved architecture and offer the theory.

In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow in the presence of the surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an inert mass in the case of a building without curves. But the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.<ref name=SmithMag>{{Citation|last=Hadingham|first=Evan|year=February 2008|title=Unlocking Mysteries of the Parthenon |publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|location= Washington, DC|page=42}}</ref>\n\nSome studies of the Acropolis, including of the Parthenon and its fa\u00e7ade, have conjectured that many of its proportions approximate the [[golden ratio]].<ref>Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., \"Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis,\" ''Philosophical Polemic Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46, 1998.</ref> However, such theories have been discredited by more recent studies, which have shown that the proportions of the Parthenon do not match the golden proportion.<ref>{{cite journal|author=George Markowsky|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|title=Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=23|issue=1|date=January 1992|access-date=4 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408200850/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf|archive-date=8 April 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|authorlink=Mario Livio|title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, the World's Most Astonishing Number|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUARfgWRH14C|origyear=2002|edition=First trade paperback|year=2003|publisher=[[Random House|Broadway Books]]|location=New York City|isbn=0-7679-0816-3|pages=74\u20135}}</ref>\n\n==Sculpture==\n[[File:British Museum (8375482047).jpg|thumb|Group from the east pediment, [[British Museum]].]]\nThe cella of the Parthenon housed the [[Athena Parthenos|chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos]] sculpted by [[Phidias]] and dedicated in 439 or 438&nbsp;BC.

In the ''[[opisthodomos]]'' (the back room of the cella) were stored the monetary contributions of the Delian League, of which Athens was the leading member.\n\nOnly a very small number of the sculptures remain ''in situ''; most of the surviving sculptures are today (controversially) in the [[British Museum]] in London (as with the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon Marbles]]) and the [[Acropolis Museum]] in Athens, with a few pieces in the [[Louvre]], [[National Museum of Denmark]], and museums in Rome, [[Vienna]], and [[Palermo]].<ref>For comprehensive drawings showing the location of each piece today, see: [https://www.academia.edu/2543561/The_Parthenon= \"The Parthenon\", in ''Strolling Through Athens''], City of Athens, 2004, pp. 112\u2013119.</ref>\n\n===Metopes===\n{{Main|Metopes of the Parthenon}}\n[[File:Parthenon XL.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the West metopes]]\n\nThe frieze of the Parthenon's entablature contained 92 [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]], 14 each on the east and west sides, 32 each on the north and south sides.

The metopes of the east side of the Parthenon, above the main entrance, depict the [[Gigantomachy]] (the mythical battle between the Olympian gods and the [[Gigantes|Giants]]). The metopes of the west end show the [[Amazonomachy]] (the mythical battle of the Athenians against the [[Amazons]]). The metopes of the south side show the Thessalian [[Centauromachy]] (battle of the [[Lapiths]] aided by [[Theseus]] against the half-man, half-horse [[Centaur]]s).

The experts discovered the metopes while processing 2,250 photos with modern photographic methods, as the white Pentelic [[marble]] they are made of differed from the other stone of the wall. It was previously presumed that the missing metopes were destroyed during the Morosini explosion of the Parthenon in 1687.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2011/03/04/archaeologists-discover-new-metopes-of-parthenon/Discovery|title=Discovery Reveals Ancient Greek Theaters Used Moveable Stages Over 2,000 Years Ago |website=greece.greekreporter.com}}</ref>\n\n\n===Frieze===\n{{Main|Parthenon Frieze}}\n[[File:1868 Lawrence Alma-Tadema - Phidias Showing the Frieze of the Parthenon to his Friends.jpg|thumb|''[[Phidias]] Showing the Frieze of the Parthenon to his Friends'', 1868 painting by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]\n\nThe most characteristic feature in the architecture and decoration of the temple is the Ionic [[frieze]] running around the exterior of the cella walls. The [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]] frieze was carved in situ and is dated to 442&nbsp;BC-438&nbsp;BC.\n\nOne interpretation is that it depicts an idealized version of the [[Panathenaic Festival|Panathenaic procession]] from the [[Dipylon Gate]] in the [[Kerameikos]] to the [[Acropolis]]. In this procession held every year, with a special procession taking place every four years, Athenians and foreigners participated in honoring the goddess [[Athena]] by offering her sacrifices and a new [[peplos]] (a dress woven by selected noble Athenian girls called {{Lang|grc-Latn|ergastines}}).

She identifies the central panel above the door of the Parthenon as the pre-battle sacrifice of the daughter of [[King Erechtheus]], a sacrifice that ensured Athenian victory over [[Eumolpos]] and his Thracian army. The great procession marching toward the east end of the Parthenon shows the post-battle thanksgiving sacrifice of cattle and sheep, honey and water, followed by the triumphant army of Erechtheus returning from their victory. This represents the very first Panathenaia set in mythical times, the model on which historic Panathenaic processions was based.<ref>Connelly, ''Parthenon and Parthenoi'', 53\u201380.</ref><ref>Connelly, ''The Parthenon Enigma'', chapters 4, 5, and 7.</ref>\n\n===Pediments===\n{{Main|Pediments of the Parthenon}}\nThe traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], when he visited the Acropolis at the end of the 2nd century AD, only mentioned briefly the sculptures of the [[pediment]]s (gable ends) of the temple, reserving the majority of his description for the gold and ivory statue of the goddess inside.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias1B.html |title=Description of Greece |author=Pausanias |author-link=Pausanias (geographer) |translator-first=W.H.S. |translator-last=Jones |year=1918 |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=Harvard University Press |at=Book 1, 24.5}}</ref>\n\n====East pediment====\n[[File:Partenon04.JPG|thumb|Part of the east pediment still found on the Parthenon (although part of it, like Dionysos, is a copy)]]\n\nThe figures on the corners of the pediment depict the passage of time over the course of a full day.

Amongst those early travellers and archaeologists were [[James Stuart (1713\u20131788)|James Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]], who were commissioned by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] to survey the ruins of classical Athens. What they produced was the first measured drawings of the Parthenon published in 1787 in the second volume of ''Antiquities of Athens Measured and Delineated''. In 1801, the British Ambassador at [[Constantinople]], the [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Earl of Elgin]], obtained a questionable ''firman'' (edict) from the [[Sultan]], whose existence or legitimacy has not been proved to this day, to make casts and drawings of the antiquities on the Acropolis, to demolish recent buildings if this was necessary to view the antiquities, and to remove sculptures from them.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Independent Greece===\nWhen independent Greece gained control of Athens in 1832, the visible section of the minaret was demolished; only its base and spiral staircase up to the level of the [[architrave]] remain intact.<ref>{{cite book | last = Murray | first = John | title = Handbook for travellers in Greece, Volume 2 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1884 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ac4GAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA317 | page = 317}}</ref> Soon all the medieval and Ottoman buildings on the Acropolis were destroyed.

An archaeological committee thoroughly documented every [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] remaining on the site, and architects assisted with [[computer model]]s to determine their original locations. Particularly important and fragile sculptures were transferred to the Acropolis Museum. A crane was installed for moving marble blocks; the crane was designed to fold away beneath the roofline when not in use. In some cases, prior re-constructions were found to be incorrect. These were dismantled, and a careful process of restoration began.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20081003065234/http://cipa.icomos.org/fileadmin/papers/Athens2007/FP111.pdf \"The Surface Conservation Project\"] (pdf file). Once they had been conserved, the West Frieze blocks were moved to the museum, and copies cast in artificial stone were reinstalled in their places.</ref> Originally, various blocks were held together by elongated iron '''H''' pins that were completely coated in lead, which protected the iron from corrosion. Stabilizing pins added in the 19th century were not so coated, and corroded. Since the corrosion product (rust) is expansive, the expansion caused further damage by cracking the marble.<ref>{{cite magazine |title =Unlocking the Mysteries of the Parthenon |author=Hadingham, Evan |magazine=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] |year=2008 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/parthenon.html |accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right\n | headerimage=[[File:Dionysos pediment Parthenon BM.jpg|210px]]\n | video1 = [http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html Sculpture from the Parthenon's East Pediment], [[Smarthistory]]<ref name=\"smarth\">{{cite web | title =Sculpture from the Parthenon's East Pediment | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html | accessdate =18 March 2013 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130304063318/http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Sculpture-from-the-Parthenons-East-Pediment.html | archive-date =4 March 2013 | url-status =dead | df =dmy-all }}</ref> }}\n* [[Palermo Fragment]]\n* [[Ancient Greek architecture]]\n* [[Ancient Greek temple]]\n* [[List of Ancient Greek temples]]\n* [[List of megalithic sites]]\n* [[National Monument of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]]\n* [[Walhalla temple]] [[Regensburg]] \u2013 Exterior modeled on the Parthenon, but interior is a hall of fame for distinguished Germans\n* [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] \u2013 Full-scale replica\n* [[Temple of Hephaestus]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Printed sources===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Burkert|title=Greek Religion|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-36281-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/greekreligion0000burk}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Connelly |first=Joan Breton|authorlink=Joan Breton Connelly|date=1 January 1996|title=Parthenon and Parthenoi: A Mythological Interpretation of the Parthenon Frieze |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=100 |issue=1 |doi=10.2307/506297 |jstor=506297 |pages=53\u201380}}\n* {{cite book | last = Connelly | first = Joan Breton | title = The Parthenon Enigma: A New Understanding of the West's Most Iconic Building and the People who Made It | publisher = Random House | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-0-307-47659-3 | author-link = Joan Breton Connelly | url = https://archive.org/details/parthenonenigma0000conn | url-access = registration }}\n* {{cite book | last = D'Ooge | first = Martin Luther | title = The Acropolis of Athens | url = https://archive.org/details/acropolisofathen00dooguoft | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1909}}\n* {{cite book |last=Frazer |first= Sir James George|title=The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=The King of the Woods|isbn=978-0-19-283541-3}}\n* {{cite book | last = Freely | first = John | title = Strolling Through Athens: Fourteen Unforgettable Walks through Europe's Oldest City | publisher = Tauris Parke Paperbacks | year = 2004 | edition=2 |isbn = 978-1-85043-595-2}}\n* {{cite book | last = Hollis | first = Edward | title = The Secret Lives of Buildings: From the Ruins of the Parthenon to the Vegas Strip in Thirteen Stories | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-8050-8785-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/secretlivesofbui0000holl }}\n* {{cite book |last=Hurwit |first=Jeffrey M. |title=The Athenian Acropolis: History, Mythology, and Archeology from the Neolithic Era to the Present |year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42834-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hurwit|first=Jeffrey M.|title=Periklean Athens and Its Legacy: Problems and Perspectives|year=2005|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-70622-4|editor=Judith M.

The events of the voyage led to witch trials and executions in Denmark and Scotland.\n\n==Career==\nPeder Munk was the son of Ludvig Munk (d. 1537) and Kirstin Pedersdatte Lykke.

The cut-down was created to modernize the appearance and improve the performance of the aging J-series Harley-Davidson.  By removing the front fender, shortening the rear, and removing all excess accessories, the motorcycle was significantly lightened.  The cut-down was also characterized by a modified frame, in which the seat tube was lowered and the wheelbase shortened, resulting in a lower, shorter machine, with a sweeping diagonal line between the steering head and rear axle.\n\nIn 1933 the [[American Motorcyclist Association|AMA]] introduced Class C racing, which stipulated only catalogued racing motorcycles could be used in sanctioned competition, with points gained towards the National Championship.  Class C racers such as the [[Indian Motorcycles|Indian]] Daytona Scout <ref>'The Harley-Davidson and Indian Wars', Girdler, 1997, MBI, St. Paul, {{ISBN|0-7603-0208-1}}</ref> and Harley-Davidson WLDR and WR <ref>'Harley Davidson Racing 1934-1986', Girdler, 1987, MBI, St.Paul, {{ISBN|0-7603-1217-6}}</ref> were the inspiration of the 'bob-job'; these stripped-down racers had no front fender, an abbreviated rear, and no excess weight.  Road riders directly copied the look of the racers for better performance and a measure of style. The first bob-jobs appeared in the mid-1930s, and tended to reflect their somber competition origins, with plain paint jobs and no extra chrome or decoration.\n\nImmediately after [[World War II]], bob-jobs, in parallel with [[hot rod]]s, were subject to increasingly decorative modifications, including extra [[chrome plating]], [[Metallic paint|metal flake paint]] jobs, [[pin striping]], and colored [[upholstery]].  As early as 1946, Kenneth Howard ('[[Von Dutch]]') began modifying his Indian Scout bob-job with wild paint jobs, a smaller gas tank, raised handlebars, and exhaust pipes which turned upwards at the rear.<ref>'The Art of Von Dutch', Kahan, Nason, Quatrocchi, Smith, 2006, Tornado Design, Los Angeles, {{ISBN|0-9771118-1-4}}</ref>  Such modifications became the standard for bob-jobs, which grew in popularity, whether as show bikes <ref>'Hop Up', Morton, 2002, MBI, St. Paul, {{ISBN|0-7603-1073-4}}</ref> or ordinary road bikes.  The bob-job evolved through the 1950s and 60s in several directions; some were strictly for the popular motorcycle and hot rod show circuit, some had a distinctive  'club bike' style, some reflected drag racing practice, and some were simply a continuation of the original Class C inspiration.\n\nBob-jobs reflected the aesthetic tastes of their owners, and were home-built, there being no commercially produced road-going bob-job available until the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite book | last = Miguel | first = Jose de | title = How to Build a Bobber on a Budget | publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2008 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760327852 }}</ref> The style has also influenced motorcycle manufacturers, such as [[Harley-Davidson]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Holmstrom | first = Darwin | title = Harley-Davidson Century | publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760311554 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ets-Hokin|first1=Gabe |title=2008 1/2 Harley Softail Cross Bones, Buell Ulysses XB12XT - First Look |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2008/01/23/2008-12-harley-softail-cross-bones-buell-ulysses-xb12xt-first-look/ |website=Cycle World |publisher=Bonnier Corp. |accessdate=1 January 2015 |date=23 January 2008 |quote=The new bike, styled like a classic post-World War II bobber, has apehangers, a springer front end, a cut-down rear fender, a tractor saddle and tough, aggressive styling.

Springer forks are popular on both bikes, but often mounted with a higher rake in the Chopper\u00b4s triple-tree, to move the front wheel forward.

The bob-job evolved through the 1950s and 60s in several directions; some were strictly for the popular motorcycle and hot rod show circuit, some had a distinctive  'club bike' style, some reflected drag racing practice, and some were simply a continuation of the original Class C inspiration.\n\nBob-jobs reflected the aesthetic tastes of their owners, and were home-built, there being no commercially produced road-going bob-job available until the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite book | last = Miguel | first = Jose de | title = How to Build a Bobber on a Budget | publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2008 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760327852 }}</ref> The style has also influenced motorcycle manufacturers, such as [[Harley-Davidson]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Holmstrom | first = Darwin | title = Harley-Davidson Century | publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2002 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760311554 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ets-Hokin|first1=Gabe |title=2008 1/2 Harley Softail Cross Bones, Buell Ulysses XB12XT - First Look |url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2008/01/23/2008-12-harley-softail-cross-bones-buell-ulysses-xb12xt-first-look/ |website=Cycle World |publisher=Bonnier Corp. |accessdate=1 January 2015 |date=23 January 2008 |quote=The new bike, styled like a classic post-World War II bobber, has apehangers, a springer front end, a cut-down rear fender, a tractor saddle and tough, aggressive styling.

The bobber continues to be favored today; although hybrid styles have emerged, such as the \"bobber chopper\", and \"retro-bobber\".<ref name=\"Seate\">{{cite book | last = Seate | first = Mike | title = Outlaw choppers | publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2004 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760318492 }}</ref> Such bobbers exemplify the continuing evolution of the style, and its enduring popularity.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Roland |title=Sport Bobber: Yamaha XV950 |url=http://bikeindia.in/sport-bobber-yamaha-xv950/ |accessdate=1 January 2015 |work=Bike India |publisher=Next Gen Publishing Ltd |date=15 April 2014 |quote=Essentially, the XV is a production bobber: a simple, relatively sporty cruiser, designed to be easily customised using a variety of factory-made accessories.}}</ref>\n\n==Bobbers vs. choppers==\nThe term '[[Chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]]' did not appear in print until the mid-1960s, over 30 years after the bob-job was invented.  The chopper is a more stylistically and technically extreme evolution of the bob-job, which emerged after the highly elaborate, heavily chromed bob-jobs which appeared in the late 1940s and 1950s.  Bobbers are typically built around unmodified frames, while choppers use either highly modified or custom-made frames.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lane | first = Billy | title = Billy Lane's How to Build Old School Choppers, Bobbers and Customs |publisher = Motorbooks | location = Minneapolis | year = 2005 | edition=1st | isbn = 9780760321683 }}</ref> Chopper frames are often cut and welded into shape.  Thus, bobbers are fairly easy to create from stock motorcycles and are generally hand built.\n\nWhile customized motorcycles can be expensive, bobber builders tend to adopt an economical approach involving old, second-hand, recycled parts and hand-machined items reminiscent of the period before the mass-market motorcycle accessory industry had developed.<ref name=\"Seate\" /><ref>{{cite book | last = Baas | first = Kevin | title = How to Build an Old Skool [sic] Bobber | publisher = Wolfgang Pub | location = Stillwater, MN | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781935828006 }}</ref>\n\nInstead of the large diameter front wheels of Choppers<ref>https://www.thunderbike.com/model/chopper-en/</ref>, Bobbers<ref>https://www.thunderbike.com/model/bobber-en/</ref> usually come with a size similar to the rear rim. Builders mostly use spring saddles, which isn\u00b4t a must on choppers with their long extended sissy-bars. Springer forks are popular on both bikes, but often mounted with a higher rake in the Chopper\u00b4s triple-tree, to move the front wheel forward. Instead of glossy flake-paintings and chrome parts used for many Choppers, a Bobber more often comes as a [[Ratbike]] in flat paint and/or some rusty parts.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bobber (disambiguation)|Bobber]]\n* [[Triumph Bonneville Bobber]]\n* [[Cutdown]]\n* [[Caf\u00e9 racer]]\n* [[Streetfighter]]\n* [[Outline of motorcycles and motorcycling]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Types of motorcycles}}\n\n[[Category:Custom motorcycles]]\n[[Category:Motorcycle customization]]\n", "name_user": "82.38.235.195", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed description)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobber_(motorcycle)"}

They participated in 132 Grands Prix between 1980 and 1990. They achieved two points finishes and scored 5 championship points.\n\n==Early days==\n[[File:Osella PA5 BMW.jpg|thumb|Osella placed second in the [[1977 World Championship for Sports Cars]] with the Osella PA5 BMW.]]\nNamed after its founder Vincenzo \"Enzo\" Osella, the team began life by racing [[Abarth]] [[sports car racing|sports car]]s in local and national races in Italy in the mid-1960s. Though relatively successful (Osella eventually took over the factory Abarth sports car program), Osella expanded into single-seater racing in 1974 to further develop his business. In 1975, the team entered the [[1975 European Formula Two Championship|European Formula Two Championship]] for the first time, achieving some success with its own car, the [[BMW in motorsport|BMW]]-powered Osella FA2.\n\nOsella continued in Formula Two in [[1976 European Formula Two Championship|1976]], but financial problems meant that the team was not competitive and withdrew from the championship before the end of the season. In the following years, the FA2s were occasionally entered by privateers, one of them being the Swiss Charly Kiser.\n\n==The late 1970s==\nEnzo Osella tried to make some money by selling a self-penned [[Formula Three]] car, the Osella FA3, with little success. Only a few privateers were optimistic enough to buy the simple, untested machine, which with [[Toyota]] or [[Lancia]] engines competed in the 1976 [[Germany|German]] and Italian F3 championships without making any great impression. After this, the team concentrated on running in local sports car events during 1977 and 1978.\n\nOsella returned to the European Formula Two Championship in [[1979 European Formula Two Championship|1979]], with American driver [[Eddie Cheever]] racing the well-used FA2, again powered by a BMW engine. The car was good enough to win three races and take Cheever to fourth in the championship. This was enough for Enzo Osella to take the plunge into the cut-and-thrust world of [[Formula One]].\n\n==Formula One==\n\n===Early years===\nOsella Squadra Corse appeared in the world of Grand Prix racing with its first Formula One machine, the FA1. The car was designed by [[Giorgio Stirano]]. Powered by [[Ford Cosworth DFV]], it was overweight and aerodynamically inefficient. The car was presented in a blue and white livery with large [[Denim (label)|Denim]] branding on the sidepods. Many components were manufactured in-house which meant that they were cheap to produce but not always state-of-the-art. The driver was again Eddie Cheever who was able to finish just one race in whole season. Frequently, he had to suffer from the massive unreliability of his car. In the following seasons, the basic design was changed several times.\n\nIn the early years, most of the work was done by interim designers like [[Giorgio Valentini]] or [[Tony Southgate]], but frequently Enzo Osella himself also worked on the cars. Most of these attempts brought no improvement as high-tech solutions could not be financed. [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]] finished fourth at [[San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] in [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix|1982]] (where only 14 cars started) and scored the first Championship points for the young team in a car that was by now dubbed Osella FA1C.\n\nDespite this result, neither the financial nor the technical situation improved. Few [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] were attracted by the tiny Italian team. Denim only stayed for the first two seasons, [[Kelemata]] was no more reliable, and others like [[Landis & Gyr]] vanished as quickly as they had come. Most of the other sponsors were small or mid-size companies from [[Turin]] or the region of [[Piemont]].\n\n===Driver changes===\n[[File:Osella FA1D Bournemouth WHEELS Festival 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Osella FA1D at [[Bournemouth]] in 2016.]]\nThe lack of funding led to frequent driver changes as the team demanded that their drivers bring significant sponsorship to keep the team afloat. Some drivers started their F1 careers at Osella, such as [[Alex Caffi]] and [[Gabriele Tarquini]], while [[Piercarlo Ghinzani]] had four stints with the team. Others disappeared as quickly as they had come, such as [[Allen Berg]] and [[Franco Forini]]. Enzo Osella gave the young Austrian [[Jo Gartner]] his one and only chance to drive a Formula One car in 1984. [[Riccardo Paletti]] also had high hopes, but was killed in a start-line accident at the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix]].\n\nNone of these drivers were able to push the team forward. Finally, Osella continued to live hand-to-mouth each year, with little or no improvement in competitiveness.\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[File:Ghinzani Osella FA1F 1984 Dallas F1.jpg|thumb|right|Alfa-Romeo derived FA1F at the [[1984 Dallas Grand Prix]], where Ghinzani achieved Osella's second and last points finish.]]\nIn the mid-1980s, Osella was the beneficiary of factory [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] engines, both in [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally-aspirated]] (1983\u201384) and [[Turbocharger|turbo]] (1984\u201388) forms. On one hand, the Alfa engine program helped the team to survive the increasingly professional turbo era; on the other hand, the heavy, unreliable and thirsty machines contributed to the team's lack of competitiveness. At least at first, Alfa offered some technical input to the team; the 1984 Osella FA1F was based on the 1983 works [[Alfa Romeo 183T]], which had been loaned to the team for \"design assistance\" purposes. All the following Osella models up to the [[Osella FA1L|FA1L]] in {{f1|1988}} had their origins in the initial Alfa design.\n\nThe Alfa turbo engine, the 890T, was not reliable. Chargers blew off regularly and power output had to be reduced down to the level of the non-turbo cars just to achieve the necessary reliability. On more than one occasion, Osella tried to replace the 890T with more up-to-date [[Motori Moderni]] turbos (which [[Minardi]] did not support) or with [[Cosworth]] engines. In the end, both were too expensive, so Osella had to stick with the increasingly outdated but cheap 890T.\n\nFor 1988 \u2013 the last year before turbos were banned \u2013 the team re-branded the 890T as the \"Osella V8\". This came about after Alfa's parent company, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat]], grew tired of the negative publicity the team had given the 890T and, while allowing them to continue using the engine, refused to allow the Alfa Romeo name to be used.\n\nAfter driver [[Nicola Larini]] managed some impressive times in pre-season testing at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], the team were quietly confident of a decent showing through 1988, as many teams had switched to naturally-aspirated engines in preparation for 1989. However, the reality was that the FA1L, with its outdated turbo, was not up to the challenge: Larini often failed to qualify or even pre-qualify, and was also excluded from the [[1988 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] before practice after failing to get through scrutineering due to illegal changes made to the chassis. At the end of the season, Enzo Osella was more than happy to be finally rid of the old Alfa engine.\n\n===Cosworth power and Fondmetal===\nThe 1989 season saw much improvement. The all-new, [[Cosworth DFV#DFR|Cosworth DFR]]-powered [[Osella FA1M]] was a big step ahead, and ultra-sticky qualifying [[tyres]] from [[Pirelli]] brought some success, at least in the qualifying sessions (most notably in the [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], where Larini qualified 10th). The fine qualifying performance brought no results in the races; the Osella cars almost never saw the finish line due to several technical failures. The most tragic race was the Canadian Grand Prix in which Larini was third before the FA1M's electrics failed due to water ingress. Piercarlo Ghinzani re-joined the team for 1989 with limited success, often failing to qualify. He announced his retirement at the season ending [[1989 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]]. While Larini failed to start the very wet race when his electrics were water-logged on the grid, Ghinzani's race and career came to a violent end when a high-speed collision with the [[Lotus 101|Lotus]] of [[Nelson Piquet]] left Ghinzani with an injured ankle.\n\nIn 1990, after ten years in Formula One and still without any meaningful sponsorship, Enzo Osella sold shares in his team to metalwork magnate [[Gabriele Rumi]], as part of a sponsorship deal with Rumi's [[Fondmetal]] company. During {{f1|1990}}, the team entered a single car for French driver [[Olivier Grouillard]], who gained a reputation in F1 for being a \"blocker\", holding up faster cars and ignoring his mirrors. At the end of 1990, Rumi took over the remainder of the team and renamed it Fondmetal.\n\n==Sportscars==\n[[File:Osella PA 20 S BMW.jpg|thumb|right|BMW-powered Osella PA20]]The involvement of Gabriele Rumi meant the end of Enzo Osella's activities in Formula One. Instead he concentrated on the thing he knew best: sports car racing. During his Formula One years, he never gave up building sports cars; in fact this was one of the few projects that regularly brought work and money to Volpiano, especially in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races, with [[Maurpo Nesti]] many times winner of European and Italian Championship, and many other drivers, with PA9 and PA9/90 models.\n\nA few of those sports cars even found their way to the [[Can Am]] series, although without much success. The most prestigious result was during the 1984 Can Am season with a third place in the championship for the 2-litre class; the car was the Osella PA10 driven by Armando Trentini, and was the only two-seater in the championship; the rest of the 2-litre class field comprised single-seater F2 cars with covered wheels.\n\nIn the 1990s, Osella moved to [[Atella, Basilicata|Atella]] in the south of Italy where he built a new ultra-modern facility to produce some very competitive sports cars. Many of them were sold to privateers, while others were entered in several classes by the Osella works team. The works team was particularly successful in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races. In 1995 for instance works team driver [[Pasquale Irlando]] won all 9 races of the European hillclimb championship using the Osella PA18. He won the title in 1997, 1998 and 1999 consecutively. His successor [[Fabio Danti]] died in one of Osella's cars when he was competing in the 2000 Championship. Hillclimb stars like [[Franz Tschager]] and [[Martin Krisam]] continue to use Osella cars.\n\nNowadays, the factory was transferred back near Turin, in [[Verolengo]] and continue activity building sport cars for hill climbing and minor sport race championship.\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Complete Formula Two results===\n([[:Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]])\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n!

They participated in 132 Grands Prix between 1980 and 1990. They achieved two points finishes and scored 5 championship points.\n\n==Early days==\n[[File:Osella PA5 BMW.jpg|thumb|Osella placed second in the [[1977 World Championship for Sports Cars]] with the Osella PA5 BMW.]]\nNamed after its founder Vincenzo \"Enzo\" Osella, the team began life by racing [[Abarth]] [[sports car racing|sports car]]s in local and national races in Italy in the mid-1960s. Though relatively successful (Osella eventually took over the factory Abarth sports car program), Osella expanded into single-seater racing in 1974 to further develop his business. In 1975, the team entered the [[1975 European Formula Two Championship|European Formula Two Championship]] for the first time, achieving some success with its own car, the [[BMW in motorsport|BMW]]-powered Osella FA2.\n\nOsella continued in Formula Two in [[1976 European Formula Two Championship|1976]], but financial problems meant that the team was not competitive and withdrew from the championship before the end of the season. In the following years, the FA2s were occasionally entered by privateers, one of them being the Swiss Charly Kiser.\n\n==The late 1970s==\nEnzo Osella tried to make some money by selling a self-penned [[Formula Three]] car, the Osella FA3, with little success. Only a few privateers were optimistic enough to buy the simple, untested machine, which with [[Toyota]] or [[Lancia]] engines competed in the 1976 [[Germany|German]] and Italian F3 championships without making any great impression. After this, the team concentrated on running in local sports car events during 1977 and 1978.\n\nOsella returned to the European Formula Two Championship in [[1979 European Formula Two Championship|1979]], with American driver [[Eddie Cheever]] racing the well-used FA2, again powered by a BMW engine. The car was good enough to win three races and take Cheever to fourth in the championship. This was enough for Enzo Osella to take the plunge into the cut-and-thrust world of [[Formula One]].\n\n==Formula One==\n\n===Early years===\nOsella Squadra Corse appeared in the world of Grand Prix racing with its first Formula One machine, the FA1. The car was designed by [[Giorgio Stirano]]. Powered by [[Ford Cosworth DFV]], it was overweight and aerodynamically inefficient. The car was presented in a blue and white livery with large [[Denim (label)|Denim]] branding on the sidepods. Many components were manufactured in-house which meant that they were cheap to produce but not always state-of-the-art. The driver was again Eddie Cheever who was able to finish just one race in whole season. Frequently, he had to suffer from the massive unreliability of his car. In the following seasons, the basic design was changed several times.\n\nIn the early years, most of the work was done by interim designers like [[Giorgio Valentini]] or [[Tony Southgate]], but frequently Enzo Osella himself also worked on the cars. Most of these attempts brought no improvement as high-tech solutions could not be financed. [[Jean-Pierre Jarier]] finished fourth at [[San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]] in [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix|1982]] (where only 14 cars started) and scored the first Championship points for the young team in a car that was by now dubbed Osella FA1C.\n\nDespite this result, neither the financial nor the technical situation improved. Few [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsors]] were attracted by the tiny Italian team. Denim only stayed for the first two seasons, [[Kelemata]] was no more reliable, and others like [[Landis & Gyr]] vanished as quickly as they had come. Most of the other sponsors were small or mid-size companies from [[Turin]] or the region of [[Piemont]].\n\n===Driver changes===\n[[File:Osella FA1D Bournemouth WHEELS Festival 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Osella FA1D at [[Bournemouth]] in 2016.]]\nThe lack of funding led to frequent driver changes as the team demanded that their drivers bring significant sponsorship to keep the team afloat. Some drivers started their F1 careers at Osella, such as [[Alex Caffi]] and [[Gabriele Tarquini]], while [[Piercarlo Ghinzani]] had four stints with the team. Others disappeared as quickly as they had come, such as [[Allen Berg]] and [[Franco Forini]]. Enzo Osella gave the young Austrian [[Jo Gartner]] his one and only chance to drive a Formula One car in 1984. [[Riccardo Paletti]] also had high hopes, but was killed in a start-line accident at the [[1982 Canadian Grand Prix]].\n\nNone of these drivers were able to push the team forward. Finally, Osella continued to live hand-to-mouth each year, with little or no improvement in competitiveness.\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[File:Ghinzani Osella FA1F 1984 Dallas F1.jpg|thumb|right|Alfa-Romeo derived FA1F at the [[1984 Dallas Grand Prix]], where Ghinzani achieved Osella's second and last points finish.]]\nIn the mid-1980s, Osella was the beneficiary of factory [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] engines, both in [[Naturally aspirated engine|naturally-aspirated]] (1983\u201384) and [[Turbocharger|turbo]] (1984\u201388) forms. On one hand, the Alfa engine program helped the team to survive the increasingly professional turbo era; on the other hand, the heavy, unreliable and thirsty machines contributed to the team's lack of competitiveness. At least at first, Alfa offered some technical input to the team; the 1984 Osella FA1F was based on the 1983 works [[Alfa Romeo 183T]], which had been loaned to the team for \"design assistance\" purposes. All the following Osella models up to the [[Osella FA1L|FA1L]] in {{f1|1988}} had their origins in the initial Alfa design.\n\nThe Alfa turbo engine, the 890T, was not reliable. Chargers blew off regularly and power output had to be reduced down to the level of the non-turbo cars just to achieve the necessary reliability. On more than one occasion, Osella tried to replace the 890T with more up-to-date [[Motori Moderni]] turbos (which [[Minardi]] did not support) or with [[Cosworth]] engines. In the end, both were too expensive, so Osella had to stick with the increasingly outdated but cheap 890T.\n\nFor 1988 \u2013 the last year before turbos were banned \u2013 the team re-branded the 890T as the \"Osella V8\". This came about after Alfa's parent company, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles|Fiat]], grew tired of the negative publicity the team had given the 890T and, while allowing them to continue using the engine, refused to allow the Alfa Romeo name to be used.\n\nAfter driver [[Nicola Larini]] managed some impressive times in pre-season testing at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]], the team were quietly confident of a decent showing through 1988, as many teams had switched to naturally-aspirated engines in preparation for 1989. However, the reality was that the FA1L, with its outdated turbo, was not up to the challenge: Larini often failed to qualify or even pre-qualify, and was also excluded from the [[1988 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] before practice after failing to get through scrutineering due to illegal changes made to the chassis. At the end of the season, Enzo Osella was more than happy to be finally rid of the old Alfa engine.\n\n===Cosworth power and Fondmetal===\nThe 1989 season saw much improvement. The all-new, [[Cosworth DFV#DFR|Cosworth DFR]]-powered [[Osella FA1M]] was a big step ahead, and ultra-sticky qualifying [[tyres]] from [[Pirelli]] brought some success, at least in the qualifying sessions (most notably in the [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]], where Larini qualified 10th). The fine qualifying performance brought no results in the races; the Osella cars almost never saw the finish line due to several technical failures. The most tragic race was the Canadian Grand Prix in which Larini was third before the FA1M's electrics failed due to water ingress. Piercarlo Ghinzani re-joined the team for 1989 with limited success, often failing to qualify. He announced his retirement at the season ending [[1989 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]]. While Larini failed to start the very wet race when his electrics were water-logged on the grid, Ghinzani's race and career came to a violent end when a high-speed collision with the [[Lotus 101|Lotus]] of [[Nelson Piquet]] left Ghinzani with an injured ankle.\n\nIn 1990, after ten years in Formula One and still without any meaningful sponsorship, Enzo Osella sold shares in his team to metalwork magnate [[Gabriele Rumi]], as part of a sponsorship deal with Rumi's [[Fondmetal]] company. During {{f1|1990}}, the team entered a single car for French driver [[Olivier Grouillard]], who gained a reputation in F1 for being a \"blocker\", holding up faster cars and ignoring his mirrors. At the end of 1990, Rumi took over the remainder of the team and renamed it Fondmetal.\n\n==Sportscars==\n[[File:Osella PA 20 S BMW.jpg|thumb|right|BMW-powered Osella PA20]]The involvement of Gabriele Rumi meant the end of Enzo Osella's activities in Formula One. Instead he concentrated on the thing he knew best: sports car racing. During his Formula One years, he never gave up building sports cars; in fact this was one of the few projects that regularly brought work and money to Volpiano, especially in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races, with [[Maurpo Nesti]] many times winner of European and Italian Championship, and many other drivers, with PA9 and PA9/90 models.\n\nA few of those sports cars even found their way to the [[Can Am]] series, although without much success. The most prestigious result was during the 1984 Can Am season with a third place in the championship for the 2-litre class; the car was the Osella PA10 driven by Armando Trentini, and was the only two-seater in the championship; the rest of the 2-litre class field comprised single-seater F2 cars with covered wheels.\n\nIn the 1990s, Osella moved to [[Atella, Basilicata|Atella]] in the south of Italy where he built a new ultra-modern facility to produce some very competitive sports cars. Many of them were sold to privateers, while others were entered in several classes by the Osella works team. The works team was particularly successful in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] races. In 1995 for instance works team driver [[Pasquale Irlando]] won all 9 races of the European hillclimb championship using the Osella PA18. He won the title in 1997, 1998 and 1999 consecutively. His successor [[Fabio Danti]] died in one of Osella's cars when he was competing in the 2000 Championship. Hillclimb stars like [[Franz Tschager]] and [[Martin Krisam]] continue to use Osella cars.\n\nNowadays, the factory was transferred back near Turin, in [[Verolengo]] and continue activity building sport cars for hill climbing and minor sport race championship.\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Complete Formula Two results===\n([[:Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]])\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n!

It was thus almost co-terminous with the limits of the (Anglican) [[Diocese of Winchester]]. The obvious place for the cathedral and curia of the new diocese was Winchester. The [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act]] forbade a Catholic diocese to have the same name as an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] see. It would appear that the original intention was to fix the see at [[Southampton]], with [[St Joseph Church, Southampton|St Joseph Church]] in Bugle Street as the pro-cathedral. The construction of a large parish church in the centre of [[Portsmouth]] had begun, and it was decided to make it the future cathedral of the diocese.<ref name=hist>{{Cite web|url = http://www.catholicassociation.co.uk/groups/porthist.shtml|title = History of Portsmouth Diocese|accessdate = 13 December 2014|website = [[Catholic Association Pilgrimage]]|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140416210531/http://www.catholicassociation.co.uk/groups/porthist.shtml|archivedate = 16 April 2014|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBishop Vertue was succeeded by his vicar-general [[John Cahill (bishop)|John Cahill]].

The [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act]] forbade a Catholic diocese to have the same name as an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] see. It would appear that the original intention was to fix the see at [[Southampton]], with [[St Joseph Church, Southampton|St Joseph Church]] in Bugle Street as the pro-cathedral.

In many of these cases, the task of felling trees in preparation of new plots, the fencing of fields against wild animals, and sometimes the initial planting of crops, is usually done by men and older boys (along with hunting, fishing and the raising of livestock).<ref name=\" FB 1969\">Guyer, Jane.

Boserup notes that though the work completed by women calculates for a larger percentage of the tasks that form the basis of sub-Saharan life, women often do not receive the majority portion of the benefits that tag along with economic and agricultural success. \n\nAn elderly cultivator, with several wives and likely several young male children, benefits from having a much larger workforce within his household. By the combined efforts of his young sons and young wives, he may gradually expand his cultivation and become more prosperous. A man with a single wife has less help in cultivation and is likely to have little or no help for felling trees. According to Boserup's historical data, women living in such a structure also welcome one or more co-wives to share with them the burden of daily labor. However, the second wife will usually do the most tiresome work, almost as if she were a servant to the first wife, and will be inferior to the first wife in status.<ref name=\" Boserup Esther 1970\"/>{{page needed|date=October 2013}} A 1930s study of the [[Mende people|Mende]] in the West African state of Sierra Leone concluded that a plurality of wives is an agricultural asset since a large number of women makes it unnecessary to employ wage laborers.

This favored polygamous marriages in which men sought to monopolize the production of women \"who are valued both as workers and as child bearers.\" Goody, however, observes that the correlation is imperfect, and also describes more traditionally male-dominated though relatively extensive farming systems such as those that exist in much of West Africa, particularly the savanna region,  where polygamy is desired more for the production of male offspring whose labor in farming is valued.<ref>Goody, Jack.

Goody says, \"The reasons behind polygyny are sexual and reproductive rather than economic and productive\" (1973:189), arguing that men marry polygynously to maximize their fertility and to obtain large households containing many young dependent males.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = Douglas | last2 = Burton | first2 = Michael | year = 1988 | title = Causes of Polygyny: Ecology, Economy, Kinship, and Warfare | url = https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0468q4xq| journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 90 | issue = 4| pages = 871\u2013887 [873] | doi=10.1525/aa.1988.90.4.02a00060}}</ref>\n\nAn analysis by James Fenske (2012) found that child mortality and ecologically-related economic shocks had a stronger association with rates of polygamy in Subsaharan Africa rather than female agricultural contributions (which are typically relatively small in the West African savanna and sahel, where polygyny rates are higher), finding that polygyny rates decrease significantly with child mortality rates.<ref>{{Citation  | last = Fenske  | first = James  | author-link = James Fenske  | title = AFRICAN POLYGAMY: PAST AND PRESENT | url = https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/12544/csae-wps-2012-20.pdf | journal = Centre for the Study of African Economies, University of Oxford  | pages = 1\u201330  | date = November 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Desire for progeny===\nMost research into the determinants of polygyny has focused on macro-level factors.

In order to feed an additional wife, the husband must either work harder himself or he must hire laborers to do part of the work.

According to Natali Exposito, \"in a study of the Ngwa Igbo Clan in Nigeria identified five principal reasons for men to maintain more than one wife: because having more than one wife allows the Ngwa husband to (1) have the many children that he desires; (2) heighten his prestige and boost his ego among his peers; (3) enhance his status within the community; (4) ensure a sufficient availability of labor to perform the necessary farm work and the processing of commercial oil-palm produce; and (5) satisfy his sexual urges.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Exposito|first=Natali|year=2017|title=The Negative Impact of Polygamy on Women and Children in Mormon and Islamic Cultures|journal=Seton Hall University Law School Student Scholarship|volume=|pages=|url= http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1898&context=student_scholarship| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170219030849/http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1898&context=student_scholarship| archive-date= 19 February 2017}}</ref> Out of all of the reasons stated none are beneficial to the wives, but instead only beneficial to the husbands.

Some view polygyny as a means to prevent men from taking random sexual partners and potentially introducing STDs into relationships. Interviews conducted with some of the Logoli tribe in Kenya suggested they feared polygynous marriages because of what they have witnessed in the lives of other women who are currently in such relationships. The observed experiences of some of the women in polygynous unions tend to be characterized by frequent jealousy, conflicts, competition, tensions, and psychological stresses. Some of the husbands fail to share love and other resources equally; and envy and hatred, and sometimes violent physical confrontations become the order of the day among co-wives and their children. This discourages women from entering a polygynous marriage.<ref name=\"Gwako, Edwins Laban 1998\">Gwako, Edwins Laban. \"Polygamy Among the Logoli of Western Kenya\". ''Anthropos'' 93.4 (1998).

In ''Women's Role in Economic Development'', edited by Ester Boserup, 47. New York: St. Martin's Press.</ref> In most cases, women do not have access to their children if they decide to leave polygyny, nor are they allowed to take them, due to cultural ideas of ownership in relation to progeny.\n\n==Premodern era==\n\nIn Africa, the Americas, and Southeast Asia in the Premodern Era, circa 600&nbsp;BCE \u2013 1600&nbsp;CE, both monogamy and polygyny occurred. Polygyny occurred even in areas of where monogamy was prevalent. Wealth played a key role in the development of family life during these times. Wealth meant the more powerful men had a principal wife and several secondary wives, known as ''resource polygyny''. Local rulers of villages usually had the most wives as a sign of power and status. Conquerors of villages would often marry the daughters of the former leaders as a symbol of conquest. The practice of resource polygyny continued with the spread and expansion of Islam in Africa and Southeast Asia. Children born into these households were considered free. Children born to free or slave concubines were free, but had lesser status than those born to wives. Living arrangements varied between areas. In Africa, each wife usually had their own house, as well as property and animals. The idea that all property was owned by the husband originated in Europe and was not recognized in Africa. In many other parts of the world, wives lived together in seclusion, under one household. A ''[[harem]]'' (also known as a ''forbidden area'') was a special part of the house for the wives.<ref>Wiesner-Hanks, Merry E. Gender in History: Global Perspectives. 2nd ed., Wiley-Blackwell, 2011.

Taking additional wives was regarded as one of the fundamental indicators of a successfully established man. Large families enhanced the prestige of Logoli men. Logoli men with large families were also capable of obtaining justice, as they would be feared by people, who would not dare to use force to take their livestock or other goods from them.  Interviews with some of the contemporary Logoli men and women who recently made polygynous marriages yielded data which suggest that marrying another wife is usually approached with considerable thought and deliberation by the man. It may or may not involve or require the consent of the other wives and prospective wife's parents. A type of \"[[surrogate pregnancy]]\" arrangement was reported to have been observed, in which some wives who are unable to bear children, find fulfillment in the children and family provided by a husband taking additional wives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Laban Moogi Gwako|first=Edwins|title=Polygyny among the Logoli of Western Kenya|journal=Anthropos|volume=93|issue=4/6|pages=331\u2013348|quote=\"...encoraged{{Clarify|sp|date=April 2016}} their husbands to marry other wives so that they may engage themselves and bestow their affection upon the co-wives' children.\"|jstor=40464835|year=1998}}</ref> Some of the men indicated that they were pressured by their parents to marry another wife, who could contribute additional income to the family. Some of the young polygynous men indicated that they were trapped in polygyny because of the large number of single women who needed and were willing to take them as husbands although they were already married. Most of those second and third wives were older women who had not yet married.<ref name=\"Gwako, Edwins Laban 1998\"/>\n\n====Nigeria====\n\nCustomary law, one of the three legal systems in operation in Nigeria (the other two being Nigerian common law and [[Sharia]] law) allows for the legal marriage of more than one woman by a single man.\n\nUnlike those marriages recognized by Sharia, there is no limit to the number of legal wives allowed under customary law. Currently polygyny is most common within [[Royal family|royal]] and [[Nobility|noble]] families within the country, and is largely practiced by the tribes native to its north and west. Although far less popular there, it is nonetheless also legal in Nigeria's east and south.\n\nPolygyny varies according to a woman's age, religion and educational experience. Research conducted in the city of Ibadan, the second largest city in Nigeria, show that non-educated woman are significantly higher (58%) to be in a polygynous union compared to college educated women (4%).<ref name=\":4\" /> Followers of traditional African religions are expected to have as many wives as they can afford.

Several factors for this include infertility or long-term illness of the first wife, excessive wealth on the part of the husband enabling him to support widowed or divorced mothers, and the economic benefits of large families.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Moosa|first=N|date=2009-09-24|title=Polygynous Muslim Marriages in South Africa: Their Potential Impact on the Incidence of HIV/AIDS|journal=Potchefstroom Electronic Law Journal/Potchefstroomse Elektroniese Regsblad|volume=12|issue=3|doi=10.4314/pelj.v12i3.46271|issn=1727-3781}}</ref>\n\nDespite the historical and cultural history of polygyny among Muslim South Africans, polygynous unions are officially illegal on the federal level in South Africa.

As a result, polygyny is extensive throughout the country. There is an estimated report that over one-third of marriages in Mozambique. <ref>Mwareya, Ray (5 July 2016). \"Widows without sons in Mozambique accused of sorcery and robbed of land\". ''Reuters''. Retrieved 13 November 2019. <q>Although polygamy is prohibited in Mozambique there is no punishment. Across the country nearly a third of married women are thought to be in polygamous marriages, according to a NORAD survey.</q></ref> However, under Mozambican law the first wife of the marriage is only legally recognized. The Mozambican government has also granted equal protection of inheritance rights for all wives within polygynous marriages as documented by an OECD finding. \n<br />\n=== Australia ===\nPolygyny is not legal in Australia. The Marriage Act of 1961 under section 94 states that any person who knowingly marries another whose marriage is legally ongoing carries out the act of bigamy. The penalty of bigamy is up to five years of imprisonment. The Full Court of the Family Court of Australia ruled on March 6, 2016 that it is illegal to have polygamous marriages. However, foreign marriages that have potential to be polygamous when it was started will be legally recognized in Australia. The court defined a potentially polygamous marriage as if the marriage is not yet polygamous, but if the country where the marriage marginally taken place permits polygamous marriages of either partner to the original marriage at a later date. Indigenous populations of Australia have been noted to engage in polygamous relationships. \n<br />\n===Asia===\nMany majority-[[Muslim]] countries retain the traditional [[sharia]], which interprets teachings of the Quran to permit polygamy with up to four wives. Exceptions to this include [[Albania]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], and former [[USSR]] republics. Though about 70% of the population of Albania is [[Cultural Muslim|historically Muslim]], the majority is non-practicing. Turkey and Tunisia are countries with overwhelmingly Muslim populations that enforce [[La\u00efcit\u00e9|secularist practices]] by law. In the former USSR republics, a prohibition against polygamy has been inherited from [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]. In the 21st century, a revival of the practice of polygamy in the [[Muslim World]] has contributed to efforts to re-establish its legality and legitimacy in some countries and communities where it is illegal.\n\nProposals have been made to re-legalize polygamy in other ex-Soviet Muslim republics, such as [[Kazakhstan]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/GB04Ag01.html |last= Saidazimova |first= Gulnoza|title= Polygamy hurts - in the pocket |newspaper= [[Asia Times Online]] |date= February 4, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nThe original wife (or legal wife) was referred to as the \u6b63\u5ba4 zh\u00e8ngsh\u00ec /\uc815\uc2e4 (main room) both in China, Japan and Korea. \u5927\u5a46 d\u00e0p\u00f3 (\"big woman/big wife\") is the slang term.

Polygyny among Christians was banned in the late 19th century, while [[The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955]] banned polygyny for Hindus. Currently, polygyny is only allowed among [[Muslims]]; but it is strongly discouraged by public policy.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Muslims are subject to the terms of ''The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937'', interpreted by the [[All India Muslim Personal Law Board]].

Rich officials and merchants of the elite also took concubines in addition to legal wives. The first wife was the head or mother wife; other wives were under her headship if the husband was away. Concubines had a lower status than full wives, generally not being seen in public with their husband and not having rights to decisions in the house. Children from concubines were considered inferior to those of the wife and did not receive equal wealth/legacy from their father. However they were considered legitimate, therefore had many more rights to inheritance of status and wealth than illegitimate children conceived outside a marriage.\n\nPolygamy was ''de facto'' widely practiced in the Republic of China from 1911 to 1949, before [[Kuomintang]] was defeated in the Civil War and retreated to Taiwan. [[Zhang Zongchang]], a well-known warlord, notably declared he had three 'unknowns' - unknown number of rifles, unknown amount of money, and unknown number of concubines. \u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u81ea\u5df1\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u67aa\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u81ea\u5df1\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u94b1\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u81ea\u5df1\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u59e8\u592a\u592a<ref>[http://baike.baidu.com/view/17617.htm \"Zhang Zongchang\"].</ref>\n\n[[Chinese people|Chinese]] men in [[Hong Kong]] could practice concubinage by virtue of the [[Qing Code]].

[[1 Timothy]] states that certain Church leaders should have but one wife: \"A ''bishop'' then must be blameless, the husband of one wife (''mias gunaikos andra'', lit. one-woman man), vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach\" (chapter 3, verse 2; see also verse 12 regarding deacons having only one wife).

In some instances in recent times there have been moves for accommodation; in other instances, churches have resisted such moves strongly. African Independent Churches have sometimes referred to those parts of the Old Testament that describe polygamy in defending the practice. \n\nThere are small numbers of Roman Catholic theologians that claim polygyny can be an authentic form of marriage in certain regions such as Africa.<ref>\"''The Ratzinger report: an exclusive interview on the state of the Church Pope Benedict XVI, Vittorio Messori\"'', p. 195, Ignatius Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-89870-080-9}}</ref>\n\n=== Islam ===\n{{main|Polygyny in Islam}}\nUnder [[Islamic marital jurisprudence]], Muslim men are allowed to practice polygyny, that is, they can have more than one wife at the same time, up to a total of four. Polyandry, the practice of a woman having more than one husband, is not permitted.\n\nBased on verse 30:21 of [[Quran]] the ideal relationship is the comfort that a couple find in each other's embrace:\n{{quote|And one of His signs is that He created for you spouses from among yourselves so that you may find comfort in them. And He has placed between you compassion and mercy. Surely in this are signs for people who reflect.|Qur'an, Sura 30 ([[Ar-Rum]]), Ayah 21<ref name=\"cite quran|30|21|\">{{cite Quran|30|21|}}</ref>}}\n\nThe polygyny that is allowed in the Quran is for special situations; however, it advises monogamy if a man fears he can't deal justly with them. This is based on verse 4:3 of [[Quran]] which says:\n{{quote|If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their \u02f9due\u02fa rights \u02f9if you were to marry them\u02fa, then marry other women of your choice\u2014two, three, or four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then \u02f9content yourselves with\u02fa one or those \u02f9bondwomen\u02fa in your possession. This way you are less likely to commit injustice.|Qur'an, Sura 4 ([[An-Nisa]]), Ayah 3<ref name=\"cite quran|4|3|s=ns\">{{cite Quran|4|3 |s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\nThere are strict requirements to marrying more than one woman, as the man must treat them equally financially and in terms of support given to each wife, according to Islamic law.\n\nMuslim women aren't allowed to marry more than one husband at once. However, in the case of a [[divorce]] or their husbands' death they can remarry after the completion of [[Iddah]], as divorce is legal in Islamic law. A non-Muslim woman who flees from her non-Muslim husband and accepts [[Islam]] can remarry without divorce from her previous husband, as her marriage with non-Muslim husband is Islamically dissolved on her fleeing. A non-Muslim woman captured during war by Muslims, can also remarry, as her marriage with her non-Muslim husband is Islamically dissolved at capture by Muslim soldiers. This permission is given to such women in verse 4:24 of Quran. The verse also emphasizes on transparency, mutual agreement and financial compensation as prerequisites for matrimonial relationship as opposed to prostitution; it says:\n{{quote|Also \u02f9forbidden are\u02fa married women\u2014except \u02f9female\u02fa captives in your possession. This is God's commandment to you. Lawful to you are all beyond these\u2014as long as you seek them with your wealth in a legal marriage, not in fornication. Give those you have consummated marriage with their due dowries. It is permissible to be mutually gracious regarding the set dowry.

The Qur'an does not give preference in marrying more than one wife.

Usually the wives have little to no contact with each other and lead separate, individual lives in their own houses, and sometimes in different cities, though they all share the same husband.\n\nIn most Muslim-majority countries, polygyny is legal with [[Kuwait]] being the only one where no restrictions are imposed on it.

[[Polyandry]] is another form of polygamy in which women practice having two or more husbands.  Most countries which permit polygyny are [[Muslim-majority countries]].\n\nIn some countries where polygamy is illegal but polygyny is still a cultural norm, and sometimes even in countries where polygamy is legal, men sometimes have one or more [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]es. The status of a mistress is not that of a wife, and any children born of such relationships were or sometimes are considered illegitimate and subject to legal disadvantage.

(1970). ''Woman's Role in Economic Development'', London, England & Sterling, VA: Cromwell Press, Trowbridge</ref> was the first to propose that the high incidence of polygyny in sub-Saharan Africa is rooted in the sexual division of labor in [[hoe-farming]] and the large economic contribution of women.\n\nIn some regions of shifting cultivation where polygyny is most frequently recorded, labor is often starkly divided between genders. In many of these cases, the task of felling trees in preparation of new plots, the fencing of fields against wild animals, and sometimes the initial planting of crops, is usually done by men and older boys (along with hunting, fishing and the raising of livestock).<ref name=\" FB 1969\">Guyer, Jane.

Boserup notes that though the work completed by women calculates for a larger percentage of the tasks that form the basis of sub-Saharan life, women often do not receive the majority portion of the benefits that tag along with economic and agricultural success. \n\nAn elderly cultivator, with several wives and likely several young male children, benefits from having a much larger workforce within his household. By the combined efforts of his young sons and young wives, he may gradually expand his cultivation and become more prosperous. A man with a single wife has less help in cultivation and is likely to have little or no help for felling trees. According to Boserup's historical data, women living in such a structure also welcome one or more co-wives to share with them the burden of daily labor. However, the second wife will usually do the most tiresome work, almost as if she were a servant to the first wife, and will be inferior to the first wife in status.<ref name=\" Boserup Esther 1970\"/>{{page needed|date=October 2013}} A 1930s study of the [[Mende people|Mende]] in the West African state of Sierra Leone concluded that a plurality of wives is an agricultural asset since a large number of women makes it unnecessary to employ wage laborers. Polygyny is considered an economic advantage in many rural areas. In some cases, the economic role of the additional wife enables the husband to enjoy more leisure.<ref>Boserup Esther. (1970).

This favored polygamous marriages in which men sought to monopolize the production of women \"who are valued both as workers and as child bearers.\" Goody, however, observes that the correlation is imperfect, and also describes more traditionally male-dominated though relatively extensive farming systems such as those that exist in much of West Africa, particularly the savanna region,  where polygamy is desired more for the production of male offspring whose labor in farming is valued.<ref>Goody, Jack.

He notes Dorjahn's (1959) comparison of East and West Africa, showing higher female agricultural contributions in East Africa and higher polygyny rates in West Africa, especially in the West African savanna, where one finds especially high male agricultural contributions. Goody says, \"The reasons behind polygyny are sexual and reproductive rather than economic and productive\" (1973:189), arguing that men marry polygynously to maximize their fertility and to obtain large households containing many young dependent males.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = Douglas | last2 = Burton | first2 = Michael | year = 1988 | title = Causes of Polygyny: Ecology, Economy, Kinship, and Warfare | url = https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0468q4xq| journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 90 | issue = 4| pages = 871\u2013887 [873] | doi=10.1525/aa.1988.90.4.02a00060}}</ref>\n\nAn analysis by James Fenske (2012) found that child mortality and ecologically-related economic shocks had a stronger association with rates of polygamy in Subsaharan Africa rather than female agricultural contributions (which are typically relatively small in the West African savanna and sahel, where polygyny rates are higher), finding that polygyny rates decrease significantly with child mortality rates.<ref>{{Citation  | last = Fenske  | first = James  | author-link = James Fenske  | title = AFRICAN POLYGAMY: PAST AND PRESENT | url = https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/12544/csae-wps-2012-20.pdf | journal = Centre for the Study of African Economies, University of Oxford  | pages = 1\u201330  | date = November 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Desire for progeny===\nMost research into the determinants of polygyny has focused on macro-level factors.

In order to feed an additional wife, the husband must either work harder himself or he must hire laborers to do part of the work. In such regions, polygyny is either non-existent or is a luxury which only a small minority of rich farmers can indulge.<ref name=\"Boserup Esther 1970\"/>{{page needed|date=October 2013}} \n\nA report by the secretariat of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) quotes: \"one of the strongest appeals of polygyny to men in Africa is precisely its economic aspect, for a man with several wives commands more land, can produce more food for his household and can achieve a high status due to the wealth which he can command\".<ref name=\"Boserup Esther 1970\">Boserup Esther. (1970). ''Woman's Role in Economic Development'', London, England & Sterling, Virginia: Cromwell Press, Trowbridge.</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2013}} According to Boserup, through the hard work, economic, and agricultural assistance of a man's many wives, a husband can afford to pay the bride price of a new wife and further his access to more land, meanwhile, expanding his progeny.<ref name=\":3\" /> According to [[Esther Boserup]], over much of the continent of Africa, tribal rules of land tenure are still in force.{{page needed|date=October 2013}} This implies that members of a tribe which commands a certain territory have a native right to take land under cultivation for food production and in many cases also for the cultivation of cash crops. Under this tenure system, an additional wife is an economic asset that helps the family to expand its production.\n\nThe economist [[Mich\u00e8le Tertilt]] concludes that countries that practice polygyny are less economically stable than those that practice [[monogamy]]. Polygynous countries usually have a higher fertility rate, fewer savings reserves, and a lower GDP.

According to Natali Exposito, \"in a study of the Ngwa Igbo Clan in Nigeria identified five principal reasons for men to maintain more than one wife: because having more than one wife allows the Ngwa husband to (1) have the many children that he desires; (2) heighten his prestige and boost his ego among his peers; (3) enhance his status within the community; (4) ensure a sufficient availability of labor to perform the necessary farm work and the processing of commercial oil-palm produce; and (5) satisfy his sexual urges.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Exposito|first=Natali|year=2017|title=The Negative Impact of Polygamy on Women and Children in Mormon and Islamic Cultures|journal=Seton Hall University Law School Student Scholarship|volume=|pages=|url= http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1898&context=student_scholarship| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170219030849/http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1898&context=student_scholarship| archive-date= 19 February 2017}}</ref> Out of all of the reasons stated none are beneficial to the wives, but instead only beneficial to the husbands.

Some view polygyny as a means to prevent men from taking random sexual partners and potentially introducing STDs into relationships. Interviews conducted with some of the Logoli tribe in Kenya suggested they feared polygynous marriages because of what they have witnessed in the lives of other women who are currently in such relationships. The observed experiences of some of the women in polygynous unions tend to be characterized by frequent jealousy, conflicts, competition, tensions, and psychological stresses. Some of the husbands fail to share love and other resources equally; and envy and hatred, and sometimes violent physical confrontations become the order of the day among co-wives and their children. This discourages women from entering a polygynous marriage.<ref name=\"Gwako, Edwins Laban 1998\">Gwako, Edwins Laban. \"Polygamy Among the Logoli of Western Kenya\". ''Anthropos'' 93.4 (1998).

Findings show that the wife order can affect life satisfaction. According to Bove and Valeggia, women who are senior wives often misuse their position to obtain healthcare benefits in countries one wife can become a recipient. The conflict between co-wives can attribute to the higher rates of mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and paranoia.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Bove|first=Riley|last2=Valeggia|first2=Claudia|year=2009|title=Polygyny and Women's Health in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=|journal=Social Science and Medicine|volume=68|issue=1|pages=21\u201329|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.09.045|pmid=18952335}}</ref>\n\nVarious methods have been used to reduce the amount of jealousy and conflict among wives. These include sororal polygyny, in which the co-wives are sisters; and hut polygyny, in which each wife has her own residence and the husband visits them in rotation.

Ifediora, who believes that women should be equal to men and not subject to them in marriage. Professor Ifediora also believes that polygyny is a \"hindrance to social and economic development\" in the continent of Africa due to women's lack of financial control.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ifediora|first=John|year=2016|title=Polygamy As Further Subjugation Of African Women, And National Economies|url=http://www.casade.org/polygamy-subjugation-african-women-national-economies/|journal=CASADE|volume=|pages=1|via=}}</ref> Standard polygynist practices often leave women at a disadvantage if they make the decision to remove themselves from the polygynist lifestyle. To leave the marriage, women must repay their bride price. Though this is simple in thought, this is not simple in execution. To prevent their wives from leaving, husbands will often keep the bride price at high levels, which is often at an unpayable level for women.<ref>Boserup, Ester. 1970. \"The Economics of Polygamy\". In ''Women's Role in Economic Development'', edited by Ester Boserup, 47. New York: St. Martin's Press.</ref> In most cases, women do not have access to their children if they decide to leave polygyny, nor are they allowed to take them, due to cultural ideas of ownership in relation to progeny.\n\n==Premodern era==\n\nIn Africa, the Americas, and Southeast Asia in the Premodern Era, circa 600&nbsp;BCE \u2013 1600&nbsp;CE, both monogamy and polygyny occurred. Polygyny occurred even in areas of where monogamy was prevalent. Wealth played a key role in the development of family life during these times. Wealth meant the more powerful men had a principal wife and several secondary wives, known as ''resource polygyny''. Local rulers of villages usually had the most wives as a sign of power and status. Conquerors of villages would often marry the daughters of the former leaders as a symbol of conquest. The practice of resource polygyny continued with the spread and expansion of Islam in Africa and Southeast Asia. Children born into these households were considered free. Children born to free or slave concubines were free, but had lesser status than those born to wives. Living arrangements varied between areas. In Africa, each wife usually had their own house, as well as property and animals. The idea that all property was owned by the husband originated in Europe and was not recognized in Africa. In many other parts of the world, wives lived together in seclusion, under one household. A ''[[harem]]'' (also known as a ''forbidden area'') was a special part of the house for the wives.<ref>Wiesner-Hanks, Merry E. Gender in History: Global Perspectives. 2nd ed., Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. (Page 34)</ref>\n\n==By country==\n{{main|Legal status of polygamy}}\n\n===Africa===\n====Kenya====\n\nPolygynous marriage was preferred among the Logoli and other [[Abalulya]] sub ethnic groups. Taking additional wives was regarded as one of the fundamental indicators of a successfully established man. Large families enhanced the prestige of Logoli men. Logoli men with large families were also capable of obtaining justice, as they would be feared by people, who would not dare to use force to take their livestock or other goods from them.  Interviews with some of the contemporary Logoli men and women who recently made polygynous marriages yielded data which suggest that marrying another wife is usually approached with considerable thought and deliberation by the man. It may or may not involve or require the consent of the other wives and prospective wife's parents. A type of \"[[surrogate pregnancy]]\" arrangement was reported to have been observed, in which some wives who are unable to bear children, find fulfillment in the children and family provided by a husband taking additional wives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Laban Moogi Gwako|first=Edwins|title=Polygyny among the Logoli of Western Kenya|journal=Anthropos|volume=93|issue=4/6|pages=331\u2013348|quote=\"...encoraged{{Clarify|sp|date=April 2016}} their husbands to marry other wives so that they may engage themselves and bestow their affection upon the co-wives' children.\"|jstor=40464835|year=1998}}</ref> Some of the men indicated that they were pressured by their parents to marry another wife, who could contribute additional income to the family. Some of the young polygynous men indicated that they were trapped in polygyny because of the large number of single women who needed and were willing to take them as husbands although they were already married. Most of those second and third wives were older women who had not yet married.<ref name=\"Gwako, Edwins Laban 1998\"/>\n\n====Nigeria====\n\nCustomary law, one of the three legal systems in operation in Nigeria (the other two being Nigerian common law and [[Sharia]] law) allows for the legal marriage of more than one woman by a single man.\n\nUnlike those marriages recognized by Sharia, there is no limit to the number of legal wives allowed under customary law. Currently polygyny is most common within [[Royal family|royal]] and [[Nobility|noble]] families within the country, and is largely practiced by the tribes native to its north and west. Although far less popular there, it is nonetheless also legal in Nigeria's east and south.\n\nPolygyny varies according to a woman's age, religion and educational experience. Research conducted in the city of Ibadan, the second largest city in Nigeria, show that non-educated woman are significantly higher (58%) to be in a polygynous union compared to college educated women (4%).<ref name=\":4\" /> Followers of traditional African religions are expected to have as many wives as they can afford. Muslim men are allowed up to 4 women and only the basis he can care for and treat them equally. Christians are typically (and expected) to be monogamous.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAmong the Ngwa group in Eastern Nigeria, studies show that 70% of polygynous marriages consist of illiterate men and women, compared to 53% in monogamous marriages.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==== Malawi ====\nWhile polygynous marriages are not legally recognized under the civil marriage laws of Malawi, customary law affords a generous amount of benefits to polygynous unions, ranging from inheritance rights to child custody.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|title=Figures 18 and 2.10.

An effort led in 2008 to outlaw polygyny in the country was fiercely opposed by Islamic religious leaders, citing the practice as a cultural, religious and pragmatic reality of the nation.<ref>{{Citation|last=Lamloum|first=Olfa|title=Islamonline.

Polygynous marriages of individuals over the age of 15 accounts for approximately 30,000 (0.1%) people in 2001. Both Islamic law and cultural family laws create a system in which Muslim men are encouraged to take up to four wives. Several factors for this include infertility or long-term illness of the first wife, excessive wealth on the part of the husband enabling him to support widowed or divorced mothers, and the economic benefits of large families.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Moosa|first=N|date=2009-09-24|title=Polygynous Muslim Marriages in South Africa: Their Potential Impact on the Incidence of HIV/AIDS|journal=Potchefstroom Electronic Law Journal/Potchefstroomse Elektroniese Regsblad|volume=12|issue=3|doi=10.4314/pelj.v12i3.46271|issn=1727-3781}}</ref>\n\nDespite the historical and cultural history of polygyny among Muslim South Africans, polygynous unions are officially illegal on the federal level in South Africa.

According to the Muslim tradition, men can have up to four wives. For a man to gain additional wives in Somalia, it must be granted by the court and it has to be proven that the first wife is either imprisoned or infertile.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-03/2007-03-12-voa14.cfm|title=Acceptance of Polygamy Slowly Changes in Muslim Africa|last=|first=|date=12 March 2007|work=Voice of America|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507024715/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-03/2007-03-12-voa14.cfm|access-date=18 November 2019|archive-date=2009-05-07}}</ref>\n\n==== Mozambique ====\nThere are no legal restrictions against any polygynous marriages. As a result, polygyny is extensive throughout the country. There is an estimated report that over one-third of marriages in Mozambique. <ref>Mwareya, Ray (5 July 2016). \"Widows without sons in Mozambique accused of sorcery and robbed of land\". ''Reuters''. Retrieved 13 November 2019. <q>Although polygamy is prohibited in Mozambique there is no punishment. Across the country nearly a third of married women are thought to be in polygamous marriages, according to a NORAD survey.</q></ref> However, under Mozambican law the first wife of the marriage is only legally recognized. The Mozambican government has also granted equal protection of inheritance rights for all wives within polygynous marriages as documented by an OECD finding. \n<br />\n=== Australia ===\nPolygyny is not legal in Australia. The Marriage Act of 1961 under section 94 states that any person who knowingly marries another whose marriage is legally ongoing carries out the act of bigamy. The penalty of bigamy is up to five years of imprisonment. The Full Court of the Family Court of Australia ruled on March 6, 2016 that it is illegal to have polygamous marriages. However, foreign marriages that have potential to be polygamous when it was started will be legally recognized in Australia. The court defined a potentially polygamous marriage as if the marriage is not yet polygamous, but if the country where the marriage marginally taken place permits polygamous marriages of either partner to the original marriage at a later date. Indigenous populations of Australia have been noted to engage in polygamous relationships. \n<br />\n===Asia===\nMany majority-[[Muslim]] countries retain the traditional [[sharia]], which interprets teachings of the Quran to permit polygamy with up to four wives. Exceptions to this include [[Albania]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]], and former [[USSR]] republics. Though about 70% of the population of Albania is [[Cultural Muslim|historically Muslim]], the majority is non-practicing. Turkey and Tunisia are countries with overwhelmingly Muslim populations that enforce [[La\u00efcit\u00e9|secularist practices]] by law. In the former USSR republics, a prohibition against polygamy has been inherited from [[Law of the Soviet Union|Soviet Law]]. In the 21st century, a revival of the practice of polygamy in the [[Muslim World]] has contributed to efforts to re-establish its legality and legitimacy in some countries and communities where it is illegal.\n\nProposals have been made to re-legalize polygamy in other ex-Soviet Muslim republics, such as [[Kazakhstan]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Uzbekistan]].<ref>{{citation |url= http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/GB04Ag01.html |last= Saidazimova |first= Gulnoza|title= Polygamy hurts - in the pocket |newspaper= [[Asia Times Online]] |date= February 4, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nThe original wife (or legal wife) was referred to as the \u6b63\u5ba4 zh\u00e8ngsh\u00ec /\uc815\uc2e4 (main room) both in China, Japan and Korea. \u5927\u5a46 d\u00e0p\u00f3 (\"big woman/big wife\") is the slang term.

Polygyny among Christians was banned in the late 19th century, while [[The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955]] banned polygyny for Hindus. Currently, polygyny is only allowed among [[Muslims]]; but it is strongly discouraged by public policy.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Muslims are subject to the terms of ''The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937'', interpreted by the [[All India Muslim Personal Law Board]].

Rich officials and merchants of the elite also took concubines in addition to legal wives. The first wife was the head or mother wife; other wives were under her headship if the husband was away. Concubines had a lower status than full wives, generally not being seen in public with their husband and not having rights to decisions in the house. Children from concubines were considered inferior to those of the wife and did not receive equal wealth/legacy from their father. However they were considered legitimate, therefore had many more rights to inheritance of status and wealth than illegitimate children conceived outside a marriage.\n\nPolygamy was ''de facto'' widely practiced in the Republic of China from 1911 to 1949, before [[Kuomintang]] was defeated in the Civil War and retreated to Taiwan. [[Zhang Zongchang]], a well-known warlord, notably declared he had three 'unknowns' - unknown number of rifles, unknown amount of money, and unknown number of concubines. \u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u81ea\u5df1\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u67aa\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u81ea\u5df1\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u94b1\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u81ea\u5df1\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u59e8\u592a\u592a<ref>[http://baike.baidu.com/view/17617.htm \"Zhang Zongchang\"].</ref>\n\n[[Chinese people|Chinese]] men in [[Hong Kong]] could practice concubinage by virtue of the [[Qing Code]].

This is based on verse 4:3 of [[Quran]] which says:\n{{quote|If you fear you might fail to give orphan women their \u02f9due\u02fa rights \u02f9if you were to marry them\u02fa, then marry other women of your choice\u2014two, three, or four. But if you are afraid you will fail to maintain justice, then \u02f9content yourselves with\u02fa one or those \u02f9bondwomen\u02fa in your possession. This way you are less likely to commit injustice.|Qur'an, Sura 4 ([[An-Nisa]]), Ayah 3<ref name=\"cite quran|4|3|s=ns\">{{cite Quran|4|3 |s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\nThere are strict requirements to marrying more than one woman, as the man must treat them equally financially and in terms of support given to each wife, according to Islamic law.\n\nMuslim women aren't allowed to marry more than one husband at once. However, in the case of a [[divorce]] or their husbands' death they can remarry after the completion of [[Iddah]], as divorce is legal in Islamic law. A non-Muslim woman who flees from her non-Muslim husband and accepts [[Islam]] can remarry without divorce from her previous husband, as her marriage with non-Muslim husband is Islamically dissolved on her fleeing. A non-Muslim woman captured during war by Muslims, can also remarry, as her marriage with her non-Muslim husband is Islamically dissolved at capture by Muslim soldiers. This permission is given to such women in verse 4:24 of Quran. The verse also emphasizes on transparency, mutual agreement and financial compensation as prerequisites for matrimonial relationship as opposed to prostitution; it says:\n{{quote|Also \u02f9forbidden are\u02fa married women\u2014except \u02f9female\u02fa captives in your possession. This is God's commandment to you. Lawful to you are all beyond these\u2014as long as you seek them with your wealth in a legal marriage, not in fornication. Give those you have consummated marriage with their due dowries. It is permissible to be mutually gracious regarding the set dowry. Surely God is All-Knowing, All-Wise. |Qur'an, Sura 4 ([[An-Nisa]]), Ayah 24<ref name=\"cite quran|4|24|s=ns\">{{cite Quran|4|24 |s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] was monogamously married to [[Khadija]], his first wife, for 25 years, until she died. After her death, he married multiple women, mostly widows,<ref>\"[http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/articles/134426/prophet-muhammad-and-polygyny-i Prophet Muhammad and polygyny]\", IslamWeb.</ref> for social and political reasons.<ref>Sahar El-Nadi, \"[http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-about-islam/ethics-and-values/muslim-character/166258-why-did-the-prophet-have-so-many-wives.html Why Did the Prophet Have So Many Wives?],\" OnIslam.net</ref> He had a total of nine wives, but not all at the same time, depending on the sources in his lifetime. The Qur'an does not give preference in marrying more than one wife. One reason cited for polygyny is that it allows a man to give financial protection to multiple women, who might otherwise not have any support (e.g. widows).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islamweb.net/ver2/fatwa/ShowFatwa.php?lang=A&Id=18444&Option=FatwaId |title=IslamWeb |publisher=IslamWeb |date=7 February 2002 |accessdate=13 September 2011}}</ref> However, the wife can set a condition, in the [[nikah|marriage contract]], that the husband cannot marry another woman during their marriage.

Usually the wives have little to no contact with each other and lead separate, individual lives in their own houses, and sometimes in different cities, though they all share the same husband.\n\nIn most Muslim-majority countries, polygyny is legal with [[Kuwait]] being the only one where no restrictions are imposed on it. The practice is illegal in Muslim-majority [[Turkey]], [[Tunisia]], [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Central Asian]] countries.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHF8AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT230|title=Women, Islam and Everyday Life: Renegotiating Polygamy in Indonesia|first=Nina|last=Nurmila|date=10 June 2009|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=10 December 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781134033706}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkafricapress.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fthinkafricapress.com%2Ftunisia%2Ffuture-state-feminism#2848 |title=Tunisia: Protecting Ben Ali's Feminist Legacy |author=Maike Voorhoeve |publisher=[[Think Africa Press]] |date=31 January 2013 |accessdate=23 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njPYSxcBV-EC&pg=PA272|title=Social Assessment and Agricultural Reform in Central Asia and Turkey|first1=Ay?e|last1=Kudat|first2=Stan|last2=Peabody|first3=\u00c7a?lar|last3=Keyder|date=1 January 2000|publisher=World Bank Publications|accessdate=10 December 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9780821346785}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.un.org/press/fr/2007/FEM1625.doc.htm|title= LES EXPERTS DU CEDAW S'INQUI\u00c8TENT DE LA PERSISTANCE DE ST\u00c9R\u00c9OTYPES SEXISTES ET DE LA SITUAITON DES MINORIT\u00c9S EN SERBIE|publisher= [[United Nations]]|date= May 16, 2007|accessdate= February 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCountries that allow polygyny typically also require a man to obtain permission from his previous wives before marrying another, and require the man to prove that he can financially support multiple wives.
