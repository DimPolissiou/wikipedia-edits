Bishop Kelley students come from 53 different [[ZIP Code|zip codes]], with incoming freshmen and transfer students matriculating from more than 30 middle schools across [[Green Country|Northeast Oklahoma]]. Students come from a variety of faith and educational backgrounds. They are traditionally welcomed with extensive freshman orientation activities.\n\nThough Bishop Kelley is the flagship diocesan Catholic high school for the Diocese of Tulsa, it serves both Catholic and non-Catholic students. The school consistently ranks as one of the best private high schools in Oklahoma.<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Best Private High Schools in Oklahoma|url=https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-private-high-schools/s/oklahoma/|website=Niche}}</ref> \n\n==History==\nBishop Kelley was established in 1960 to serve as Tulsa's citywide Catholic high school.  At the time of its founding, its forerunners, Holy Family High School (founded 1899) and Marquette High School (founded in 1926), closed and consolidated their student bodies into the newly formed Bishop Kelley High School. While the initial plans for the school were developed under [[Eugene J. McGuinness|Bishop Eugene J. McGuinness']] leadership, it was the pioneering [[Victor Joseph Reed|Bishop Victor Joseph Reed]] who oversaw its founding.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.bishopkelley.org/about/history|website=Bishop Kelley High School|accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref> Bishop Reed was a famous Catholic reformer who attended all four sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]], where he was associated with the more progressive bishops, lending his support to the use of vernacular in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and to an emphasis of pastoral over administrative skills in bishops.<ref name=bonner>{{cite book|last1=Bonner|first1=Jeremy|title=The Road to Renewal: Victor Joseph Reed & Oklahoma Catholicism, 1905-1971|year=2008|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press}}</ref> Bishop Reed is in part responsible for the high school's legacy of lay leadership. In 1960, the year Bishop Kelley High School was founded, Bishop Reed established the first mixed (clerical and lay) diocesan board of education in the United States.<ref name=bonner>{{cite book|last1=Bonner|first1=Jeremy|title=The Road to Renewal: Victor Joseph Reed & Oklahoma Catholicism, 1905-1971|year=2008|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press}}</ref>\n\nThe school was named for [[Bishop]] [[Francis Kelley]], the second bishop of Oklahoma. The founder of the [[Catholic Church Extension Society]], Bishop Kelley was an accomplished author and diplomat, whom [[H.L. Mencken]] described as \"a charming Irishman\" who \"has had a brilliant career in the Church.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mencken|first1=H.L.|title=Diary of H. L. Mencken|date=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday}}</ref>  He famously partnered with California oilman [[Edward L.

Doheny|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520229096|page=118}}</ref>\n\nAt its founding, male students were taught by the LaSallian (French) Christian Brothers, who still teach at the school, while the [[Sisters of Divine Providence]] from [[San Antonio, Texas]] taught the female students. By 1965, the school had become entirely coeducational.  By 1982, the Sisters of Divine Providence had been reassigned to other ministries.\n\nThe original school building was designed by architect [[Robert Lawton Jones]], a Tulsa Catholic who had been a protege of [[Mies Van der Rohe]].<ref>{{cite web |title=ROBERT LAWTON JONES, FAIA (1925-2018) |url=https://tulsaarchitecture.org/architects/robert-lawton-jones-faia-1925/ |website=Tulsa Foundation for Architecture |accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\nCo-curricular opportunities include Academic Bowl, Christian Service, Class Board, Comet Ambassadors, Competitive One-Act, Drama, Drumline, Environmental Club, FCA, Foreign Language Clubs,3 on 3, Jazz Choir, Kairos, Kelley Krazies (a spirit organization), Link Crew (dedicated to mentoring freshmen), Lasallian Youth, Mission Trips, National Forensic League, Performing Arts, Play Production/Theater Tech, Photography Club, ProLife Club, Retreats, Robotics, and Student Council. The school is a frequent winner of state championships in speech and debate, academic bowl, and robotics competitions.\n\n==Athletics==\nBishop Kelley has won more state championships than any other school of its size in Oklahoma, including state championships in baseball, football, soccer, softball, volleyball, basketball, tennis, golf and cross country. Its women's volleyball and women's soccer teams have been nationally ranked. Bishop Kelley was the first Tulsa high school to support a lacrosse team.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moguin|first1=Mike|title=Lacrosse Becoming Popular in Greater Tulsa|url=http://gtrnews.com/greater-tulsa-reporter/14025/lacrosse-becoming-popular-in-greater-tulsa|accessdate=1 May 2017|work=Greater Tulsa Reporter|date=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nNCAA head coach [[Barry Hinson]] (currently coaching at [[Southern Illinois University]]) coached the men's basketball team at Bishop Kelley.\nBishop Kelley is also the site for [[Russell Westbrook]]'s \"Why Not\" Basketball camp.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vardeman|first1=Brady|title=Russell Westbrook's Tulsa visit sets Twitter ablaze|work=Tulsa World|date=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Bishops Rivalry===\n\nIn football, Bishop Kelley shares a tradition with cross-state rival [[Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School (Oklahoma)|Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School]].<ref name=shillelagh>{{cite news |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sports/extra/article.aspx?articleID=20080912_227_B3_spa158171&allcom=1 |work=Tulsa World |date=September 12, 2008 |last=Lewis |first=Barry |title=Bishop Kelley at OKC McGuinness: The stick that's all that}}</ref> The winner of the contest obtains possession of the \"[[Shillelagh (club)|Shillelagh]] Trophy\" for the upcoming year.<ref name=shillelagh/> The schools also compete annually in boys and girls basketball.\n\n===State Championships <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ossaa.com/Champions.aspx|title=History of Champions|publisher=ossaa.com}}</ref>===\n\n'''Academic Bowl''' - 1993, 1995, 1998, 2004, 2005*, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018\n\n'''Baseball''' - 1976, 1978, 2004, 2006, 2011, 2018\n\n'''Boys Basketball''' - 1995\n\n'''Boys Cross Country''' - 1967, 1968, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 2005, 2008\n\n'''Girls Cross Country''' - 1985, 1986, 2018\n\n'''Fast Pitch Softball''' - 1977, 1991, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2001\n\n'''Football''' - 1981\n\n'''Boys Golf''' - 1986, 1988, 1993, 2002, 2012, 2013\n\n'''Girls Golf''' - 1996, 2000, 2001, 2006\n\n'''Boys Soccer ''' - 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2017, 2018\n\n'''Girls Soccer ''' - 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2017\n\n'''Speech and Debate ''' - 1993, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2013\n\n'''Boys Tennis ''' - 1995, 1999, 2001, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010\n\n'''Girls Tennis''' - 1985, 1987, 1995, 1997, 2006, 2007, 2008\n\n'''Volleyball''' - 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2018\n\n'''Wrestling''' - 1974, 1975, 1984, 1985\n\n'''Spirit Squad''' - 2016, 2017, 2018\n\n'''Total ''': 105\n*The 2005 Bishop Kelley Academic Bowl team defeated the national champion academic bowl team in a scrimmage, but did not compete against them during the regular season because they were in a different athletic class.\n\n==Notable Bishop Kelley people==\n\n===Bishop Kelley alumni===\n====Arts, entertainment, media and letters====\n\n* [[Robert Bryce (writer)|Robert Bryce]] \u2013 journalist, commentator and author (books include ''[[Pipe Dreams: Greed, Ego, and the Death of Enron]]'')\n* Steven Castillo - writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tramel|first1=Jimmy|title=Pop culture: Tulsan among new faces hired by 'Saturday Night Live|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/scene/popculture/pop-culture-tulsan-among-new-faces-hired-by-saturday-night/article_4068e432-9727-5150-b67d-34ffdad8c324.html|accessdate=3 May 2018|work=Tulsa World|date=27 September 2017}}</ref> \n* [[Chris Combs (composer)|Chris Combs]] \u2013 avante-garde jazz composer and musician; guitarist for [[Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey]]\n* [[Samantha Isler]] \u2013 film and television actress best known for her role in ''[[Captain Fantastic (film)|Captain Fantastic]]'' and [[The CW]] series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''\n* [[Olivia Jordan]] \u2013 actress, pageant winner ([[Miss USA 2015]] and [[Miss World America|Miss World America 2013]])\n* [[Frank Main]] \u2013 reporter at the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' and winner of 2011 [[Pulitzer Prize]]\n* [[Matt Villines]] (1995) - film director (''[[Funny or Die]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'')<ref name=tw>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Smith |title=Tulsa filmmaker known for 'SNL' projects dies of cancer at 39  |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/tulsa-filmmaker-known-for-snl-projects-dies-of-cancer-at/article_8a7968ca-84bc-58d0-99f3-4b355cf2deb5.html |work=[[Tulsa World]] |date=2016-07-13 |accessdate=2016-08-06}}</ref>\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] \u2013 film and television actress ([[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominee; four-time [[Emmy Award]] winner; Grammy nominee)\n\n====Business, politics and civic life====\n\n* [[Dewey F.

Bishop Kelley students come from 53 different [[ZIP Code|zip codes]], with incoming freshmen and transfer students matriculating from more than 30 middle schools across [[Green Country|Northeast Oklahoma]]. Students come from a variety of faith and educational backgrounds. They are traditionally welcomed with extensive freshman orientation activities.\n\nThough Bishop Kelley is the flagship diocesan Catholic high school for the Diocese of Tulsa, it serves both Catholic and non-Catholic students. The school consistently ranks as one of the best private high schools in Oklahoma.<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Best Private High Schools in Oklahoma|url=https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-private-high-schools/s/oklahoma/|website=Niche}}</ref> \n\n==History==\nBishop Kelley was established in 1960 to serve as Tulsa's citywide Catholic high school.  At the time of its founding, its forerunners, Holy Family High School (founded 1899) and Marquette High School (founded in 1926), closed and consolidated their student bodies into the newly formed Bishop Kelley High School. While the initial plans for the school were developed under [[Eugene J. McGuinness|Bishop Eugene J. McGuinness']] leadership, it was the pioneering [[Victor Joseph Reed|Bishop Victor Joseph Reed]] who oversaw its founding.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.bishopkelley.org/about/history|website=Bishop Kelley High School|accessdate=26 April 2017}}</ref> Bishop Reed was a famous Catholic reformer who attended all four sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]], where he was associated with the more progressive bishops, lending his support to the use of vernacular in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and to an emphasis of pastoral over administrative skills in bishops.<ref name=bonner>{{cite book|last1=Bonner|first1=Jeremy|title=The Road to Renewal: Victor Joseph Reed & Oklahoma Catholicism, 1905-1971|year=2008|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press}}</ref> Bishop Reed is in part responsible for the high school's legacy of lay leadership. In 1960, the year Bishop Kelley High School was founded, Bishop Reed established the first mixed (clerical and lay) diocesan board of education in the United States.<ref name=bonner>{{cite book|last1=Bonner|first1=Jeremy|title=The Road to Renewal: Victor Joseph Reed & Oklahoma Catholicism, 1905-1971|year=2008|publisher=The Catholic University of America Press}}</ref>\n\nThe school was named for [[Bishop]] [[Francis Kelley]], the second bishop of Oklahoma. The founder of the [[Catholic Church Extension Society]], Bishop Kelley was an accomplished author and diplomat, whom [[H.L. Mencken]] described as \"a charming Irishman\" who \"has had a brilliant career in the Church.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mencken|first1=H.L.|title=Diary of H. L. Mencken|date=2012|publisher=Knopf Doubleday}}</ref>  He famously partnered with California oilman [[Edward L.

Doheny|date=2001|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520229096|page=118}}</ref>\n\nAt its founding, male students were taught by the LaSallian (French) Christian Brothers, who still teach at the school, while the [[Sisters of Divine Providence]] from [[San Antonio, Texas]] taught the female students. By 1965, the school had become entirely coeducational.  By 1982, the Sisters of Divine Providence had been reassigned to other ministries.\n\nThe original school building was designed by architect [[Robert Lawton Jones]], a Tulsa Catholic who had been a protege of [[Mies Van der Rohe]].<ref>{{cite web |title=ROBERT LAWTON JONES, FAIA (1925-2018) |url=https://tulsaarchitecture.org/architects/robert-lawton-jones-faia-1925/ |website=Tulsa Foundation for Architecture |accessdate=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\nCo-curricular opportunities include Academic Bowl, Christian Service, Class Board, Comet Ambassadors, Competitive One-Act, Drama, Drumline, Environmental Club, FCA, Foreign Language Clubs,3 on 3, Jazz Choir, Kairos, Kelley Krazies (a spirit organization), Link Crew (dedicated to mentoring freshmen), Lasallian Youth, Mission Trips, National Forensic League, Performing Arts, Play Production/Theater Tech, Photography Club, ProLife Club, Retreats, Robotics, and Student Council. The school is a frequent winner of state championships in speech and debate, academic bowl, and robotics competitions.\n\n==Athletics==\nBishop Kelley has won more state championships than any other school of its size in Oklahoma, including state championships in baseball, football, soccer, softball, volleyball, basketball, tennis, golf and cross country. Its women's volleyball and women's soccer teams have been nationally ranked. Bishop Kelley was the first Tulsa high school to support a lacrosse team.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moguin|first1=Mike|title=Lacrosse Becoming Popular in Greater Tulsa|url=http://gtrnews.com/greater-tulsa-reporter/14025/lacrosse-becoming-popular-in-greater-tulsa|accessdate=1 May 2017|work=Greater Tulsa Reporter|date=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nNCAA head coach [[Barry Hinson]] (currently coaching at [[Southern Illinois University]]) coached the men's basketball team at Bishop Kelley.\nBishop Kelley is also the site for [[Russell Westbrook]]'s \"Why Not\" Basketball camp.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vardeman|first1=Brady|title=Russell Westbrook's Tulsa visit sets Twitter ablaze|work=Tulsa World|date=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Battle of the Bishops Rivalry===\n\nIn football, Bishop Kelley shares a tradition with cross-state rival [[Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School (Oklahoma)|Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School]].<ref name=shillelagh>{{cite news |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sports/extra/article.aspx?articleID=20080912_227_B3_spa158171&allcom=1 |work=Tulsa World |date=September 12, 2008 |last=Lewis |first=Barry |title=Bishop Kelley at OKC McGuinness: The stick that's all that}}</ref> The winner of the contest obtains possession of the \"[[Shillelagh (club)|Shillelagh]] Trophy\" for the upcoming year.<ref name=shillelagh/> The schools also compete annually in boys and girls basketball.\n\n===State Championships <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ossaa.com/Champions.aspx|title=History of Champions|publisher=ossaa.com}}</ref>===\n\n'''Academic Bowl''' - 1993, 1995, 1998, 2004, 2005*, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018\n\n'''Baseball''' - 1976, 1978, 2004, 2006, 2011, 2018\n\n'''Boys Basketball''' - 1995\n\n'''Boys Cross Country''' - 1967, 1968, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 2005, 2008\n\n'''Girls Cross Country''' - 1985, 1986, 2018\n\n'''Fast Pitch Softball''' - 1977, 1991, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2001\n\n'''Football''' - 1981\n\n'''Boys Golf''' - 1986, 1988, 1993, 2002, 2012, 2013\n\n'''Girls Golf''' - 1996, 2000, 2001, 2006\n\n'''Boys Soccer ''' - 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2017, 2018\n\n'''Girls Soccer ''' - 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2017\n\n'''Speech and Debate ''' - 1993, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2013\n\n'''Boys Tennis ''' - 1995, 1999, 2001, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010\n\n'''Girls Tennis''' - 1985, 1987, 1995, 1997, 2006, 2007, 2008\n\n'''Volleyball''' - 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2018\n\n'''Wrestling''' - 1974, 1975, 1984, 1985\n\n'''Spirit Squad''' - 2016, 2017, 2018\n\n'''Total ''': 105\n*The 2005 Bishop Kelley Academic Bowl team defeated the national champion academic bowl team in a scrimmage, but did not compete against them during the regular season because they were in a different athletic class.\n\n==Notable Bishop Kelley people==\n\n===Bishop Kelley alumni===\n====Arts, entertainment, media and letters====\n\n* [[Robert Bryce (writer)|Robert Bryce]] \u2013 journalist, commentator and author (books include ''[[Pipe Dreams: Greed, Ego, and the Death of Enron]]'')\n* Steven Castillo - writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tramel|first1=Jimmy|title=Pop culture: Tulsan among new faces hired by 'Saturday Night Live|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/blogs/scene/popculture/pop-culture-tulsan-among-new-faces-hired-by-saturday-night/article_4068e432-9727-5150-b67d-34ffdad8c324.html|accessdate=3 May 2018|work=Tulsa World|date=27 September 2017}}</ref> \n* [[Chris Combs (composer)|Chris Combs]] \u2013 avante-garde jazz composer and musician; guitarist for [[Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey]]\n* [[Samantha Isler]] \u2013 film and television actress best known for her role in ''[[Captain Fantastic (film)|Captain Fantastic]]'' and [[The CW]] series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]''\n* [[Olivia Jordan]] \u2013 actress, pageant winner ([[Miss USA 2015]] and [[Miss World America|Miss World America 2013]])\n* [[Frank Main]] \u2013 reporter at the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' and winner of 2011 [[Pulitzer Prize]]\n* [[Matt Villines]] (1995) - film director (''[[Funny or Die]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'')<ref name=tw>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Smith |title=Tulsa filmmaker known for 'SNL' projects dies of cancer at 39  |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/tulsa-filmmaker-known-for-snl-projects-dies-of-cancer-at/article_8a7968ca-84bc-58d0-99f3-4b355cf2deb5.html |work=[[Tulsa World]] |date=2016-07-13 |accessdate=2016-08-06}}</ref>\n* [[Alfre Woodard]] \u2013 film and television actress ([[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominee; four-time [[Emmy Award]] winner; Grammy nominee)\n\n====Business, politics and civic life====\n\n* [[Dewey F.
