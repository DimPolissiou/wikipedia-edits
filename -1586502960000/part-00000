They argued (following the \"[[Kurgan hypothesis]]\") that the 'proto-Illyrians' had arrived much earlier, during the Bronze Age as nomadic Indo-Europeans from the steppe. From that point, there was a gradual ''Illyrianization'' of the western Balkans leading to historic Illyrians, with no early Iron Age migration from northern Europe. He did not deny a minor cultural impact from the northern Urnfield cultures, however \"these movements had neither a profound influence on the stability.. of the Balkans, nor did they affect the ethnogenesis of the Illyrian ethnos\".{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=19}}\n\n[[Aleksandar Stip\u010devi\u0107]] raised concerns regarding Benac's all-encompassing scenario of autochthonous ethnogenesis.

Following prevailing trends in discourse on identity in Iron Age Europe, current anthropological perspectives reject older theories of a ''[[longue duree]]'' (long term) ethnogenesis of Illyrians,{{sfn|Dzino|2012}} even where 'archaeological continuity' can be demonstrated to Bronze Age times.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=39}} argues that \"cannot fail to impress through their weight of archaeological evidence; but material remains alone can never tell the whole story and can mislead.\"</ref> They rather see the emergence of historic Illyrians tribes as a more recent phenomenon - just prior to their first attestation.{{sfn|Dzino|2012}}\n\nThe impetus behind the emergence of larger regional groups, such as \"Iapodes\", \"Liburnians\", \"Pannonians\" etc., is traced to increased contacts with the Mediterranean and [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] 'global worlds'.{{sfn|Dzino|2012|pp=74-76}} This catalyzed \"the development of more complex political institutions and the increase in differences between individual communities\".{{sfn|Dzino|2012|p=97}} Emerging local elites selectively adopted either La T\u00e8ne or Hellenistic and, later, Roman cultural templates \"in order to legitimise and strengthen domination within their communities. They were competing fiercely through either alliance or conflict and resistance to Roman expansion. Thus, they established more complex political alliances, which convinced (Greco-Roman) sources to see them as \u2018ethnic\u2019 identities.\"{{sfn|Dzino|2012|pp=84-85}} Contemporary perspectives again highlight that the term \"Illyrian\" was a 'catch-all' exonym used by the Greeks and Romans to denote diverse communities beyond Epirus and Macedonia.

The most numerous traces\u2014still insufficiently studied\u2014of [[religious practice|religious practices]] of the pre-Roman era are those relating to [[Religious symbol|religious symbolism]]. Symbols are depicted in every variety of ornament and reveal that the chief object of the prehistoric cult of the Illyrians was the [[Sun]],{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=182}}{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=244}} worshipped in a widespread and complex religious system.{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=182}} The solar deity was depicted as a [[Geometry|geometrical]] figure such as the [[spiral]], the concentric [[circle]] and the [[swastika]], or as an [[animal]] figure the likes of the [[birds]], [[Snake|serpents]] and [[horses]].{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|pp=182, 186}}{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=244}} The symbols of water-fowl and horses were more common in the north, while the serpent was more common in the south.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=244}} Illyrian deities were mentioned in inscriptions on [[statues]], [[monuments]], and [[coins]] of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman period]], and some [[Interpretatio graeca|interpreted]] by Ancient writers through [[comparative religion]].{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=245}}{{sfn|West|2007|p=15}} There appears to be no single most prominent god for all the [[List of ancient Illyrian peoples and tribes|Illyrian tribes]], and a number of deities evidently appear only in specific regions.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=245}} \n\nIn [[Illyris]], [[Deipaturos|Dei-p\u00e1trous]] was a god worshiped as the [[Sky Father]], [[Prende]] was the love-goddess and the consort of the thunder-god [[Perendi]], [[En (deity)|En or Enji]] was the fire-god, Jupiter Parthinus was a chief deity of the [[Parthini]], Redon was a tutelary deity of sailors appearing on many inscriptions in the coastal towns of [[Lissus]], [[Daorson]], [[Scodra]] and [[Dyrrhachium]], while [[Medaurus]] was the protector deity of [[Risinium]], with a monumental equestrian statue dominating the city from the acropolis. In [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]] one of the most popular ritual traditions during the Roman period was the cult of the Roman [[tutelary deity]] of the wild, woods and fields [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]], depicted with iconography of [[Pan (god)|Pan]]. The Roman deity of wine, fertility and freedom [[Liber]] was worshipped with the attributes of Silvanus, and those of [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the god protector of boundaries. Tadenus was a Dalmatian deity bearing the identity or epithet of [[Apollo]] in inscriptions found near the source of the Bosna river. The Delmatae also had Armatus as a war god in [[Delminium]]. The Silvanae, a feminine plural of Silvanus, were featured on many dedications across Pannonia. In the hot springs of Topusko ([[Pannonia Superior]]), sacrificial altars were dedicated to Vidasus and Thana (identified with [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]), whose names invariably stand side by side as companions. Aecorna or Arquornia was a lake or river tutelary goddess worshipped exclusively in the cities of [[Nauportus]] and [[Emona]], where she was the most important deity next to [[Jupiter]]. Laburus was also a local deity worshipped in Emona, perhaps a deity protecting the boatmen sailing.\n\nIt seems that the Illyrians did not develop a uniform cosmology on which to center their religious practices.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=244}} A number of Illyrian toponyms and anthroponyms derived from animal names and reflected the beliefs in animals as [[Myth|mythological]] ancestors and protectors.{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=197}} The [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] was one of the most important animal [[totems]].{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1976|p=235}} Illyrians believed in the force of [[Spell (ritual)|spells]] and the [[evil eye]], in the magic power of protective and beneficial [[Amulet|amulets]] which could avert the evil eye or the bad intentions of enemies.{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=182}}{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=245}} Human sacrifice also played a role in the lives of the Illyrians.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=123}}.</ref> [[Arrian]] records the chieftain [[Cleitus (Dardania)|Cleitus the Illyrian]] as sacrificing three boys, three girls and three rams just before his battle with [[Alexander the Great]].<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite book |author1=F.

The kin of the first tumuli was buried around that, and the higher the status of those in these burials the higher the mound. [[Archaeology]] has found many artifacts placed within these tumuli such as weapons, ornaments, garments and clay vessels. The rich spectrum in religious beliefs and burial rituals that emerged in Illyria, especially during the Roman period, may reflect the variation in cultural identities in this region.{{Sfn|Brandt|Ingvaldsen|Prusac|2014|p=249}}\n\n== Archaeology ==\n{{Further|Prehistoric Balkans}}\n\n[[File:Byllis-01-Alb.jpg|thumb|Details of the late antique cathedral complex in [[Byllis]], [[Albania]] and the [[Adriatic sea]] in the distance.]][[File:Daorson.jpg|thumb|right|Walls of ancient Daorson, located at O\u0161ani\u0107i near [[Stolac]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]\n\nThere are few remains to connect with the [[Prehistoric Balkans#Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] with the later Illyrians in the [[western Balkans]]. Moreover, with the notable exception of [[Pod, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pod]] near [[Bugojno]] in the upper valley of the [[Vrbas River]], nothing is known of their settlements. Some hill settlements have been identified in western Serbia, but the main evidence comes from cemeteries, consisting usually of a small number of burial mounds ([[tumuli]]). In the cemeteries of [[Beloti\u0107 (Ose\u010dina)|Beloti\u0107]] and [[Bela Crkva (Krupanj)|Bela Crkva]] ([[:sr:Beloti\u0107 Bela Crkva grupa|sr]]), the rites of exhumation and [[cremation]] are attested, with skeletons in stone [[cists]] and cremations in [[urns]]. Metal implements appear here side-by-side with stone implements. Most of the remains belong to the fully developed Middle Bronze Age. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nDuring the 7th century BC, the beginning of the Iron Age, the Illyrians emerge as an ethnic group with a distinct culture and art form. Various Illyrian tribes appeared, under the influence of the Halstatt cultures from the north, and they organized their regional centers.{{sfn|Wilkes|1992|p=140}} The cult of the dead played an important role in the lives of the Illyrians, which is seen in their carefully made burials and burial ceremonies, as well as the richness of the burial sites. In the northern parts of the Balkans, there existed a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves, while in the southern parts, the dead were buried in large stone, or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called ''gromile'') that in [[Herzegovina]] were reaching monumental sizes, more than 50 meters wide and 5 meters high. The ''Japodian tribe'' (found from [[Istria]] in [[Croatia]] to [[Biha\u0107]] in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]) have had an affinity for decoration with heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste, and large bronze fibulas, as well as spiral bracelets, diadems and helmets out of bronze. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Small sculptures out of jade in form of archaic Ionian plastic are also characteristically Japodian. Numerous monumental sculptures are preserved, as well as walls of [[citadel]] ''Nezakcij'' near [[Pula]], one of numerous Istrian cities from [[Iron Age]].

They argued (following the \"[[Kurgan hypothesis]]\") that the 'proto-Illyrians' had arrived much earlier, during the Bronze Age as nomadic Indo-Europeans from the steppe. From that point, there was a gradual ''Illyrianization'' of the western Balkans leading to historic Illyrians, with no early Iron Age migration from northern Europe. He did not deny a minor cultural impact from the northern Urnfield cultures, however \"these movements had neither a profound influence on the stability.. of the Balkans, nor did they affect the ethnogenesis of the Illyrian ethnos\".{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=19}}\n\n[[Aleksandar Stip\u010devi\u0107]] raised concerns regarding Benac's all-encompassing scenario of autochthonous ethnogenesis. He points out \"can one negate the participation of the bearers of the [[Urnfield culture|field-urn]] culture in the ethnogenesis of the Illyrian tribes who lived in present-day Slovenia and Croatia\" or \"Hellenistic and Mediterranean influences on southern Illyrians and Liburnians?\".{{sfn|Stip\u010devi\u0107|1977|p=19}} He concludes that Benac's model is only applicable to the Illyrian groups in Bosnia, western Serbia and a part of Dalmatia, where there had indeed been a settlement continuity and 'native' progression of pottery sequences since the Bronze Age. Following prevailing trends in discourse on identity in Iron Age Europe, current anthropological perspectives reject older theories of a ''[[longue duree]]'' (long term) ethnogenesis of Illyrians,{{sfn|Dzino|2012}} even where 'archaeological continuity' can be demonstrated to Bronze Age times.<ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=39}} argues that \"cannot fail to impress through their weight of archaeological evidence; but material remains alone can never tell the whole story and can mislead.\"</ref> They rather see the emergence of historic Illyrians tribes as a more recent phenomenon - just prior to their first attestation.{{sfn|Dzino|2012}}\n\nThe impetus behind the emergence of larger regional groups, such as \"Iapodes\", \"Liburnians\", \"Pannonians\" etc., is traced to increased contacts with the Mediterranean and [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]] 'global worlds'.{{sfn|Dzino|2012|pp=74-76}} This catalyzed \"the development of more complex political institutions and the increase in differences between individual communities\".{{sfn|Dzino|2012|p=97}} Emerging local elites selectively adopted either La T\u00e8ne or Hellenistic and, later, Roman cultural templates \"in order to legitimise and strengthen domination within their communities. They were competing fiercely through either alliance or conflict and resistance to Roman expansion. Thus, they established more complex political alliances, which convinced (Greco-Roman) sources to see them as \u2018ethnic\u2019 identities.\"{{sfn|Dzino|2012|pp=84-85}} Contemporary perspectives again highlight that the term \"Illyrian\" was a 'catch-all' exonym used by the Greeks and Romans to denote diverse communities beyond Epirus and Macedonia.

In [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Pannonia]] one of the most popular ritual traditions during the Roman period was the cult of the Roman [[tutelary deity]] of the wild, woods and fields [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]], depicted with iconography of [[Pan (god)|Pan]]. The Roman deity of wine, fertility and freedom [[Liber]] was worshipped with the attributes of Silvanus, and those of [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]], the god protector of boundaries. Tadenus was a Dalmatian deity bearing the identity or epithet of [[Apollo]] in inscriptions found near the source of the Bosna river. The Delmatae also had Armatus as a war god in [[Delminium]]. The Silvanae, a feminine plural of Silvanus, were featured on many dedications across Pannonia. In the hot springs of Topusko ([[Pannonia Superior]]), sacrificial altars were dedicated to Vidasus and Thana (identified with [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]), whose names invariably stand side by side as companions. Aecorna or Arquornia was a lake or river tutelary goddess worshipped exclusively in the cities of [[Nauportus]] and [[Emona]], where she was the most important deity next to [[Jupiter]].

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis in 1857 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

The very first, possibly from the whole area, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of the area's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nJan was followed by the Tichacek family to St. Louis in 1857 and Jan \"John Adam\" Stupka (1825-1914) who settled in [[Monmouth, Iowa]] around 1859. Immigration slowed because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army|Union army]]. This lasted until the later half of the 1860s.

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life.

It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi.

This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice.

Throughout history, women have not had the same freedom or independence as men to pursue homosexual relationships, but neither have they met the same harsh punishment as homosexual men in some societies. Instead, lesbian relationships have often been regarded as harmless, unless a participant attempts to assert privileges traditionally enjoyed by men. As a result, little in history was documented to give an accurate description of how female homosexuality was expressed. When early [[sexologists]] in the late 19th century began to categorize and describe homosexual behavior, hampered by a lack of knowledge about homosexuality or women's sexuality, they distinguished lesbians as women who did not adhere to female [[gender]] roles and incorrectly designated them mentally ill\u2014a designation which has been reversed in the global scientific community.\n\nWomen in homosexual relationships responded to this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and [[Identity (social science)|identity]] that developed in Europe and the United States. Following [[World War II]], during a period of social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With [[second wave feminism]] and the growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of ''lesbian'' broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior. Sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a [[Homophobia|homophobic]] setting.\n\nPortrayals of lesbians in the media suggest that society at large has been simultaneously intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine [[gender role]]s, as well as fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women. Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity: as homosexuals, they are unified by the [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] [[discrimination]] and potential rejection they face from their families, friends, and others as a result of homophobia. As women, they face concerns separate from men. Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns arising from discrimination, [[prejudice]], and [[minority stress]]. Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships and families in open.\n\n==Origin and transformation of the term==\n[[File:Godward-In the Days of Sappho-1904.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sappho]] of [[Lesbos]], depicted here in a 1904 painting by [[John William Godward]], gave the term ''lesbian'' the connotation of erotic desire between women.|alt=Painting of a woman dressed in Greek robes sitting on a marble bench with trees and water in the distance.]]\n\nThe word ''lesbian'' is derived from the name of the Greek island of [[Lesbos]], home to the 6th-century BCE poet [[Sappho]].<ref name=\"Lesbian\"/> From various ancient writings, historians gathered that a group of young women were left in Sappho's charge for their instruction or cultural edification.<ref>Foster, p. 18.</ref> Little of Sappho's poetry survives, but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about: women's daily lives, their relationships, and rituals.

In the middle of the 19th century, medical writers attempted to establish ways to identify male homosexuality, which was considered a significant social problem in most Western societies. In categorizing behavior that indicated what was referred to as \"[[Sexual inversion (sexology)|inversion]]\" by German sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], researchers categorized what was normal sexual behavior for men and women, and therefore to what extent men and women varied from the \"perfect male sexual type\" and the \"perfect female sexual type\".<ref>Aldrich, p. 168.</ref>\n\nFar less literature focused on female homosexual behavior than on male homosexuality, as medical professionals did not consider it a significant problem. In some cases, it was not acknowledged to exist. However, sexologists [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] from Germany, and Britain's [[Havelock Ellis]] wrote some of the earliest and more enduring categorizations of female [[same-sex attraction]], approaching it as a form of insanity (Ellis' categorization of \"lesbianism\" as a medical problem is now discredited).<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 241.</ref> Krafft-Ebing, who considered lesbianism (what he termed \"[[Uranian|Uranism]]\") a neurological disease, and Ellis, who was influenced by Krafft-Ebing's writings, disagreed about whether sexual inversion was generally a lifelong condition. Ellis believed that many women who professed love for other women changed their feelings about such relationships after they had experienced marriage and a \"practical life\".<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 242.</ref>\n\nHowever, Ellis conceded that there were \"true inverts\" who would spend their lives pursuing erotic relationships with women. These were members of the \"[[Third gender|third sex]]\" who rejected the roles of women to be subservient, feminine, and domestic.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 240.</ref> ''Invert'' described the opposite gender roles, and also the related attraction to women instead of men; since women in the [[Victorian period]] were considered unable to initiate sexual encounters, women who did so with other women were thought of as possessing masculine sexual desires.<ref>Jennings, p. 77.</ref>\n\nThe work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis was widely read, and helped to create public consciousness of female homosexuality.<ref group=note>In Germany between 1898 and 1908 over a thousand articles were published regarding the topic of homosexuality. (Faderman [1981], p. 248) Between 1896 and 1916, 566 articles on women's \"perversions\" were published in the United States. (Faderman, [1991], p. 49.)</ref> The sexologists' claims that homosexuality was a congenital anomaly were generally well-accepted by homosexual men; it indicated that their behavior was not inspired by nor should be considered a criminal vice, as was widely acknowledged. In the absence of any other material to describe their emotions, homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin. ''Lesbian'' began to describe elements of a subculture.<ref>Aldrich, 178\u2013179.</ref>\n\nLesbians in Western cultures in particular often classify themselves as having an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] that defines their individual sexuality, as well as their membership to a group that shares common traits.<ref name=\"rust\">Rust, Paula C.

According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator is not necessary to identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital.<ref>McCormick, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the [[feminist sex wars]].<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 246\u2013252.</ref> Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed as they were in the 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.<ref>Faderman, Lillian (April 1992). \"The Return of Butch and Femme: A Phenomenon in Lesbian Sexuality in the 1980s and 1990s\", ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'', '''2''' (4), pp. 578\u2013596.</ref>\n\nThe focus of this debate often centers on a phenomenon named by sexologist [[Pepper Schwartz]] in 1983. Schwartz found that long-term lesbian couples report having less sexual contact than heterosexual or homosexual male couples, calling this [[lesbian bed death]]. However, lesbians dispute the study's definition of sexual contact, and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant, greater [[sexual fluidity]] in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives\u2014or reject the labels entirely. Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate sexual contact between women, or sexual contact between women has increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves.<ref name=\"nichols\">Nichols, Margaret (November, 2004). \"Lesbian Sexuality/Female Sexuality: Rethinking 'Lesbian Bed Death'\", ''Sexual and Relationship Therapy'', '''19''' (4), pp. 364\u2013371.</ref>\n\nMore discussion on gender and [[sexual orientation identity]] has affected how many women label or view themselves. Most people in western culture are taught that heterosexuality is an innate quality in all people. When a woman realizes her romantic and sexual attraction to another woman, it may cause an \"existential crisis\"; many who go through this adopt the identity of a lesbian, challenging what society has offered in stereotypes about homosexuals, to learn how to function within a homosexual subculture.<ref>Schlager, p. 93.</ref> Lesbians in western cultures generally share an identity that parallels those built on ethnicity; they have a shared history and subculture, and similar experiences with discrimination which has caused many lesbians to reject heterosexual principles. This identity is unique from gay men and heterosexual women, and often creates tension with bisexual women.<ref name=\"rust\" /> One point of contention are lesbians who have had sex with men, while lesbians who have never had sex with men may be referred to as \"gold star lesbians\". Those who have had sex with men may face ridicule from other lesbians or identity challenges with regard to defining what it means to be a lesbian.<ref name=\"Shelby\">{{cite book|author1=R Dennis Shelby |author2=Kathleen Dolan|title=Lesbian Women and Sexual Health: The Social Construction of Risk and Susceptibility|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1317718192|year=2014|page=34|accessdate=April 11, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNQJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA34}}</ref>\n\nResearchers, including [[social scientists]], state that often behavior and identity do not match: women may label themselves heterosexual but have sexual relations with women, self-identified lesbians may have sex with men, or women may find that what they considered an immutable sexual identity has changed over time.<ref name=\"Solarz\"/><ref name=\"Diamond\">{{cite book|author=Lisa M.

How and where study samples were obtained can also affect the definition.<ref name=\"Solarz\"/>\n\n==Female homosexuality without identity in western culture==\n===General===\n{{Further|History of lesbianism}}\n\nThe varied meanings of ''lesbian'' since the early 20th century have prompted some historians to revisit historic relationships between women before the wide usage of the word was defined by erotic proclivities. Discussion from historians caused further questioning of what qualifies as a lesbian relationship. As lesbian-feminists asserted, a sexual component was unnecessary in declaring oneself a lesbian if the primary and closest relationships were with women. When considering past relationships within appropriate historic context, there were times when love and sex were separate and unrelated notions.<ref>Rothblum, pp. 4\u20137.</ref> In 1989, an academic cohort named the Lesbian History Group wrote: <blockquote>Because of society's reluctance to admit that lesbians exist, a high degree of certainty is expected before historians or biographers are allowed to use the label. Evidence that would suffice in any other situation is inadequate here... A woman who never married, who lived with another woman, whose friends were mostly women, or\nwho moved in known lesbian or mixed gay circles, may well have been a lesbian. ... But this sort of evidence is not 'proof'. What our critics want is incontrovertible evidence of sexual activity between women. This is almost impossible to find.<ref>Norton, p. 184.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFemale sexuality is often not adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much of what has been documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men\u2014as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example.<ref>Rabinowitz, p. 2.</ref> Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.\n\n===Ancient Greece and Rome===\n{{Further|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Homosexuality in ancient Rome}}\n\nHistory is often analyzed with contemporary ideologies; [[ancient Greece]] as a subject enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance.<ref>Rabinowitz, p. 11.</ref> Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet [[Alcman]] used the term ''aitis,'' as the feminine form of ''aites''\u2014which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship.<ref name=\"bremmer 27-28\">Bremmer, pp. 27\u201328.</ref> [[Aristophanes]], in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', mentions women who love women, but uses the term ''trepesthai'' (to be focused on) instead of ''eros'', which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.<ref>Aldrich, p. 47.</ref>\n\nHistorian Nancy Rabinowitz argues that ancient Greek [[Pottery of ancient Greece|red vase]] images portraying women with their arms around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's shoulders can be construed as expressions of romantic desire.<ref>Rabinowitz, p. 115.</ref> Much of the daily lives of women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with [[dildo]]s placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.<ref name=\"bremmer 27-28\" /><ref>Rabinowitz, p. 148.</ref>\n\nWomen in [[ancient Rome]] were similarly subject to men's definitions of sexuality. Modern scholarship indicates that men viewed female homosexuality with hostility. They considered women who engaged in sexual relations with other women to be biological oddities that would attempt to penetrate women\u2014and sometimes men\u2014with \"monstrously enlarged\" [[clitoris]]es.<ref>Verstraete, p. 238.</ref> According to scholar James Butrica, lesbianism \"challenged not only the Roman male's view of himself as the exclusive giver of sexual pleasure but also the most basic foundations of Rome's male-dominated culture\". No historical documentation exists of women who had other women as sex partners.<ref>Verstraete, pp. 239\u2013240.</ref>\n\n===Early modern Europe===\n[[File:Hermaphrodite engraving circa 1690.jpg|thumb|upright|Lesbianism and [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]], depicted here in an engraving circa 1690, were very similar concepts during the Renaissance.|alt=A front and back illustration of a Renaissance-era hermaphrodite showing a person with female facial features, breasts, and what appears to be a small penis or large clitoris.

She has no buttocks.]]\n\nFemale homosexuality has not received the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, men and women, and men and animals was punishable by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270.<ref name=\"norton191\">Norton, p. 191.</ref> In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.<ref>Aldrich, p. 130.</ref>\n\nThe earliest such execution occurred in [[Speyer|Speier, Germany]], in 1477. Forty days' [[penance]] was demanded of nuns who \"rode\" each other or were discovered to have touched each other's breasts. An Italian nun named Sister [[Benedetta Carlini]] was documented to have seduced many of her sisters when possessed by a Divine spirit named \"Splenditello\"; to end her relationships with other women, she was placed in solitary confinement for the last 40 years of her life.<ref>Norton, p. 190.</ref> Female homoeroticism, however, was so common in English literature and theater that historians suggest it was fashionable for a period during the [[Renaissance]].<ref>Jennings. p. 1.</ref>\n\nIdeas about women's sexuality were linked to contemporary understanding of female physiology. The [[vagina]] was considered an inward version of the penis; where nature's perfection created a man, often nature was thought to be trying to right itself by prolapsing the vagina to form a penis in some women.<ref>Jennings, p. 12.</ref> These sex changes were later thought to be cases of [[hermaphrodite]]s, and hermaphroditism became synonymous with female same-sex desire. Medical consideration of hermaphroditism depended upon measurements of the [[clitoris]]; a longer, engorged clitoris was thought to be used by women to penetrate other women. Penetration was the focus of concern in all sexual acts, and a woman who was thought to have uncontrollable desires because of her engorged clitoris was called a \"tribade\" (literally, one who rubs).<ref>Jennings, pp. 14\u201316.</ref> Not only was an abnormally engorged clitoris thought to create lusts in some women that led them to masturbate, but pamphlets warning women about [[masturbation]] leading to such oversized organs were written as cautionary tales. For a while, masturbation and lesbian sex carried the same meaning.<ref>Aldrich, p. 129.</ref>\n\nClass distinction, however, became linked as the fashion of female homoeroticism passed. Tribades were simultaneously considered members of the lower class trying to ruin virtuous women, and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery. Satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals (or more often, their wives) engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was rumored to have a passionate relationship with [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill]], Duchess of Marlborough, her closest adviser and confidante. When Churchill was ousted as the queen's favorite, she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen.<ref>Aldrich, p. 137.</ref> [[Marie Antoinette]] was also the subject of such speculation for some months between 1795 and 1796.<ref>Jennings, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\n===Female husbands===\n[[File:Viola and the Countess - Frederick Richard Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Gender masquerade as a dramatic device was popular in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as this scene from ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' painted by [[Frederick Richard Pickersgill|Frederick Pickersgill]].|alt=Painting of a Renaissance-era woman dressed as a man, standing and looking away, as a woman dressed as a woman holds the other's hand to her breast, looking imploringly at the other, set against a bucolic backdrop.]]\n\nHermaphroditism appeared in medical literature enough to be considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (1601), ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' by [[Edmund Spenser]] in 1590, and [[James Shirley]]'s ''[[The Bird in a Cage]]'' (1633).<ref>Jennings, pp. 1\u201311, 22\u201324.</ref> Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.<ref group=note>Whether these cases would be more accurately described in contemporary sociology as [[transgender]] is debated, and based on the individual details of each case.</ref>\n\nIf found, punishments ranged from death, to time in the [[pillory]], to being ordered never to dress as a man again. [[Henry Fielding]] wrote a pamphlet titled ''The Female Husband'' in 1746, based on the life of [[Mary Hamilton (bigamist)|Mary Hamilton]], who was arrested after marrying a woman while masquerading as a man, and was sentenced to public whipping and six months in jail. Similar examples were procured of Catharine Linck in Prussia in 1717, executed in 1721; Swiss Anne Grandjean married and relocated with her wife to Lyons, but was exposed by a woman with whom she had had a previous affair and sentenced to time in the stocks and prison.<ref name=\"faderman54\">Faderman, pp. 51\u201354.</ref>\n\nQueen [[Christina of Sweden]]'s tendency to dress as a man was well known during her time, and excused because of her noble birth. She was brought up as a male and there was speculation at the time that she was a hermaphrodite. Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage, she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women.<ref>Faderman, pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\nSome historians view cases of cross-dressing women to be manifestations of women seizing power they would naturally be unable to enjoy in feminine attire, or their way of making sense out of their desire for women. Lillian Faderman argues that Western society was threatened by women who rejected their feminine roles. Catharine Linck and other women who were accused of using dildos, such as two nuns in 16th century Spain executed for using \"material instruments\", were punished more severely than those who did not.<ref name=\"norton191\" /><ref name=\"faderman54\" /> Two marriages between women were recorded in [[Cheshire]], England, in 1707 (between Hannah Wright and Anne Gaskill) and 1708 (between Ane Norton and Alice Pickford) with no comment about both parties being female.<ref>Jennings, p. 30.</ref><ref name=\"Aldrich, p. 136\">Aldrich, p. 136.</ref> Reports of clergymen with lax standards who performed weddings\u2014and wrote their suspicions about one member of the wedding party\u2014continued to appear for the next century.\n\nOutside Europe, women were able to dress as men and go undetected.

Documentation of these relationships is possible by a large volume of letters written between women. Whether the relationship included any genital component was not a matter for public discourse, but women could form strong and exclusive bonds with each other and still be considered virtuous, innocent, and chaste; a similar relationship with a man would have destroyed a woman's reputation. In fact, these relationships were promoted as alternatives to and practice for a woman's marriage to a man.<ref>Faderman (1981), pp. 74\u201377.</ref><ref group=note>In a rare instance of sexuality being the focus of a romantic friendship, two Scottish schoolteachers in the early 19th century were accused by a student of visiting in the same bed, kissing, and making the bed shake.

In all-female surroundings, a culture of romantic pursuit was fostered in women's colleges. Older students mentored younger ones, called on them socially, took them to all-women dances, and sent them flowers, cards, and poems that declared their undying love for each other.<ref name=\"smashes\">Faderman (1981), pp. 297\u2013313.</ref> These were called \"smashes\" or \"spoons\", and they were written about quite frankly in stories for girls aspiring to attend college in publications such as ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'', a children's magazine titled ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine|St. Nicholas]]'', and a collection called ''Smith College Stories'', without negative views.<ref>Foster, p. 255.</ref> Enduring loyalty, devotion, and love were major components to these stories, and sexual acts beyond kissing were consistently absent.<ref name=\"smashes\" />\n\nWomen who had the option of a career instead of marriage labeled themselves [[New Woman|New Women]], and took their new opportunities very seriously.<ref group=note>First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] exchanged rings with and wrote letters to journalist [[Lorena Hickok]], expressing her love and desire to kiss Hickock; her writings were in the style of romantic friendship.

The novel's plot centers around Stephen Gordon, a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing's ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (Richard von Krafft-Ebing book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]'', and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 320.</ref> Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing's theories and rejected [[Freud]]'s theory that [[same-sex attraction]] was caused by childhood trauma and was curable. The publicity Hall received was due to unintended consequences; the novel was tried for [[obscenity]] in London, a spectacularly scandalous event described as \"''the'' crystallizing moment in the construction of a visible modern English lesbian subculture\" by professor Laura Doan.<ref>Doan, p.

When British women participated in World War I, they became familiar with masculine clothing, and were considered patriotic for wearing uniforms and pants. However, postwar masculinization of women's clothing became associated with lesbians.<ref>Doan, pp. 64\u201366.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gladys Bentley.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Harlem]] resident [[Gladys Bentley]] was renowned for her [[blues]] songs about her affairs with women.|alt=A publicity photo of a stout African American woman in white tuxedo with tails and top hat, carrying a cane and her signature in the lower right corner.]]\n\nIn the United States, the 1920s was a decade of social experimentation, particularly with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts were a part of lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 63\u201367.</ref>\n\nNo location saw more visitors for its possibilities of homosexual nightlife than [[Harlem]], the predominantly African American section of [[New York City]]. White \"slummers\" enjoyed [[jazz]], nightclubs, and anything else they wished. [[Blues]] singers [[Ma Rainey]], [[Bessie Smith]], [[Ethel Waters]], and [[Gladys Bentley]] sang about affairs with women to visitors such as [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Beatrice Lillie]], and the soon-to-be-named [[Joan Crawford]].<ref>Faderman (1991), p. 71.</ref><ref>Zimmerman, p. 354.</ref> Homosexuals began to draw comparisons between their newly recognized minority status and that of African Americans.<ref>Faderman (1991), p. 68.</ref> Among African American residents of [[Harlem]], lesbian relationships were common and tolerated, though not overtly embraced. Some women staged lavish wedding ceremonies, even filing licenses using masculine names with New York City.<ref>Faderman (1991), p. 73.</ref> Most women, however, were married to men and participated in affairs with women regularly; bisexuality was more widely accepted than lesbianism.<ref>Zimmerman, p. 355.</ref>\n\nAcross town, [[Greenwich Village]] also saw a growing homosexual community; both Harlem and Greenwich Village provided furnished rooms for single men and women, which was a major factor in their development as centers for homosexual communities.<ref>Norton, p. 181.</ref> The tenor was different in Greenwich Village than Harlem, however. [[Bohemianism|Bohemians]]\u2014intellectuals who rejected Victorian ideals\u2014gathered in the Village. Homosexuals were predominantly male, although figures such as poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and social host [[Mabel Dodge]] were known for their affairs with women and promotion of tolerance of homosexuality.<ref>Faderman, pp. 82\u201383.</ref> Women in the U.S. who could not visit Harlem or live in Greenwich Village for the first time were able to visit saloons in the 1920s without being considered prostitutes. The existence of a public space for women to socialize in [[Lesbian bars|bars]] that were known to cater to lesbians \"became the single most important public manifestation of the subculture for many decades\", according to historian [[Lillian Faderman]].<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 79\u201380.</ref>\n\n===The Great Depression===\nThe primary component necessary to encourage lesbians to be public and seek other women was economic independence, which virtually disappeared in the 1930s with the [[Great Depression]]. Most women in the U.S. found it necessary to marry, to a \"[[Beard (companion)|front]]\" such as a gay man where both could pursue homosexual relationships with public discretion, or to a man who expected a traditional wife. Independent women in the 1930s were generally seen as holding jobs that men should have.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 94\u201396.</ref>\n\nThe social attitude made very small and close-knit communities in large cities that centered around bars, while simultaneously isolating women in other locales. Speaking of homosexuality in any context was socially forbidden, and women rarely discussed lesbianism even amongst themselves; they referred to openly gay people as \"in the Life\".<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 105\u2013112.</ref><ref group=note>Historian [[Vern Bullough]] published a paper based on an unfinished study of mental and physical traits performed by a lesbian in [[Salt Lake City]] during the 1920s and 1930s. The compiler of the study reported on 23 of her colleagues, indicating there was an underground lesbian community in the conservative city. Bullough remarked that the information was being used to support the attitude that lesbians were not abnormal or maladjusted, but it also reflected that women included in the study strove in every way to conform to social gender expectations, viewing anyone who pushed the boundaries of respectability with hostility. Bullough wrote, \"In fact, their very success in disguising their sexual orientation to the outside world leads us to hypothesize that lesbianism in the past was more prevalent than the sources might indicate, since society was so unsuspecting.\" (Bullough, Vern; Bullough, Bonnie [Summer 1977]. \"Lesbianism in the 1920s and 1930s: A Newfound Study\", ''Signs'', pp. 895\u2013904.)</ref> Freudian psychoanalytic theory was pervasive in influencing doctors to consider homosexuality as a neurosis afflicting immature women.

Women were also accepted into the military in the U.S. [[Women's Army Corps]] (WACs) and U.S. Navy's [[Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service]] (WAVES). Unlike processes to screen out male homosexuals, which had been in place since the creation of the American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by the military in the 1940s, and frailty discouraged.<ref name=\"Berube, pp. 28\u201333\">Berube, pp. 28\u201333.</ref>\n\nSome women were able to arrive at the recruiting station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted.<ref name=\"Berube, pp. 28\u201333\"/> Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and [[blue discharge]] was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian [[Allan Berube|Allan B\u00e9rub\u00e9]] documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.<ref>Berube, p. 104.</ref>\n\nThe most masculine women were not necessarily common, though they were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright.<ref>Berube, p. 100.</ref> Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, in order to continue national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands, something that would not have been feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 129\u2013130.</ref>\n\nLesbians were not included under [[Paragraph 175]], a German statute which made homosexual acts between males a crime. The [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] stipulates that this is because women were seen as subordinate to men, and that the Nazi state feared lesbians less than gay men. However, the USHMM also claims that many women were arrested and imprisoned for \"asocial\" behaviour, a label which was applied to women who did not conform to the ideal Nazi image of a woman: cooking, cleaning, kitchen work, child raising, and passivity. These women were labeled with a black triangle.<ref name=USHMM1>{{cite web|title=LESBIANS AND THE THIRD REICH|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005478|website=ushmm.org|publisher=USHMM|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref> Some lesbians reclaimed this symbol for themselves as gay men reclaimed the pink triangle.

Community meeting places consisted of bars that were commonly raided by police once a month on average, with those arrested exposed in newspapers. In response, eight women in San Francisco met in their living rooms in 1955 to socialize and have a safe place to dance. When they decided to make it a regular meeting, they became the first organization for lesbians in the U.S., titled the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB). The DOB began publishing a magazine titled ''[[The Ladder (magazine)|The Ladder]]'' in 1956. Inside the front cover of every issue was their mission statement, the first of which stated was \"Education of the variant\". It was intended to provide women with knowledge about homosexuality\u2014specifically relating to women and famous lesbians in history. However, by 1956, the term \"lesbian\" had such a negative meaning that the DOB refused to use it as a descriptor, choosing \"variant\" instead.<ref>Gallo, p. 3.</ref>\n\nThe DOB spread to Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, and ''The Ladder'' was mailed to hundreds\u2014eventually thousands\u2014of DOB members discussing the nature of homosexuality, sometimes challenging the idea that it was a sickness, with readers offering their own reasons why they were lesbians and suggesting ways to cope with the condition or society's response to it.<ref name=\"esterberg\" /> British lesbians followed with the publication of ''[[Arena Three (magazine)|Arena Three]]'' beginning in 1964, with a similar mission.<ref>Jennings, pp. 153\u2013158.</ref>\n\n[[File:Thirdsex bookcover 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|Though marketed to heterosexual men, [[lesbian pulp fiction]] provided an identity to isolated women in the 1950s.|alt=A brightly painted book cover with the title \"The Third Sex\", with a sultry blonde wearing a red outfit showing cleavage and midriff seated on a sofa, while a redhead with short hair places her hand on the blonde's shoulder and leans over her, also displaying cleavage wearing a white blouse with rolled-up sleeves.]]\n\n==== Butch and femme dichotomy ====\n{{Further|Butch and femme}}\n\nAs a reflection of categories of sexuality so sharply defined by the government and society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as [[Butch and femme|butches]]: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\nButch women were not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were pervasive and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions.<ref>Jennings, pp. 141\u2013143.</ref> They further identified members of a group that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 170\u2013174.</ref> Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 175\u2013178.</ref>\n\n==== Lesbian-themed fiction ====\n{{See also|Lesbian literature}}\nRegardless of the lack of information about homosexuality in scholarly texts, another forum for learning about lesbianism was growing. A paperback book titled ''Women's Barracks'' describing a woman's experiences in the [[Free French Forces]] was published in 1950. It told of a lesbian relationship the author had witnessed. After 4.5 million copies were sold, it was consequently named in the [[House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials]] in 1952.<ref>Stryker, p. 49.</ref> Its publisher, [[Gold Medal Books]], followed with the novel ''[[Spring Fire]]'' in 1952, which sold 1.5 million copies. Gold Medal Books was overwhelmed with mail from women writing about the subject matter, and followed with more books, creating the genre of [[lesbian pulp fiction]].<ref>Stryker, pp. 54\u201357.</ref>\n\nBetween 1955 and 1969 over 2,000 books were published using lesbianism as a topic, and they were sold in corner drugstores, train stations, bus stops, and newsstands all over the U.S. and Canada. Most were written by, and almost all were marketed to heterosexual men. Coded words and images were used on the covers. Instead of \"lesbian\", terms such as \"strange\", \"twilight\", \"queer\", and \"third sex\", were used in the titles, and cover art was invariably salacious.<ref>Zimet, pp. 17\u201324.</ref> A handful of lesbian pulp fiction authors were women writing for lesbians, including [[Ann Bannon]], [[Valerie Taylor (novelist)|Valerie Taylor]], Paula Christian, and [[Marijane Meaker|Vin Packer/Ann Aldrich]]. Bannon, who also purchased lesbian pulp fiction, later stated that women identified the material iconically by the cover art.<ref name=\"forbidden\">''[[Forbidden Love: The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives]]''. Dir. Fernie, L., Weissman. Videocassette. Women Make Movies Home Video, 1994.</ref> Many of the books used cultural references: naming places, terms, describing modes of dress and other codes to isolated women. As a result, pulp fiction helped to proliferate a lesbian identity simultaneously to lesbians and heterosexual readers.<ref name=\"nestle\">[[Joan Nestle|Nestle, Joan]] (1983). \"Desire So Big It Had to Be Brave\", [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]].</ref>\n\n===Second-wave feminism===\nThe social rigidity of the 1950s and early 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements to improve the standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]].<ref>Aldrich, pp. 212\u2013216.</ref> What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.\n\nThe [[sexual revolution]] in the 1970s introduced the differentiation between identity and sexual behavior for women. Many women took advantage of their new social freedom to try new experiences. Women who previously identified as heterosexual tried sex with women, though many maintained their heterosexual identity.<ref>Faderman (1991), p. 203.</ref> However, with the advent of [[Feminist Movement in the United States (1963\u20131982)|second wave feminism]], lesbian as a political identity grew to describe a social philosophy among women, often overshadowing sexual desire as a defining trait. A militant feminist organization named [[Radicalesbians]] published a [[manifesto]] in 1970 entitled \"[[The Woman-Identified Woman]]\" that declared \"A lesbian is the rage of all women condensed to the point of explosion\".<ref>Schlager, p. 70.</ref><ref group=note>A similar statement appeared in a militant feminist pamphlet in [[Leeds, England]], stating \"Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women.\" (Jennings, p. 177.) See: [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]]</ref>\n\nMilitant feminists expressed their disdain with an inherently sexist and patriarchal society, and concluded the most effective way to overcome sexism and attain the equality of women would be to deny men any power or pleasure from women. For women who subscribed to this philosophy\u2014dubbing themselves [[Lesbian feminism|lesbian-feminists]]\u2014lesbian was a term chosen by women to describe any woman who dedicated her approach to social interaction and political motivation to the welfare of women. Sexual desire was not the defining characteristic of a lesbian-feminist, but rather her focus on politics. Independence from men as oppressors was a central tenet of lesbian-feminism, and many believers strove to separate themselves physically and economically from traditional male-centered culture. In the ideal society, named Lesbian Nation, \"woman\" and \"lesbian\" were interchangeable.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 218\u2013219.</ref>\n\nAlthough lesbian-feminism was a significant shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in [[New Left]] and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues.<ref>Schlager, p. 11.</ref> Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The [[Daughters of Bilitis]] folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.<ref>Esterberg, Kristen (September, 1994). \"From Accommodation to Liberation: A Social Movement Analysis of Lesbians in the Homophile Movement.\" ''Gender and Society'', '''8''', (3) pp. 424\u2013443.</ref>\n\nAs equality was a priority for lesbian-feminists, disparity of roles between men and women or butch and femme were viewed as patriarchal. Lesbian-feminists eschewed gender role play that had been pervasive in bars, as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men; many lesbian-feminists refused to work with gay men, or take up their causes.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 210\u2013211.</ref> However, lesbians who held a more [[essentialist]] view that they had been [[Biology and sexual orientation#Political aspects|born homosexual]] and used the descriptor \"lesbian\" to define sexual attraction, often considered the separatist, angry opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 217\u2013218.</ref>\n\nIn 1980, poet and essayist [[Adrienne Rich]] expanded upon the political meaning of lesbian by proposing a continuum of lesbian existence based on \"woman-identified experience\" in her essay \"[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]\".<ref name=\"rich\">Rich, Adrienne (Summer 1980). \"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\", ''Signs'', '''5''' (4), pp. 631\u2013660.</ref> All relationships between women, Rich proposed, have some lesbian element, regardless if they claim a lesbian identity: mothers and daughters, women who work together, and women who nurse each other, for example. Such a perception of women relating to each other connects them through time and across cultures, and Rich considered heterosexuality a condition forced upon women by men.<ref name=\"rich\" /> Several years earlier, DOB founders [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]] similarly relegated sexual acts as unnecessary in determining what a lesbian is, by providing their definition: \"a woman whose primary erotic, psychological, emotional and social interest is in a member of her own sex, even though that interest may not be overtly expressed\".<ref>Martin and Lyon, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Outside western culture==\n{{Further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}\n\n===Middle East===\n{{Further|LGBT in Islam}}\n\nFemale homosexual behavior may be present in every culture, although the concept of a lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society and each culture's definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated with Islamic women. The Caliphal court in [[Baghdad]] featured women who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.<ref name=\"murray\">Murray and Roscoe, pp. 98\u2013104.</ref>\n\nHighly intelligent women, according to the 12th century writings of [[Sharif al-Idrisi]], were more likely to be lesbians; their intellectual prowess put them on a more even par with men.<ref name=\"murray\" /> Relations between women who lived in harems and fears of women being sexually intimate in Turkish baths were expressed in writings by men. Women, however, were mostly silent and men likewise rarely wrote about lesbian relationships. It is unclear to historians if the rare instances of lesbianism mentioned in literature are an accurate historical record or intended to serve as fantasies for men. A 1978 treatise about repression in [[Iran]] asserted that women were completely silenced: \"In the whole of Iranian history, [no woman] has been allowed to speak out for such tendencies ... To attest to lesbian desires would be an unforgivable crime.\"<ref name=\"murray\" />\n\nAlthough the authors of ''Islamic Homosexualities'' argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian anthropologist in 1991 visited [[Yemen]] and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; those who do not are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.<ref>Murray and Roscoe, pp. 283\u2013284.</ref>\n\nThe United Nations estimate for the number of [[honor killings]] in the world is 5000 per year. Many women's groups in the [[Middle East]] and [[Southwest Asia]] suspect that more than 20,000 women are victims of honor killings in the world each year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/the-crimewave-that-shames-the-world-2072201.html |title=Robert Fisk: The crimewave that shames the world |author=Robert Fisk |date=7 September 2010 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=8 September 2010 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n===The Americas===\nSome [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] conceptualize a [[third gender]] for women who dress as, and fulfill the roles usually filled by, men in their cultures.<ref name=Vowel-1>{{cite book|last1=Vowel|first1=Chelsea|editor1-last=|editor1-first=|title= Indigenous Writes: A Guide to First Nations, M\u00e9tis & Inuit Issues in Canada|date=2016|publisher=Highwater Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada|isbn=978-1553796800|page=|url=|accessdate=|chapter=All My Queer Relations - Language, Culture, and [[Two-Spirit]] Identity}}</ref><ref name=NCIA>{{cite journal|last1=Pruden|first1=Harlan|last2=Edmo|first2=Se-ah-dom|title=Two-Spirit People: Sex, Gender & Sexuality in Historic and Contemporary Native America|journal=National Congress of American Indians Policy Research Center |date=2016|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-research-center/initiatives/Pruden-Edmo_TwoSpiritPeople.pdf}}</ref> In other cases they may see gender as a spectrum, and use different terms for feminine women and masculine women.<ref name=Estrada>{{cite journal|last1=Estrada|first1=Gabriel|title=''Two Spirits'', ''N\u00e1dleeh'', and LGBTQ2 Navajo Gaze|journal=American Indian Culture and Research Journal|date=2011|volume=35|issue=4|pages=167\u2013190|doi=10.17953/aicr.35.4.x500172017344j30|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/318264790/Two-Spirits-Nadleeh-and-Navajo-LGBTQ2-Gaze-pdf}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, these identities are rooted in the context of the ceremonial and cultural lives of the particular Indigenous cultures, and \"simply being gay and Indian does not make someone a [[Two-Spirit]].\"<ref name=NYT2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/fashion/08SPIRIT.html|title=A Spirit of Belonging, Inside and Out|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 Oct 2006|accessdate=28 July 2016 |quote='The elders will tell you the difference between a gay Indian and a Two-Spirit,' [Criddle] said, underscoring the idea that simply being gay and Indian does not make someone a Two-Spirit.}}</ref> These ceremonial and social roles, which are conferred and confirmed by the person's elders, \"do not make sense\" when defined by non-Native concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity.<ref name=NCIA/> Rather, they must be understood in an Indigenous context, as traditional spiritual and social roles held by the person in their Indigenous community.<ref name=NYT2/><ref name=NCIA/><ref name=Pember>{{cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2016/10/13/two-spirit-tradition-far-ubiquitous-among-tribes/|title='Two Spirit' Tradition Far From Ubiquitous Among Tribes|publisher=[[Rewire (website)|Rewire]]|first=Mary Annette |last=Pember |date=Oct 13, 2016|accessdate=October 17, 2016 |quote= Unfortunately, depending on an oral tradition to impart our ways to future generations opened the floodgates for early non-Native explorers, missionaries, and anthropologists to write books describing Native peoples and therefore bolstering their own role as experts.

Harassment and intimidation have been common even in places where homosexuality is legal, and laws against child corruption, morality, or \"the good ways\" (''faltas a la moral o las buenas costumbres''), have been used to persecute homosexuals.<ref name=\"Mogrovejo\">Mogrovejo, Norma (2004). \"Relevancia de las lesbianas en Am\u00e9rica Latina: la recuperaci\u00f3n de nuestra historia\" (Relevance of lesbians in Latin America: the recovery of our history).

Six mostly secret organizations concentrating on gay or lesbian issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the [[Dirty War]]. Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women.<ref>Mogrovejo (2000), pp. 281\u2013294.</ref>\n\nThe Latin American lesbian movement has been the most active in [[Mexico]], but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, ''Lesbos'', the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.<ref>Mogrovejo (2004), pp. 88\u201394.</ref>\n\nIn [[Chile]], the dictatorship of [[Augusto Pinochet]] forbade the creation of lesbian groups until 1984, when ''Ayuquel\u00e9n'' (\"joy of being\" in [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]]) was first founded, prompted by the very public beating death of a woman amid shouts of \"Damned lesbian!\" from her attacker. The lesbian movement has been closely associated with the feminist movement in Chile, although the relationship has been sometimes strained. ''Ayuquel\u00e9n'' worked with the [[International Lesbian Information Service]], the [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]], and the Chilean gay rights group ''Movimiento de Integraci\u00f3n y Liberaci\u00f3n Homosexual'' (Movement to Integrate and Liberate Homosexuals) to remove the sodomy law still in force in Chile.<ref name=\"Mogrovejo 2004 pp85\u2013100\" />\n\nLesbian consciousness became more visible in [[Nicaragua]] in 1986, when the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] expelled gay men and lesbians from its midst. State persecution prevented the formation of associations until [[AIDS]] became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together. The first lesbian organization was ''Nosotras'', founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when ''Grupo Safo&nbsp;\u2013 Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua'' was created, four years before homosexuality became legal again.<ref>Mogrovejo (2004), pp. 100-103</ref>\n\nThe meetings of feminist lesbians of Latin America and the Caribbean, sometimes shortened to \"Lesbian meetings\", have been an important forum for the exchange of ideas for Latin American lesbians since the late 1980s. With rotating hosts and biannual gatherings, its main aims are the creation of communication networks, to change the situation of lesbians in Latin America (both legally and socially), to increase solidarity between lesbians and to destroy the existing myths about them.<ref>Rachid, p. 260</ref>\n\n===Africa===\nCross-gender roles and marriage between women has also been recorded in over 30 African societies.<ref>Aldrich, p. 262.</ref> Women may marry other women, raise their children, and be generally thought of as men in societies in [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]], and [[Kenya]].

Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal societies in [[Ghana]] among the [[Akan people]]. In [[Lesotho]], females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in [[cunnilingus]], and maintain their relationships with other females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis, however, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.<ref>Aldrich, pp. 237\u2013238.</ref>\n\nIn South Africa, [[Corrective rape|lesbians are raped by heterosexual men with a goal of punishment]] of \"abnormal\" behavior and reinforcement of societal norms.<ref name=\"Actionaid\">{{cite web|last=Martin|first=A|author2=Kelly A|author3=Turquet L|author4=Ross S|title=Hate crimes: The rise of 'corrective rape' in South Africa|url=http://www.actionaid.org.uk/doc_lib/correctiveraperep_final.pdf|publisher=[[ActionAid]]|year=2009|pages=1\u20132|accessdate=April 16, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FenWRBzx?url=http://www.actionaid.org.uk/doc_lib/correctiveraperep_final.pdf|archive-date=April 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The crime was first identified in South Africa<ref name=\"Janoff\">Janoff, Douglas.

Rare references to lesbianism were written by [[Ying Shao]], who identified same-sex relationships between women in imperial courts who behaved as husband and wife as ''dui shi'' (paired eating). \"Golden Orchid Associations\" in Southern China existed into the 20th century and promoted formal marriages between women, who were then allowed to adopt children.<ref>Norton, p. 187.</ref> Westernization brought new ideas that all sexual behavior not resulting in reproduction was aberrant.<ref>Sullivan and Jackson, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe liberty of being employed in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed some women to style themselves ''tzu-shu nii'' (never to marry) and live in communes with other women.

These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently discouraged by the communist government for being a relic of feudal China.<ref>Norton, p. 195.</ref> In contemporary Chinese society, ''tongzhi'' (same goal or spirit) is the term used to refer to homosexuals; most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians.<ref>Sullivan and Jackson, p. 28.</ref>\n\nIn Japan, the term ''rezubian'', a Japanese pronunciation of \"lesbian\", was used during the 1920s.

According to [[Ruth Vanita]], this invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled ''[[Fire (1996 film)|Fire]]'' in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by religious extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse on homosexuality centers on men. Women's rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms, as lesbians and material focusing on female homosexuality are frequently suppressed.<ref>Vanita, Ruth (2007). \"Lesbian Studies and Activism in India\", ''Journal of Lesbian Studies'', '''11''' (3/4), pp. 245\u2013253.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===The Kinsey Report===\n[[File:Kinsey Scale.svg|thumb|[[Kinsey scale|Kinsey's scale]] of sexual responses showing exclusively [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]], with the varying degrees of [[bisexuality]] in between.|alt=A graph with seven columns labeled 0 to 6.

More than 8,000 women were interviewed by [[Alfred Kinsey]] and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.<ref name=\"bullough\">Bullough, Vern (May 1998). \"Alfred Kinsey and the Kinsey Report: Historical Overview and Lasting Contribution\", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', '''35''' (2), pp. 127\u2013131.</ref>\n\nKinsey and his staff reported that 28% of women had been aroused by another female, and 19% had a sexual contact with another female.<ref>Kinsey, p. 453.</ref><ref group=note>Sexual contact, according to Kinsey, included lip kissing, deep kissing, body touching, manual breast and genital stimulation, oral breast and genital stimulation, and object-vaginal penetration.

Hite's questions differed from Kinsey's, focusing more on how women identified, or what they preferred rather than experience. Respondents to Hite's questions indicated that 8% preferred sex with women and 9% answered that they identified as bisexual or had sexual experiences with men and women, though they refused to indicate preference.<ref>Hite, p. 261.</ref>\n\nHite's conclusions are more based on respondents' comments than quantifiable data. She found it \"striking\" that many women who had no lesbian experiences indicated they were interested in sex with women, particularly because the question was not asked.<ref>Hite, p. 262.</ref> Hite found the two most significant differences between respondents' experience with men and women were the focus on clitoral stimulation, and more emotional involvement and orgasmic responses.<ref>Hite, p. 274.</ref> Since Hite performed her study during the popularity of feminism in the 1970s, she also acknowledged that women may have chosen the political identity of a lesbian.\n\n===Population estimates===\nLesbians in the U.S. are estimated to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a [[National Opinion Research Center]] survey of sexually active adults who had had same-sex experiences within the past year, completed in 2000.<ref name=\"almanac\">Wright, John, ed. \"Homosexuality in the U.S., 1998\u20132000\", ''The New York Times Almanac'' (2009), Penguin Reference. {{ISBN|0-14-311457-3}}, p. 314.</ref> A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%\u2014five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.<ref group=note>The study estimated the total population of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals at 8.8 million, but did not differentiate between men and women.

Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts.<ref>Edsall, p. 242.</ref><ref group=note>A 1966 survey of psychological literature on homosexuality began with Freud's 1924 theory that it is a fixation on the opposite sex parent. As Freud's views were the foundation of psychotherapy, further articles agreed with this, including one in 1951 that asserted that homosexuals are actually heterosexuals that play both gender roles, and homosexuals are attempting to perpetuate \"infantile, incestuous fixation(s)\" on relationships that are forbidden. (Zucker, Luise [July 1966], \"Mental Health and Homosexuality\", ''Journal of Sex Research'' '''2''' (2), pp. 111\u2013125.)</ref> Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[substance abuse]], and [[suicide]]. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.<ref name=\"cochran\">Cochran, Susan; Sullivan, J; Mays, Vickie (February 2003). \"Prevalence of Mental Disorders, Psychological Distress, and Mental Health Services Use Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults in the United States\", ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'', '''71''' (1), pp. 53\u201361.</ref>\n\nWomen who identify as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence.<ref name=\"cochran\" /><ref name=\"schlager153\">Schlager, p. 153.</ref> These emotions have been cited as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women who identify as bisexual.<ref name=\"rust2\">Rust, Paula, (March, 1993). \"Coming out\" in the Age of Social Constructionism: Sexual Identity Formation among Lesbian and Bisexual Women\", ''Gender and Society'', '''7''' (1), pp. 50\u201377.</ref> On the whole, women tend to work through developing a self-concept internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to, and more often see being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.<ref name=\"schlager153\" />\n\n[[Anxiety disorder]]s and [[depression (mood)|depression]] are the most common mental health issues for women.

The majority of media about lesbians is produced by men;<ref name=\"schlagermedia\" /> women's publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about lesbians made by women did not appear until the 1980s, and television shows portraying lesbians written by women only began to be created in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality\u2014particularly dealing with women\u2014has been excluded because of [[symbolic annihilation]].

Terry Castle also lists the Book of Ruth as an example of early lesbianism in literature (Castle, p. 108.)</ref> and ancient mythological tradition as examples of lesbianism in classical literature. Greek stories of the heavens often included a female figure whose virtue and virginity were unspoiled, who pursued more masculine interests, and who was followed by a dedicated group of maidens. Foster cites [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Artemis]] and [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], and [[Iphis]] and [[Iphis|Ianthe]] as examples of female mythological figures who showed remarkable devotion to each other, or defied gender expectations.<ref>Foster, pp. 24\u201327.</ref> The Greeks are also given credit with spreading the story of a mythological race of women warriors named [[Amazons]]. [[En-hedu-ana]], a priestess in [[Ancient Iraq]] who dedicated herself to the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] goddess [[Inanna]], has the distinction of signing the oldest-surviving signed poetry in history. She characterized herself as Inanna's spouse.<ref>Norton, p. 189.</ref>\n\nFor ten centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, lesbianism disappeared from literature.<ref>Castle, p. 11.</ref> Foster points to the particularly strict view that [[Eve]]\u2014representative of all women\u2014caused the downfall of mankind; [[original sin]] among women was a particular concern, especially because women were perceived as creating life.<ref>Foster, pp. 30\u201331.</ref> During this time, women were largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuit, so men were responsible for shaping ideas about sexuality.<ref>Castle, p. 6.</ref>\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, French and English depictions of relationships between women (''[[Lives of Gallant Ladies]]'' by [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brant\u00f4me|Brant\u00f4me]] in 1665, [[John Cleland]]'s 1749 erotica ''[[Fanny Hill|Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure]]'', ''[[L'Espion Anglais]]'' by various authors in 1778), writers' attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women.<ref>Faderman (1981), pp. 26\u201328.</ref> At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 29.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lautrec in bed 1893.jpg|thumb|''[[Le Lit (Toulouse-Lautrec)|In Bed]]'' by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] (1893).

His work influenced novelist [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]]'s ''[[Mademoiselle de Maupin]]'', which provided the first description of a physical type that became associated with lesbians: tall, wide-shouldered, slim-hipped, and athletically inclined.<ref>Foster, pp. 51\u201365.</ref> [[Charles Baudelaire]] repeatedly used lesbianism as a theme in his poems \"Lesbos\", \"Femmes damn\u00e9es 1\" (\"Damned Women\"), and \"Femmes damn\u00e9es 2\".<ref>Castle, p. 435.</ref>\n\nReflecting French society, as well as employing stock character associations, many of the lesbian characters in 19th-century French literature were prostitutes or courtesans: personifications of vice who died early, violent deaths in moral endings.<ref name=\"prostitution\">Faderman (1981), pp. 281\u2013283</ref> [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s 1816 poem \"[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]\" and the novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' (1872) by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]] both present lesbianism associated with vampirism.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 277, 288\u2013289.</ref> Portrayals of female homosexuality not only formed European consciousness about lesbianism, but Krafft-Ebing cited the characters in [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Salammb\u00f4]]'' (1862) and [[Ernest Feydeau]]'s ''[[Le Comte de Chalis]]'' (1867) as examples of lesbians because both novels feature female protagonists who do not adhere to social norms and express \"contrary sexual feeling\", although neither participated in same-sex desire or sexual behavior.<ref>Foster, p. 72.</ref> Havelock Ellis used literary examples from Balzac and several French poets and writers to develop his framework to identify sexual inversion in women.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 254.</ref>\n\nGradually, women began to author their own thoughts and literary works about lesbian relationships. Until the publication of ''The Well of Loneliness'', most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men. Foster suggests that women would have encountered suspicion about their own lives had they used same-sex love as a topic, and that some writers including [[Louise Lab\u00e9]], [[Charlotte Charke]], and [[Margaret Fuller]] either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male, or made them ambiguous.<ref>Foster, pp. 116\u2013127.</ref> Author [[George Sand]] was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century; writer [[Mario Praz]] credited the popularity of lesbianism as a theme to Sand's appearance in Paris society in the 1830s.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 263.</ref><ref group=note>The cross-dressing Sand was also the subject of a few of [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s sonnets.(Castle, pp. 426\u2013427.)</ref> [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'' in 1853 initiated a genre of boarding [[School story|school stories]] with homoerotic themes.<ref>Castle, p. 429.</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, [[Katherine Mansfield]], [[Amy Lowell]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[H.D.]], [[Vita Sackville-West]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Gale Wilhelm]] wrote popular works that had same-sex relationships as themes. Some women, such as [[Marguerite Yourcenar]] and [[Mary Renault]], wrote or translated works of fiction that focused on homosexual men, like some of the writings of [[Carson McCullers]]. All three were involved in same-sex relationships, but their primary friendships were with gay men.<ref>Norton, p. 182.</ref> Foster further asserts 1928 was a \"peak year\" for lesbian-themed literature; in addition to ''The Well of Loneliness'', three other novels with lesbian themes were published in England: [[Elizabeth Bowen]]'s ''The Hotel'', Woolf's ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'', and [[Compton Mackenzie]]'s satirical novel ''Extraordinary Women''.<ref>Lanser, 1979, p. 39.</ref> Unlike ''The Well of Loneliness'', none of these novels were banned.<ref name=\"Foster-281\">Foster, pp. 281\u2013287.</ref><ref group=note>A fifth novel in 1928, American author Djuna Barnes' ''[[Ladies Almanack]]'', is a ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' of [[Natalie Clifford Barney#Salon|a lesbian literary and artistic salon in Paris]] and circulated at first within those circles; Susan Sniader Lanser calls it a \"sister-text\" to Hall's landmark work, (Lanser, Susan Sniader [Autumn 1979], \"Speaking in Tongues: 'Ladies Almanack' and the Language of Celebration\". ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies'', '''4''' (3), pp. 39\u201346.) as Barnes includes a character based on Radclyffe Hall and passages that may be a response to ''The Well of Loneliness'' (Barnes, p. xxxi.)</ref>\n\nAs the paperback book came into fashion, lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction. Many of the pulp novels typically presented very unhappy women, or relationships that ended tragically. Marijane Meaker later wrote that she was told to make the relationship end badly in ''Spring Fire'' because the publishers were concerned about the books being confiscated by the U.S. Postal Service.<ref>Packer, Vin (Marijane Meaker). ''Spring Fire'', Introduction. 2004, Cleis Press.</ref> [[Patricia Highsmith]], writing as Claire Morgan, wrote ''[[The Price of Salt]]'' in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.<ref>Castle, pp. 1024\u20131025.</ref>\n\nFollowing the Stonewall riots, lesbian themes in literature became much more diverse and complex, and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as ''[[The Furies Collective|The Furies]]'', and ''[[Sinister Wisdom]]'' replaced ''The Ladder''. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included [[Rita Mae Brown]]'s ''[[Rubyfruit Jungle]]'' (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian.<ref>Schlager, p. 377.</ref> Poet [[Audre Lorde]] confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and [[Cherr\u00ede Moraga]] is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values are evident in the writings of [[Dorothy Allison]], who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian [[sadomasochism]] themes.<ref>Schlager, p. 379.</ref>\n\n===Film===\nLesbianism, or the suggestion of it, began early in filmmaking. The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed\u2014or for what reasons\u2014as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films. Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones. Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in ''[[A Florida Enchantment]]'' featuring [[Edith Storey]]. In ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' (1930) [[Marlene Dietrich]] kisses another woman on the lips, and [[Katharine Hepburn]] plays a man in ''[[Christopher Strong]]'' in 1933 and again in ''[[Sylvia Scarlett]]'' (1936). Hollywood films followed the same trend set by audiences who flocked to Harlem to see edgy shows that suggested bisexuality.<ref>Benshoff, pp. 27\u201328.</ref>\n\nOvert female homosexuality was introduced in 1929's ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' between [[Louise Brooks]] and [[Alice Roberts (actress)|Alice Roberts]]. However, the development of the [[Hays Code]] in 1930 censored most references to homosexuality from film under the umbrella term \"sex perversion\". German films depicted homosexuality and were distributed throughout Europe, but 1931's ''[[M\u00e4dchen in Uniform (1931 film)|M\u00e4dchen in Uniform]]'' was not distributed in the U.S. because of the depiction of an adolescent's love for a female teacher in boarding school.<ref name=\"russo58\" />\n\n[[File:Childrens Hour trailer.jpg|thumb|Lesbianism, or homosexuality, was never spoken about in ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'', but it is transparent why [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s character hangs herself.|alt=Still shot from the film \"The Children's Hour\", showing Shirley MacLaine looking down at the left and Audrey Hepburn to her right staring at her, in a bedroom. The words \"Can an ugly rumor destroy what's beautiful?\" obscure much of MacLaine's face.]]\n\nBecause of the Hays Code, lesbianism after 1930 was absent from most films, even those adapted with overt lesbian characters or plot devices. [[Lillian Hellman]]'s play ''[[The Children's Hour (play)|The Children's Hour]]'' was converted into a heterosexual love triangle and retitled ''[[These Three]]''. Biopic ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' in 1933, starring [[Greta Garbo]], veiled most of the speculation about Christina of Sweden's affairs with women.<ref name=\"russo58\">Russo, p. 58.</ref> Homosexuality or lesbianism was never mentioned outright in the films while the Hays Code was enforced. The reason censors stated for removing a lesbian scene in 1954's ''[[Olivia (1951 film)|The Pit of Loneliness]]'' was that it was, \"Immoral, would tend to corrupt morals\".<ref>Russo, p. 102.</ref> The code was relaxed somewhat after 1961, and the next year [[William Wyler]] remade ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'' with [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]]. After MacLaine's character admits her love for Hepburn's, she hangs herself; this set a precedent for miserable endings in films addressing homosexuality.<ref>Russo, p. 139.</ref>\n\nGay characters also were often killed off at the end, such as the death of [[Sandy Dennis]]' character at the end of ''[[The Fox (1967 film)|The Fox]]'' in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|Walk on the Wild Side]]'' from 1962 and [[Shelley Winters]] in ''[[The Balcony (film)|The Balcony]]'' in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), women's prison films like ''[[Caged]]'' (1950), or in the character [[Rosa Klebb]] in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963).<ref>Russo, pp. 143\u2013156.</ref> Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' (1936), ''[[Blood and Roses]]'' (1960), ''[[Vampyros Lesbos]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'' (1983).<ref>Russo, p. 49.</ref> ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by [[Sharon Stone]]; it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction of gays as predators.<ref>Brenshoff, pp. 250\u2013151.</ref>\n\nThe first film to address lesbianism with significant depth was ''[[The Killing of Sister George (film)|The Killing of Sister George]]'' in 1968, which was filmed in [[Gateways club|The Gateways Club]], a longstanding lesbian pub in London. It is the first to claim a film character who identifies as a lesbian, and film historian [[Vito Russo]] considers the film a complex treatment of a multifaceted character who is forced into silence about her openness by other lesbians.<ref>Russo, pp. 170\u2013173.</ref> ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' in 1982, and ''[[Lianna]]'' in 1983 treat the lesbian relationships more sympathetically and show lesbian sex scenes, though in neither film are the relationships happy ones. ''Personal Best'' was criticized for engaging in the cliched plot device of one woman returning to a relationship with a man, implying that lesbianism is a phase, as well as treating the lesbian relationship with \"undisguised voyeurism\".<ref>Benshoff, pp. 185\u2013186.</ref> More ambiguous portrayals of lesbian characters were seen in ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), ''[[The Color Purple (1985 film)|The Color Purple]]'' (1985), and ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes (film)|Fried Green Tomatoes]]'' (1991), despite explicit lesbianism in the source material.<ref>''[[The Celluloid Closet]]''.

In 2019, the production was nominated for six [[Tony Award]]s, including Best Musical, and received the [[Drama Desk Award]] for Best Musical. A performance from ''The Prom'' was included in the 2018 [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] and made history by showing the first [[Homosexuality|same-sex]] kiss in the parade's broadcast.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} ''[[Jagged Little Pill (musical)|Jagged Little Pill]]'' featured lesbian characters Frankie Healy and Jo.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|List of television shows with LGBT characters|Lists of American television episodes with LGBT themes}}\n\nTelevision began to address homosexuality much later than film. Local talk shows in the late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts (usually not gay themselves) to discuss the problems of gay men in society. Lesbianism was rarely included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and in distress, calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for women. When she realizes this, however, she is able to pursue heterosexual relationships, which are portrayed as \"healthy\".<ref>Tropiano, pp. 7\u20139.</ref>\n\nInvisibility for lesbians continued in the 1970s when homosexuality became the subject of dramatic portrayals, first with medical dramas (''[[The Bold Ones: The New Doctors|The Bold Ones]]'', ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]'') featuring primarily male patients coming out to doctors, or staff members coming out to other staff members. These shows allowed homosexuality to be discussed clinically, with the main characters guiding troubled gay characters or correcting homophobic antagonists, while simultaneously comparing homosexuality to psychosis, criminal behavior, or drug use.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 13\u201344.</ref>\n\nAnother stock plot device in the 1970s was the gay character in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. Beginning in the late 1960s with ''[[N.Y.P.D. (TV series)|N.Y.P.D.]]'', ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', and ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, as a response to their higher profiles in gay activism.<ref>Russo, pp. 186\u2013189.</ref> Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or fear of being exposed as homosexual. One episode of ''Police Woman'' earned protests by the [[National Gay Task Force]] before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money.<ref>Tropiano, p. 68.</ref> NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but a [[sit-in]] was staged in the head of NBC's offices.<ref>Tropiano, p. 69.</ref>\n\nIn the middle of the 1970s, gay men and lesbians began to appear as police officers or detectives facing coming out issues. This did not extend to CBS' groundbreaking show ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'' in 1982, starring two female police detectives. CBS production made conscious attempts to soften the characters so they would not appear to be lesbians.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> In 1991, a bisexual lawyer portrayed by [[Amanda Donohoe]] on ''[[L.A. Law]]'' shared the first significant [[Lesbian kiss episode|lesbian kiss]]<ref group=note>''[[21 Jump Street]]'' included a kiss between series regular [[Holly Robinson Peete]] and guest star [[Katy Boyer]] in \"A Change of Heart\" (1990) but it did not inspire the critical or popular attention later such kisses would engender. (Capsuto, p. 235)</ref> on primetime television with [[Michele Greene]], stirring a controversy despite being labeled \"chaste\" by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.<ref>Tropiano, p. 89.</ref>\n\n[[File:EllenDeGeneres1997Emmies.jpg|200px|thumb|Ellen DeGeneres with her Emmy Award in 1997.

These included Zelda from ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'', Miss Hathaway from ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', and Jo from ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]''.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 185\u2013186.</ref> In the mid-1980s through the 1990s, sitcoms frequently employed a \"coming out\" episode, where a friend of one of the stars admits she is a lesbian, forcing the cast to deal with the issue. ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', and ''[[Friends]]'' used this device with women in particular.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 202\u2013204.</ref>\n\nRecurring lesbian characters who came out were seen on ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Mad About You]]'', and ''[[Roseanne (TV show)|Roseanne]]'', in which a [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell (Roseanne)|highly publicized episode]] had ABC executives afraid a televised kiss between Roseanne and [[Mariel Hemingway]] would destroy ratings and ruin advertising. The episode was instead the week's highest rated.<ref>Schlager, p. 394, 399.</ref> By far the sitcom with the most significant impact to the image of lesbians was ''[[Ellen (TV show)|Ellen]]''. Publicity surrounding Ellen's coming out episode in 1997 was enormous; [[Ellen DeGeneres]] appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine the week before the airing of \"[[The Puppy Episode]]\" with the headline \"Yep, I'm Gay\". Parties were held in many U.S. cities to watch the episode, and the opposition from conservative organizations was intense. [[WBMA-LD|WBMA-LP]], the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], even refused to air the first run of the episode, citing conservative values of the local viewing audience, which earned the station some infamy and ire in the LGBT community. Even still, \"The Puppy Episode\" won an [[Emmy]] for writing, but as the show began to deal with Ellen Morgan's sexuality each week, network executives grew uncomfortable with the direction the show took and canceled it.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 245\u2013249.</ref>\n\nDramas following ''L.A. Law'' began incorporating homosexual themes, particularly with continuing storylines on ''[[Relativity (TV series)|Relativity]]'', ''[[Picket Fences]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'', both of which tested the boundaries of sexuality and gender.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 128\u2013136.</ref> A show directed at adolescents that had a particularly strong cult following was ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. In the fourth season of ''Buffy'', [[Tara Maclay|Tara]] and [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] admit their love for each other without any special fanfare and the relationship is treated as are the other romantic relationships on the show.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\nWhat followed was a series devoted solely to gay characters from network television. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s American rendition of ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' ran for five years, from 2000 to 2005; two of the main characters were a lesbian couple. Showtime promoted the series as \"No Limits\", and ''Queer as Folk'' addressed homosexuality graphically. The aggressive advertising paid off as the show became the network's highest rated, doubling the numbers of other Showtime programs after the first season.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 150\u2013152.</ref> In 2004, Showtime introduced ''[[The L Word]]'', a dramatic series devoted to a group of lesbian and bisexual women, running its final season in 2009.\n\n==Other aspects==\n===Lesbian chic and popular culture===\n[[File:Vanity Fair Cover Lang Crawford.jpg|thumb|upright|The August 1993 cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that marked the arrival of lesbian chic as a social phenomenon in the 1990s.|alt=Cover of Vanity Fair magazine from August 1993 showing k.d. lang reclining in a barber chair with eyes closed and holding a compact mirror.

This is in part due to public figures who have caused speculation and comment in the press about their sexuality and lesbianism in general. The primary figure earning this attention was [[Martina Navratilova]], who served as tabloid fodder for years as she denied being lesbian, admitted to being bisexual, had very public relationships with [[Rita Mae Brown]] and [[Judy Nelson]], and acquired as much press about her sexuality as she did her athletic achievements. Navratilova spurred what scholar Diane Hamer termed \"constant preoccupation\" in the press with determining the root of same-sex desire.<ref>Hamer, pp. 57\u201377.</ref>\n\nOther public figures acknowledged their homosexuality and bisexuality, notably musicians [[k.d. lang]] and [[Melissa Etheridge]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s pushing of sexual boundaries in her performances and publications. In 1993, lang and self-professed heterosexual supermodel [[Cindy Crawford]] posed for the August cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in a provocative arrangement that showed Crawford shaving lang's face, as lang lounged in a barber's chair wearing a pinstripe suit.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bennetts|first1=Leslie|title=k.d. lang Cuts It Close |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/1993/08/kd-lang-cover-story|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=August 1, 1993|accessdate=13 September 2018}}</ref> The image \"became an internationally recognized symbol of the phenomenon of lesbian chic\", according to Hamer.<ref>Hamer, p. 1.</ref> The year 1994 marked a rise in lesbian visibility, particularly appealing to women with feminine appearances. Between 1992 and 1994, ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazines featured stories about women who admitted sexual histories with other women.<ref>Streitmatter, pp. 77\u201378.</ref>\n\nOne analyst reasoned the recurrence of lesbian chic was due to the often-used homoerotic subtexts of gay male subculture being considered off limits because of [[AIDS]] in the late 1980s and 1990s, joined with the distant memory of lesbians as they appeared in the 1970s: unattractive and militant. In short, lesbians became more attractive to general audiences when they ceased having political convictions.<ref>Hamer, pp. 87\u201390.</ref> All the attention on feminine and glamorous women created what culture analyst Rodger Streitmatter characterizes as an unrealistic image of lesbians packaged by heterosexual men; the trend influenced an increase in the inclusion of lesbian material in [[pornography]] aimed at men.<ref>Streitmatter, p. 81.</ref>\n\nA resurgence of lesbian visibility and sexual fluidity was noted in 2009, with celebrities such as [[Cynthia Nixon]] and [[Lindsay Lohan]] commenting openly on their relationships with women, and reality television addressing same-sex relationships. Psychiatrists and feminist philosophers write that the rise in women acknowledging same-sex relationships is due to growing social acceptance, but also concede that \"only a certain kind of lesbian\u2014slim and elegant or butch in just the right androgynous way\u2014is acceptable to mainstream culture\".<ref>Fischer, Mary (April 23, 2009).

[[Same-sex marriage in New York]] was legalized in 2011.|alt=]]\n{{Further|LGBT parenting}}\n\nAlthough homosexuality among females has taken place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship.<ref>Schlager, p. 117.</ref> Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.<ref>Schlager, pp. 118\u2013119.</ref>\n\nFamily issues were significant concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, even though the general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother.<ref name=\"custody\">Schlager, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref><ref>Jennings, p. 182.</ref> Several studies performed as a result of custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, [[gender identity]], and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.<ref name=\"custody\" />\n\nImproving opportunities for growing families of same-sex couples has shaped the political landscape within the past ten years. A push for [[same-sex marriage]] or civil unions in western countries has replaced other political objectives. {{As of|2012}}, ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; [[civil unions]] are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to [[artificial insemination]].<ref>Schlager, pp. 128\u2013129.</ref>\n\n===Lesbians of color===\n[[File:NYC Pride Parade 2012 - 034 (7457177728).jpg|thumb|right|190px|Attendees at 2012 New York City [[Pride parade]].]]\n\nLesbians of color have often been a marginalized group, including African American, Latina, Asian, Arab, and other non-Caucasian lesbians;<ref name=Myers>{{cite book |last1=Myers |first1=JoAnne |title=Historical Dictionary of the Lesbian and Gay Liberation Movements |date=2013 |page=85 |edition=1st |chapter=Black Lesbians |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=978-0810872264}}</ref> and experienced racism, homophobia, and misogyny due to their many identities.<ref name=Zimmerman_LHC2000>{{cite book|editor1-last=Zimmerman|editor1-first=Bonnie|title=Lesbian Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia|date=2000|edition=1st|volume=1 (Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures)|publisher=[[Garland Publishing]]|isbn=0-8153-1920-7}}</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that in the past the predominant lesbian community was largely composed of [[White people|white women]] and influenced by American culture, leading some lesbians of color to experience difficulties integrating into the community at large.

Historically, women of color were often excluded from participating in lesbian and gay movements. Scholars have stated that this exclusion came as a result of the majority of whites dismissing the intersections of gender, race, and sexuality that are a core part of the lesbian of color identity. Lesbians that organized events were mostly white and middle-class, and largely focused their political movements on the issues of sexism and homophobia, rather than class or race issues. The early lesbian feminist movement was criticized for excluding race and class issues from their spaces and for a lack of focus on issues that did not benefit white women.<ref name=Myers /> [[Audre Lorde]], [[Barbara Smith]], and [[Cherrie Moraga]] are cited as major theorists within the various lesbians of color movements for their insistence on inclusion and equality, from both racial communities and white lesbian communities.<ref name=Myers />\n\nThe many intersections surrounding lesbians of color can often contribute to an increased need for mental health resources.

Throughout history, women have not had the same freedom or independence as men to pursue homosexual relationships, but neither have they met the same harsh punishment as homosexual men in some societies. Instead, lesbian relationships have often been regarded as harmless, unless a participant attempts to assert privileges traditionally enjoyed by men. As a result, little in history was documented to give an accurate description of how female homosexuality was expressed. When early [[sexologists]] in the late 19th century began to categorize and describe homosexual behavior, hampered by a lack of knowledge about homosexuality or women's sexuality, they distinguished lesbians as women who did not adhere to female [[gender]] roles and incorrectly designated them mentally ill\u2014a designation which has been reversed in the global scientific community.\n\nWomen in homosexual relationships responded to this designation either by hiding their personal lives or accepting the label of outcast and creating a subculture and [[Identity (social science)|identity]] that developed in Europe and the United States. Following [[World War II]], during a period of social repression when governments actively persecuted homosexuals, women developed networks to socialize with and educate each other. Greater economic and social freedom allowed them gradually to be able to determine how they could form relationships and families. With [[second wave feminism]] and the growth of scholarship in women's history and sexuality in the 20th century, the definition of ''lesbian'' broadened, sparking a debate about sexual desire as the major component to define what a lesbian is. Some women who engage in same-sex sexual activity may reject not only identifying as lesbians but as [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] as well, while other women's self-identification as lesbian may not align with their sexual orientation or sexual behavior. Sexual identity is not necessarily the same as one's sexual orientation or sexual behavior, due to various reasons, such as the fear of identifying their sexual orientation in a [[Homophobia|homophobic]] setting.\n\nPortrayals of lesbians in the media suggest that society at large has been simultaneously intrigued and threatened by women who challenge feminine [[gender role]]s, as well as fascinated and appalled with women who are romantically involved with other women. Women who adopt a lesbian identity share experiences that form an outlook similar to an ethnic identity: as homosexuals, they are unified by the [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] [[discrimination]] and potential rejection they face from their families, friends, and others as a result of homophobia. As women, they face concerns separate from men. Lesbians may encounter distinct physical or mental health concerns arising from discrimination, [[prejudice]], and [[minority stress]]. Political conditions and social attitudes also affect the formation of lesbian relationships and families in open.\n\n==Origin and transformation of the term==\n[[File:Godward-In the Days of Sappho-1904.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sappho]] of [[Lesbos]], depicted here in a 1904 painting by [[John William Godward]], gave the term ''lesbian'' the connotation of erotic desire between women.|alt=Painting of a woman dressed in Greek robes sitting on a marble bench with trees and water in the distance.]]\n\nThe word ''lesbian'' is derived from the name of the Greek island of [[Lesbos]], home to the 6th-century BCE poet [[Sappho]].<ref name=\"Lesbian\"/> From various ancient writings, historians gathered that a group of young women were left in Sappho's charge for their instruction or cultural edification.<ref>Foster, p. 18.</ref> Little of Sappho's poetry survives, but her remaining poetry reflects the topics she wrote about: women's daily lives, their relationships, and rituals.

Retrieved on January 7, 2009.</ref>\n\nThe development of medical knowledge was a significant factor in further connotations of the term ''lesbian.'' In the middle of the 19th century, medical writers attempted to establish ways to identify male homosexuality, which was considered a significant social problem in most Western societies. In categorizing behavior that indicated what was referred to as \"[[Sexual inversion (sexology)|inversion]]\" by German sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]], researchers categorized what was normal sexual behavior for men and women, and therefore to what extent men and women varied from the \"perfect male sexual type\" and the \"perfect female sexual type\".<ref>Aldrich, p. 168.</ref>\n\nFar less literature focused on female homosexual behavior than on male homosexuality, as medical professionals did not consider it a significant problem. In some cases, it was not acknowledged to exist. However, sexologists [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] from Germany, and Britain's [[Havelock Ellis]] wrote some of the earliest and more enduring categorizations of female [[same-sex attraction]], approaching it as a form of insanity (Ellis' categorization of \"lesbianism\" as a medical problem is now discredited).<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 241.</ref> Krafft-Ebing, who considered lesbianism (what he termed \"[[Uranian|Uranism]]\") a neurological disease, and Ellis, who was influenced by Krafft-Ebing's writings, disagreed about whether sexual inversion was generally a lifelong condition. Ellis believed that many women who professed love for other women changed their feelings about such relationships after they had experienced marriage and a \"practical life\".<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 242.</ref>\n\nHowever, Ellis conceded that there were \"true inverts\" who would spend their lives pursuing erotic relationships with women. These were members of the \"[[Third gender|third sex]]\" who rejected the roles of women to be subservient, feminine, and domestic.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 240.</ref> ''Invert'' described the opposite gender roles, and also the related attraction to women instead of men; since women in the [[Victorian period]] were considered unable to initiate sexual encounters, women who did so with other women were thought of as possessing masculine sexual desires.<ref>Jennings, p. 77.</ref>\n\nThe work of Krafft-Ebing and Ellis was widely read, and helped to create public consciousness of female homosexuality.<ref group=note>In Germany between 1898 and 1908 over a thousand articles were published regarding the topic of homosexuality.

In the absence of any other material to describe their emotions, homosexuals accepted the designation of different or perverted, and used their outlaw status to form social circles in Paris and Berlin.

According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator is not necessary to identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital.<ref>McCormick, pp. 60\u201361.</ref> Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the [[feminist sex wars]].<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 246\u2013252.</ref> Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed as they were in the 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.<ref>Faderman, Lillian (April 1992). \"The Return of Butch and Femme: A Phenomenon in Lesbian Sexuality in the 1980s and 1990s\", ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'', '''2''' (4), pp. 578\u2013596.</ref>\n\nThe focus of this debate often centers on a phenomenon named by sexologist [[Pepper Schwartz]] in 1983. Schwartz found that long-term lesbian couples report having less sexual contact than heterosexual or homosexual male couples, calling this [[lesbian bed death]]. However, lesbians dispute the study's definition of sexual contact, and introduced other factors such as deeper connections existing between women that make frequent sexual relations redundant, greater [[sexual fluidity]] in women causing them to move from heterosexual to bisexual to lesbian numerous times through their lives\u2014or reject the labels entirely. Further arguments attested that the study was flawed and misrepresented accurate sexual contact between women, or sexual contact between women has increased since 1983 as many lesbians find themselves freer to sexually express themselves.<ref name=\"nichols\">Nichols, Margaret (November, 2004). \"Lesbian Sexuality/Female Sexuality: Rethinking 'Lesbian Bed Death'\", ''Sexual and Relationship Therapy'', '''19''' (4), pp. 364\u2013371.</ref>\n\nMore discussion on gender and [[sexual orientation identity]] has affected how many women label or view themselves. Most people in western culture are taught that heterosexuality is an innate quality in all people. When a woman realizes her romantic and sexual attraction to another woman, it may cause an \"existential crisis\"; many who go through this adopt the identity of a lesbian, challenging what society has offered in stereotypes about homosexuals, to learn how to function within a homosexual subculture.<ref>Schlager, p. 93.</ref> Lesbians in western cultures generally share an identity that parallels those built on ethnicity; they have a shared history and subculture, and similar experiences with discrimination which has caused many lesbians to reject heterosexual principles. This identity is unique from gay men and heterosexual women, and often creates tension with bisexual women.<ref name=\"rust\" /> One point of contention are lesbians who have had sex with men, while lesbians who have never had sex with men may be referred to as \"gold star lesbians\". Those who have had sex with men may face ridicule from other lesbians or identity challenges with regard to defining what it means to be a lesbian.<ref name=\"Shelby\">{{cite book|author1=R Dennis Shelby |author2=Kathleen Dolan|title=Lesbian Women and Sexual Health: The Social Construction of Risk and Susceptibility|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1317718192|year=2014|page=34|accessdate=April 11, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNQJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA34}}</ref>\n\nResearchers, including [[social scientists]], state that often behavior and identity do not match: women may label themselves heterosexual but have sexual relations with women, self-identified lesbians may have sex with men, or women may find that what they considered an immutable sexual identity has changed over time.<ref name=\"Solarz\"/><ref name=\"Diamond\">{{cite book|author=Lisa M.

How and where study samples were obtained can also affect the definition.<ref name=\"Solarz\"/>\n\n==Female homosexuality without identity in western culture==\n===General===\n{{Further|History of lesbianism}}\n\nThe varied meanings of ''lesbian'' since the early 20th century have prompted some historians to revisit historic relationships between women before the wide usage of the word was defined by erotic proclivities. Discussion from historians caused further questioning of what qualifies as a lesbian relationship. As lesbian-feminists asserted, a sexual component was unnecessary in declaring oneself a lesbian if the primary and closest relationships were with women. When considering past relationships within appropriate historic context, there were times when love and sex were separate and unrelated notions.<ref>Rothblum, pp. 4\u20137.</ref> In 1989, an academic cohort named the Lesbian History Group wrote: <blockquote>Because of society's reluctance to admit that lesbians exist, a high degree of certainty is expected before historians or biographers are allowed to use the label. Evidence that would suffice in any other situation is inadequate here... A woman who never married, who lived with another woman, whose friends were mostly women, or\nwho moved in known lesbian or mixed gay circles, may well have been a lesbian. ... But this sort of evidence is not 'proof'. What our critics want is incontrovertible evidence of sexual activity between women. This is almost impossible to find.<ref>Norton, p. 184.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFemale sexuality is often not adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much of what has been documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men\u2014as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example.<ref>Rabinowitz, p. 2.</ref> Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or ideas on broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.\n\n===Ancient Greece and Rome===\n{{Further|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Homosexuality in ancient Rome}}\n\nHistory is often analyzed with contemporary ideologies; [[ancient Greece]] as a subject enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance.<ref>Rabinowitz, p. 11.</ref> Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet [[Alcman]] used the term ''aitis,'' as the feminine form of ''aites''\u2014which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship.<ref name=\"bremmer 27-28\">Bremmer, pp. 27\u201328.</ref> [[Aristophanes]], in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', mentions women who love women, but uses the term ''trepesthai'' (to be focused on) instead of ''eros'', which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.<ref>Aldrich, p. 47.</ref>\n\nHistorian Nancy Rabinowitz argues that ancient Greek [[Pottery of ancient Greece|red vase]] images portraying women with their arms around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's shoulders can be construed as expressions of romantic desire.<ref>Rabinowitz, p. 115.</ref> Much of the daily lives of women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with [[dildo]]s placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.<ref name=\"bremmer 27-28\" /><ref>Rabinowitz, p. 148.</ref>\n\nWomen in [[ancient Rome]] were similarly subject to men's definitions of sexuality. Modern scholarship indicates that men viewed female homosexuality with hostility. They considered women who engaged in sexual relations with other women to be biological oddities that would attempt to penetrate women\u2014and sometimes men\u2014with \"monstrously enlarged\" [[clitoris]]es.<ref>Verstraete, p. 238.</ref> According to scholar James Butrica, lesbianism \"challenged not only the Roman male's view of himself as the exclusive giver of sexual pleasure but also the most basic foundations of Rome's male-dominated culture\". No historical documentation exists of women who had other women as sex partners.<ref>Verstraete, pp. 239\u2013240.</ref>\n\n===Early modern Europe===\n[[File:Hermaphrodite engraving circa 1690.jpg|thumb|upright|Lesbianism and [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]], depicted here in an engraving circa 1690, were very similar concepts during the Renaissance.|alt=A front and back illustration of a Renaissance-era hermaphrodite showing a person with female facial features, breasts, and what appears to be a small penis or large clitoris.

Where it opens in the front, the apparent rear appearance shows it to be perhaps a shell of some kind, as one with her body Two squares are missing from her the back of her head and torso. She has no buttocks.]]\n\nFemale homosexuality has not received the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, men and women, and men and animals was punishable by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270.<ref name=\"norton191\">Norton, p. 191.</ref> In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.<ref>Aldrich, p. 130.</ref>\n\nThe earliest such execution occurred in [[Speyer|Speier, Germany]], in 1477. Forty days' [[penance]] was demanded of nuns who \"rode\" each other or were discovered to have touched each other's breasts. An Italian nun named Sister [[Benedetta Carlini]] was documented to have seduced many of her sisters when possessed by a Divine spirit named \"Splenditello\"; to end her relationships with other women, she was placed in solitary confinement for the last 40 years of her life.<ref>Norton, p. 190.</ref> Female homoeroticism, however, was so common in English literature and theater that historians suggest it was fashionable for a period during the [[Renaissance]].<ref>Jennings. p. 1.</ref>\n\nIdeas about women's sexuality were linked to contemporary understanding of female physiology. The [[vagina]] was considered an inward version of the penis; where nature's perfection created a man, often nature was thought to be trying to right itself by prolapsing the vagina to form a penis in some women.<ref>Jennings, p. 12.</ref> These sex changes were later thought to be cases of [[hermaphrodite]]s, and hermaphroditism became synonymous with female same-sex desire. Medical consideration of hermaphroditism depended upon measurements of the [[clitoris]]; a longer, engorged clitoris was thought to be used by women to penetrate other women. Penetration was the focus of concern in all sexual acts, and a woman who was thought to have uncontrollable desires because of her engorged clitoris was called a \"tribade\" (literally, one who rubs).<ref>Jennings, pp. 14\u201316.</ref> Not only was an abnormally engorged clitoris thought to create lusts in some women that led them to masturbate, but pamphlets warning women about [[masturbation]] leading to such oversized organs were written as cautionary tales. For a while, masturbation and lesbian sex carried the same meaning.<ref>Aldrich, p. 129.</ref>\n\nClass distinction, however, became linked as the fashion of female homoeroticism passed. Tribades were simultaneously considered members of the lower class trying to ruin virtuous women, and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery. Satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals (or more often, their wives) engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was rumored to have a passionate relationship with [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill]], Duchess of Marlborough, her closest adviser and confidante. When Churchill was ousted as the queen's favorite, she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen.<ref>Aldrich, p. 137.</ref> [[Marie Antoinette]] was also the subject of such speculation for some months between 1795 and 1796.<ref>Jennings, pp. 17\u201318.</ref>\n\n===Female husbands===\n[[File:Viola and the Countess - Frederick Richard Pickersgill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Gender masquerade as a dramatic device was popular in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as this scene from ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' painted by [[Frederick Richard Pickersgill|Frederick Pickersgill]].|alt=Painting of a Renaissance-era woman dressed as a man, standing and looking away, as a woman dressed as a woman holds the other's hand to her breast, looking imploringly at the other, set against a bucolic backdrop.]]\n\nHermaphroditism appeared in medical literature enough to be considered common knowledge, although cases were rare. Homoerotic elements in literature were pervasive, specifically the masquerade of one gender for another to fool an unsuspecting woman into being seduced. Such plot devices were used in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (1601), ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' by [[Edmund Spenser]] in 1590, and [[James Shirley]]'s ''[[The Bird in a Cage]]'' (1633).<ref>Jennings, pp. 1\u201311, 22\u201324.</ref> Extraordinary cases during the Renaissance of women taking on male personae and going undetected for years or decades have been recorded.<ref group=note>Whether these cases would be more accurately described in contemporary sociology as [[transgender]] is debated, and based on the individual details of each case.</ref>\n\nIf found, punishments ranged from death, to time in the [[pillory]], to being ordered never to dress as a man again. [[Henry Fielding]] wrote a pamphlet titled ''The Female Husband'' in 1746, based on the life of [[Mary Hamilton (bigamist)|Mary Hamilton]], who was arrested after marrying a woman while masquerading as a man, and was sentenced to public whipping and six months in jail. Similar examples were procured of Catharine Linck in Prussia in 1717, executed in 1721; Swiss Anne Grandjean married and relocated with her wife to Lyons, but was exposed by a woman with whom she had had a previous affair and sentenced to time in the stocks and prison.<ref name=\"faderman54\">Faderman, pp. 51\u201354.</ref>\n\nQueen [[Christina of Sweden]]'s tendency to dress as a man was well known during her time, and excused because of her noble birth. She was brought up as a male and there was speculation at the time that she was a hermaphrodite. Even after Christina abdicated the throne in 1654 to avoid marriage, she was known to pursue romantic relationships with women.<ref>Faderman, pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\nSome historians view cases of cross-dressing women to be manifestations of women seizing power they would naturally be unable to enjoy in feminine attire, or their way of making sense out of their desire for women. Lillian Faderman argues that Western society was threatened by women who rejected their feminine roles. Catharine Linck and other women who were accused of using dildos, such as two nuns in 16th century Spain executed for using \"material instruments\", were punished more severely than those who did not.<ref name=\"norton191\" /><ref name=\"faderman54\" /> Two marriages between women were recorded in [[Cheshire]], England, in 1707 (between Hannah Wright and Anne Gaskill) and 1708 (between Ane Norton and Alice Pickford) with no comment about both parties being female.<ref>Jennings, p. 30.</ref><ref name=\"Aldrich, p. 136\">Aldrich, p. 136.</ref> Reports of clergymen with lax standards who performed weddings\u2014and wrote their suspicions about one member of the wedding party\u2014continued to appear for the next century.\n\nOutside Europe, women were able to dress as men and go undetected.

Documentation of these relationships is possible by a large volume of letters written between women. Whether the relationship included any genital component was not a matter for public discourse, but women could form strong and exclusive bonds with each other and still be considered virtuous, innocent, and chaste; a similar relationship with a man would have destroyed a woman's reputation. In fact, these relationships were promoted as alternatives to and practice for a woman's marriage to a man.<ref>Faderman (1981), pp. 74\u201377.</ref><ref group=note>In a rare instance of sexuality being the focus of a romantic friendship, two Scottish schoolteachers in the early 19th century were accused by a student of visiting in the same bed, kissing, and making the bed shake.

Where is the innocent woman in Scotland?\" (Aldrich, p. 233.)</ref>\n\nOne such relationship was between [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]], who wrote to Anne Wortley in 1709: \"Nobody was so entirely, so faithfully yours ...

The novel's plot centers around Stephen Gordon, a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing's ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (Richard von Krafft-Ebing book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]]'', and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 320.</ref> Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing's theories and rejected [[Freud]]'s theory that [[same-sex attraction]] was caused by childhood trauma and was curable. The publicity Hall received was due to unintended consequences; the novel was tried for [[obscenity]] in London, a spectacularly scandalous event described as \"''the'' crystallizing moment in the construction of a visible modern English lesbian subculture\" by professor Laura Doan.<ref>Doan, p.

When British women participated in World War I, they became familiar with masculine clothing, and were considered patriotic for wearing uniforms and pants. However, postwar masculinization of women's clothing became associated with lesbians.<ref>Doan, pp. 64\u201366.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gladys Bentley.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Harlem]] resident [[Gladys Bentley]] was renowned for her [[blues]] songs about her affairs with women.|alt=A publicity photo of a stout African American woman in white tuxedo with tails and top hat, carrying a cane and her signature in the lower right corner.]]\n\nIn the United States, the 1920s was a decade of social experimentation, particularly with sex. This was heavily influenced by the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts were a part of lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 63\u201367.</ref>\n\nNo location saw more visitors for its possibilities of homosexual nightlife than [[Harlem]], the predominantly African American section of [[New York City]]. White \"slummers\" enjoyed [[jazz]], nightclubs, and anything else they wished. [[Blues]] singers [[Ma Rainey]], [[Bessie Smith]], [[Ethel Waters]], and [[Gladys Bentley]] sang about affairs with women to visitors such as [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Beatrice Lillie]], and the soon-to-be-named [[Joan Crawford]].<ref>Faderman (1991), p. 71.</ref><ref>Zimmerman, p. 354.</ref> Homosexuals began to draw comparisons between their newly recognized minority status and that of African Americans.<ref>Faderman (1991), p. 68.</ref> Among African American residents of [[Harlem]], lesbian relationships were common and tolerated, though not overtly embraced. Some women staged lavish wedding ceremonies, even filing licenses using masculine names with New York City.<ref>Faderman (1991), p. 73.</ref> Most women, however, were married to men and participated in affairs with women regularly; bisexuality was more widely accepted than lesbianism.<ref>Zimmerman, p. 355.</ref>\n\nAcross town, [[Greenwich Village]] also saw a growing homosexual community; both Harlem and Greenwich Village provided furnished rooms for single men and women, which was a major factor in their development as centers for homosexual communities.<ref>Norton, p. 181.</ref> The tenor was different in Greenwich Village than Harlem, however. [[Bohemianism|Bohemians]]\u2014intellectuals who rejected Victorian ideals\u2014gathered in the Village. Homosexuals were predominantly male, although figures such as poet [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and social host [[Mabel Dodge]] were known for their affairs with women and promotion of tolerance of homosexuality.<ref>Faderman, pp. 82\u201383.</ref> Women in the U.S. who could not visit Harlem or live in Greenwich Village for the first time were able to visit saloons in the 1920s without being considered prostitutes. The existence of a public space for women to socialize in [[Lesbian bars|bars]] that were known to cater to lesbians \"became the single most important public manifestation of the subculture for many decades\", according to historian [[Lillian Faderman]].<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 79\u201380.</ref>\n\n===The Great Depression===\nThe primary component necessary to encourage lesbians to be public and seek other women was economic independence, which virtually disappeared in the 1930s with the [[Great Depression]]. Most women in the U.S. found it necessary to marry, to a \"[[Beard (companion)|front]]\" such as a gay man where both could pursue homosexual relationships with public discretion, or to a man who expected a traditional wife. Independent women in the 1930s were generally seen as holding jobs that men should have.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 94\u201396.</ref>\n\nThe social attitude made very small and close-knit communities in large cities that centered around bars, while simultaneously isolating women in other locales. Speaking of homosexuality in any context was socially forbidden, and women rarely discussed lesbianism even amongst themselves; they referred to openly gay people as \"in the Life\".<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 105\u2013112.</ref><ref group=note>Historian [[Vern Bullough]] published a paper based on an unfinished study of mental and physical traits performed by a lesbian in [[Salt Lake City]] during the 1920s and 1930s. The compiler of the study reported on 23 of her colleagues, indicating there was an underground lesbian community in the conservative city. Bullough remarked that the information was being used to support the attitude that lesbians were not abnormal or maladjusted, but it also reflected that women included in the study strove in every way to conform to social gender expectations, viewing anyone who pushed the boundaries of respectability with hostility. Bullough wrote, \"In fact, their very success in disguising their sexual orientation to the outside world leads us to hypothesize that lesbianism in the past was more prevalent than the sources might indicate, since society was so unsuspecting.\" (Bullough, Vern; Bullough, Bonnie [Summer 1977]. \"Lesbianism in the 1920s and 1930s: A Newfound Study\", ''Signs'', pp. 895\u2013904.)</ref> Freudian psychoanalytic theory was pervasive in influencing doctors to consider homosexuality as a neurosis afflicting immature women.

Women were also accepted into the military in the U.S. [[Women's Army Corps]] (WACs) and U.S. Navy's [[Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service]] (WAVES). Unlike processes to screen out male homosexuals, which had been in place since the creation of the American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by the military in the 1940s, and frailty discouraged.<ref name=\"Berube, pp. 28\u201333\">Berube, pp. 28\u201333.</ref>\n\nSome women were able to arrive at the recruiting station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted.<ref name=\"Berube, pp. 28\u201333\"/> Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and [[blue discharge]] was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian [[Allan Berube|Allan B\u00e9rub\u00e9]] documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.<ref>Berube, p. 104.</ref>\n\nThe most masculine women were not necessarily common, though they were visible so they tended to attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright.<ref>Berube, p. 100.</ref> Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, in order to continue national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands, something that would not have been feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 129\u2013130.</ref>\n\nLesbians were not included under [[Paragraph 175]], a German statute which made homosexual acts between males a crime. The [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] stipulates that this is because women were seen as subordinate to men, and that the Nazi state feared lesbians less than gay men. However, the USHMM also claims that many women were arrested and imprisoned for \"asocial\" behaviour, a label which was applied to women who did not conform to the ideal Nazi image of a woman: cooking, cleaning, kitchen work, child raising, and passivity. These women were labeled with a black triangle.<ref name=USHMM1>{{cite web|title=LESBIANS AND THE THIRD REICH|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005478|website=ushmm.org|publisher=USHMM|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref> Some lesbians reclaimed this symbol for themselves as gay men reclaimed the pink triangle.

Community meeting places consisted of bars that were commonly raided by police once a month on average, with those arrested exposed in newspapers. In response, eight women in San Francisco met in their living rooms in 1955 to socialize and have a safe place to dance. When they decided to make it a regular meeting, they became the first organization for lesbians in the U.S., titled the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB). The DOB began publishing a magazine titled ''[[The Ladder (magazine)|The Ladder]]'' in 1956. Inside the front cover of every issue was their mission statement, the first of which stated was \"Education of the variant\". It was intended to provide women with knowledge about homosexuality\u2014specifically relating to women and famous lesbians in history. However, by 1956, the term \"lesbian\" had such a negative meaning that the DOB refused to use it as a descriptor, choosing \"variant\" instead.<ref>Gallo, p. 3.</ref>\n\nThe DOB spread to Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, and ''The Ladder'' was mailed to hundreds\u2014eventually thousands\u2014of DOB members discussing the nature of homosexuality, sometimes challenging the idea that it was a sickness, with readers offering their own reasons why they were lesbians and suggesting ways to cope with the condition or society's response to it.<ref name=\"esterberg\" /> British lesbians followed with the publication of ''[[Arena Three (magazine)|Arena Three]]'' beginning in 1964, with a similar mission.<ref>Jennings, pp. 153\u2013158.</ref>\n\n[[File:Thirdsex bookcover 1959.jpg|thumb|upright|Though marketed to heterosexual men, [[lesbian pulp fiction]] provided an identity to isolated women in the 1950s.|alt=A brightly painted book cover with the title \"The Third Sex\", with a sultry blonde wearing a red outfit showing cleavage and midriff seated on a sofa, while a redhead with short hair places her hand on the blonde's shoulder and leans over her, also displaying cleavage wearing a white blouse with rolled-up sleeves.]]\n\n==== Butch and femme dichotomy ====\n{{Further|Butch and femme}}\n\nAs a reflection of categories of sexuality so sharply defined by the government and society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as [[Butch and femme|butches]]: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\nButch women were not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were pervasive and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions.<ref>Jennings, pp. 141\u2013143.</ref> They further identified members of a group that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 170\u2013174.</ref> Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 175\u2013178.</ref>\n\n==== Lesbian-themed fiction ====\n{{See also|Lesbian literature}}\nRegardless of the lack of information about homosexuality in scholarly texts, another forum for learning about lesbianism was growing. A paperback book titled ''Women's Barracks'' describing a woman's experiences in the [[Free French Forces]] was published in 1950. It told of a lesbian relationship the author had witnessed. After 4.5 million copies were sold, it was consequently named in the [[House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials]] in 1952.<ref>Stryker, p. 49.</ref> Its publisher, [[Gold Medal Books]], followed with the novel ''[[Spring Fire]]'' in 1952, which sold 1.5 million copies. Gold Medal Books was overwhelmed with mail from women writing about the subject matter, and followed with more books, creating the genre of [[lesbian pulp fiction]].<ref>Stryker, pp. 54\u201357.</ref>\n\nBetween 1955 and 1969 over 2,000 books were published using lesbianism as a topic, and they were sold in corner drugstores, train stations, bus stops, and newsstands all over the U.S. and Canada. Most were written by, and almost all were marketed to heterosexual men. Coded words and images were used on the covers. Instead of \"lesbian\", terms such as \"strange\", \"twilight\", \"queer\", and \"third sex\", were used in the titles, and cover art was invariably salacious.<ref>Zimet, pp. 17\u201324.</ref> A handful of lesbian pulp fiction authors were women writing for lesbians, including [[Ann Bannon]], [[Valerie Taylor (novelist)|Valerie Taylor]], Paula Christian, and [[Marijane Meaker|Vin Packer/Ann Aldrich]]. Bannon, who also purchased lesbian pulp fiction, later stated that women identified the material iconically by the cover art.<ref name=\"forbidden\">''[[Forbidden Love: The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives]]''. Dir. Fernie, L., Weissman. Videocassette. Women Make Movies Home Video, 1994.</ref> Many of the books used cultural references: naming places, terms, describing modes of dress and other codes to isolated women. As a result, pulp fiction helped to proliferate a lesbian identity simultaneously to lesbians and heterosexual readers.<ref name=\"nestle\">[[Joan Nestle|Nestle, Joan]] (1983). \"Desire So Big It Had to Be Brave\", [[Lesbian Herstory Archives]].</ref>\n\n===Second-wave feminism===\nThe social rigidity of the 1950s and early 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements to improve the standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 [[Stonewall riots]].<ref>Aldrich, pp. 212\u2013216.</ref> What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.\n\nThe [[sexual revolution]] in the 1970s introduced the differentiation between identity and sexual behavior for women. Many women took advantage of their new social freedom to try new experiences. Women who previously identified as heterosexual tried sex with women, though many maintained their heterosexual identity.<ref>Faderman (1991), p. 203.</ref> However, with the advent of [[Feminist Movement in the United States (1963\u20131982)|second wave feminism]], lesbian as a political identity grew to describe a social philosophy among women, often overshadowing sexual desire as a defining trait. A militant feminist organization named [[Radicalesbians]] published a [[manifesto]] in 1970 entitled \"[[The Woman-Identified Woman]]\" that declared \"A lesbian is the rage of all women condensed to the point of explosion\".<ref>Schlager, p. 70.</ref><ref group=note>A similar statement appeared in a militant feminist pamphlet in [[Leeds, England]], stating \"Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women.\" (Jennings, p. 177.) See: [[Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group]]</ref>\n\nMilitant feminists expressed their disdain with an inherently sexist and patriarchal society, and concluded the most effective way to overcome sexism and attain the equality of women would be to deny men any power or pleasure from women. For women who subscribed to this philosophy\u2014dubbing themselves [[Lesbian feminism|lesbian-feminists]]\u2014lesbian was a term chosen by women to describe any woman who dedicated her approach to social interaction and political motivation to the welfare of women. Sexual desire was not the defining characteristic of a lesbian-feminist, but rather her focus on politics. Independence from men as oppressors was a central tenet of lesbian-feminism, and many believers strove to separate themselves physically and economically from traditional male-centered culture. In the ideal society, named Lesbian Nation, \"woman\" and \"lesbian\" were interchangeable.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 218\u2013219.</ref>\n\nAlthough lesbian-feminism was a significant shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in [[New Left]] and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues.<ref>Schlager, p. 11.</ref> Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The [[Daughters of Bilitis]] folded in 1970 over which direction to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.<ref>Esterberg, Kristen (September, 1994). \"From Accommodation to Liberation: A Social Movement Analysis of Lesbians in the Homophile Movement.\" ''Gender and Society'', '''8''', (3) pp. 424\u2013443.</ref>\n\nAs equality was a priority for lesbian-feminists, disparity of roles between men and women or butch and femme were viewed as patriarchal. Lesbian-feminists eschewed gender role play that had been pervasive in bars, as well as the perceived chauvinism of gay men; many lesbian-feminists refused to work with gay men, or take up their causes.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 210\u2013211.</ref> However, lesbians who held a more [[essentialist]] view that they had been [[Biology and sexual orientation#Political aspects|born homosexual]] and used the descriptor \"lesbian\" to define sexual attraction, often considered the separatist, angry opinions of lesbian-feminists to be detrimental to the cause of gay rights.<ref>Faderman (1991), pp. 217\u2013218.</ref>\n\nIn 1980, poet and essayist [[Adrienne Rich]] expanded upon the political meaning of lesbian by proposing a continuum of lesbian existence based on \"woman-identified experience\" in her essay \"[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]\".<ref name=\"rich\">Rich, Adrienne (Summer 1980). \"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\", ''Signs'', '''5''' (4), pp. 631\u2013660.</ref> All relationships between women, Rich proposed, have some lesbian element, regardless if they claim a lesbian identity: mothers and daughters, women who work together, and women who nurse each other, for example. Such a perception of women relating to each other connects them through time and across cultures, and Rich considered heterosexuality a condition forced upon women by men.<ref name=\"rich\" /> Several years earlier, DOB founders [[Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon]] similarly relegated sexual acts as unnecessary in determining what a lesbian is, by providing their definition: \"a woman whose primary erotic, psychological, emotional and social interest is in a member of her own sex, even though that interest may not be overtly expressed\".<ref>Martin and Lyon, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Outside western culture==\n{{Further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}\n\n===Middle East===\n{{Further|LGBT in Islam}}\n\nFemale homosexual behavior may be present in every culture, although the concept of a lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society and each culture's definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated with Islamic women. The Caliphal court in [[Baghdad]] featured women who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.<ref name=\"murray\">Murray and Roscoe, pp. 98\u2013104.</ref>\n\nHighly intelligent women, according to the 12th century writings of [[Sharif al-Idrisi]], were more likely to be lesbians; their intellectual prowess put them on a more even par with men.<ref name=\"murray\" /> Relations between women who lived in harems and fears of women being sexually intimate in Turkish baths were expressed in writings by men. Women, however, were mostly silent and men likewise rarely wrote about lesbian relationships. It is unclear to historians if the rare instances of lesbianism mentioned in literature are an accurate historical record or intended to serve as fantasies for men. A 1978 treatise about repression in [[Iran]] asserted that women were completely silenced: \"In the whole of Iranian history, [no woman] has been allowed to speak out for such tendencies ... To attest to lesbian desires would be an unforgivable crime.\"<ref name=\"murray\" />\n\nAlthough the authors of ''Islamic Homosexualities'' argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian anthropologist in 1991 visited [[Yemen]] and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; those who do not are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.<ref>Murray and Roscoe, pp. 283\u2013284.</ref>\n\nThe United Nations estimate for the number of [[honor killings]] in the world is 5000 per year. Many women's groups in the [[Middle East]] and [[Southwest Asia]] suspect that more than 20,000 women are victims of honor killings in the world each year.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/the-crimewave-that-shames-the-world-2072201.html |title=Robert Fisk: The crimewave that shames the world |author=Robert Fisk |date=7 September 2010 |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=8 September 2010 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n===The Americas===\nSome [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] conceptualize a [[third gender]] for women who dress as, and fulfill the roles usually filled by, men in their cultures.<ref name=Vowel-1>{{cite book|last1=Vowel|first1=Chelsea|editor1-last=|editor1-first=|title= Indigenous Writes: A Guide to First Nations, M\u00e9tis & Inuit Issues in Canada|date=2016|publisher=Highwater Press|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada|isbn=978-1553796800|page=|url=|accessdate=|chapter=All My Queer Relations - Language, Culture, and [[Two-Spirit]] Identity}}</ref><ref name=NCIA>{{cite journal|last1=Pruden|first1=Harlan|last2=Edmo|first2=Se-ah-dom|title=Two-Spirit People: Sex, Gender & Sexuality in Historic and Contemporary Native America|journal=National Congress of American Indians Policy Research Center |date=2016|url=http://www.ncai.org/policy-research-center/initiatives/Pruden-Edmo_TwoSpiritPeople.pdf}}</ref> In other cases they may see gender as a spectrum, and use different terms for feminine women and masculine women.<ref name=Estrada>{{cite journal|last1=Estrada|first1=Gabriel|title=''Two Spirits'', ''N\u00e1dleeh'', and LGBTQ2 Navajo Gaze|journal=American Indian Culture and Research Journal|date=2011|volume=35|issue=4|pages=167\u2013190|doi=10.17953/aicr.35.4.x500172017344j30|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/318264790/Two-Spirits-Nadleeh-and-Navajo-LGBTQ2-Gaze-pdf}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However, these identities are rooted in the context of the ceremonial and cultural lives of the particular Indigenous cultures, and \"simply being gay and Indian does not make someone a [[Two-Spirit]].\"<ref name=NYT2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/08/fashion/08SPIRIT.html|title=A Spirit of Belonging, Inside and Out|newspaper=The New York Times|date=8 Oct 2006|accessdate=28 July 2016 |quote='The elders will tell you the difference between a gay Indian and a Two-Spirit,' [Criddle] said, underscoring the idea that simply being gay and Indian does not make someone a Two-Spirit.}}</ref> These ceremonial and social roles, which are conferred and confirmed by the person's elders, \"do not make sense\" when defined by non-Native concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity.<ref name=NCIA/> Rather, they must be understood in an Indigenous context, as traditional spiritual and social roles held by the person in their Indigenous community.<ref name=NYT2/><ref name=NCIA/><ref name=Pember>{{cite web|url=https://rewire.news/article/2016/10/13/two-spirit-tradition-far-ubiquitous-among-tribes/|title='Two Spirit' Tradition Far From Ubiquitous Among Tribes|publisher=[[Rewire (website)|Rewire]]|first=Mary Annette |last=Pember |date=Oct 13, 2016|accessdate=October 17, 2016 |quote= Unfortunately, depending on an oral tradition to impart our ways to future generations opened the floodgates for early non-Native explorers, missionaries, and anthropologists to write books describing Native peoples and therefore bolstering their own role as experts.

Harassment and intimidation have been common even in places where homosexuality is legal, and laws against child corruption, morality, or \"the good ways\" (''faltas a la moral o las buenas costumbres''), have been used to persecute homosexuals.<ref name=\"Mogrovejo\">Mogrovejo, Norma (2004). \"Relevancia de las lesbianas en Am\u00e9rica Latina: la recuperaci\u00f3n de nuestra historia\" (Relevance of lesbians in Latin America: the recovery of our history).

Six mostly secret organizations concentrating on gay or lesbian issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the [[Dirty War]]. Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women.<ref>Mogrovejo (2000), pp. 281\u2013294.</ref>\n\nThe Latin American lesbian movement has been the most active in [[Mexico]], but has encountered similar problems in effectiveness and cohesion. While groups try to promote lesbian issues and concerns, they also face misogynistic attitudes from gay men and homophobic views from heterosexual women. In 1977, ''Lesbos'', the first lesbian organization for Mexicans, was formed. Several incarnations of political groups promoting lesbian issues have evolved; 13 lesbian organizations were active in Mexico City in 1997. Ultimately, however, lesbian associations have had little influence both on the homosexual and feminist movements.<ref>Mogrovejo (2004), pp. 88\u201394.</ref>\n\nIn [[Chile]], the dictatorship of [[Augusto Pinochet]] forbade the creation of lesbian groups until 1984, when ''Ayuquel\u00e9n'' (\"joy of being\" in [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]]) was first founded, prompted by the very public beating death of a woman amid shouts of \"Damned lesbian!\" from her attacker. The lesbian movement has been closely associated with the feminist movement in Chile, although the relationship has been sometimes strained. ''Ayuquel\u00e9n'' worked with the [[International Lesbian Information Service]], the [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association]], and the Chilean gay rights group ''Movimiento de Integraci\u00f3n y Liberaci\u00f3n Homosexual'' (Movement to Integrate and Liberate Homosexuals) to remove the sodomy law still in force in Chile.<ref name=\"Mogrovejo 2004 pp85\u2013100\" />\n\nLesbian consciousness became more visible in [[Nicaragua]] in 1986, when the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] expelled gay men and lesbians from its midst. State persecution prevented the formation of associations until [[AIDS]] became a concern, when educational efforts forced sexual minorities to band together. The first lesbian organization was ''Nosotras'', founded in 1989. An effort to promote visibility from 1991 to 1992 provoked the government to declare homosexuality illegal in 1994, effectively ending the movement, until 2004, when ''Grupo Safo&nbsp;\u2013 Grupo de Mujeres Lesbianas de Nicaragua'' was created, four years before homosexuality became legal again.<ref>Mogrovejo (2004), pp. 100-103</ref>\n\nThe meetings of feminist lesbians of Latin America and the Caribbean, sometimes shortened to \"Lesbian meetings\", have been an important forum for the exchange of ideas for Latin American lesbians since the late 1980s. With rotating hosts and biannual gatherings, its main aims are the creation of communication networks, to change the situation of lesbians in Latin America (both legally and socially), to increase solidarity between lesbians and to destroy the existing myths about them.<ref>Rachid, p. 260</ref>\n\n===Africa===\nCross-gender roles and marriage between women has also been recorded in over 30 African societies.<ref>Aldrich, p. 262.</ref> Women may marry other women, raise their children, and be generally thought of as men in societies in [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]], and [[Kenya]].

Lesbian relationships are also known in matrilineal societies in [[Ghana]] among the [[Akan people]]. In [[Lesotho]], females engage in what is commonly considered sexual behavior to the Western world: they kiss, sleep together, rub genitals, participate in [[cunnilingus]], and maintain their relationships with other females vigilantly. Since the people of Lesotho believe sex requires a penis, however, they do not consider their behavior sexual, nor label themselves lesbians.<ref>Aldrich, pp. 237\u2013238.</ref>\n\nIn South Africa, [[Corrective rape|lesbians are raped by heterosexual men with a goal of punishment]] of \"abnormal\" behavior and reinforcement of societal norms.<ref name=\"Actionaid\">{{cite web|last=Martin|first=A|author2=Kelly A|author3=Turquet L|author4=Ross S|title=Hate crimes: The rise of 'corrective rape' in South Africa|url=http://www.actionaid.org.uk/doc_lib/correctiveraperep_final.pdf|publisher=[[ActionAid]]|year=2009|pages=1\u20132|accessdate=April 16, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6FenWRBzx?url=http://www.actionaid.org.uk/doc_lib/correctiveraperep_final.pdf|archive-date=April 5, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The crime was first identified in South Africa<ref name=\"Janoff\">Janoff, Douglas.

Rare references to lesbianism were written by [[Ying Shao]], who identified same-sex relationships between women in imperial courts who behaved as husband and wife as ''dui shi'' (paired eating). \"Golden Orchid Associations\" in Southern China existed into the 20th century and promoted formal marriages between women, who were then allowed to adopt children.<ref>Norton, p. 187.</ref> Westernization brought new ideas that all sexual behavior not resulting in reproduction was aberrant.<ref>Sullivan and Jackson, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\nThe liberty of being employed in silk factories starting in 1865 allowed some women to style themselves ''tzu-shu nii'' (never to marry) and live in communes with other women.

These communes passed because of the Great Depression and were subsequently discouraged by the communist government for being a relic of feudal China.<ref>Norton, p. 195.</ref> In contemporary Chinese society, ''tongzhi'' (same goal or spirit) is the term used to refer to homosexuals; most Chinese are reluctant to divide this classification further to identify lesbians.<ref>Sullivan and Jackson, p. 28.</ref>\n\nIn Japan, the term ''rezubian'', a Japanese pronunciation of \"lesbian\", was used during the 1920s.

According to [[Ruth Vanita]], this invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled ''[[Fire (1996 film)|Fire]]'' in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by religious extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse on homosexuality centers on men. Women's rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms, as lesbians and material focusing on female homosexuality are frequently suppressed.<ref>Vanita, Ruth (2007). \"Lesbian Studies and Activism in India\", ''Journal of Lesbian Studies'', '''11''' (3/4), pp. 245\u2013253.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n===The Kinsey Report===\n[[File:Kinsey Scale.svg|thumb|[[Kinsey scale|Kinsey's scale]] of sexual responses showing exclusively [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexual]], with the varying degrees of [[bisexuality]] in between.|alt=A graph with seven columns labeled 0 to 6.

More than 8,000 women were interviewed by [[Alfred Kinsey]] and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.<ref name=\"bullough\">Bullough, Vern (May 1998). \"Alfred Kinsey and the Kinsey Report: Historical Overview and Lasting Contribution\", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', '''35''' (2), pp. 127\u2013131.</ref>\n\nKinsey and his staff reported that 28% of women had been aroused by another female, and 19% had a sexual contact with another female.<ref>Kinsey, p. 453.</ref><ref group=note>Sexual contact, according to Kinsey, included lip kissing, deep kissing, body touching, manual breast and genital stimulation, oral breast and genital stimulation, and object-vaginal penetration.

Hite's questions differed from Kinsey's, focusing more on how women identified, or what they preferred rather than experience. Respondents to Hite's questions indicated that 8% preferred sex with women and 9% answered that they identified as bisexual or had sexual experiences with men and women, though they refused to indicate preference.<ref>Hite, p. 261.</ref>\n\nHite's conclusions are more based on respondents' comments than quantifiable data. She found it \"striking\" that many women who had no lesbian experiences indicated they were interested in sex with women, particularly because the question was not asked.<ref>Hite, p. 262.</ref> Hite found the two most significant differences between respondents' experience with men and women were the focus on clitoral stimulation, and more emotional involvement and orgasmic responses.<ref>Hite, p. 274.</ref> Since Hite performed her study during the popularity of feminism in the 1970s, she also acknowledged that women may have chosen the political identity of a lesbian.\n\n===Population estimates===\nLesbians in the U.S. are estimated to be about 2.6% of the population, according to a [[National Opinion Research Center]] survey of sexually active adults who had had same-sex experiences within the past year, completed in 2000.<ref name=\"almanac\">Wright, John, ed. \"Homosexuality in the U.S., 1998\u20132000\", ''The New York Times Almanac'' (2009), Penguin Reference. {{ISBN|0-14-311457-3}}, p. 314.</ref> A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%\u2014five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.<ref group=note>The study estimated the total population of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals at 8.8 million, but did not differentiate between men and women.

Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts.<ref>Edsall, p. 242.</ref><ref group=note>A 1966 survey of psychological literature on homosexuality began with Freud's 1924 theory that it is a fixation on the opposite sex parent. As Freud's views were the foundation of psychotherapy, further articles agreed with this, including one in 1951 that asserted that homosexuals are actually heterosexuals that play both gender roles, and homosexuals are attempting to perpetuate \"infantile, incestuous fixation(s)\" on relationships that are forbidden. (Zucker, Luise [July 1966], \"Mental Health and Homosexuality\", ''Journal of Sex Research'' '''2''' (2), pp. 111\u2013125.)</ref> Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[substance abuse]], and [[suicide]]. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.<ref name=\"cochran\">Cochran, Susan; Sullivan, J; Mays, Vickie (February 2003). \"Prevalence of Mental Disorders, Psychological Distress, and Mental Health Services Use Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults in the United States\", ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology'', '''71''' (1), pp. 53\u201361.</ref>\n\nWomen who identify as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence.<ref name=\"cochran\" /><ref name=\"schlager153\">Schlager, p. 153.</ref> These emotions have been cited as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women who identify as bisexual.<ref name=\"rust2\">Rust, Paula, (March, 1993). \"Coming out\" in the Age of Social Constructionism: Sexual Identity Formation among Lesbian and Bisexual Women\", ''Gender and Society'', '''7''' (1), pp. 50\u201377.</ref> On the whole, women tend to work through developing a self-concept internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to, and more often see being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.<ref name=\"schlager153\" />\n\n[[Anxiety disorder]]s and [[depression (mood)|depression]] are the most common mental health issues for women.

The majority of media about lesbians is produced by men;<ref name=\"schlagermedia\" /> women's publishing companies did not develop until the 1970s, films about lesbians made by women did not appear until the 1980s, and television shows portraying lesbians written by women only began to be created in the 21st century. As a result, homosexuality\u2014particularly dealing with women\u2014has been excluded because of [[symbolic annihilation]]. When depictions of lesbians began to surface, they were often one-dimensional, simplified stereotypes.<ref name=\"schlagermedia\">Schlager, pp. 389\u2013390.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Further|Lesbian literature}}\n\nIn addition to Sappho's accomplishments,<ref group=note>Sappho has also served as a subject of many works of literature by writers such as [[John Donne]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[Pierre Lou\u00ffs]], and several anonymous writers, that have addressed her relationships with women and men. She has been used as an embodiment of same-sex desire, and as a character in fictions loosely based on her life. (Castle, pp. 125, 208, 252, 319, 566.)</ref> literary historian [[Jeannette Howard Foster]] includes the [[Book of Ruth]],<ref>Foster, pp. 22\u201323. Terry Castle also lists the Book of Ruth as an example of early lesbianism in literature (Castle, p. 108.)</ref> and ancient mythological tradition as examples of lesbianism in classical literature. Greek stories of the heavens often included a female figure whose virtue and virginity were unspoiled, who pursued more masculine interests, and who was followed by a dedicated group of maidens. Foster cites [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], [[Artemis]] and [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], and [[Iphis]] and [[Iphis|Ianthe]] as examples of female mythological figures who showed remarkable devotion to each other, or defied gender expectations.<ref>Foster, pp. 24\u201327.</ref> The Greeks are also given credit with spreading the story of a mythological race of women warriors named [[Amazons]]. [[En-hedu-ana]], a priestess in [[Ancient Iraq]] who dedicated herself to the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] goddess [[Inanna]], has the distinction of signing the oldest-surviving signed poetry in history. She characterized herself as Inanna's spouse.<ref>Norton, p. 189.</ref>\n\nFor ten centuries after the fall of the Roman Empire, lesbianism disappeared from literature.<ref>Castle, p. 11.</ref> Foster points to the particularly strict view that [[Eve]]\u2014representative of all women\u2014caused the downfall of mankind; [[original sin]] among women was a particular concern, especially because women were perceived as creating life.<ref>Foster, pp. 30\u201331.</ref> During this time, women were largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuit, so men were responsible for shaping ideas about sexuality.<ref>Castle, p. 6.</ref>\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, French and English depictions of relationships between women (''[[Lives of Gallant Ladies]]'' by [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brant\u00f4me|Brant\u00f4me]] in 1665, [[John Cleland]]'s 1749 erotica ''[[Fanny Hill|Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure]]'', ''[[L'Espion Anglais]]'' by various authors in 1778), writers' attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted when men were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women.<ref>Faderman (1981), pp. 26\u201328.</ref> At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 29.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lautrec in bed 1893.jpg|thumb|''[[Le Lit (Toulouse-Lautrec)|In Bed]]'' by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] (1893).

One woman is looking sleepily at the other.]]\n\nLesbianism became almost exclusive to French literature in the 19th century, based on male fantasy and the desire to shock bourgeois moral values.<ref>Faderman (1981), pp. 264, 268.</ref> [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]], in ''[[The Girl with the Golden Eyes]]'' (1835), employed lesbianism in his story about three people living amongst the moral degeneration of Paris, and again in ''[[Cousin Bette]]'' and ''[[S\u00e9raph\u00eeta]]''. His work influenced novelist [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]]'s ''[[Mademoiselle de Maupin]]'', which provided the first description of a physical type that became associated with lesbians: tall, wide-shouldered, slim-hipped, and athletically inclined.<ref>Foster, pp. 51\u201365.</ref> [[Charles Baudelaire]] repeatedly used lesbianism as a theme in his poems \"Lesbos\", \"Femmes damn\u00e9es 1\" (\"Damned Women\"), and \"Femmes damn\u00e9es 2\".<ref>Castle, p. 435.</ref>\n\nReflecting French society, as well as employing stock character associations, many of the lesbian characters in 19th-century French literature were prostitutes or courtesans: personifications of vice who died early, violent deaths in moral endings.<ref name=\"prostitution\">Faderman (1981), pp. 281\u2013283</ref> [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s 1816 poem \"[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]\" and the novella ''[[Carmilla]]'' (1872) by [[Sheridan Le Fanu]] both present lesbianism associated with vampirism.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 277, 288\u2013289.</ref> Portrayals of female homosexuality not only formed European consciousness about lesbianism, but Krafft-Ebing cited the characters in [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Salammb\u00f4]]'' (1862) and [[Ernest Feydeau]]'s ''[[Le Comte de Chalis]]'' (1867) as examples of lesbians because both novels feature female protagonists who do not adhere to social norms and express \"contrary sexual feeling\", although neither participated in same-sex desire or sexual behavior.<ref>Foster, p. 72.</ref> Havelock Ellis used literary examples from Balzac and several French poets and writers to develop his framework to identify sexual inversion in women.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 254.</ref>\n\nGradually, women began to author their own thoughts and literary works about lesbian relationships. Until the publication of ''The Well of Loneliness'', most major works involving lesbianism were penned by men. Foster suggests that women would have encountered suspicion about their own lives had they used same-sex love as a topic, and that some writers including [[Louise Lab\u00e9]], [[Charlotte Charke]], and [[Margaret Fuller]] either changed the pronouns in their literary works to male, or made them ambiguous.<ref>Foster, pp. 116\u2013127.</ref> Author [[George Sand]] was portrayed as a character in several works in the 19th century; writer [[Mario Praz]] credited the popularity of lesbianism as a theme to Sand's appearance in Paris society in the 1830s.<ref>Faderman (1981), p. 263.</ref><ref group=note>The cross-dressing Sand was also the subject of a few of [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s sonnets.(Castle, pp. 426\u2013427.)</ref> [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Villette (novel)|Villette]]'' in 1853 initiated a genre of boarding [[School story|school stories]] with homoerotic themes.<ref>Castle, p. 429.</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, [[Katherine Mansfield]], [[Amy Lowell]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[H.D.]], [[Vita Sackville-West]], [[Virginia Woolf]], and [[Gale Wilhelm]] wrote popular works that had same-sex relationships as themes. Some women, such as [[Marguerite Yourcenar]] and [[Mary Renault]], wrote or translated works of fiction that focused on homosexual men, like some of the writings of [[Carson McCullers]]. All three were involved in same-sex relationships, but their primary friendships were with gay men.<ref>Norton, p. 182.</ref> Foster further asserts 1928 was a \"peak year\" for lesbian-themed literature; in addition to ''The Well of Loneliness'', three other novels with lesbian themes were published in England: [[Elizabeth Bowen]]'s ''The Hotel'', Woolf's ''[[Orlando: A Biography|Orlando]]'', and [[Compton Mackenzie]]'s satirical novel ''Extraordinary Women''.<ref>Lanser, 1979, p. 39.</ref> Unlike ''The Well of Loneliness'', none of these novels were banned.<ref name=\"Foster-281\">Foster, pp. 281\u2013287.</ref><ref group=note>A fifth novel in 1928, American author Djuna Barnes' ''[[Ladies Almanack]]'', is a ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' of [[Natalie Clifford Barney#Salon|a lesbian literary and artistic salon in Paris]] and circulated at first within those circles; Susan Sniader Lanser calls it a \"sister-text\" to Hall's landmark work, (Lanser, Susan Sniader [Autumn 1979], \"Speaking in Tongues: 'Ladies Almanack' and the Language of Celebration\". ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies'', '''4''' (3), pp. 39\u201346.) as Barnes includes a character based on Radclyffe Hall and passages that may be a response to ''The Well of Loneliness'' (Barnes, p. xxxi.)</ref>\n\nAs the paperback book came into fashion, lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction. Many of the pulp novels typically presented very unhappy women, or relationships that ended tragically. Marijane Meaker later wrote that she was told to make the relationship end badly in ''Spring Fire'' because the publishers were concerned about the books being confiscated by the U.S. Postal Service.<ref>Packer, Vin (Marijane Meaker). ''Spring Fire'', Introduction. 2004, Cleis Press.</ref> [[Patricia Highsmith]], writing as Claire Morgan, wrote ''[[The Price of Salt]]'' in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.<ref>Castle, pp. 1024\u20131025.</ref>\n\nFollowing the Stonewall riots, lesbian themes in literature became much more diverse and complex, and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for heterosexual men to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as ''[[The Furies Collective|The Furies]]'', and ''[[Sinister Wisdom]]'' replaced ''The Ladder''. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included [[Rita Mae Brown]]'s ''[[Rubyfruit Jungle]]'' (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian.<ref>Schlager, p. 377.</ref> Poet [[Audre Lorde]] confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and [[Cherr\u00ede Moraga]] is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values are evident in the writings of [[Dorothy Allison]], who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian [[sadomasochism]] themes.<ref>Schlager, p. 379.</ref>\n\n===Film===\nLesbianism, or the suggestion of it, began early in filmmaking. The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed\u2014or for what reasons\u2014as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films. Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones. Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in ''[[A Florida Enchantment]]'' featuring [[Edith Storey]]. In ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' (1930) [[Marlene Dietrich]] kisses another woman on the lips, and [[Katharine Hepburn]] plays a man in ''[[Christopher Strong]]'' in 1933 and again in ''[[Sylvia Scarlett]]'' (1936). Hollywood films followed the same trend set by audiences who flocked to Harlem to see edgy shows that suggested bisexuality.<ref>Benshoff, pp. 27\u201328.</ref>\n\nOvert female homosexuality was introduced in 1929's ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' between [[Louise Brooks]] and [[Alice Roberts (actress)|Alice Roberts]]. However, the development of the [[Hays Code]] in 1930 censored most references to homosexuality from film under the umbrella term \"sex perversion\". German films depicted homosexuality and were distributed throughout Europe, but 1931's ''[[M\u00e4dchen in Uniform (1931 film)|M\u00e4dchen in Uniform]]'' was not distributed in the U.S. because of the depiction of an adolescent's love for a female teacher in boarding school.<ref name=\"russo58\" />\n\n[[File:Childrens Hour trailer.jpg|thumb|Lesbianism, or homosexuality, was never spoken about in ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'', but it is transparent why [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s character hangs herself.|alt=Still shot from the film \"The Children's Hour\", showing Shirley MacLaine looking down at the left and Audrey Hepburn to her right staring at her, in a bedroom. The words \"Can an ugly rumor destroy what's beautiful?\" obscure much of MacLaine's face.]]\n\nBecause of the Hays Code, lesbianism after 1930 was absent from most films, even those adapted with overt lesbian characters or plot devices. [[Lillian Hellman]]'s play ''[[The Children's Hour (play)|The Children's Hour]]'' was converted into a heterosexual love triangle and retitled ''[[These Three]]''. Biopic ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' in 1933, starring [[Greta Garbo]], veiled most of the speculation about Christina of Sweden's affairs with women.<ref name=\"russo58\">Russo, p. 58.</ref> Homosexuality or lesbianism was never mentioned outright in the films while the Hays Code was enforced. The reason censors stated for removing a lesbian scene in 1954's ''[[Olivia (1951 film)|The Pit of Loneliness]]'' was that it was, \"Immoral, would tend to corrupt morals\".<ref>Russo, p. 102.</ref> The code was relaxed somewhat after 1961, and the next year [[William Wyler]] remade ''[[The Children's Hour (film)|The Children's Hour]]'' with [[Audrey Hepburn]] and [[Shirley MacLaine]]. After MacLaine's character admits her love for Hepburn's, she hangs herself; this set a precedent for miserable endings in films addressing homosexuality.<ref>Russo, p. 139.</ref>\n\nGay characters also were often killed off at the end, such as the death of [[Sandy Dennis]]' character at the end of ''[[The Fox (1967 film)|The Fox]]'' in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by [[Barbara Stanwyck]] in ''[[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|Walk on the Wild Side]]'' from 1962 and [[Shelley Winters]] in ''[[The Balcony (film)|The Balcony]]'' in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' (1940), women's prison films like ''[[Caged]]'' (1950), or in the character [[Rosa Klebb]] in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963).<ref>Russo, pp. 143\u2013156.</ref> Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' (1936), ''[[Blood and Roses]]'' (1960), ''[[Vampyros Lesbos]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'' (1983).<ref>Russo, p. 49.</ref> ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by [[Sharon Stone]]; it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction of gays as predators.<ref>Brenshoff, pp. 250\u2013151.</ref>\n\nThe first film to address lesbianism with significant depth was ''[[The Killing of Sister George (film)|The Killing of Sister George]]'' in 1968, which was filmed in [[Gateways club|The Gateways Club]], a longstanding lesbian pub in London. It is the first to claim a film character who identifies as a lesbian, and film historian [[Vito Russo]] considers the film a complex treatment of a multifaceted character who is forced into silence about her openness by other lesbians.<ref>Russo, pp. 170\u2013173.</ref> ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' in 1982, and ''[[Lianna]]'' in 1983 treat the lesbian relationships more sympathetically and show lesbian sex scenes, though in neither film are the relationships happy ones. ''Personal Best'' was criticized for engaging in the cliched plot device of one woman returning to a relationship with a man, implying that lesbianism is a phase, as well as treating the lesbian relationship with \"undisguised voyeurism\".<ref>Benshoff, pp. 185\u2013186.</ref> More ambiguous portrayals of lesbian characters were seen in ''[[Silkwood]]'' (1983), ''[[The Color Purple (1985 film)|The Color Purple]]'' (1985), and ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes (film)|Fried Green Tomatoes]]'' (1991), despite explicit lesbianism in the source material.<ref>''[[The Celluloid Closet]]''.

Local talk shows in the late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts (usually not gay themselves) to discuss the problems of gay men in society. Lesbianism was rarely included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and in distress, calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for women. When she realizes this, however, she is able to pursue heterosexual relationships, which are portrayed as \"healthy\".<ref>Tropiano, pp. 7\u20139.</ref>\n\nInvisibility for lesbians continued in the 1970s when homosexuality became the subject of dramatic portrayals, first with medical dramas (''[[The Bold Ones: The New Doctors|The Bold Ones]]'', ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]]'') featuring primarily male patients coming out to doctors, or staff members coming out to other staff members. These shows allowed homosexuality to be discussed clinically, with the main characters guiding troubled gay characters or correcting homophobic antagonists, while simultaneously comparing homosexuality to psychosis, criminal behavior, or drug use.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 13\u201344.</ref>\n\nAnother stock plot device in the 1970s was the gay character in a police drama. They served as victims of blackmail or anti-gay violence, but more often as criminals. Beginning in the late 1960s with ''[[N.Y.P.D. (TV series)|N.Y.P.D.]]'', ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', and ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', the use of homosexuals in stories became much more prevalent, according to Vito Russo, as a response to their higher profiles in gay activism.<ref>Russo, pp. 186\u2013189.</ref> Lesbians were included as villains, motivated to murder by their desires, internalized homophobia, or fear of being exposed as homosexual. One episode of ''Police Woman'' earned protests by the [[National Gay Task Force]] before it aired for portraying a trio of murderous lesbians who killed retirement home patients for their money.<ref>Tropiano, p. 68.</ref> NBC edited the episode because of the protests, but a [[sit-in]] was staged in the head of NBC's offices.<ref>Tropiano, p. 69.</ref>\n\nIn the middle of the 1970s, gay men and lesbians began to appear as police officers or detectives facing coming out issues. This did not extend to CBS' groundbreaking show ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'' in 1982, starring two female police detectives. CBS production made conscious attempts to soften the characters so they would not appear to be lesbians.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> In 1991, a bisexual lawyer portrayed by [[Amanda Donohoe]] on ''[[L.A. Law]]'' shared the first significant [[Lesbian kiss episode|lesbian kiss]]<ref group=note>''[[21 Jump Street]]'' included a kiss between series regular [[Holly Robinson Peete]] and guest star [[Katy Boyer]] in \"A Change of Heart\" (1990) but it did not inspire the critical or popular attention later such kisses would engender.

Her coming out in the media, as well as her sitcom, \"ranks, hands down, as the single most public exit in gay history\", changing media portrayals of lesbians in Western culture.<ref>Streitmatter, p. 104.</ref>|alt=A photograph of Ellen DeGeneres with her 1997 Emmy Award.]]\n\nThough television did not begin to use recurring homosexual characters until the late 1980s, some early situation comedies used a stock character that author Stephen Tropiano calls \"gay-straight\": supporting characters who were quirky, did not comply with gender norms, or had ambiguous personal lives, that \"for all purposes ''should'' be gay\". These included Zelda from ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'', Miss Hathaway from ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', and Jo from ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]''.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 185\u2013186.</ref> In the mid-1980s through the 1990s, sitcoms frequently employed a \"coming out\" episode, where a friend of one of the stars admits she is a lesbian, forcing the cast to deal with the issue. ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', and ''[[Friends]]'' used this device with women in particular.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 202\u2013204.</ref>\n\nRecurring lesbian characters who came out were seen on ''[[Married... with Children]]'', ''[[Mad About You]]'', and ''[[Roseanne (TV show)|Roseanne]]'', in which a [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell (Roseanne)|highly publicized episode]] had ABC executives afraid a televised kiss between Roseanne and [[Mariel Hemingway]] would destroy ratings and ruin advertising. The episode was instead the week's highest rated.<ref>Schlager, p. 394, 399.</ref> By far the sitcom with the most significant impact to the image of lesbians was ''[[Ellen (TV show)|Ellen]]''. Publicity surrounding Ellen's coming out episode in 1997 was enormous; [[Ellen DeGeneres]] appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine the week before the airing of \"[[The Puppy Episode]]\" with the headline \"Yep, I'm Gay\". Parties were held in many U.S. cities to watch the episode, and the opposition from conservative organizations was intense. [[WBMA-LD|WBMA-LP]], the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], even refused to air the first run of the episode, citing conservative values of the local viewing audience, which earned the station some infamy and ire in the LGBT community. Even still, \"The Puppy Episode\" won an [[Emmy]] for writing, but as the show began to deal with Ellen Morgan's sexuality each week, network executives grew uncomfortable with the direction the show took and canceled it.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 245\u2013249.</ref>\n\nDramas following ''L.A. Law'' began incorporating homosexual themes, particularly with continuing storylines on ''[[Relativity (TV series)|Relativity]]'', ''[[Picket Fences]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'', both of which tested the boundaries of sexuality and gender.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 128\u2013136.</ref> A show directed at adolescents that had a particularly strong cult following was ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. In the fourth season of ''Buffy'', [[Tara Maclay|Tara]] and [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] admit their love for each other without any special fanfare and the relationship is treated as are the other romantic relationships on the show.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref>\n\nWhat followed was a series devoted solely to gay characters from network television. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s American rendition of ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' ran for five years, from 2000 to 2005; two of the main characters were a lesbian couple. Showtime promoted the series as \"No Limits\", and ''Queer as Folk'' addressed homosexuality graphically. The aggressive advertising paid off as the show became the network's highest rated, doubling the numbers of other Showtime programs after the first season.<ref>Tropiano, pp. 150\u2013152.</ref> In 2004, Showtime introduced ''[[The L Word]]'', a dramatic series devoted to a group of lesbian and bisexual women, running its final season in 2009.\n\n==Other aspects==\n===Lesbian chic and popular culture===\n[[File:Vanity Fair Cover Lang Crawford.jpg|thumb|upright|The August 1993 cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that marked the arrival of lesbian chic as a social phenomenon in the 1990s.|alt=Cover of Vanity Fair magazine from August 1993 showing k.d. lang reclining in a barber chair with eyes closed and holding a compact mirror.

This is in part due to public figures who have caused speculation and comment in the press about their sexuality and lesbianism in general. The primary figure earning this attention was [[Martina Navratilova]], who served as tabloid fodder for years as she denied being lesbian, admitted to being bisexual, had very public relationships with [[Rita Mae Brown]] and [[Judy Nelson]], and acquired as much press about her sexuality as she did her athletic achievements. Navratilova spurred what scholar Diane Hamer termed \"constant preoccupation\" in the press with determining the root of same-sex desire.<ref>Hamer, pp. 57\u201377.</ref>\n\nOther public figures acknowledged their homosexuality and bisexuality, notably musicians [[k.d. lang]] and [[Melissa Etheridge]], and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s pushing of sexual boundaries in her performances and publications. In 1993, lang and self-professed heterosexual supermodel [[Cindy Crawford]] posed for the August cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in a provocative arrangement that showed Crawford shaving lang's face, as lang lounged in a barber's chair wearing a pinstripe suit.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bennetts|first1=Leslie|title=k.d. lang Cuts It Close |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/1993/08/kd-lang-cover-story|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=August 1, 1993|accessdate=13 September 2018}}</ref> The image \"became an internationally recognized symbol of the phenomenon of lesbian chic\", according to Hamer.<ref>Hamer, p. 1.</ref> The year 1994 marked a rise in lesbian visibility, particularly appealing to women with feminine appearances. Between 1992 and 1994, ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle]]'', ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazines featured stories about women who admitted sexual histories with other women.<ref>Streitmatter, pp. 77\u201378.</ref>\n\nOne analyst reasoned the recurrence of lesbian chic was due to the often-used homoerotic subtexts of gay male subculture being considered off limits because of [[AIDS]] in the late 1980s and 1990s, joined with the distant memory of lesbians as they appeared in the 1970s: unattractive and militant. In short, lesbians became more attractive to general audiences when they ceased having political convictions.<ref>Hamer, pp. 87\u201390.</ref> All the attention on feminine and glamorous women created what culture analyst Rodger Streitmatter characterizes as an unrealistic image of lesbians packaged by heterosexual men; the trend influenced an increase in the inclusion of lesbian material in [[pornography]] aimed at men.<ref>Streitmatter, p. 81.</ref>\n\nA resurgence of lesbian visibility and sexual fluidity was noted in 2009, with celebrities such as [[Cynthia Nixon]] and [[Lindsay Lohan]] commenting openly on their relationships with women, and reality television addressing same-sex relationships. Psychiatrists and feminist philosophers write that the rise in women acknowledging same-sex relationships is due to growing social acceptance, but also concede that \"only a certain kind of lesbian\u2014slim and elegant or butch in just the right androgynous way\u2014is acceptable to mainstream culture\".<ref>Fischer, Mary (April 23, 2009).

[[Same-sex marriage in New York]] was legalized in 2011.|alt=]]\n{{Further|LGBT parenting}}\n\nAlthough homosexuality among females has taken place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship.<ref>Schlager, p. 117.</ref> Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.<ref>Schlager, pp. 118\u2013119.</ref>\n\nFamily issues were significant concerns for lesbians when gay activism became more vocal in the 1960s and 1970s. Custody issues in particular were of interest since often courts would not award custody to mothers who were openly homosexual, even though the general procedure acknowledged children were awarded to the biological mother.<ref name=\"custody\">Schlager, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref><ref>Jennings, p. 182.</ref> Several studies performed as a result of custody disputes viewed how children grow up with same-sex parents compared to single mothers who did not identify as lesbians. They found that children's mental health, happiness, and overall adjustment is similar to children of divorced women who are not lesbians. Sexual orientation, [[gender identity]], and sex roles of children who grow up with lesbian mothers are unaffected. Differences that were found include the fact that divorced lesbians tend to be living with a partner, fathers visit divorced lesbian mothers more often than divorced nonlesbian mothers, and lesbian mothers report a greater fear of losing their children through legal means.<ref name=\"custody\" />\n\nImproving opportunities for growing families of same-sex couples has shaped the political landscape within the past ten years. A push for [[same-sex marriage]] or civil unions in western countries has replaced other political objectives. {{As of|2012}}, ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; [[civil unions]] are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to [[artificial insemination]].<ref>Schlager, pp. 128\u2013129.</ref>\n\n===Lesbians of color===\n[[File:NYC Pride Parade 2012 - 034 (7457177728).jpg|thumb|right|190px|Attendees at 2012 New York City [[Pride parade]].]]\n\nLesbians of color have often been a marginalized group, including African American, Latina, Asian, Arab, and other non-Caucasian lesbians;<ref name=Myers>{{cite book |last1=Myers |first1=JoAnne |title=Historical Dictionary of the Lesbian and Gay Liberation Movements |date=2013 |page=85 |edition=1st |chapter=Black Lesbians |publisher=[[Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=978-0810872264}}</ref> and experienced racism, homophobia, and misogyny due to their many identities.<ref name=Zimmerman_LHC2000>{{cite book|editor1-last=Zimmerman|editor1-first=Bonnie|title=Lesbian Histories and Cultures: An Encyclopedia|date=2000|edition=1st|volume=1 (Encyclopedia of Lesbian and Gay Histories and Cultures)|publisher=[[Garland Publishing]]|isbn=0-8153-1920-7}}</ref>\n\nSome scholars have noted that in the past the predominant lesbian community was largely composed of [[White people|white women]] and influenced by American culture, leading some lesbians of color to experience difficulties integrating into the community at large.

Many feel abandoned, as communities of color often view homosexual identity as a \"white\" lifestyle and see the acceptance of homosexuality as a setback in achieving equality.<ref name=Zimmerman_LHC2000 />\n\nLesbians of color, especially those of immigrant populations, often hold the sentiment that their [[sexual orientation]] identity adversely affects assimilation into the [[dominant culture]]. Historically, women of color were often excluded from participating in lesbian and gay movements. Scholars have stated that this exclusion came as a result of the majority of whites dismissing the intersections of gender, race, and sexuality that are a core part of the lesbian of color identity. Lesbians that organized events were mostly white and middle-class, and largely focused their political movements on the issues of sexism and homophobia, rather than class or race issues. The early lesbian feminist movement was criticized for excluding race and class issues from their spaces and for a lack of focus on issues that did not benefit white women.<ref name=Myers /> [[Audre Lorde]], [[Barbara Smith]], and [[Cherrie Moraga]] are cited as major theorists within the various lesbians of color movements for their insistence on inclusion and equality, from both racial communities and white lesbian communities.<ref name=Myers />\n\nThe many intersections surrounding lesbians of color can often contribute to an increased need for mental health resources. Lesbians of color are more likely to experience a number of psychological issues due to the various experiences of sexism, racism, and homophobia as a part of their existence.<ref name=BridgesSK>{{cite journal |last1=Bridges |first1=Sara K. |last2=Selvidge |first2=Mary M.

But then, unlike other cheeses, fresh mozzarella [[curds]] are plunged into hot [[whey]] or lightly salted water, kneaded, and pulled to develop the familiar stretchy strings ([[pasta filata]]), then shaped in whatever form is desired.\n\nWhen making burrata, the still-hot cheese is formed into a pouch, which is then filled with scraps of leftover mozzarella and topped off with fresh [[cream]] before closing. The finished burrata is traditionally wrapped in the leaves of [[Asphodelus|asphodel]], tied to form a little [[brioche]]-like topknot, and moistened with a little whey. The asphodel leaves should still be green when the cheese is served to indicate the cheese's freshness.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 March 2011|title=Burrata: Britain's new Big cheese|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/burrata-britains-new-big-cheese-2229887.html|accessdate=7 September 2013|last=Roberts|first=Genevieve}}</ref> More recently, the cheese is often sold in a plastic bag or container.\n\n==Serving suggestions==\nWhen the burrata is sliced open, a spurt of thickened cream flows out.

But then, unlike other cheeses, fresh mozzarella [[curds]] are plunged into hot [[whey]] or lightly salted water, kneaded, and pulled to develop the familiar stretchy strings ([[pasta filata]]), then shaped in whatever form is desired.\n\nWhen making burrata, the still-hot cheese is formed into a pouch, which is then filled with scraps of leftover mozzarella and topped off with fresh [[cream]] before closing. The finished burrata is traditionally wrapped in the leaves of [[Asphodelus|asphodel]], tied to form a little [[brioche]]-like topknot, and moistened with a little whey. The asphodel leaves should still be green when the cheese is served to indicate the cheese's freshness.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 March 2011|title=Burrata: Britain's new Big cheese|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/burrata-britains-new-big-cheese-2229887.html|accessdate=7 September 2013|last=Roberts|first=Genevieve}}</ref> More recently, the cheese is often sold in a plastic bag or container.\n\n==Serving suggestions==\nWhen the burrata is sliced open, a spurt of thickened cream flows out. The cheese has a rich, buttery flavor and retains its fresh milkiness. It is best when eaten within 24 hours and is considered past its prime after 48 hours.
