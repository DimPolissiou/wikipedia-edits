Bond and Felix Leiter then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the Flying Saucer, in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in North Africa, but Bond subsequently escapes with Domino. The two agents ambush Largo while he is placing one of the bombs.\n\n==Awards==\nThe Bond films have been nominated for a number of awards throughout their fifty-year history, with most films winning an award; these include successes at the [[British Academy Film Awards]], [[Golden Globe Award]]s and [[Academy Award]]s.

He recruits baccarat player Evelyn Tremble to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Having embezzled SMERSH's money, Le Chiffre is desperate for money to cover up his theft. Tremble stops Le Chiffre's cheating and beats him in a game of baccarat. Tremble is captured, tortured and killed. Bond establishes that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah; he and Moneypenny travel there to investigate. Dr. Noah turns out to be Sir James's nephew Jimmy Bond, who plans to use biological warfare to make all women beautiful and kill all tall men, leaving him as the \"big man\" who gets all the girls. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues, but the building explodes, killing all inside.\n\n===''Never Say Never Again'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Never Say Never Again}}\n\nBond investigates the hijacking of two [[cruise missiles]] with live nuclear warheads which had been taken by SPECTRE. He meets Domino Petachi, the pilot's sister, and her lover, Maximillian Largo, SPECTRE's Number One, who directly responds to Blofeld. Following them to France, Bond informs Domino of her brother's death and subsequently finds his MI6 colleague killed by Fatima Blush, another SPECTRE agent: Bond kills her. Bond and Felix Leiter then attempt to board Largo's motor yacht, the Flying Saucer, in search of the missing nuclear warheads. Bond becomes trapped and is taken, with Domino, to Palmyra, Largo's base of operations in North Africa, but Bond subsequently escapes with Domino. The two agents ambush Largo while he is placing one of the bombs.\n\n==Awards==\nThe Bond films have been nominated for a number of awards throughout their fifty-year history, with most films winning an award; these include successes at the [[British Academy Film Awards]], [[Golden Globe Award]]s and [[Academy Award]]s. In addition, in 1982 Albert R. Broccoli received the [[Irving G.
