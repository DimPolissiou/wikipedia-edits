Founded in 1959 by the anthropologist [[Sol Tax]] ([http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/950119/tax.shtml 1907-1995]).

The company currently owns fifteen stations \u2013 nine affiliated with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (one of which also carries [[MyNetworkTV]] on a digital subchannel), three affiliated with [[The CW]], two affiliated with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and one affiliated with MyNetworkTV.\n\nCunningham has very close ties to the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]. All but one of the Cunningham stations are operated by Sinclair under [[local marketing agreement]]s (the exception is [[WYZZ-TV]], which is operated by [[Nexstar Media Group]]). In addition, over 90 percent of Cunningham's stock is controlled by trusts in the name of Sinclair founder Julian Smith's children. Based on these arrangements, Cunningham appears to be a [[shell corporation]] that Sinclair uses to circumvent [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations on television station ownership.<ref>[http://www.sinclairwatch.org/sinclair_report.pdf SinclairWatch.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720005425/http://www.sinclairwatch.org/sinclair_report.pdf |date=July 20, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nCunningham was formed in 1994 as '''Glencairn, Ltd.''' It was headed by Edwin Edwards, a former Sinclair executive who had been [[general manager]] of one of Sinclair's original stations, WPTT-TV (channel 22, now [[WPNT]]) in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Sinclair sold WPTT to Edwards after Sinclair bought rival [[WPGH-TV]] (channel 53), but continued to operate the station under a local marketing agreement before buying the station back outright in 2000.\n\nThe initial capital was supplied by Carolyn Smith, wife of Sinclair founder Julian Smith and mother of current Sinclair CEO David Smith. Carolyn Smith also controlled 70% of Glencairn's stock. However, Glencairn held itself out as a minority-owned broadcaster (Edwards is [[African American]]), gaining instant favor with the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nGlencairn's initial purchase set the stage for its future dealings. In late 1993 or early 1994, Sinclair Broadcast Group merged with Abry Communications, which owned [[WNUV]] (channel 54) in [[Baltimore]]. WNUV had been the principal rival to Sinclair's flagship station, [[WBFF]] (channel 45). Sinclair could not keep both stations because FCC rules at the time did not allow common ownership of two television stations in a single [[media market|market]]. Accordingly, Glencairn bought WNUV from Sinclair, and the latter took over WNUV's operations under an LMA. However, due to the Smiths' controlling interest in Glencairn, Sinclair effectively had a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] in Baltimore \u2013 and had all but emasculated its principal rival.\n\nGlencairn eventually bought ten more stations, and Sinclair controlled all their operations via local marketing agreements. Due to Glencairn's financial structure (the Smiths eventually bought 97% of Glencairn's stock), Sinclair effectively had duopolies in all 11 markets in violation of the FCC media ownership rules at the time. Among the more notable purchases:\n*As part of the Abry merger, Sinclair also acquired WNRW-TV (channel 45, now [[WXLV-TV]]) in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. It simulcast its programming on separately-owned WGGT-TV (channel 48) in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]. Glencairn bought WGGT from its previous owner Act III Broadcasting, discontinued the simulcast and turned WGGT into an affiliate of the fledgling [[UPN|United Paramount Network]] as WUPN-TV (now [[WMYV]]).\n*In 1995, Glencairn bought [[WRDC-TV]] (channel 28) in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] and turned over control of its operations to Sinclair via an LMA. Sinclair already owned [[WLFL]] (channel 22) in that market. In effect, Sinclair now had duopolies in two of North Carolina's largest markets.\n*In 1996, Sinclair merged with [[River City Broadcasting]], which owned [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WSYX]] (channel 6) in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. This initially posed a problem for Sinclair, as it already owned that market's Fox affiliate, [[WTTE]] (channel 28). Sinclair decided to keep the higher-rated WSYX and sold WTTE to Glencairn. Sinclair continued to operate WTTE through an LMA. River City also owned [[WLOS]] (channel 13) in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] and satellite station WAXA-TV (channel 40) in [[Anderson, South Carolina]]. Sinclair sold WAXA to Glencairn, who ended the simulcast and turned WAXA into an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]], later changing its call letters to WFBC-TV and later [[WBSC-TV]].\n* In 1997, Sinclair purchased the broadcasting properties of [[Heritage Media]], which included ABC affiliate [[WCHS-TV]] (channel 8) in [[Charleston, West Virginia]]. Sinclair already owned the market's Fox affiliate [[WVAH-TV]] (channel 11), but opted to keep the longer-established WCHS and sold WVAH to Glencairn. Also that year, Glencairn bought KRRT (channel 35, now [[KMYS]]) in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]], which already had an existing LMA with [[KABB]] (channel 29, which Sinclair had acquired the previous year as part of its purchase of River City).\n* In 1998, Sinclair and Glencairn teamed up to buy five stations from [[Sullivan Broadcasting]]. Glencairn simply bought the licenses while Sinclair bought the stations' other assets. Sinclair then leased the non-license assets back to Glencairn.\n\n===The 1999\u20132001 dispute===\nIn 1999, the FCC finally relaxed its ownership rules and allowed one company to own two stations in the same market starting in 2001. Ironically, this development brought the Sinclair-Glencairn arrangement to light for the first time. At the time, Glencairn was getting ready to buy Sullivan-owned [[KOKH-TV]] (channel 25) in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], where Sinclair already owned [[KOCB]] (channel 34). When the FCC relaxed its rules, Sinclair simply replaced Glencairn as the buyer for KOKH. Glencairn then announced plans to sell five of its stations to Sinclair outright.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140610193409/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20938729.html PUSH pushing FCC over Sinclair/Glencairn.(Rainbow/Push Coalition; Sinclair Broadcast; local marketing agreements)], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', July 13, 1998.</ref>\n\nThis move led [[Jesse Jackson]] and others to file challenges to the proposed transactions. In the course of subsequent hearings, it emerged that Edwards did not know how much debt Glencairn would assume when the deals were finalized. This led FCC Commissioner [[Michael Copps]] to question the deal's integrity, as well as Glencairn's decision-making process. It later emerged that Glencairn was to be paid for the proposed purchases with Sinclair stock, and that the Smiths controlled almost all of Glencairn's stock. Eventually, the FCC placed a $40,000 fine against Sinclair for illegally controlling Glencairn. However, it took no further action, leading Copps to blast the decision as a backhanded endorsement of Sinclair's tactics.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140610193407/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54266781.html Glencairn's dicey LMAs], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', March 29, 1999.</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fcc-fines-sinclair-glencairn-control/90604 FCC fines Sinclair for Glencairn control], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', December 10, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Glencairn becomes Cunningham===\nIn 2001, Glencairn attempted to merge with Sinclair outright. However, the FCC rejected the deal because six of Glencairn's stations \u2013 WNUV, WVAH, WTTE, WBSC, [[WRGT-TV]] (channel 45) in [[Dayton, Ohio]] and [[WTAT-TV]] (channel 24) in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] \u2013 were located in markets where Sinclair could not legally have duopolies. The reasons stated:\n* WNUV: Baltimore, despite being the 24th-largest market, has only seven full-power television stations. The FCC requires a market to have eight unique station owners once a duopoly is formed, not counting [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] stations. \n* WTTE: Sinclair-owned WSYX is the third-rated station in Columbus while WTTE is the fourth-rated station. FCC rules do not allow common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market. In addition, despite being the 32nd-largest market, Columbus has only seven full-power stations \u2013 too few to allow a duopoly in any case.\n* WBSC: The FCC already permitted [[Media General]], owner of [[WSPA-TV]] (channel 7), to buy LMA partner WASV (channel 62, now [[WYCW]]), and a Sinclair purchase of WBSC (now [[WMYA-TV]]) would leave only seven unique owners in the [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]]-[[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]]-Asheville market.\n* WVAH: Sinclair-owned WCHS is the second highest-rated station in the [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]]-Charleston market, while WVAH is #4.\n* WRGT: Dayton has only seven full-power television stations \u2013 too few to allow any duopolies. In addition, Sinclair already owned [[WKEF]] (channel 22), the third highest-rated station, while WRGT is the fourth highest-rated.\n* WTAT: Charleston has only six full-power stations \u2013 too few to allow any duopolies. WTAT was nominally junior partner in an LMA with [[WCIV|WMMP]] (channel 36), which Sinclair had acquired in a group deal in July 1998.\n\nSinclair, however, was able to buy five of Glencairn's stations, and Glencairn subsequently changed its name to '''Cunningham Broadcasting''', named after the widow of Sinclair's founder, Carolyn Cunningham Smith.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/baltimoresun/obituary.aspx?n=carolyn-beth-cunningham-smith&pid=158138071&fhid=9958|title=Obituary for Carolyn Beth Cunningham Smith|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> However, nearly all of Cunningham's stock is owned by the estate of Carolyn C. Smith, which controls the trusts of her and [[Julian Sinclair Smith]]'s four sons (one of whom is the current CEO of Sinclair), and so Sinclair still effectively owns Cunningham.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25406-2004Oct11.html |title=Family's TV Clout in Bush's Corner, Howard Kurtz and Frank Ahrens, Washington Post, October 12, 2004, Page A1 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2004-10-12 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}</ref> This situation led Sinclair Media Watch, a grassroots organization based in Asheville, to file informal objections when WLOS and WBSC's licenses came up for renewal in 2004.

The company currently owns fifteen stations \u2013 nine affiliated with [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] (one of which also carries [[MyNetworkTV]] on a digital subchannel), three affiliated with [[The CW]], two affiliated with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and one affiliated with MyNetworkTV.\n\nCunningham has very close ties to the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]. All but one of the Cunningham stations are operated by Sinclair under [[local marketing agreement]]s (the exception is [[WYZZ-TV]], which is operated by [[Nexstar Media Group]]). In addition, over 90 percent of Cunningham's stock is controlled by trusts in the name of Sinclair founder Julian Smith's children. Based on these arrangements, Cunningham appears to be a [[shell corporation]] that Sinclair uses to circumvent [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations on television station ownership.<ref>[http://www.sinclairwatch.org/sinclair_report.pdf SinclairWatch.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720005425/http://www.sinclairwatch.org/sinclair_report.pdf |date=July 20, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nCunningham was formed in 1994 as '''Glencairn, Ltd.''' It was headed by Edwin Edwards, a former Sinclair executive who had been [[general manager]] of one of Sinclair's original stations, WPTT-TV (channel 22, now [[WPNT]]) in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Sinclair sold WPTT to Edwards after Sinclair bought rival [[WPGH-TV]] (channel 53), but continued to operate the station under a local marketing agreement before buying the station back outright in 2000.\n\nThe initial capital was supplied by Carolyn Smith, wife of Sinclair founder Julian Smith and mother of current Sinclair CEO David Smith. Carolyn Smith also controlled 70% of Glencairn's stock. However, Glencairn held itself out as a minority-owned broadcaster (Edwards is [[African American]]), gaining instant favor with the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nGlencairn's initial purchase set the stage for its future dealings. In late 1993 or early 1994, Sinclair Broadcast Group merged with Abry Communications, which owned [[WNUV]] (channel 54) in [[Baltimore]]. WNUV had been the principal rival to Sinclair's flagship station, [[WBFF]] (channel 45). Sinclair could not keep both stations because FCC rules at the time did not allow common ownership of two television stations in a single [[media market|market]]. Accordingly, Glencairn bought WNUV from Sinclair, and the latter took over WNUV's operations under an LMA. However, due to the Smiths' controlling interest in Glencairn, Sinclair effectively had a [[duopoly (broadcasting)|duopoly]] in Baltimore \u2013 and had all but emasculated its principal rival.\n\nGlencairn eventually bought ten more stations, and Sinclair controlled all their operations via local marketing agreements. Due to Glencairn's financial structure (the Smiths eventually bought 97% of Glencairn's stock), Sinclair effectively had duopolies in all 11 markets in violation of the FCC media ownership rules at the time. Among the more notable purchases:\n*As part of the Abry merger, Sinclair also acquired WNRW-TV (channel 45, now [[WXLV-TV]]) in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. It simulcast its programming on separately-owned WGGT-TV (channel 48) in [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]]. Glencairn bought WGGT from its previous owner Act III Broadcasting, discontinued the simulcast and turned WGGT into an affiliate of the fledgling [[UPN|United Paramount Network]] as WUPN-TV (now [[WMYV]]).\n*In 1995, Glencairn bought [[WRDC-TV]] (channel 28) in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] and turned over control of its operations to Sinclair via an LMA. Sinclair already owned [[WLFL]] (channel 22) in that market. In effect, Sinclair now had duopolies in two of North Carolina's largest markets.\n*In 1996, Sinclair merged with [[River City Broadcasting]], which owned [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WSYX]] (channel 6) in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. This initially posed a problem for Sinclair, as it already owned that market's Fox affiliate, [[WTTE]] (channel 28). Sinclair decided to keep the higher-rated WSYX and sold WTTE to Glencairn. Sinclair continued to operate WTTE through an LMA. River City also owned [[WLOS]] (channel 13) in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] and satellite station WAXA-TV (channel 40) in [[Anderson, South Carolina]]. Sinclair sold WAXA to Glencairn, who ended the simulcast and turned WAXA into an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]], later changing its call letters to WFBC-TV and later [[WBSC-TV]].\n* In 1997, Sinclair purchased the broadcasting properties of [[Heritage Media]], which included ABC affiliate [[WCHS-TV]] (channel 8) in [[Charleston, West Virginia]]. Sinclair already owned the market's Fox affiliate [[WVAH-TV]] (channel 11), but opted to keep the longer-established WCHS and sold WVAH to Glencairn. Also that year, Glencairn bought KRRT (channel 35, now [[KMYS]]) in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]], which already had an existing LMA with [[KABB]] (channel 29, which Sinclair had acquired the previous year as part of its purchase of River City).\n* In 1998, Sinclair and Glencairn teamed up to buy five stations from [[Sullivan Broadcasting]]. Glencairn simply bought the licenses while Sinclair bought the stations' other assets. Sinclair then leased the non-license assets back to Glencairn.\n\n===The 1999\u20132001 dispute===\nIn 1999, the FCC finally relaxed its ownership rules and allowed one company to own two stations in the same market starting in 2001. Ironically, this development brought the Sinclair-Glencairn arrangement to light for the first time. At the time, Glencairn was getting ready to buy Sullivan-owned [[KOKH-TV]] (channel 25) in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], where Sinclair already owned [[KOCB]] (channel 34). When the FCC relaxed its rules, Sinclair simply replaced Glencairn as the buyer for KOKH. Glencairn then announced plans to sell five of its stations to Sinclair outright.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140610193409/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20938729.html PUSH pushing FCC over Sinclair/Glencairn.(Rainbow/Push Coalition; Sinclair Broadcast; local marketing agreements)], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', July 13, 1998.</ref>\n\nThis move led [[Jesse Jackson]] and others to file challenges to the proposed transactions. In the course of subsequent hearings, it emerged that Edwards did not know how much debt Glencairn would assume when the deals were finalized. This led FCC Commissioner [[Michael Copps]] to question the deal's integrity, as well as Glencairn's decision-making process. It later emerged that Glencairn was to be paid for the proposed purchases with Sinclair stock, and that the Smiths controlled almost all of Glencairn's stock. Eventually, the FCC placed a $40,000 fine against Sinclair for illegally controlling Glencairn. However, it took no further action, leading Copps to blast the decision as a backhanded endorsement of Sinclair's tactics.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140610193407/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54266781.html Glencairn's dicey LMAs], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', March 29, 1999.</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/fcc-fines-sinclair-glencairn-control/90604 FCC fines Sinclair for Glencairn control], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', December 10, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Glencairn becomes Cunningham===\nIn 2001, Glencairn attempted to merge with Sinclair outright. However, the FCC rejected the deal because six of Glencairn's stations \u2013 WNUV, WVAH, WTTE, WBSC, [[WRGT-TV]] (channel 45) in [[Dayton, Ohio]] and [[WTAT-TV]] (channel 24) in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] \u2013 were located in markets where Sinclair could not legally have duopolies. The reasons stated:\n* WNUV: Baltimore, despite being the 24th-largest market, has only seven full-power television stations. The FCC requires a market to have eight unique station owners once a duopoly is formed, not counting [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] stations. \n* WTTE: Sinclair-owned WSYX is the third-rated station in Columbus while WTTE is the fourth-rated station. FCC rules do not allow common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market. In addition, despite being the 32nd-largest market, Columbus has only seven full-power stations \u2013 too few to allow a duopoly in any case.\n* WBSC: The FCC already permitted [[Media General]], owner of [[WSPA-TV]] (channel 7), to buy LMA partner WASV (channel 62, now [[WYCW]]), and a Sinclair purchase of WBSC (now [[WMYA-TV]]) would leave only seven unique owners in the [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]]-[[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]]-Asheville market.\n* WVAH: Sinclair-owned WCHS is the second highest-rated station in the [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]]-Charleston market, while WVAH is #4.\n* WRGT: Dayton has only seven full-power television stations \u2013 too few to allow any duopolies. In addition, Sinclair already owned [[WKEF]] (channel 22), the third highest-rated station, while WRGT is the fourth highest-rated.\n* WTAT: Charleston has only six full-power stations \u2013 too few to allow any duopolies. WTAT was nominally junior partner in an LMA with [[WCIV|WMMP]] (channel 36), which Sinclair had acquired in a group deal in July 1998.\n\nSinclair, however, was able to buy five of Glencairn's stations, and Glencairn subsequently changed its name to '''Cunningham Broadcasting''', named after the widow of Sinclair's founder, Carolyn Cunningham Smith<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/baltimoresun/obituary.aspx?n=carolyn-beth-cunningham-smith&pid=158138071&fhid=9958|title=Obituary for Carolyn Beth Cunningham Smith|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>. However, nearly all of Cunningham's stock is owned by the estate of Carolyn C. Smith, which controls the trusts of her and [[Julian Sinclair Smith]]'s four sons (one of whom is the current CEO of Sinclair), and so Sinclair still effectively owns Cunningham.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25406-2004Oct11.html |title=Family's TV Clout in Bush's Corner, Howard Kurtz and Frank Ahrens, Washington Post, October 12, 2004, Page A1 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2004-10-12 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}</ref> This situation led Sinclair Media Watch, a grassroots organization based in Asheville, to file informal objections when WLOS and WBSC's licenses came up for renewal in 2004.

{"title_page": "Culture of Panama", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{Culture of Panama}}\n'''Panamanian culture''' is a hybrid of [[Culture of Africa|African]], [[Indigenous peoples of Panama|Native Panamanian]], and European culture - specifically Spanish. For example, the ''tamborito'' is a Spanish dance that was blended with Native American rhythms and dance moves. Dance is a symbol of the diverse cultures that have coupled in [[Panama]]. The local folklore can be experienced through a multitude of festivals, dances and traditions that have been handed down from generation to generation.\n\n==Panamanian cuisine==\n{{Further|Panamanian cuisine}}\n\n[[File:Arepa de huevo.jpg|thumb|300px|Arepa de huevo - Arepa with egg.]]\nPanamanian Cuisine is a mix of African, Spanish, and Native American techniques, dishes, and ingredients, reflecting its diverse population. Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking. \n\nTypical Panamanian foods are mildly flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama's Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are [[corn]], [[rice]], [[wheat]] flour, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, ''yuca'' ([[cassava]]), beef, chicken, pork and seafood.(in Panama they call this example tortilla, because the arepas are from Colombia)\n\n==Literature==\n{{See|Panamanian literature}}\n\nPanamanian historian and essayist Rodrigo Mir\u00f3 (1912\u20131996) cites [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s]] as the author of the first Panamanian literary work, the story of a character named Andrea de la Roca, which was published as part of the \"Historia General y Natural de Las Indias\" (1535). However, the first manifestations of literature written in Panama come from the 17th century with the title of \"Llanto de Panam\u00e1 a la muerte de don Enrique Enr\u00edquez\" (Crying from Panama at the Death of Don Enrique Enr\u00edquez).

With this heritage, Panama has a rich and diverse music history, and important contributions to Cumbia, Saloma, Pasillo, Punto, Tamborito, Mejorana, Bolero, Jazz, Salsa, Reggae, Calypso, Rock and other musical genres.  Not all people in Panama choose to listen to Spanish music. Some choose to listen to something they call \"soca\" music. So to summarize, Panamanians are considered mixed: American, Hispanic, and from the islands.\n\n== The arts ==\n===Visual arts===\nAnother example of Panama\u2019s blended culture is reflected in the traditional products, such as [[woodcarving]]s, ceremonial masks and [[pottery]], as well as in its architecture, cuisine, history and festivals.

This Conte Bowl consists of the colors black, dark red, and brown. In Helms'<ref name=\":1\" /> evaluation the color black represents a Panamanian  serpent, to be more exact a [[boa constrictor]]. The Panamanian [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] can be traced back to cosmic or [[mythological]] Mayan version of [[Rainbow Serpent|rainbow serpent]], commonly known in [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] mythology. The rainbow serpent to many ancient people connects the rainbow and snake, demonstrating how important it is for life to have water. The red portion of the bowl is representing mammals; small [[Appendage|appendages]] can be seen, representing the presence of life. The red and black work together to show ingenious appreciation of the mystical and the living. The brown in this piece makes its way around the appendages, glorifying the female anatomy. Museums all around North America possess many such artifacts; they encode different stories and meanings.\n\n===Nuchukana of the Kuna===\n\nThe Kuna people, originally referred to as the [[Guna people|Guna]] people, are natives to the land which is now known as [[Panama]] and [[Guatemala]]. These people often have sacred [[ritual]]s or traditions, one of them being the Nuchukana.

They are used to cure people from illness or to bring back the dead.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although they are a [[mythological]]  practice; these wooden figures hold a sentimental and cultural value that the Kuna people hold near to their hearts. When a person is in need a proper ritual is done involving chanting and [[tobacco]] smoking. The Nuchukana are asked to search for the cause of a person's illness. When the Nuchukana are not being used they are kept in a bundle in the house. The Kuna believe that [[evil spirit]]s will be kept out of the home. For this same reason the Nuchukana figures are respected and sometimes even shown to visitors and friends. Each Nuchukana holds a story or a tale of why it was created and why it is so special. Elder Kuna respect the Nuchukana and treat them as part of the family. It is important for the Kuna to keep Nuchukana sacred\u2014only young girls or elderly grandmothers may wash and clean Nuchukanas. It is possible for some Kuna to prefer a specific Nuchukana, making a special personal connection between a human and a [[wood]]en figure. Nuchukanas are so valuable that they are inherited from generation to generation. Once a Nuchukana wooden figure has [[wear|deteriorated]], it is simply tossed away, sometimes accompanied with a [[chant]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Today, these Nuchukanas can be found in the rural homes of the Guna people, or in local museums that were able to take care of these objects.\n\n==Museums==\nThe best overview of Panamanian culture is found in the Museum of the [[Panama]]nian, in [[Panama City]]. Other views can be found at the Museum of [[History of Panama|Panamanian History]], the Museum of [[Natural Sciences]], the Museum of Religious Colonial Art, the Museum of [[Contemporary Art]], the Museum of the Interoceanic Canal, and the national institutes of culture and music.\n\nA number of museums located in smaller communities throughout Panama's interior strive to preserve numerous aspects of the country's pre-Columbian, colonial and post-independence heritage.  Examples include the Museum of Nationality in Los Santos, located in an original colonial home and exhibiting relics from the region\u2019s pre-Columbian inhabitants, colonial period and nascent struggle for independence from Spain. The Herrera Museum was ranked #2 of six things to do in Chitre by Lonely Planet travelers. The two-story museum includes permanent exhibits covering the pre-Hispanic period, the region\u2019s first mammals, and the contact between the Spanish and the natives.  The main highlight of the second floor is a carefully constructed replica of the burial site of the Indian chief (Cacique) Parita.\n\nAn additional museum will soon be opening in Chitre as part of a unique tourism/residential project currently being developed.  The [http://www.cubitapanama.com/Culture-in-Panama/museum.html Cubit\u00e1 Museum] will explore the variety of cultural influences that have shaped the history, art and folklore of the Azuero Peninsula, and to appreciate the unique and painstakingly crafted work of local artisans.\n\nA scholarly analysis of Panamanian Museums, their history, exhibitions and social, political and economic contexts is available in the 2011 book \"Panamanian Museums and Historical Memory\".<ref>{{cite book|last=S\u00e1nchez Laws|first=Ana Luisa|title=Panamanian Museums and Historical Memory|date=2011|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-85745-240-5|url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=SanchezLawsPanamanian}}</ref>\n\n== See also == \n* [[Public holidays in Panama]]\n* [[Pollera]], national dress\n* [[Se\u00f1orita Panam\u00e1]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Panama topics}}\n{{Latin America topic|Culture of|Latin American culture}}\n{{Americas topic|Culture of}}\n\n[[Category:Panamanian culture| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{Culture of Panama}}\n'''Panamanian culture''' is a hybrid of [[Culture of Africa|African]], [[Indigenous peoples of Panama|Native Panamanian]], and European culture - specifically Spanish. For example, the ''tamborito'' is a Spanish dance that was blended with Native American rhythms and dance moves. Dance is a symbol of the diverse cultures that have coupled in [[Panama]].

Since Panama is a land bridge between two continents, it has a large variety of tropical fruits, vegetables and herbs that are used in native cooking. \n\nTypical Panamanian foods are mildly flavored, without the pungency of some of Panama's Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Common ingredients are [[corn]], [[rice]], [[wheat]] flour, [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, ''yuca'' ([[cassava]]), beef, chicken, pork and seafood.(in Panama they call this example tortilla, because the arepas are from Colombia)\n\n==Literature==\n{{See|Panamanian literature}}\n\nPanamanian historian and essayist Rodrigo Mir\u00f3 (1912\u20131996) cites [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s]] as the author of the first Panamanian literary work, the story of a character named Andrea de la Roca, which was published as part of the \"Historia General y Natural de Las Indias\" (1535).

This [[Pedestal]] Plate which is in Conte style is estimated to be from around A.D 600 to A.D. 800. This specific Bowl is held in a private collection and was photographed in 1991.  Different interpretations can be made depending on what point of view the piece is studied. Mary W. Helms,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Color and Creativity: Interpretation of Themes and Design Styles on a Panamanian Conte Bowl |last=Helms|first=Mary W.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|year=1996|isbn=|location=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20166955|pages=290\u2013302}}</ref> an author on Panamanian history, studies the colors and shapes in the Conte [[Bowl]] to tell the story behind the beautiful artwork. This Conte Bowl consists of the colors black, dark red, and brown. In Helms'<ref name=\":1\" /> evaluation the color black represents a Panamanian  serpent, to be more exact a [[boa constrictor]]. The Panamanian [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] can be traced back to cosmic or [[mythological]] Mayan version of [[Rainbow Serpent|rainbow serpent]], commonly known in [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] mythology. The rainbow serpent to many ancient people connects the rainbow and snake, demonstrating how important it is for life to have water. The red portion of the bowl is representing mammals; small [[Appendage|appendages]] can be seen, representing the presence of life. The red and black work together to show ingenious appreciation of the mystical and the living. The brown in this piece makes its way around the appendages, glorifying the female anatomy. Museums all around North America possess many such artifacts; they encode different stories and meanings.\n\n===Nuchukana of the Kuna===\n\nThe Kuna people, originally referred to as the [[Guna people|Guna]] people, are natives to the land which is now known as [[Panama]] and [[Guatemala]]. These people often have sacred [[ritual]]s or traditions, one of them being the Nuchukana. Paolo Fortis writes about Nuchukanas in his 2012 book \"''Kuna Art and Shamanism : An Ethnographic Approach''\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Kuna Art and Shamanism : An Ethnographic Approach|last=Fortis|first=Paolo|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=ProQuest Ebook Central|pages=178-180}}</ref>.  Nuchukana are carved wooden human-like figures. They are used to cure people from illness or to bring back the dead.<ref name=\":0\" /> Although they are a [[mythological]]  practice; these wooden figures hold a sentimental and cultural value that the Kuna people hold near to their hearts. When a person is in need a proper ritual is done involving chanting and [[tobacco]] smoking. The Nuchukana are asked to search for the cause of a person's illness. When the Nuchukana are not being used they are kept in a bundle in the house. The Kuna believe that [[evil spirit]]s will be kept out of the home. For this same reason the Nuchukana figures are respected and sometimes even shown to visitors and friends. Each Nuchukana holds a story or a tale of why it was created and why it is so special. Elder Kuna respect the Nuchukana and treat them as part of the family. It is important for the Kuna to keep Nuchukana sacred\u2014only young girls or elderly grandmothers may wash and clean Nuchukanas. It is possible for some Kuna to prefer a specific Nuchukana, making a special personal connection between a human and a [[wood]]en figure. Nuchukanas are so valuable that they are inherited from generation to generation. Once a Nuchukana wooden figure has [[wear|deteriorated]], it is simply tossed away, sometimes accompanied with a [[chant]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Today, these Nuchukanas can be found in the rural homes of the Guna people, or in local museums that were able to take care of these objects.\n\n==Museums==\nThe best overview of Panamanian culture is found in the Museum of the [[Panama]]nian, in [[Panama City]]. Other views can be found at the Museum of [[History of Panama|Panamanian History]], the Museum of [[Natural Sciences]], the Museum of Religious Colonial Art, the Museum of [[Contemporary Art]], the Museum of the Interoceanic Canal, and the national institutes of culture and music.\n\nA number of museums located in smaller communities throughout Panama's interior strive to preserve numerous aspects of the country's pre-Columbian, colonial and post-independence heritage.  Examples include the Museum of Nationality in Los Santos, located in an original colonial home and exhibiting relics from the region\u2019s pre-Columbian inhabitants, colonial period and nascent struggle for independence from Spain. The Herrera Museum was ranked #2 of six things to do in Chitre by Lonely Planet travelers. The two-story museum includes permanent exhibits covering the pre-Hispanic period, the region\u2019s first mammals, and the contact between the Spanish and the natives.  The main highlight of the second floor is a carefully constructed replica of the burial site of the Indian chief (Cacique) Parita.\n\nAn additional museum will soon be opening in Chitre as part of a unique tourism/residential project currently being developed.  The [http://www.cubitapanama.com/Culture-in-Panama/museum.html Cubit\u00e1 Museum] will explore the variety of cultural influences that have shaped the history, art and folklore of the Azuero Peninsula, and to appreciate the unique and painstakingly crafted work of local artisans.\n\nA scholarly analysis of Panamanian Museums, their history, exhibitions and social, political and economic contexts is available in the 2011 book \"Panamanian Museums and Historical Memory\".<ref>{{cite book|last=S\u00e1nchez Laws|first=Ana Luisa|title=Panamanian Museums and Historical Memory|date=2011|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-85745-240-5|url=http://www.berghahnbooks.com/title.php?rowtag=SanchezLawsPanamanian}}</ref>\n\n== See also == \n* [[Public holidays in Panama]]\n* [[Pollera]], national dress\n* [[Se\u00f1orita Panam\u00e1]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Panama topics}}\n{{Latin America topic|Culture of|Latin American culture}}\n{{Americas topic|Culture of}}\n\n[[Category:Panamanian culture| ]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Panama"}

Practical instructions are helpful, but somebody conducting research must personally be tuned-in to receive signals, interpret them and be surprised at them, as well as tolerate the ambiguous nature of the probing process (and design)\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nCsmMQAACAAJ|title=Design Probes|last=Mattelm\u00e4ki|first=Tuuli|date=2006|publisher=University of Art and Design|isbn=9789515582119|language=en}}</ref>.\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n* It is hard to get scientifically valid information from data that is so subjective.\n* The data generated it not suitable for deep analysis and requirements list.\n* Participants are supposed to reflect upon and be inspired by the probes, but it can be hard to motivate participants doing it, as well as to get them to send the probes back.\n* There is a risk of few returns.\n* The wide variety of applications of and scientific approach to the probes has been criticized by Gaver and his colleagues as a misunderstood desire to rationalize and analyze the probe[s2.]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wf0kdgkB2isC&pg=PA194&dq=%22Cultural+probe%22&hl=en&ei=0WfaTvGaIoOZiAez9OD4Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Cultural%20probe%22&f=false]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wWrqzNdZ5o8C&pg=PA336&dq=%22Cultural+probe%22&hl=en&ei=0WfaTvGaIoOZiAez9OD4Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22Cultural%20probe%22&f=false]\n*[http://www.itu.dk/~kikki/AVID/CulturalProbes.htm]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wf0kdgkB2isC&pg=PA194&dq=%22Cultural+probe%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ug82T_rNJsXkmAWPqfiYAg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22Cultural%20probe%22&f=false]\n\n{{Culture}}\n\n[[Category:Design]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_probe"}

The vast majority of the people live in the eastern region, most within {{convert|160|km|mi}} of [[Asunci\u00f3n]], the capital and largest city, which borders on [[Argentina]] to the south and west. The [[Gran Chaco]] in the north-west, which accounts for about 60% of Paraguayan territory, is home to less than 2% of the population. The Paraguay government encouraged{{when?|date=August 2017}} massive settlement of the vast Gran Chaco.\n\nEthnically, culturally, and socially, Paraguay has one of the most homogeneous populations in South America. About 95% of the people are [[mestizo]] (mixed Spanish and [[Guarani people|Guaran\u00ed]] Native American descent).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pa.html|title=South America :: Paraguay \u2014 The World Factbook - Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Little trace is left of the original Guaran\u00ed culture except the language, which is spoken by 90% of the population. About 75% of all Paraguayans also speak Spanish.

Only 28,000 men and 200,000 women had survived the war, the reason why Paraguay had since then a high rate of illegitimate births. The government pursued a pro-immigration policy in an effort to increase population. Government records indicated that approximately 12,000 immigrants entered the port of Asunci\u00f3n between 1882 and 1907, of that total, almost 9,000 came from Italy, Germany, France, and Spain. Migrants also arrived from neighboring Spanish American countries, especially [[Argentina]].\n\nThe immigrant ethnic groups kept their cultures and languages to some extent, especially Brazilians - known as \"[[Brasiguayos]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://wais.stanford.edu/Brazil/brazil_braziliansinparaguay61501.html|title= BRAZIL: Brazilians in Paraguay|last= Hilton|first= Ronald|date= 2001-06-15 |language= en|access-date= 2017-01-19}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web\n|url= http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Paraguay.html\n|title= Culture of Paraguay - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family\n|website= www.everyculture.com|language= en|access-date= 2017-01-19\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOfficial records gave an imprecise sense of the number of Brazilians who came to the country. According to the 1982 census, 99,000 Brazilians resided in Paraguay. Most{{quantify|date=August 2017}} analysts discounted this figure, however, and contended that between 300,000 and 350,000 Brazilians lived in the eastern border region. \n\nAnalysts also rejected government figures on the number of immigrants from [[South Korea]], Hong Kong and [[Taiwan]]. The 1982 census reported that there were 2,700 Koreans in Paraguay, along with another 1,100 non-Japanese or non-Korean Asian immigrants. The actual number of Koreans and ethnic Chinese, however, was believed{{by whom?|date=August 2017}} to be between 30,000 and 50,000.

The [[Gran Chaco]] in the north-west, which accounts for about 60% of Paraguayan territory, is home to less than 2% of the population.

Only 28,000 men and 200,000 women had survived the war, the reason why Paraguay had since then a high rate of illegitimate births. The government pursued a pro-immigration policy in an effort to increase population. Government records indicated that approximately 12,000 immigrants entered the port of Asunci\u00f3n between 1882 and 1907, of that total, almost 9,000 came from Italy, Germany, France, and Spain. Migrants also arrived from neighboring Spanish American countries, especially [[Argentina]].\n\nThe immigrant ethnic groups kept their cultures and languages to some extent, especially Brazilians - known as \"[[Brasiguayos]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://wais.stanford.edu/Brazil/brazil_braziliansinparaguay61501.html|title= BRAZIL: Brazilians in Paraguay|last= Hilton|first= Ronald|date= 2001-06-15 |language= en|access-date= 2017-01-19}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web\n|url= http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Paraguay.html\n|title= Culture of Paraguay - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family\n|website= www.everyculture.com|language= en|access-date= 2017-01-19\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOfficial records gave an imprecise sense of the number of Brazilians who came to the country. According to the 1982 census, 99,000 Brazilians resided in Paraguay. Most{{quantify|date=August 2017}} analysts discounted this figure, however, and contended that between 300,000 and 350,000 Brazilians lived in the eastern border region. \n\nAnalysts also rejected government figures on the number of immigrants from [[South Korea]], Hong Kong and [[Taiwan]]. The 1982 census reported that there were 2,700 Koreans in Paraguay, along with another 1,100 non-Japanese or non-Korean Asian immigrants. The actual number of Koreans and ethnic Chinese, however, was believed{{by whom?|date=August 2017}} to be between 30,000 and 50,000. Virtually all Koreans and ethnic Chinese lived in [[Ciudad del Este]] or Asunci\u00f3n and played a major role in the importation and sale of electronic goods manufactured in Asia.\n\nParaguay became the site of radical and progressive colonies inspired by political thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

According to the 2001 census there are only 125 Caribs remaining (0.12% of the total population).\n\n==Languages==\nApart from a 114-year period of French occupancy (1649-1763) English has been the country's official language.  However, over time the minority of the population use a colloquial spoken language considered to be either [[English-based creole languages]] or ([[Grenadian Creole English]]) and which is said reflects the African, European and Indian heritage of the nation.<ref>Alleyne, Mervyn C. \"A Linguistic Perspective on the Caribbean\", Latin American Program, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, 1985</ref> \n\nThe Grenadian creoles originally influenced by [[French language|French]], now contain elements from a variety of Grenadian Creole and a little of the African languages. [[Grenadian Creole French]] is mainly spoken in smaller rural areas, but today it can only be heard in a few small pockets of the society. Grenadian Creole French is mainly known as ''[[Patois]]'' and may have similarities to the [[Saint Lucian Creole French]].\n\nIt is believed that the one-time native or indigenous languages were [[I\u00f1eri language|I\u00f1eri]] and [[Karina language|Karina]].\n\n==Religion==\nHistorically the religious makeup of the islands of Grenada covers the period from first European occupation in the 17th century.  This has always been predominantly Christian and largely Roman Catholic (due to the first occupants being French) and from the 1891 census we get a snapshot of the population and its religious proclivities - over half were Roman Catholic (55%), a third were Church of England (36%), others listed were Wesleyan (6%) and Presbyterian (0.88%).\n\nMore recently, according to the 2001 census, 89.1% percent of the population of Grenada is considered [[Christianity|Christian]], 1.5% is non-Christian and 3.6% has no religion or stated \"other\" (5.7%).<ref name=\"2001 census\"/>\n\nRoughly one half of Christians are [[Roman Catholics]] (44.6% of the total population), a reflection of early French influence on the island, and one half are [[Protestant]]. [[Anglicanism]] constitutes the largest Protestant group, with 11.5% of the population. [[Pentecostals]] are the second largest group (11.3%), followed by [[Seventh-day Adventists]] (10.5% of the population).  Other [[Christianity|Christians]] include [[Baptists]] (2.9%), Church of God (2.6%), [[Methodists#Caribbean|Methodists]] (1.8%), [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] (1.6%) [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (1.1%), and [[Brethren Christian]] (0.5%).\n\nThe number of non-Christians is small. These religious groups include the [[Rastafarian Movement]] (1.1% of the population), [[Hinduism in the West Indies|Hinduism]] (0.2%) and [[Muslims]] (0.3%).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{North America in topic|Demographics of}}\n\n[[Category:Demographics of Grenada]]\n[[Category:Grenadian society]]\n", "text_old": "This article is about the '''[[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Grenada]]''', including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.\n\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source:<ref name=\"2001 census\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.caricomstats.org/Files/Publications/NCR%20Reports/Grenada.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200517/http://www.caricomstats.org/Files/Publications/NCR%20Reports/Grenada.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.caribank.org/uploads/2014/12/CGA-Grenada_JANUARY2014_FINAL.pdf</ref>\n|title       = Census population and average annual growth rate\n|percentages = pagr\n|1871 | 37684\n|1881 | 42403\n|1891 | 53209\n|1901 | 63438\n|1911 | 66750\n|1921 | 66302\n|1946 | 72387\n|1960 | 88677\n|1970 | 92775\n|1981 | 89088\n|1991 | 85123\n|2001 | 103137\n|2011 | 105539\n}}\n\n==Population==\n\nAccording to the 2011 census [[Grenada]] has 105,539 inhabitants<ref>http://www.caribank.org/uploads/2014/12/CGA-Grenada_JANUARY2014_FINAL.pdf</ref>.

According to the 2001 census there are only 125 Caribs remaining (0.12% of the total population).\n\n==Languages==\nApart from a 114-year period of French occupancy (1649-1763) English has been the country's official language.  However, over time the minority of the population use a colloquial spoken language considered to be either [[English-based creole languages]] or ([[Grenadian Creole English]]) and which is said reflects the African, European and Indian heritage of the nation.<ref>Alleyne, Mervyn C. \"A Linguistic Perspective on the Caribbean\", Latin American Program, Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, 1985</ref> \n\nThe Grenadian creoles originally influenced by [[French language|French]], now contain elements from a variety of Grenadian Creole and a little of the African languages. [[Grenadian Creole French]] is mainly spoken in smaller rural areas, but today it can only be heard in a few small pockets of the society. Grenadian Creole French is mainly known as ''[[Patois]]'' and may have similarities to the [[Saint Lucian Creole French]].\n\nIt is believed that the one-time native or indigenous languages were [[I\u00f1eri language|I\u00f1eri]] and [[Karina language|Karina]].\n\n==Religion==\nHistorically the religious makeup of the islands of Grenada covers the period from first European occupation in the 17th century.  This has always been predominantly Christian and largely Roman Catholic (due to the first occupants being French) and from the 1891 census we get a snapshot of the population and its religious proclivities - over half were Roman Catholic (55%), a third were Church of England (36%), others listed were Wesleyan (6%) and Presbyterian (0.88%).\n\nMore recently, according to the 2001 census, 89.1% percent of the population of Grenada is considered [[Christianity|Christian]], 1.5% is non-Christian and 3.6% has no religion or stated \"other\" (5.7%).<ref name=\"2001 census\"/>\n\nRoughly one half of Christians are [[Roman Catholics]] (44.6% of the total population), a reflection of early French influence on the island, and one half are [[Protestant]]. [[Anglicanism]] constitutes the largest Protestant group, with 11.5% of the population. [[Pentecostals]] are the second largest group (11.3%), followed by [[Seventh-day Adventists]] (10.5% of the population).  Other [[Christianity|Christians]] include [[Baptists]] (2.9%), Church of God (2.6%), [[Methodists#Caribbean|Methodists]] (1.8%), [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] (1.6%) [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (1.1%), and [[Brethren Christian]] (0.5%).\n\nThe number of non-Christians is small. These religious groups include the [[Rastafarian Movement]] (1.1% of the population), [[Hinduism in the West Indies|Hinduism]] (0.2%) and [[Muslims]] (0.3%).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{North America in topic|Demographics of}}\n\n[[Category:Demographics of Grenada]]\n[[Category:Grenadian society]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Grenada"}

These ideas derived from pre-scientific concepts of [[heredity]] (\"hereditary taint\") with [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] emphasis on biological development through purpose and habit. Degeneration concepts were often associated with authoritarian political attitudes, including [[militarism]] and [[scientific racism]], and a preoccupation with [[Eugenics|eugenics]]. The theory originated in racial concepts of [[ethnicity]], recorded in the writings of such medical scientists as [[Johann Blumenbach]] and [[Robert Knox]]. From the 1850s, it became influential in [[psychiatry]] through the writings of [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel]], and in  [[criminology]] with [[Cesare Lombroso]].<ref>Horn, David G. (2003) ''The Criminal Body: Lombroso and the Anatomy of Deviance'' London and New York: Routledge</ref> By the 1890s, in the work of [[Max Nordau]] and others, degeneration became a more general concept in [[social criticism]]. It also fed into the ideology of [[Ethnic nationalism]], attracting, among others, [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], [[Charles Maurras]] and the ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]''.  [[Alexis Carrel]], a French Nobel Laureate in Medicine, cited national degeneration as a rationale for a eugenics programme in collaborationist [[Vichy France]].\n\nThe meaning of ''degeneration'' was poorly defined, but can be described as an organism's change from a more complex to a simpler, less differentiated form, and is associated with 19th century conceptions of [[Devolution (biology)|biological devolution]]. In scientific usage, the term was reserved for changes occurring at a histological level - i.e. in body tissues. Although rejected by [[Charles Darwin]], the theory's application to the social sciences was supported by some evolutionary biologists, most notably [[Ernst Haeckel]] and [[Ray Lankester]]. As the 19th century wore on, the increasing emphasis on degeneration reflected an anxious [[pessimism]] about the [[wikt:resilient|resilience]] of European civilization and its possible decline and collapse.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe concept of degeneration arose during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the [[industrial revolution]] - a period of profound [[social change]] and a rapidly shifting sense of [[personal identity]]. Several influences were involved.\n\nThe first related to the extreme demographic upheavals, including [[urbanization]], in the early years of the 19th century. The disturbing experience of [[social change]] and urban [[Crowd psychology|crowds]], largely unknown in the agrarian 18th century, was recorded in the journalism of [[William Cobbett]], the novels of [[Charles Dickens]] and in the paintings of [[J M W Turner]]. These changes were also explored by early writers on social psychology, including [[Gustav Le Bon]] and [[Georg Simmel]]. The psychological impact of industrialisation is comprehensively described in [[Humphrey Jennings]]' masterly anthology [[Pandaemonium (history book)|''Pandaemonium 1660 - 1886'']]. Victorian social reformers including [[Edwin Chadwick]], [[Henry Mayhew]] and [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] voiced realistic concerns about the decline of [[public health]] in the urban life of the British working class ([[urban squalor]]), arguing for improved housing and sanitation, access to parks and recreational facilities, an improved diet and a reduction in alcohol intake. These contributions from the public health perspective were discussed by the Scottish physician Sir [[James Cantlie]] in his influential 1885 lecture ''Degeneration Amongst Londoners''. The novel experience of everyday contact with the urban working classes gave rise to a kind of horrified fascination with their perceived reproductive energies which appeared to threaten [[middle class|middle-class]] culture.\n\nSecondly, the [[proto-evolutionary biologist|proto-evolutionary biology]] and transformatist speculations of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and other natural historians\u2014taken together with the [[Georges Cuvier|Baron von Cuvier]]'s theory of extinctions\u2014played an important part in establishing a sense of the unsettled aspects of the natural world. The [[Polygenism|polygenic]] theories of multiple human origins, supported by [[Robert Knox]] in his book ''The Races of Men'' (1850),<ref>Knox, Robert (1850) ''The Races of Men: A Fragment'' London: Renshaw.</ref> were firmly rejected by [[Charles Darwin]] who, following [[James Cowles Prichard]],<ref>Prichard, J.C. (1813) ''Researches into the Physical History of Man'' London: John and Arthur Arch. On page 238, Prichard writes: \"...the primitive stock of men were probably Negroes, and I know of no argument to be set on the other side.\"</ref> generally agreed on a single African origin for the entire human species.\n\nThirdly, the development of world trade and [[colonialism]], the early European experience of [[globalization]], resulted in an awareness of the varieties of cultural expression and the vulnerabilities of Western civilization.\n\nFinally, the growth of historical scholarship in the 18th century, exemplified by [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire]]'' (1776\u20131789), excited a renewed interest in the narratives of historical decline. This resonated uncomfortably with the difficulties of French political life in the post-revolutionary nineteenth century.\n \nDegeneration theory achieved a detailed articulation in [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel]]'s ''Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species'' (1857), a complicated work of clinical commentary from an asylum in Normandy (Saint Yon in [[Rouen]]) which, in the popular imagination at least, coalesced with de [[Gobineau]]'s ''Essay on The Inequality of the Human Races'' (1855). Morel's concept of ''mental degeneration'' - in which he believed that intoxication and addiction in one generation of a family would lead to hysteria, epilepsy, sexual perversions, insanity, learning disability and sterility in subsequent generations - is an example of Lamarckian biological thinking and Morel's medical discussions are reminiscent of the clinical literature surrounding [[syphilis|syphilitic infection]] (''syphilography''). Morel's psychiatric theories were taken up and advocated by his friend [[Philippe Buchez]], and through his political influence became an official doctrine in French legal and administrative medicine.\n\n[[Arthur de Gobineau]] came from an impoverished family (with a domineering and adulterous mother) which claimed an aristocratic ancestry; he was a failed author of historical romances and his wife was widely rumored to be a Cr\u00e9ole from [[Martinique]]. De Gobineau nevertheless argued that the course of history and civilization was largely determined by ethnic factors, and that [[interracial marriage]] (\"[[miscegenation]]\") resulted in social chaos. De Gobineau built a successful career in the French diplomatic service, living for extended periods in Iran and Brazil, and spent his later years travelling through Europe, lamenting his mistreatment at the hands of his wife and daughters. He died of a heart attack in 1882 while boarding a train in Turin. His work was well received in German translation\u2014not least by the composer [[Richard Wagner]]\u2014and the leading German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] later wrote extensively on the dangers posed by degeneration to the German people. De Gobineau's writings exerted an enormous influence on the thinkers antecedent to the [[Third Reich]] - although they are curiously free of anti-Semitic prejudice. Quite different historical factors inspired the Italian [[Cesare Lombroso]] in his work on criminal anthropology with the notion of ''atavistic retrogression'', probably shaped by his experiences as a young army doctor in [[Calabria]] during the  ''risorgimento''.\n\nIn England, degeneration received a scientific formulation from [[Ray Lankester]] whose detailed discussions of the biology of [[parasitism]] were hugely influential; and the poor physical condition of many recruits for the second [[Boer War|South African war]] (1899-1902) caused alarm in British government circles. The psychiatrist [[Henry Maudsley]] initially argued that degenerate family lines would die out with little social consequence, but later became more pessimistic about the effects of degeneration on the general population;<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tMTJG0E4PPMC&dq Keeping America Sane: Psychiatry and Eugenics in the United States and Canada, 1880-1940] Pg 81</ref>Maudsley also warned against the use of the term \"degeneration\" in a vague and indiscriminate way. British anxieties about the perils of degeneration found legislative expression in the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913]] which had the strong support of [[Winston Churchill]], then a senior member of the Liberal government.\n\nIn the ''[[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]]'' period, [[Max Nordau]] scored an unexpected success with his bestselling ''[[Degeneration (Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1892). [[Sigmund Freud]] met Nordau in 1885 while he was studying in Paris and was notably unimpressed by him and hostile to the degeneration concept. Degeneration fell from popular and fashionable favor around the time of the First World War, although some of its preoccupations persisted in the writings of the [[eugenicists]] and [[social Darwinists]] (for example, [[R.

With the taxonomic mind-set of natural historians, they drew attention to the different ethnic groupings of mankind, and raised general enquiries about their relationships, with the idea that racial groupings could be explained by environmental effects on a common ancestral stock. This pre-Darwinian belief in the heritability of acquired characteristics does not accord with modern genetics. An alternative view of the multiple origins of different racial groups, called \"polygenic theories\", was also rejected by [[Charles Darwin]], who favored explanations in terms of differential geographic migrations from a single, probably African, population.\n    \nThe theory of degeneration found its first detailed presentation in the writings of [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel]] (1809\u20131873), especially in his ''Trait\u00e9 des d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rescences physiques, intellectuelles et morales de l'esp\u00e8ce humaine'' (''Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species'') (1857). This book was published two years ''before'' Darwin's ''Origin of Species''. Morel was a highly regarded psychiatrist, the very successful superintendent of the Rouen asylum for almost twenty years and a fastidious recorder of the family histories of his variously disabled patients. Through the details of these family histories, Morel discerned an hereditary line of defective parents infected by pollutants and stimulants; a second generation liable to epilepsy, neurasthenia, sexual deviations and hysteria; a third generation prone to insanity; and a final generation doomed to congenital idiocy and sterility. In 1857, Morel proposed a theory of ''hereditary degeneracy'', bringing together environmental and hereditary elements in an uncompromisingly pre-Darwinian mix. Morel's contribution was further developed by [[Valentin Magnan]] (1835\u20131916), who stressed the role of alcohol\u2014particularly ''[[absinthe]]''\u2014in the generation of psychiatric disorders.\n\nMorel's ideas were greatly extended by the Italian medical scientist [[Cesare Lombroso]] (1835\u20131909) whose work was defended and translated into English by [[Havelock Ellis]]. In his ''L'uomo delinquente'' (1876), Lombroso outlined a comprehensive natural history of the socially deviant person and detailed the ''stigmata'' of the person who was born to be ''criminally insane''. These included a low, sloping forehead, hard and shifty eyes, large, handle-shaped ears, a flattened or upturned nose, a forward projection of the jaw, irregular teeth, prehensile toes and feet, long simian arms and a scanty beard and baldness. Lombroso also listed the features of the degenerate mentality, supposedly released by the disinhibition of the primitive neurological centres. These included apathy, the loss of moral sense, a tendency to impulsiveness or self-doubt, an unevenness of mental qualities such as unusual memory or aesthetic abilities, a tendency to mutism or to verbosity, excessive originality, preoccupation with the self, mystical interpretations placed on simple facts or perceptions, the abuse of symbolic meanings and the magical use of words, or ''mantras''. Lombroso, with his concept of ''atavistic retrogression'', suggested an evolutionary reversion, complementing ''hereditary degeneracy'', and his work in the medical examination of criminals in Turin resulted in his theory of [[criminal anthropology]]\u2014a constitutional notion of abnormal personality that was not actually supported by his own scientific investigations. In his later life, Lombroso developed an obsession with [[spiritualism]], engaging with the spirit of his long dead mother.\n\nIn 1892, [[Max Nordau]], an expatriate Hungarian living in Paris, published his extraordinary bestseller ''Degeneration'', which greatly extended the concepts of B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel and Cesare Lombroso (to whom he dedicated the book) to the entire civilization of western Europe, and transformed the medical connotations of degeneration into a generalized ''cultural criticism''. Adopting some of [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]]'s neurological vocabulary, Nordau identified a number of weaknesses in contemporary [[Western culture]] which he characterized in terms of ''ego-mania'', i.e., [[narcissism]] and [[hysteria]]. He also emphasized the importance of ''fatigue'', ''enervation'' and ''ennui''. Nordau, horrified by the anti-Semitism surrounding the [[Dreyfus affair]], devoted his later years to [[Zionism|Zionist politics]]. Degeneration theory fell from favour around the time of the First World War because of an improved understanding of the mechanisms of genetics as well as the increasing vogue for psychoanalytic thinking. However, some of its preoccupations lived on in the world of [[eugenics]] and [[social Darwinism]]. It is notable that the [[Nazi]] attack on western liberal society was largely couched in terms of [[degenerate art]] with its associations of racial [[miscegenation]] and fantasies of [[racial purity]]\u2014and included as its target almost all modernist cultural experiment.\n\nThe role of women in furthering development of the concept of degeneration was reviewed by Anne McClintock, a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin, who found that women who were ambiguously placed on the so called \"imperial divide\" (nurses, nannies, governesses, prostitutes and servants) happened to serve as boundary markers and mediators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mcclintock|first=Anne|date=2013-10-01|title=Imperial Leather|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203699546|doi=10.4324/9780203699546}}</ref> These women were tasked with the purification and maintenance of boundaries and what was seen as \"inferior\" places in society they held at the time.\n\n==Degenerationist devices==\n{{See also|Decadent movement}}\n[[File:F\u00e9licien Rops - Pornokrat\u00e8s - 1878.jpg|thumb|''[[Pornocrates]]'' by [[F\u00e9licien Rops]] (1878)]]\nTowards the close of the 19th century, in the [[Fin de si\u00e8cle|fin-de-si\u00e8cle]] period, something of an obsession with decline, descent and degeneration invaded the European creative imagination, partly fuelled by widespread misconceptions of Darwinian evolutionary theory.

These ideas derived from pre-scientific concepts of [[heredity]] (\"hereditary taint\") with [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] emphasis on biological development through purpose and habit. Degeneration concepts were often associated with authoritarian political attitudes, including [[militarism]] and [[scientific racism]], and a preoccupation with [[Eugenics|eugenics]]. The theory originated in racial concepts of [[ethnicity]], recorded in the writings of such medical scientists as [[Johann Blumenbach]] and [[Robert Knox]]. From the 1850s, it became influential in [[psychiatry]] through the writings of [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel]], and in  [[criminology]] with [[Cesare Lombroso]]<ref>Horn, David G. (2003) ''The Criminal Body: Lombroso and the Anatomy of Deviance'' London and New York: Routledge</ref>. By the 1890s, in the work of [[Max Nordau]] and others, degeneration became a more general concept in [[social criticism]]. It also fed into the ideology of [[Ethnic nationalism]], attracting, among others, [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], [[Charles Maurras]] and the ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]''.  [[Alexis Carrel]], a French Nobel Laureate in Medicine, cited national degeneration as a rationale for a eugenics programme in collaborationist [[Vichy France]].\n\nThe meaning of ''degeneration'' was poorly defined, but can be described as an organism's change from a more complex to a simpler, less differentiated form, and is associated with 19th century conceptions of [[Devolution (biology)|biological devolution]]. In scientific usage, the term was reserved for changes occurring at a histological level - i.e. in body tissues. Although rejected by [[Charles Darwin]], the theory's application to the social sciences was supported by some evolutionary biologists, most notably [[Ernst Haeckel]] and [[Ray Lankester]]. As the 19th century wore on, the increasing emphasis on degeneration reflected an anxious [[pessimism]] about the [[wikt:resilient|resilience]] of European civilization and its possible decline and collapse.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe concept of degeneration arose during the European [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] and the [[industrial revolution]] - a period of profound [[social change]] and a rapidly shifting sense of [[personal identity]]. Several influences were involved.\n\nThe first related to the extreme demographic upheavals, including [[urbanization]], in the early years of the 19th century. The disturbing experience of [[social change]] and urban [[Crowd psychology|crowds]], largely unknown in the agrarian 18th century, was recorded in the journalism of [[William Cobbett]], the novels of [[Charles Dickens]] and in the paintings of [[J M W Turner]]. These changes were also explored by early writers on social psychology, including [[Gustav Le Bon]] and [[Georg Simmel]]. The psychological impact of industrialisation is comprehensively described in [[Humphrey Jennings]]' masterly anthology [[Pandaemonium (history book)|''Pandaemonium 1660 - 1886'']]. Victorian social reformers including [[Edwin Chadwick]], [[Henry Mayhew]] and [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] voiced realistic concerns about the decline of [[public health]] in the urban life of the British working class ([[urban squalor]]), arguing for improved housing and sanitation, access to parks and recreational facilities, an improved diet and a reduction in alcohol intake. These contributions from the public health perspective were discussed by the Scottish physician Sir [[James Cantlie]] in his influential 1885 lecture ''Degeneration Amongst Londoners''. The novel experience of everyday contact with the urban working classes gave rise to a kind of horrified fascination with their perceived reproductive energies which appeared to threaten [[middle class|middle-class]] culture.\n\nSecondly, the [[proto-evolutionary biologist|proto-evolutionary biology]] and transformatist speculations of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and other natural historians\u2014taken together with the [[Georges Cuvier|Baron von Cuvier]]'s theory of extinctions\u2014played an important part in establishing a sense of the unsettled aspects of the natural world. The [[Polygenism|polygenic]] theories of multiple human origins, supported by [[Robert Knox]] in his book ''The Races of Men'' (1850),<ref>Knox, Robert (1850) ''The Races of Men: A Fragment'' London: Renshaw.</ref> were firmly rejected by [[Charles Darwin]] who, following [[James Cowles Prichard]],<ref>Prichard, J.C. (1813) ''Researches into the Physical History of Man'' London: John and Arthur Arch. On page 238, Prichard writes: \"...the primitive stock of men were probably Negroes, and I know of no argument to be set on the other side.\"</ref> generally agreed on a single African origin for the entire human species.\n\nThirdly, the development of world trade and [[colonialism]], the early European experience of [[globalization]], resulted in an awareness of the varieties of cultural expression and the vulnerabilities of Western civilization.\n\nFinally, the growth of historical scholarship in the 18th century, exemplified by [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire]]'' (1776\u20131789), excited a renewed interest in the narratives of historical decline. This resonated uncomfortably with the difficulties of French political life in the post-revolutionary nineteenth century.\n \nDegeneration theory achieved a detailed articulation in [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel]]'s ''Treatise on Degeneration of the Human Species'' (1857), a complicated work of clinical commentary from an asylum in Normandy (Saint Yon in [[Rouen]]) which, in the popular imagination at least, coalesced with de [[Gobineau]]'s ''Essay on The Inequality of the Human Races'' (1855). Morel's concept of ''mental degeneration'' - in which he believed that intoxication and addiction in one generation of a family would lead to hysteria, epilepsy, sexual perversions, insanity, learning disability and sterility in subsequent generations - is an example of Lamarckian biological thinking and Morel's medical discussions are reminiscent of the clinical literature surrounding [[syphilis|syphilitic infection]] (''syphilography''). Morel's psychiatric theories were taken up and advocated by his friend [[Philippe Buchez]], and through his political influence became an official doctrine in French legal and administrative medicine.\n\n[[Arthur de Gobineau]] came from an impoverished family (with a domineering and adulterous mother) which claimed an aristocratic ancestry; he was a failed author of historical romances and his wife was widely rumored to be a Cr\u00e9ole from [[Martinique]]. De Gobineau nevertheless argued that the course of history and civilization was largely determined by ethnic factors, and that [[interracial marriage]] (\"[[miscegenation]]\") resulted in social chaos. De Gobineau built a successful career in the French diplomatic service, living for extended periods in Iran and Brazil, and spent his later years travelling through Europe, lamenting his mistreatment at the hands of his wife and daughters. He died of a heart attack in 1882 while boarding a train in Turin. His work was well received in German translation\u2014not least by the composer [[Richard Wagner]]\u2014and the leading German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] later wrote extensively on the dangers posed by degeneration to the German people. De Gobineau's writings exerted an enormous influence on the thinkers antecedent to the [[Third Reich]] - although they are curiously free of anti-Semitic prejudice. Quite different historical factors inspired the Italian [[Cesare Lombroso]] in his work on criminal anthropology with the notion of ''atavistic retrogression'', probably shaped by his experiences as a young army doctor in [[Calabria]] during the  ''risorgimento''.\n\nIn England, degeneration received a scientific formulation from [[Ray Lankester]] whose detailed discussions of the biology of [[parasitism]] were hugely influential; and the poor physical condition of many recruits for the second [[Boer War|South African war]] (1899-1902) caused alarm in British government circles. The psychiatrist [[Henry Maudsley]] initially argued that degenerate family lines would die out with little social consequence, but later became more pessimistic about the effects of degeneration on the general population;<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tMTJG0E4PPMC&dq Keeping America Sane: Psychiatry and Eugenics in the United States and Canada, 1880-1940] Pg 81</ref>Maudsley also warned against the use of the term \"degeneration\" in a vague and indiscriminate way. British anxieties about the perils of degeneration found legislative expression in the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913]] which had the strong support of [[Winston Churchill]], then a senior member of the Liberal government.\n\nIn the ''[[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]]'' period, [[Max Nordau]] scored an unexpected success with his bestselling ''[[Degeneration (Nordau)|Degeneration]]'' (1892). [[Sigmund Freud]] met Nordau in 1885 while he was studying in Paris and was notably unimpressed by him and hostile to the degeneration concept. Degeneration fell from popular and fashionable favor around the time of the First World War, although some of its preoccupations persisted in the writings of the [[eugenicists]] and [[social Darwinists]] (for example, [[R. Austin Freeman]]; [[Anthony Ludovici]]; [[Rolf Gardiner]]; and see also [[Dennis Wheatley]]'s ''Letter to posterity''). [[Oswald Spengler]]'s ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' (1919) captured something of the degenerationist spirit in the aftermath of the war.\n\n==Selected quotes==\n{{quotation|   \"The word ''degenerate'', when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same intrinsic value as it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins, continual adulterations having gradually affected the quality of that blood....in fact, the man of a decadent time, the ''degenerate man'' properly so-called, is a different being from the racial point of view, from the heroes of the great ages....I think I am right in concluding that the human race in all its branches has a secret repulsion from the crossing of blood....\" [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1855) ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races.''|}} {{quotation| \"When under any kind of noxious influence an organism becomes debilitated, its successors will not resemble the healthy, normal type of the species, with capacities for development, but will form a new sub-species, which, like all others, possesses the capacity of transmitting to its offspring, in a continuously increasing degree, its peculiarities, these being morbid deviations from the normal form - gaps in development, malformations and infirmities...\" [[B\u00e9n\u00e9dict Morel]] (1857) ''Treatise on Degeneration.''|}} {{quotation| \"...Any new set of conditions which renders a species' food and safety very easily obtained, seems to lead to degeneration....\" [[Ray Lankester]] (1880) ''Degeneration: A Chapter in Darwinism.''|}}\n{{quotation| \"We stand now in the midst of a severe mental epidemic; of a sort of black death of degeneration and hysteria, and it is natural that we should ask anxiously on all sides: 'What is to come next ?' \" [[Max Nordau]] (1892) ''Degeneration''.|}}   {{quotation| \"It has become the fashion to regard any symptom which is not obviously due to trauma or infection as a sign of degeneracy....this being so, it may well be asked whether an attribution of \"degeneracy\" is of any value, or adds anything to our knowledge...\" [[Sigmund Freud]] (1905) ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality.''|}}\n\n==Development of the degeneration concept==\n\nThe earliest uses of the term ''degeneration'' can be found in the writings of [[Blumenbach]] and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] at the end of the 18th century, when these early writers on natural history considered scientific approaches to the human species.

[[Joseph Conrad]] alludes to degeneration theory in his treatment of political radicalism in the 1907 novel ''The Secret Agent''.\n\nIn her influential study ''The Gothic Body'',<ref>Hurley, Kelly (1996) ''The Gothic Body: Sexuality, Materialism and Degeneration at the Fin-de-si\u00e8cle'' Cambridge and London: Cambridge University Press</ref> Kelly Hurley draws attention to the literary device of the ''[[abhuman]]'' as a representation of damaged personal identity, and to lesser-known authors in the field, including [[Richard Marsh (author)|Richard Marsh]] (1857-1915), author of ''[[The Beetle (novel)|The Beetle]]'' (1897), and [[William Hope Hodgson]] (1877\u20131918), author of ''[[The Boats of the Glen Carrig]]'', ''[[The House on the Borderland]]'' and ''[[The Night Land]]''. In 1897, [[Bram Stoker]] published ''[[Dracula]]'', an enormously influential Gothic novel featuring the parasitic vampire Count Dracula in an extended exercise of reversed imperialism. Unusually, Stoker makes explicit reference to the writings of Lombroso and Nordau in the course of the novel.<ref>Subotsky, Fiona (2019) ''Dracula for Doctors: Medical Facts and Gothic Fantasies'' Cambridge University Press/The Royal College of Psychiatrists</ref> [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s Sherlock Holmes stories include a host of degenerationist [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], perhaps best illustrated (drawing on the ideas of [[Serge Voronoff]]) in ''[[The Adventure of the Creeping Man]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Behavioral sink]]\n* [[Decadence]]\n* [[Declinism]]\n* [[Devolution (biology)|Devolution]]\n* [[Dysgenics]]\n* [[Human extinction]]\n* ''[[Idiocracy]]''\n* [[Last man]]\n* \"[[The Marching Morons]]\"\n* [[Societal collapse]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|last1=Lawrence|first1=Christopher|title=Degeneration|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2810%2960425-4/fulltext|website=The Lancet|accessdate=4 August 2014|year=2010}}\n* [http://www.mith.demon.co.uk/NORD.html Degeneration, Nordau and Nietzsche]\n{{Culture}}\n\n[[Category:Bioethics]]\n[[Category:History of psychiatry]]\n[[Category:History of psychology]]\n[[Category:History of mental health]]\n[[Category:Lamarckism]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneration_theory"}
