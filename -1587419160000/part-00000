It is surmised that the Peraltas or perhaps one of their ranch hands ([[cowboy|vaquero]]s) had seen local indigenous ([[Ohlone]]) structures along the creek similar to those in other parts of [[New Spain]] which were called ''temescalli''.\n\nTemescal has long been an important junction of several principal thoroughfares: Telegraph, Claremont, and [[Shattuck Avenue]]s, and 51st Street.[[Image:Temescalpool.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Temescal Pool on 45th St. in Oakland]]\n\nThe earliest telegraph wire from Oakland to Sacramento went through the area, up Claremont Avenue and over the hills at Claremont Canyon. Temescal was the site of agriculture, cattle grazing and greenhouses when, in the 1890s, an opera house was built in parkland north of the creek crossing at 51st street. The area grew and was developed into [[Idora Park]], the earliest \"trolley park\" in the East Bay. In 1929 the amusement park was closed and was razed in 1930. A plan to build mid-rise apartment blocks called the Midtown District fell through, and a tract of [[storybook houses]] was built on the site between 1930 and 1934. It is reported to be the first development in the American west with underground utilities.\n\nUntil the early 20th century, a wide wooden bridge spanned [[Temescal Creek (Northern California)|Temescal Creek]], carrying both road (Telegraph Avenue) and railroad tracks.\n\nThe [[horsecar]] line to the [[University of California]] along today's Telegraph Avenue (then called Humboldt Avenue in Oakland and Choate in Berkeley) operated out of a horse barn at 51st and Telegraph. When the horsecar was replaced by electric [[streetcar]]s, the horse barn was replaced by a carbarn. The carbarn became the Western Carhouse of the [[Key System]]'s streetcar division, the East Bay Street Railways. When the streetcars ceased operation in 1948, the car barn was remodeled to become ''Vern's'' market. Vern's closed in the 1970s and the building sat vacant for years. Eventually it was demolished and replaced by a strip mall, including a Walgreens store.\n\n[[Image:Temescal03102006.JPG|thumbnail|250px|right|The Kingfish Cafe and Pub, a popular bar in Temescal]]\n\n==Temescal Tool Lending Library==\nTemescal is home to one of the few tool-lending libraries in the Bay Area\u2014indeed, in the U.S. (The [[Berkeley Public Library]] also has a tool-lending library at their nearby South Branch.) The Temescal branch of the [[Oakland Public Library]] operates this facility, which lends tools, free of charge, to library patrons for repairs and home-improvement projects.

Eventually it was demolished and replaced by a strip mall, including a Walgreens store.\n\n[[Image:Temescal03102006.JPG|thumbnail|250px|right|The Kingfish Cafe and Pub, a popular bar in Temescal]]\n\n==Temescal Tool Lending Library==\nTemescal is home to one of the few tool-lending libraries in the Bay Area\u2014indeed, in the U.S. (The [[Berkeley Public Library]] also has a tool-lending library at their nearby South Branch.)

The battle was fought against the background of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the collapse of government in Haiti in the aftermath of the [[Haitian Revolution]] eight years earlier. After the French had been expelled from Haiti in 1804, the newly independent nation was first ruled by [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who was murdered in 1806 and replaced by two of his advisors, [[Henri Christophe]] and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]]. These rulers divided the country between them and in the confused political situation that followed a number of minor fiefdoms appeared, including one led by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Maximilien Borgella in the south-west of the island called [[Sud (department)|Sud]]. The small [[Haitian Navy]] defected to Borgella, who crewed the vessels with a collection of sailors from various countries, led by a notorious privateer named Gaspard.\n\nStationed off Haiti was the British frigate [[HMS Southampton (1757)|HMS ''Southampton'']] under Captain [[James Lucas Yeo|Sir James Lucas Yeo]], tasked with observing the political situation but with orders not to interfere in the intermittent conflict between Christophe and P\u00e9tion. Yeo's orders did not include Borgella's ships and Yeo reasoned that the Haitian flagship, the large frigate [[French frigate F\u00e9licit\u00e9 (1785)|''Heureuse R\u00e9union'']] (recently renamed from ''Am\u00e9thyste'' and often reported under its former name), presented a serious threat to international trade in the region.\n\nSailing to intercept the Haitian ship, Yeo discovered her in the Gulf of [[L\u00e9ogane]] and ordered Gaspard to surrender. The Haitian refused, and the frigates exchanged shots at 06:30. The superior seamanship and discipline on ''Southampton'' prevented Gaspard from boarding the British ship with his greater numbers and within half an hour ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' was dismasted and battered. At 07:45 the Haitian ship surrendered, Yeo depositing the crew ashore and bringing ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' to [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]]. At Jamaica, his actions were approved by his superiors and ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'', renamed ''Am\u00e9thyste'', was returned to Henri Christophe.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Caribbean Sea]] was initially an important theatre of naval conflict, as ships operating from the various French, British, Spanish and Dutch colonies preyed on enemy trade. During 1809 and 1810 however, the [[Royal Navy]] launched a series of co-ordinated [[amphibious operation]]s that eliminated the French and Dutch colonies and brought the conflict in the Caribbean to an end.<ref name=\"RG79\"/> With the threat of attacks on British trade in the region significantly reduced, the Royal Navy correspondingly reduced their presence in the Caribbean and the remaining British ships were distributed to observe trouble spots in the region, which in 1812 included the independent nation of [[Haiti]].<ref name=\"RG80\">Gardiner, p. 80</ref>\n\nHaiti had won its independence from France in 1804, the first Caribbean nation to do so. The Haitians had fought a lengthy and bloody war against the French known as the [[Haitian Revolution]], in which armies of former slaves led by [[Toussaint Louverture]] and then [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]] succeeded in driving the French into their fortified ports and then systematically eliminating their enclaves.<ref name=\"DC191\">Chandler, p. 191</ref> With the start of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803, French reinforcements for the garrison on Haiti were delayed and intercepted by the British Royal Navy, who blockaded the island and took the surrenders of the last garrisons in 1804, removing them and their dependents to prevent a massacre.<ref name=\"WJ4:209\">James, Vol. 4, p. 209</ref> Dessalines rapidly established himself as monarch of Haiti, but his reign was cut short in 1806 when his closest advisors, [[Henri Christophe]] and [[Alexandre P\u00e9tion]] organised his assassination. Assuming control of Haiti, Christophe laid claim to the northern part of the country and P\u00e9tion the south, the two sides waging a constant low-level civil war during the next decade.<ref name=\"RW244\">Woodman, p. 244</ref> Many minor rulers sprang up during this period, especially in the south, where P\u00e9tion gave parcels of land for his followers to establish their own private fiefdoms. One such warlord was J\u00e9r\u00f4me Maximilien Borgella, who took over command of a small state in the region of [[L\u00e9ogane]] following the death of its ruler, [[Andr\u00e9 Rigaud]].<ref name=\"WJ6:76\"/>\n\nIn early 1809, the French sent a number of reinforcement convoys to their blockaded colonies in the hope of strengthening the garrisons before the British invasions began. Many ships, including four frigates, were lost in these missions and few reached their destinations successfully. Among these failed attempts was [[Troude's expedition to the Caribbean]], which arrived in April 1809 at the [[\u00celes des Saintes]]. Finding that [[Guadeloupe]] was the only surviving colony, [[Amable Troude]] intended to anchor at [[Basse-Terre]] and unload his supplies, but was blockaded in the \u00celes des Saintes by a British squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane|Sir Alexander Cochrane]].<ref name=\"RG79\">Gardiner, p. 79</ref> Attempting to break out on 14 April, Troude led his main squadron northwest towards [[Puerto Rico]] while two ''[[en fl\u00fbte]]'' frigates slipped out northeast to Basse-Terre, arriving safely. Troude's squadron was defeated on 17 April, but the frigates [[French frigate F\u00e9licit\u00e9 (1785)|''F\u00e9licit\u00e9'']] and [[HMS Furieuse (1809)|''Furieuse'']] remained at Basse-Terre until 14 June, when they attempted to break out and return to France, laden with trade goods. The British blockade squadron were soon in pursuit and on 18 June the frigate [[HMS Latona (1781)|HMS ''Latona'']] captured ''F\u00e9licit\u00e9'' without a fight.<ref name=\"WJ5:165\">James, Vol. 5, p. 165</ref> ''Furieuse'' was captured a month later in the North Atlantic. ''F\u00e9licit\u00e9'' was 24&nbsp;years old and was therefore considered too antiquated for commissioning in the Royal Navy; instead she was sold to Henri Christophe to form the nucleus of the new Haitian Navy under the name ''Am\u00e9thyste''.<ref name=\"WLC500\">Clowes, p. 500</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nAt some point in January 1812 the Haitian Navy defected, for reasons unknown, from Christophe to Borgella.<ref name=\"WJ6:76\"/> Borgella placed a noted French [[privateer]] named Gaspard in command of the squadron, which included the frigate ''Am\u00e9thyste''  (renamed ''Heureuse R\u00e9union''), a [[corvette]] and a [[brig]]. Gaspard then armed ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' with 44 [[cannon]], took on board a motley crew of over 600 men, a mixture of Haitian, French, American and other nationalities, and began cruising in the [[Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve]].<ref name=\"WLC501\">Clowes, p. 501</ref> The British observer off Haiti at this time was Captain [[James Lucas Yeo|Sir James Lucas Yeo]] in the frigate [[HMS Southampton (1757)|HMS ''Southampton'']], under strict orders to respect the flags of Christophe and P\u00e9tion, but not those of the minor warlords that had emerged along the coast. On 2 January word reached him at [[Port au Prince]] of Gaspard's movements and he immediately sailed to intercept him, concerned that if Gaspard was allowed to take his powerful squadron out of Haitian waters he might begin attacks on merchant ships regardless of nationality.<ref name=\"WJ6:76\">James, Vol. 6, p. 76</ref>\n\nAt 06:00 on 3 February, Yeo discovered Gaspard's ships at anchor to the south of the island of Guanaboa and demanded that Gaspard come aboard ''Southampton'' with his [[Ship commissioning|commissioning papers]], to establish under whose authority Gaspard commanded the warship.<ref name=\"WLC500\"/> The Haitian captain refused, but sent aboard his first lieutenant with a note purported to be from Borgella, signed \"Borgellat, general in chief of the south of Hayti\". As Borgella had no authority to commission warships, Yeo ordered the lieutenant to tell Gaspard that his ships must submit to ''Southampton'' and be taken to [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]], where their ownership could be established by the naval authorities. He would have five minutes to consider the proposal.<ref name=\"WJ6:77\">James, Vol. 6, p. 77</ref> A British officer accompanied the Haitian lieutenant back to ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' for Gaspard's answer, and was informed within three minutes that Gaspard had no intention of submitting to the British ship. He was also told that should Yeo be intent on fighting the Haitian ship then he should indicate it with a bow gun fired ahead of ''Heureuse R\u00e9union''. Returning to ''Southampton'' at 06:30, the lieutenant relayed the message and the bow gun was fired, followed a few seconds later by a full [[broadside]] from ''Southampton''.<ref name=\"WJ6:77\"/>\n\n''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' responded to the cannonade in kind. During the engagement, Gaspard repeatedly attempted to board ''Southampton'', where his vastly superior numbers could overwhelm the British crew. Yeo was aware of his enemy's intentions, and repeatedly manoeuvered out of the way, his more disciplined and agile vessel easily able to remain out of contact with the overloaded Haitian ship.<ref name=\"WJ6:77\"/> Within half an hour the highly efficient gunners on ''Southampton'' had knocked down the main and mizen masts on ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'', leaving her unable to manoeuvre and vulnerable to repeated pounding at close range. Despite the severe damage the Haitian ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship.<ref name=\"RW245\">Woodman, p. 245</ref> The two smaller Haitian vessels did not support the frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near [[Petit Go\u00e2ve]] to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' to discover whether or not she had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person who gave the surrender is not known.<ref name=\"WLC501\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs ''Southampton'' stopped firing, the remaining masts of the Haitian ship fell overboard. Casualties on ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' were immense: of the 600\u2013700 crew, 105 were dead and 120 wounded, the latter including Gaspard, who subsequently died of his injuries. Yeo's loss was one man killed and ten wounded, from a crew of 212.<ref name=\"WJ6:78\">James, Vol. 6, p. 78</ref> Seeking to rid himself of so many prisoners, Yeo landed most of them at Maraguana before sailing to Port au Prince, where the rest were landed and temporary [[jury masts]] were fitted to ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' for the journey to Jamaica. The British retained 20 prisoners for trial at Port Royal.<ref name=\"WJ6:78\"/> ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' was repaired at Jamaica and subsequently restored to Christophe under the name ''Am\u00e9thyste'', returning to Haitian service. Yeo's action in attacking the Haitian ship, although not officially sanctioned by his commanding officer beforehand, was commended.<ref name=\"WLC501\"/>\n\nThe Caribbean rose in importance again later in 1812, with the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the [[United States]]. American privateers threatened British trade routes and Royal Navy ships were sent out to defeat them, including ''Southampton'', which was wrecked in the [[Bahamas]] during an anti-privateer patrol in November 1812.<ref name=\"TG345\">Grocott, p. 345</ref> There were no further significant actions in the region during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the presence of Royal Navy patrols deterred any large scale French or American operations in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"RW245\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Chandler\n | first = David\n | authorlink = David G.

Despite the severe damage the Haitian ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship.<ref name=\"RW245\">Woodman, p. 245</ref> The two smaller Haitian vessels did not support the frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near [[Petit Go\u00e2ve]] to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' to discover whether or not she had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person who gave the surrender is not known.<ref name=\"WLC501\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAs ''Southampton'' stopped firing, the remaining masts of the Haitian ship fell overboard. Casualties on ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' were immense: of the 600\u2013700 crew, 105 were dead and 120 wounded, the latter including Gaspard, who subsequently died of his injuries. Yeo's loss was one man killed and ten wounded, from a crew of 212.<ref name=\"WJ6:78\">James, Vol. 6, p. 78</ref> Seeking to rid himself of so many prisoners, Yeo landed most of them at Maraguana before sailing to Port au Prince, where the rest were landed and temporary [[jury masts]] were fitted to ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' for the journey to Jamaica. The British retained 20 prisoners for trial at Port Royal.<ref name=\"WJ6:78\"/> ''Heureuse R\u00e9union'' was repaired at Jamaica and subsequently restored to Christophe under the name ''Am\u00e9thyste'', returning to Haitian service. Yeo's action in attacking the Haitian ship, although not officially sanctioned by his commanding officer beforehand, was commended.<ref name=\"WLC501\"/>\n\nThe Caribbean rose in importance again later in 1812, with the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]] between Britain and the [[United States]]. American privateers threatened British trade routes and Royal Navy ships were sent out to defeat them, including ''Southampton'', which was wrecked in the [[Bahamas]] during an anti-privateer patrol in November 1812.<ref name=\"TG345\">Grocott, p. 345</ref> There were no further significant actions in the region during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the presence of Royal Navy patrols deterred any large scale French or American operations in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"RW245\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Chandler\n | first = David\n | authorlink = David G.

It is located on a plot bounded by [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]] to the west, Cedar Street and the [[World Trade Center (2001\u2013present)|World Trade Center]] to the north, [[130 Cedar Street]] to the east, and [[Albany Street (Manhattan)|Albany Street]] to the south.\n\n90 West Street was designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], with [[Gunvald Aus]] and Burt Harrison as structural engineers, and John Peirce as general contractor. It was erected for the West Street Improvement Corporation, led by transportation magnate Howard Carroll.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guide to Civil Engineering Projects In and Around New York City |edition=2nd |publisher=Metropolitan Section, American Society of Civil Engineers |year=2009 |page=108}}</ref> The building's [[Gothic revival|Gothic]] styling and ornamentation served to emphasize its height. The design combined elements of the three-section \"classical column\" arrangement of 19th-century buildings with the \"romantic tower\" of Gilbert's later structures such as the [[Woolworth Building]]. Its waterfront site necessitated the installation of [[pilings]] deep into the ground. Other features included a [[architectural terracotta|terracotta]] facade with [[granite]] at the two-story base, as well as terracotta fireproofing inside the building.\n\n90 West Street was built in 1905\u20131907 as an office building called the West Street Building. \"The Garret Restaurant\", located on the structure's top floors, was marketed as being the highest restaurant in the world. The building underwent numerous ownership changes in the 20th century, and was known after its long-term owner, Brady Security and Realty Corporation, during the middle of the century. Following the [[collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse]] of the adjacent [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], the West Street Building was severely damaged. The building was subsequently refurbished extensively and it reopened as a residential building called 90 West in 2005.\n\n90 West Street's design was widely praised when it was originally completed. The building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2007, and was designated a city landmark by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1998.\n\n== Site ==\n[[File:World Center Hotel & 90 West Street.jpg|left|thumb|[[130 Cedar Street]] (left) and 90 West Street (right) as seen from the [[National September 11 Memorial & Museum|National September 11 Memorial]] to the north]]\n90 West Street is located on a plot facing [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]] to the west, [[Cedar Street]] and the [[World Trade Center (2001\u2013present)|World Trade Center]] to the north, and [[Albany Street (Manhattan)|Albany Street]] to the south.

It is located on a plot bounded by [[West Street (Manhattan)|West Street]] to the west, Cedar Street and the [[World Trade Center (2001\u2013present)|World Trade Center]] to the north, [[130 Cedar Street]] to the east, and [[Albany Street (Manhattan)|Albany Street]] to the south.\n\n90 West Street was designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], with [[Gunvald Aus]] and Burt Harrison as structural engineers, and John Peirce as general contractor. It was erected for the West Street Improvement Corporation, led by transportation magnate Howard Carroll.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guide to Civil Engineering Projects In and Around New York City |edition=2nd |publisher=Metropolitan Section, American Society of Civil Engineers |year=2009 |page=108}}</ref> The building's [[Gothic revival|Gothic]] styling and ornamentation served to emphasize its height. The design combined elements of the three-section \"classical column\" arrangement of 19th-century buildings with the \"romantic tower\" of Gilbert's later structures such as the [[Woolworth Building]]. Its waterfront site necessitated the installation of [[pilings]] deep into the ground. Other features included a [[architectural terracotta|terracotta]] facade with [[granite]] at the two-story base, as well as terracotta fireproofing inside the building.\n\n90 West Street was built in 1905\u20131907 as an office building called the West Street Building. \"The Garret Restaurant\", located on the structure's top floors, was marketed as being the highest restaurant in the world. The building underwent numerous ownership changes in the 20th century, and was known after its long-term owner, Brady Security and Realty Corporation, during the middle of the century. Following the [[collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse]] of the adjacent [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], the West Street Building was severely damaged. The building was subsequently refurbished extensively and it reopened as a residential building called 90 West in 2005.\n\n90 West Street's design was widely praised when it was originally completed.

In its first formation in the far north it had an unusual ''shtat'' ([[table of organization and equipment]]) probably to facilitate its movement in the roadless tundra and forests of that region. It played a large role in holding and then pushing back the [[Finnish III Corps (Continuation War)|Finnish III Army Corps]] during Operation Silver Fox and for this success was redesignated as the [[23rd Guards Rifle Division]]. A new 88th began forming in April, 1942 based on the first formation of the 39th Rifle Brigade, mostly in the [[Moscow Military District]] and was soon assigned to the [[31st Army (Soviet Union)|31st Army]] of [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]]; it would remain in that Army for the duration of the war. It took part in the savage and mostly fruitless fighting around the Rzhev salient into the winter of 1942/43 and then in the summer offensive that liberated [[Smolensk]]. During the following fall it became badly depleted as Western Front repeatedly attempted to batter its way through the German defenses to Orsha. After rebuilding in the spring of 1944 it served as part of [[3rd Belorussian Front]] during Operation Bagration, soon being awarded a battle honor as well as the [[Order of the Red Banner]]. During this offensive it reached the border of East Prussia and won a second decoration in the unsuccessful Gumbinnen-Goldap Operation. During the East Prussian Offensive in January, 1945 it made steady progress, eventually earning its third Order after the battle for the Heiligenbeil Pocket. After the East Prussian campaign the 31st Army was railed south to Czechoslovakia where the 88th ended the war marching on [[Prague]]. Despite a fine record as a fighting unit the division was soon disbanded.\n\n==1st Formation==\nThe 88th Rifle Division began forming for the first time on the day the war began in Europe, September 1, 1939 at [[Arkhangelsk]] in the [[Arkhangelsk Military District]]. Maj. Gen. Andrei Ivanovich Zelentsov took command on June 14, 1940. As of June 22, 1941 the division's order of battle was as follows:\n* 426th Rifle Regiment\n* 611th Rifle Regiment\n* 758th Rifle Regiment\n* 401st Light Artillery Regiment\n* 269th Antitank Battalion\n* 147th Reconnaissance Battalion\n* 222nd Sapper Battalion\n* 221st Signal Battalion<ref>Charles C. Sharp, ''\"Red Legions\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed Before June 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. VIII'', Nafziger, 1996, p. 47</ref>\n* 368th Mortar Battalion (until October 16, 1941)\n* 288th Medical/Sanitation Battalion\n* 128th Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company\n* 184th Motor Transport Battalion\n* 154th Field Bakery\n* 189th Field Artillery Remount Workshop\n* 191st Field Postal Station\n* 373rd Field Office of the State Bank\nZelentsov also served as the acting commander of Arkhangelsk Military District from June 27 to July 5. The division remained near Arkhangelsk until the beginning of August, when it was shipped across the [[White Sea]] to [[Murmansk]]. Sharp states that it's possible the 88th had a special organization for operations in the roadless arctic terrain because it did not have a howitzer regiment and when it was disembarked from 10 small transports from August 9\u201314 it had just 7,818 personnel on strength with 58 artillery pieces of all calibres, 22 trucks and 1,928 horses in total. It also had a full reconnaissance battalion versus the standard company. This does not match any prewar ''shtat'' but appears to be a lightly-armed organization utilizing [[Packhorse|horse packing]] for most of its transport needs.<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Legions\"'', p. 47</ref>\n\nThe German-Finnish Operation Silver Fox had begun on July 1 with the goal of cutting the [[Kirov Railway|Murmansk railway]] and on August 7 the Finnish III Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]], captured [[Kestenga]]. By now he was 65&nbsp;km short of his objective of [[Loukhi]]. The Soviet [[14th Army (Soviet Union)|14th Army]] sent in a group of reserves known as the [[289th Rifle Division|Grivnik Brigade]] which slowed the Finnish drive. At this point the 88th joined the Kemskaya Operations Group and took over defense of the Kestenga-Loukhi road, one of the few avenues of operation in this mostly trackless wilderness. On August 15, while leading the division as it attempted to establish defensive positions along the Sofiangi River, General Zelentsov was killed in a German air attack; he was replaced five days later by Col. Vladimir Aleksandrovich Solovyov.<ref>Aleksander A. Maslov, ''Fallen Soviet Generals'', ed. & trans. D. M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, UK, 1998, p. 37</ref> By this time the Finnish forces were exhausted and on August 25 General Siilasvuo called a halt to regroup.<ref>John R. Elting, ''Battles for Scandinavia'', Time-Life Books Inc., Chicago, IL, 1981, p. 127</ref>\n\nAfter being reinforced by units of the German [[XXXVI Mountain Corps (Wehrmacht)|XXXVI Mountain Corps]] the Finns resumed their offensive on October 30. The 88th Division had also been reinforced and had had time to improve its positions. Despite this the attackers made progress and by November 6 two battalions of the 426th Rifle Regiment and a company of the 611th Regiment were fighting in encirclement. The next day two Finnish and one German battalion that had earlier infiltrated between the two Regiments were driven back 45&nbsp;km along the Kestenga-Loukhi road by other Soviet forces. On November 9 the encircled battalions of the 426th, low on ammunition and without food, were forced to break out; only 275 men returned to friendly lines. On November 16 the offensive subsided, in part due to heavy casualties on the Axis side but also due to diplomatic pressure from the United States government which threatened consequences for Finland if its supply deliveries to the USSR were interrupted. However this might have been, the division was credited with stopping the Finnish drive and largely in recognition of this it was redesignated as the 23rd Guards Rifle Division on March 17, 1942, one of only two Guards divisions created (the other being the [[10th Guards Rifle Division|10th Guards Rifle]]) in the Arctic.<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Legions\"'', p. 47</ref>\n\nOn February 22, 1943 two soldiers of the division would be posthumously made [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]] for their roles in the November battles. ''Krasnoarmeets'' Mikhail Egorovich Rodionov had been a machinegunner in the 2nd Battalion of the 426th Rifle Regiment. While fighting in encirclement Rodionov helped to drive off seven enemy attacks with his fire, despite being wounded. Following a second wound he lost conscioness; when he revived he killed himself with a grenade before being captured.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=4723. In Russian; English translation available. Retrieved January 1, 2020.</ref> Cpl. Fyodor Afanasevich Luzan commanded a radio platoon of the 758th Rifle Regiment. On November 24, while fighting for the railway station on the Loukhi-Kastenga line his battalion was surrounded by enemy tanks and infantry. In order to help his comrades to break through to friendly lines Luzan called in artillery fire on his own position. Soon after, as SS troops were breaking into his dugout, he blew up himself and his radio with a grenade, taking several attackers with him.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=4609.

Dunn, Jr., ''Stalin's Keys to Victory'', Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, p. 83</ref> It was formed from the Alma-Ata and Fruzensk Rifle-Machine gun Schools, largely with students of [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] nationality. In December the brigade was shipped north and by January 1, 1942 was in the reserves of [[Northwestern Front]], under command of Col. V. G. Noziyak. It was then assigned to [[4th Shock Army]] taking part in the [[Toropets-Kholm Offensive]] and on January 21 was one of the units recognized for its role in the liberation of [[Toropets]] and the capture of the German supply base there. By the end of the month 4th Shock came under command of [[Kalinin Front]] and the brigade remained in the Toropets salient to the west of the German-held [[Rzhev]] salient until April when it was pulled back well east of Moscow where it was disbanded to form the cadre for the new 88th Rifle Division.<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Volunteers\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. XI'', Nafziger, 1996, pp. 25-26</ref>\n\nAlthough it physically formed in the Urals the new 88th Division, based on an existing cadre, was very soon assigned to the [[Moscow Military District]].<ref>Dunn, Jr., ''Stalin's Keys to Victory'', p. 111</ref> Its order of battle was similar to that of the 1st formation:\n* 426th Rifle Regiment\n* 611th Rifle Regiment\n* 758th Rifle Regiment\n* 401st Artillery Regiment\n* 269th Antitank Battalion\n* 222nd Sapper Battalion\n* 147th Reconnaissance Company\n* 221st Signal Company<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Swarm\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol.

Andrei Filippovich Bolotov was assigned to command of the division on the day it began forming. In June it was assigned to the 4th Reserve Army in the [[Reserve of the Supreme High Command]] and then in July to 31st Army in Western Front.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1942.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942], pp. 134, 145</ref>\n\n===Battles for Rzhev===\nWestern Front began its part in the [[Battle of Rzhev, Summer 1942|First Rzhev\u2013Sychyovka Offensive Operation]] on August 4. A powerful artillery preparation reportedly knocked out 80 percent of German weapons, after which the German defenses were penetrated on both sides of Pogoreloe Gorodishche and the 31st Army's mobile group rushed through the breaches towards [[Zubtsov]]. By the evening of August 6 the breach in the German [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army's]] front had expanded up to 30&nbsp;km wide and up to 25&nbsp;km deep. The following day the ''STAVKA'' appointed Army Gen. [[Georgy Zhukov|G. K. Zhukov]] to coordinate the offensives of Western and Kalinin Fronts; Zhukov proposed to liberate Rzhev with 31st and [[30th Army (Soviet Union)|30th Armies]] as soon as August 9. However, heavy German counterattacks, complicated by adverse weather soon slowed the advance drastically. On August 23 the 31st Army, in concert with elements of the [[29th Army (Russia)|29th Army]], finally liberated Zubtsov. While this date is officially considered the end of the offensive in Soviet sources, in fact bitter fighting continued west of Zubtsov into mid-September. At dawn on September 8, 29th and 31st Armies went on a determined offensive to seize the southern part of Rzhev. Despite resolute attacks through the following day against the German [[161st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|161st Infantry Division]] the 31st made little progress. It suspended its attacks temporarily on September 16 but resumed them with three divisions, including the 88th, on its right flank on September 21\u201323 with similar lack of success. Over the course of the fighting from August 4 to September 15 the Army suffered a total of 43,321 total losses in personnel.<ref>Svetlana Gerasimova, ''The Rzhev Slaughterhouse'', ed. & trans. S. Britton, Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2013, pp. 74, 82-83, 85-87, 94-95, 99</ref>\n\nIn the planning for [[Operation Mars]] a directive was sent on September 28/29 from the command of Western Front to 31st Army, \"consisting of the 88th, [[239th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|239th]], [[336th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|336th]] and [[20th Guards Rifle Division]]s, the 32nd and 145th Tank Brigades... [to advance] along the Osuga, Artemovo, and Ligastaevo axis.\" The offensive finally began on November 25 when the Army's shock group, consisting of the above forces minus the 20th Guards, attacked the German [[102nd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|102nd Infantry Division]]. That division's history recorded:{{quotation|\"At 7:30 a.m., the brown masses of Russian infantry emerged from their assembly places in the woods. Tanks, 25 thundering, spitting monsters, rolled forward to support them. Wave after wave of Russians advanced against the 102nd Infantry Division. The Germans were ready. Standing in their trenches they fired over their parapets into the enemy masses sweeping forward over the barren fields. Their machine-guns raked the Russians. Anti-tank guns cracked flatly; field guns roared. And the Russians fell. A handful reached the German lines and were captured. Others charged forward. But at 9:40 they paused to catch their breath. When they renewed their attacks, this time in a light snowfall, the men of the 102d again drove them back. The end of the day found the Germans firmly in possession of their lines.\"<ref>David M. Glantz, ''Zhukov's Greatest Defeat'', University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 1999, p. 82</ref>}}In three days of fighting the tank brigades were decimated and the rifle divisions suffered heavy losses, up to 50 percent on the first day alone.<ref>Glantz, ''After Stalingrad'', Helion & Co., Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 43, 475</ref> The Army then went over to the defense. On December 11 it went back to the attack, in support of [[20th Army (Soviet Union)|20th Army]]. These attacks continued until the 18th. In February, 1943 the armies of Western and Kalinin Fronts began preparing for what would become the Rzhev-[[Vyasma]] Offensive Operation. 31st Army was to be prepared to attack by February 20\u201321. In the event these plans were delayed and eventually superseded when German 9th Army launched Operation ''B\u00fcffel'' on March 1 and began its phased withdrawal from the salient, pursued by 31st and other armies through the rest of the month.<ref>Gerasimova, ''The Rzhev Slaughterhouse'', pp. 111-12, 117, 129, 135-37</ref>\n\n==Into Western Russia and Belarus==\nIn June the 88th was assigned to the new [[45th Rifle Corps]], along with the [[220th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|220th]] and [[331st Rifle Division]]s.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], p. 160</ref> On August 7, the first day of [[Battle of Smolensk (1943)|Operation ''Suvorov'']], the only real Soviet success was achieved by 31st Army against [[XXXIX Panzer Corps]] in the [[Yartsevo, Smolensk Oblast|Yartsevo]] sector. The main effort was made by the [[36th Rifle Corps|36th]] and 45th Corps, the latter of which had the 220th and 331st Divisions in first echelon and the 88th in second. The attack gathered steam late in the day as the Corps attacked east of the [[Vop River]]. It faced the inexperienced [[113th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|113th Infantry Division]] which had only been at the front for two weeks. Between 1800 and 2000 hours the Corps overran one German battalion and threw another aside; an hour later an artillery battalion had also been overrun and it was clear the 113th's front was breaking apart. During the night two German regiments fell back 2&nbsp;km where a main battle line was reestablished behind the 6m-wide Vedosa River. Sensing confusion in the German ranks the commander of 31st Army, Maj. Gen. V. A. Gluzdovsky, committed his mobile group to break through to the Minsk-Moscow highway just 6&nbsp;km to the south. For a brief moment it seemed the 45th Corps and the 42nd Guards Tank Brigade might achieve a breakthrough.<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance'', Osprey Publishing Ltd., Oxford, UK, 2019, Kindle ed.</ref>\n\nThe attack was resumed at dawn on August 8 and gained more ground from the 113th Infantry which was now near collapse. By early afternoon the 260th Grenadier Regiment cracked after losing a key position and the 220th Division surged into the gap just east of the Vop. The only substantial reserve available to German [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] was the [[18th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|18th Panzergrenadier Division]] which was ordered into the counterattack. As it arrived it could only fill the gap left by the routed units of the 113th. The next day the two Soviet corps continued to try to batter their way through the German line but were stymied by 18th Panzergrenadiers; during this fighting Colonel Bolotov was killed by German tank or assault gun fire on his command post. He would be replaced by Col. Gavrill Alekseevich Bulanov on August 12. The 42nd Guards Tanks failed to reach the highway and lost 35 tanks in the process. On the other hand a major counterattack by 18th Panzergrenadier failed to restore the original front line due to heavy Soviet artillery fire and the obstacle of the Vedosa. After three days of fighting the situation was a stalemate, but the German reserve was fixed in place.<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance'', Kindle ed.</ref>\n\nWithin a few days the stalemate on the Smolensk front had become general. As of September 1 the 45th Corps consisted of the 88th and [[251st Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|251st Rifle Divisions]].<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], p. 217</ref> Western Front's offensive finally resumed on September 15 and by the end of the day Yartsevo was finally liberated. 45th Corps was transferred to [[68th Army (Soviet Union)|68th Army]] on September 18 and over the following week the 68th and 31st Armies pressed to encircle Smolensk, which was finally taken early in the morning of September 25.<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance'', Kindle ed.</ref> On October 9 the 88th came under the command of Col. Fyodor Trofimovich Kovtunov. During this month the division continued to advance towards the Belorussian border with 68th Army, but later that month 45th Corps rejoined the 31st Army.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], p. 275</ref>\n\n===Orsha Offensives===\n68th Army advanced westward south of the [[Dnieper River|Dniepr River]] in early October with 45th Corps to the rear, closing up to the defenses of the German [[XXVII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XXVII Army Corps]] late on October 8. The 88th immediately reinforced the assault of the [[159th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|159th Rifle Division]] across the [[Miareja River|Mereya River]], forcing the 18th Panzergrenadiers to withdraw westward. The division formed a forward detachment to pursue but the German division turned back towards the east and took up new defensive positions along the Rossasenka River on October 11. The Army prepared to resume its attacks the next day, but by now the 45th Corps was marching north to rejoin 31st Army.<ref>Glantz, ''Battle for Belorussia'', University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 66-67</ref>\n\n31st Army also began a new attempt to reach Orsha on October 12 with 45th Corps (now including the 220th Division) serving as its second echelon and reserve. The Army was positioned astride the Smolensk-Orsha highway north of the Dniepr. Western Front's offensive began after an artillery preparation of 85 minutes but 31st Army immediately stalled without any appreciable gains and at considerable cost. The offensive resumed the next day with reinforcements from the second echelon with no better results. Over the course of the fighting from October 12\u201318 the Front lost 5,858 personnel killed and 17,478 wounded. In preparation for a new effort 31st Army was further reinforced and regrouped its three corps south between the highway and the Dniepr, with 45th Corps in the center; the 88th and 251st Divisions were in first echelon and the 220th in second. The attack began early on October 21 following two hours and ten minutes of artillery fire. The shock groups smashed the defenses of the [[197th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|197th Infantry Division]] between the villages of Redki and Novaya, at considerable cost and by early evening had penetrated 4&nbsp;km deep on a front 1,000m wide toward the village of Kireevo, on the main rail line to Orsha. Two brigades of the [[2nd Guards Tank Corps]] were committed into the penetration but were soon halted by heavy German fire from the flanks. The attack was resumed the next day but gained 1,000m at most. On October 24 the second echelon divisions were committed in a final effort to break the German defenses but failed in part due to artillery ammunition shortages. The offensive was halted at nightfall on October 26 by which time the offensive capabilities of [[10th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|10th Guards]] and 31st Army were completely exhausted after gaining 4\u20136&nbsp;km at a combined cost of 4,787 killed and 14,315 wounded.<ref>Glantz, ''Battle for Belorussia'', pp. 71, 73-75, 79, 82-83, 85-87</ref>\n\nIn early November Western Front prepared for another attempt to break through the German defenses. The Front's first shock group consisted of the 10th Guards and 31st Armies on both sides of the Minsk highway, but by now their rifle divisions averaged only 4,500 personnel each. 45th Corps, south of Kireevo, faced the 119th Panzergrenadier Regiment of [[25th Panzergrenadier Division]]. The 88th was in the first echelon when the attack began on November 14 after a three-and-a-half hour artillery and air preparation, but was soon stopped in its tracks due to heavy machine gun fire. The fighting continued over the next four days but 45th Corps gained no more than 400m at considerable cost. The ''STAVKA'', however, ordered the offensive to continue, which it did beginning on November 30 after another regrouping. 31st and 10th Guards Armies were concentrated on a 12&nbsp;km-wide sector from Osintori to the Dniepr, with the 31st focused on just 3&nbsp;km of that with four divisions in first echelon and five in the second. In the event the attack made virtually no ground even after the second echelon was brought up, and the Front went over to the defense on December 5. The failure of the Orsha offensives was ascribed, apart from the strength of the German defenses, to a lack of training of Red Army replacements and a stereotyped use of artillery which did more to warn the German forces of attacks than to actually inflict damage. During December the ''STAVKA'' ordered Western Front to shift its efforts towards [[Vitebsk]].<ref>Glantz, ''Battle for Belorussia'', pp. 156-59, 162, 165-71</ref>\n\n==Operation Bagration==\nBy the beginning of January, 1944 the 88th, one of just four divisions remaining in 31st Army, had been assigned to the [[114th Rifle Corps]] with the 251st Division, but by a month later it was a separate division. In February it came under command of [[71st Rifle Corps]] with the 331st Division;<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1944.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944], pp. 13, 40, 70</ref> it would remain in this Corps for most of the rest of the war. On February 27 General Gluzdovsky was ordered to prepare yet another assault on the Orsha axis in cooperation with [[49th Army]] to his south. Since most of his Army was involved in offensive operations in the [[Babinavichy]] sector he only had his 71st Corps for this new attack, which began on March 5 and continued over the next four days. In the event the effort was unsuccessful at the cost to the two armies of another 1,898 killed and 5,639 wounded.<ref>Glantz, ''Battle for Belorussia'', pp. 381-83</ref>\n\nOn April 11 Western Front was disbanded and 31st Army was assigned to the new 3rd Belorussian Front, where it would remain until the last month of the war. Over the next two months the 88th got a much needed respite for rebuilding and replenishment. In the buildup to the Soviet summer offensive against Army Group Center on June 12\u201313 the 88th and [[192nd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|192nd Rifle Divisions]] of 71st Corps were shifted north to make room for the deployment of [[11th Guards Army]] on the sector north of the Dniepr. When the offensive began with probing attacks on June 22 those of 31st Army were driven back by heavy artillery and mortar fire. The following day the first echelon divisions of 71st Corps broke the German defense north of the Dniepr, and advanced 3&nbsp;km before being halted by increasing enemy resistance.<ref>Dunn, Jr., ''Soviet Blitzkrieg'', Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 139-41</ref> During the fighting near the Kireevo railway station Sen. Lieutenant [[Anna Nikandrova|Anna Alekseevna Nikandrova]], a [[Komsomol]] leader of the 426th Rifle Regiment, was distinguished for her gallantry. She used a hook ladder to help the soldiers of her company through an antitank ditch; later that day she blocked the embrasure of a German machinegun bunker with her body and was killed. On March 24, 1945 she was posthumously made a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1632. In Russian; English translation available.

Meanwhile, in the fighting around the Vitebsk salient, by June 24 the Soviets were torn by the classic dilemma of blitzkrieg warfare\u2014how many units to use to close the pocket and how many to keep pressing forward before the enemy had time to create defensive positions. [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th Army]], which was responsible for 3rd Belorussian Front's part of this encirclement, had only its [[84th Rifle Corps]] available for the battle for the city itself.

Over the next two days, as Hitler refused permission for the Corps to break out, the Soviet forces prepared to liquidate the pocket, which began at 0900 hours on June 27, preceded by a massive barrage of artillery and rockets. By noon the defenders had been broken into small pockets and during the afternoon the remnants surrendered.

Over the next two days the entire Front continued its pursuit in the direction of [[Vilnius]], which was reached by [[3rd Guards Mechanized Corps]] on the morning of July 7. At the same time the 71st Corps was overcoming limited resistance in the [[Naliboki forest]] with the assistance of partisans and reached the [[Berezina River]] by the end of the day. The battle for Vilnius would continue until July 13, but meanwhile on July 8 the 31st Army had advanced another 25\u201330&nbsp;km towards the [[Neman|Neman River]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 8</ref> Hitler regarded this as his \"line of catastrophe\" to be held at any price.<ref>Charles J.

On July 15 it was joined by elements of 71st Corps which took two more bridgeheads in the same area. At this point the Army commander, Col. Gen. [[Vasily Glagolev|V. V. Glagolev]], was ordered to regroup his forces to the right flank and force the Neman along the Army's entire front. By the end of July 17 the 11th Guards, 5th and 31st Armies had together breached the river line on a 110&nbsp;km front and repelled all counterattacks.

On the first day 31st Army advanced as much as 15&nbsp;km. On the following day the entire German defense along the Neman was crushed and the Front advanced rapidly towards [[Vilkavi\u0161kis]]. However the Army soon ran into woodland and lake terrain which slowed the advance as stubborn resistance developed. The operation was generally halted on July 31.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 8</ref>\n\n===Goldap-Gumbinnen Operation===\nA new offensive into East Prussia began on October 16; 3rd Belorussian Front planned to drive directly from [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gumbinnen]] through [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]] to [[Kaliningrad|K\u00f6nigsberg]]. However, heavy German resistance soon stalled and even reversed this offensive. [[Go\u0142dap|Goldap]], to the south of the main drive, was soon taken, but German 4th Army committed its [[102nd Panzer Brigade|102nd Panzer]] and [[F\u00fchrer Grenadier Brigade]]s to the fighting and retook it on October 25. In a surprise attack by 31st Army on October 28 the town again changed hands, but the situation soon deteriorated as further counterattacks struck home. By November 3 the 611th Rifle Regiment was surrounded and was ordered to break out to friendly lines the next night. The regimental banner was entrusted to Sen. Sergeant Andrei Nikolaievich Elgin, a squad leader of the regiment's sub-machine gun company. Elgin had the banner wrapped around his torso under his uniform before leading a team of four men out of the town along a single path through the woods and marshland to the east. When the route was blocked by a German machine gun post he charged it, throwing grenades until it was destroyed with the help of his men. Although wounded, Elgin refused to give up the banner and continued on. Later, while crossing between the lines the party was spotted by the light of flares and a German group attempted to capture it. With his sub-machine gun and grenades Elgin killed eight of the enemy but received a second wound which proved fatal. He finally handed over the banner to a rescue group before he died. On March 20, 1945 he was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=22932. In Russian, English translation available.

Nikita Sergeevich Samokhvalov took over command and continued to lead the 88th for the duration of the war.\n\n===East Prussian Offensive===\nThe second attempt to destroy the German forces in East Prussia began on January 12, 1945. The objective of 3rd Belorussian Front was much as before: to penetrate the defenses north of the [[Masurian Lake District|Masurian Lakes]] in the Insterburg region and then advance to launch a frontal attack on K\u00f6nigsberg. 31st Army remained on the Front's left flank and in the early going was ordered to firmly defend the front south of Goldap. The 88th remained in 71st Corps with the [[220th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|220th]] and [[331st Rifle Division]]s. The Army went over to the offensive on January 22 and by the next day the German grouping facing it was in retreat. During that day the Corps captured the important road junction of Benkheim while the Army developed the offensive toward [[W\u0119gorzewo|Angerburg]] and L\u00f6tzen, advancing more than 45&nbsp;km before storming the heavily fortified strongpoint at the former location.

In its first formation in the far north it had an unusual ''shtat'' ([[table of organization and equipment]]) probably to facilitate its movement in the roadless tundra and forests of that region. It played a large role in holding and then pushing back the [[Finnish III Corps (Continuation War)|Finnish III Army Corps]] during Operation Silver Fox and for this success was redesignated as the [[23rd Guards Rifle Division]]. A new 88th began forming in April, 1942 based on the first formation of the 39th Rifle Brigade, mostly in the [[Moscow Military District]] and was soon assigned to the [[31st Army (Soviet Union)|31st Army]] of [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]]; it would remain in that Army for the duration of the war. It took part in the savage and mostly fruitless fighting around the Rzhev salient into the winter of 1942/43 and then in the summer offensive that liberated [[Smolensk]]. During the following fall it became badly depleted as Western Front repeatedly attempted to batter its way through the German defenses to Orsha. After rebuilding in the spring of 1944 it served as part of [[3rd Belorussian Front]] during Operation Bagration, soon being awarded a battle honor as well as the [[Order of the Red Banner]]. During this offensive it reached the border of East Prussia and won a second decoration in the unsuccessful Gumbinnen-Goldap Operation. During the East Prussian Offensive in January, 1945 it made steady progress, eventually earning its third Order after the battle for the Heiligenbeil Pocket. After the East Prussian campaign the 31st Army was railed south to Czechoslovakia where the 88th ended the war marching on [[Prague]]. Despite a fine record as a fighting unit the division was soon disbanded.\n\n==1st Formation==\nThe 88th Rifle Division began forming for the first time on the day the war began in Europe, September 1, 1939 at [[Arkhangelsk]] in the [[Arkhangelsk Military District]]. Maj. Gen. Andrei Ivanovich Zelentsov took command on June 14, 1940. As of June 22, 1941 the division's order of battle was as follows:\n* 426th Rifle Regiment\n* 611th Rifle Regiment\n* 758th Rifle Regiment\n* 401st Light Artillery Regiment\n* 269th Antitank Battalion\n* 147th Reconnaissance Battalion\n* 222nd Sapper Battalion\n* 221st Signal Battalion<ref>Charles C. Sharp, ''\"Red Legions\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed Before June 1941, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. VIII'', Nafziger, 1996, p. 47</ref>\n* 368th Mortar Battalion (until October 16, 1941)\n* 288th Medical/Sanitation Battalion\n* 128th Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company\n* 184th Motor Transport Battalion\n* 154th Field Bakery\n* 189th Field Artillery Remount Workshop\n* 191st Field Postal Station\n* 373rd Field Office of the State Bank\nZelentsov also served as the acting commander of Arkhangelsk Military District from June 27 to July 5. The division remained near Arkhangelsk until the beginning of August, when it was shipped across the [[White Sea]] to [[Murmansk]]. Sharp states that it's possible the 88th had a special organization for operations in the roadless arctic terrain because it did not have a howitzer regiment and when it was disembarked from 10 small transports from August 9-14 it had just 7,818 personnel on strength with 58 artillery pieces of all calibres, 22 trucks and 1,928 horses in total. It also had a full reconnaissance battalion versus the standard company. This does not match any prewar ''shtat'' but appears to be a lightly-armed organization utilizing [[Packhorse|horse packing]] for most of its transport needs.<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Legions\"'', p. 47</ref>\n\nThe German-Finnish Operation Silver Fox had begun on July 1 with the goal of cutting the [[Kirov Railway|Murmansk railway]] and on August 7 the Finnish III Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. [[Hjalmar Siilasvuo]], captured [[Kestenga]]. By now he was 65km short of his objective of [[Loukhi]]. The Soviet [[14th Army (Soviet Union)|14th Army]] sent in a group of reserves known as the [[289th Rifle Division|Grivnik Brigade]] which slowed the Finnish drive. At this point the 88th joined the Kemskaya Operations Group and took over defense of the Kestenga-Loukhi road, one of the few avenues of operation in this mostly trackless wilderness. On August 15, while leading the division as it attempted to establish defensive positions along the Sofiangi River, General Zelentsov was killed in a German air attack; he was replaced five days later by Col. Vladimir Aleksandrovich Solovyov.<ref>Aleksander A. Maslov, ''Fallen Soviet Generals'', ed. & trans. D. M. Glantz, Frank Cass Publishers, London, UK, 1998, p. 37</ref> By this time the Finnish forces were exhausted and on August 25 General Siilasvuo called a halt to regroup.<ref>John R. Elting, ''Battles for Scandinavia'', Time-Life Books Inc., Chicago, IL, 1981, p. 127</ref>\n\nAfter being reinforced by units of the German [[XXXVI Mountain Corps (Wehrmacht)|XXXVI Mountain Corps]] the Finns resumed their offensive on October 30. The 88th Division had also been reinforced and had had time to improve its positions. Despite this the attackers made progress and by November 6 two battalions of the 426th Rifle Regiment and a company of the 611th Regiment were fighting in encirclement. The next day two Finnish and one German battalion that had earlier infiltrated between the two Regiments were driven back 45km along the Kestenga-Loukhi road by other Soviet forces. On November 9 the encircled battalions of the 426th, low on ammunition and without food, were forced to break out; only 275 men returned to friendly lines. On November 16 the offensive subsided, in part due to heavy casualties on the Axis side but also due to diplomatic pressure from the United States government which threatened consequences for Finland if its supply deliveries to the USSR were interrupted. However this might have been, the division was credited with stopping the Finnish drive and largely in recognition of this it was redesignated as the 23rd Guards Rifle Division on March 17, 1942, one of only two Guards divisions created (the other being the [[10th Guards Rifle Division|10th Guards Rifle]]) in the Arctic.<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Legions\"'', p. 47</ref>\n\nOn February 22, 1943 two soldiers of the division would be posthumously made [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]] for their roles in the November battles. ''Krasnoarmeets'' Mikhail Egorovich Rodionov had been a machinegunner in the 2nd Battalion of the 426th Rifle Regiment. While fighting in encirclement Rodionov helped to drive off seven enemy attacks with his fire, despite being wounded. Following a second wound he lost conscioness; when he revived he killed himself with a grenade before being captured.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=4723. In Russian; English translation available. Retrieved January 1, 2020.</ref> Cpl. Fyodor Afanasevich Luzan commanded a radio platoon of the 758th Rifle Regiment. On November 24, while fighting for the railway station on the Loukhi-Kastenga line his battalion was surrounded by enemy tanks and infantry. In order to help his comrades to break through to friendly lines Luzan called in artillery fire on his own position. Soon after, as SS troops were breaking into his dugout, he blew up himself and his radio with a grenade, taking several attackers with him.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=4609.

Dunn, Jr., ''Stalin's Keys to Victory'', Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, p. 83</ref> It was formed from the Alma-Ata and Fruzensk Rifle-Machine gun Schools, largely with students of [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] nationality. In December the brigade was shipped north and by January 1, 1942 was in the reserves of [[Northwestern Front]], under command of Col. V. G. Noziyak.

By the end of the month 4th Shock came under command of [[Kalinin Front]] and the brigade remained in the Toropets salient to the west of the German-held [[Rzhev]] salient until April when it was pulled back well east of Moscow where it was disbanded to form the cadre for the new 88th Rifle Division.<ref>Sharp, ''\"Red Volunteers\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol.

A powerful artillery preparation reportedly knocked out 80 percent of German weapons, after which the German defenses were penetrated on both sides of Pogoreloe Gorodishche and the 31st Army's mobile group rushed through the breaches towards [[Zubtsov]]. By the evening of August 6 the breach in the German [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army's]] front had expanded up to 30km wide and up to 25km deep. The following day the ''STAVKA'' appointed Army Gen. [[Georgy Zhukov|G. K. Zhukov]] to coordinate the offensives of Western and Kalinin Fronts; Zhukov proposed to liberate Rzhev with 31st and [[30th Army (Soviet Union)|30th Armies]] as soon as August 9. However, heavy German counterattacks, complicated by adverse weather soon slowed the advance drastically. On August 23 the 31st Army, in concert with elements of the [[29th Army (Russia)|29th Army]], finally liberated Zubtsov. While this date is officially considered the end of the offensive in Soviet sources, in fact bitter fighting continued west of Zubtsov into mid-September. At dawn on September 8, 29th and 31st Armies went on a determined offensive to seize the southern part of Rzhev. Despite resolute attacks through the following day against the German [[161st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|161st Infantry Division]] the 31st made little progress. It suspended its attacks temporarily on September 16 but resumed them with three divisions, including the 88th, on its right flank on September 21-23 with similar lack of success. Over the course of the fighting from August 4 to September 15 the Army suffered a total of 43,321 total losses in personnel.<ref>Svetlana Gerasimova, ''The Rzhev Slaughterhouse'', ed. & trans. S.

That division's history recorded:{{quotation|\"At 7:30 a.m., the brown masses of Russian infantry emerged from their assembly places in the woods. Tanks, 25 thundering, spitting monsters, rolled forward to support them. Wave after wave of Russians advanced against the 102nd Infantry Division. The Germans were ready. Standing in their trenches they fired over their parapets into the enemy masses sweeping forward over the barren fields. Their machine-guns raked the Russians. Anti-tank guns cracked flatly; field guns roared. And the Russians fell. A handful reached the German lines and were captured. Others charged forward. But at 9:40 they paused to catch their breath. When they renewed their attacks, this time in a light snowfall, the men of the 102d again drove them back. The end of the day found the Germans firmly in possession of their lines.\"<ref>David M.

On December 11 it went back to the attack, in support of [[20th Army (Soviet Union)|20th Army]]. These attacks continued until the 18th. In February, 1943 the armies of Western and Kalinin Fronts began preparing for what would become the Rzhev-[[Vyasma]] Offensive Operation. 31st Army was to be prepared to attack by February 20-21.

The main effort was made by the [[36th Rifle Corps|36th]] and 45th Corps, the latter of which had the 220th and 331st Divisions in first echelon and the 88th in second. The attack gathered steam late in the day as the Corps attacked east of the [[Vop River]]. It faced the inexperienced [[113th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|113th Infantry Division]] which had only been at the front for two weeks. Between 1800 and 2000 hours the Corps overran one German battalion and threw another aside; an hour later an artillery battalion had also been overrun and it was clear the 113th's front was breaking apart. During the night two German regiments fell back 2km where a main battle line was reestablished behind the 6m-wide Vedosa River. Sensing confusion in the German ranks the commander of 31st Army, Maj. Gen. V. A. Gluzdovsky, committed his mobile group to break through to the Minsk-Moscow highway just 6km to the south. For a brief moment it seemed the 45th Corps and the 42nd Guards Tank Brigade might achieve a breakthrough.<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance'', Osprey Publishing Ltd., Oxford, UK, 2019, Kindle ed.</ref>\n\nThe attack was resumed at dawn on August 8 and gained more ground from the 113th Infantry which was now near collapse. By early afternoon the 260th Grenadier Regiment cracked after losing a key position and the 220th Division surged into the gap just east of the Vop. The only substantial reserve available to German [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|4th Army]] was the [[18th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|18th Panzergrenadier Division]] which was ordered into the counterattack. As it arrived it could only fill the gap left by the routed units of the 113th. The next day the two Soviet corps continued to try to batter their way through the German line but were stymied by 18th Panzergrenadiers; during this fighting Colonel Bolotov was killed by German tank or assault gun fire on his command post. He would be replaced by Col. Gavrill Alekseevich Bulanov on August 12. The 42nd Guards Tanks failed to reach the highway and lost 35 tanks in the process. On the other hand a major counterattack by 18th Panzergrenadier failed to restore the original front line due to heavy Soviet artillery fire and the obstacle of the Vedosa. After three days of fighting the situation was a stalemate, but the German reserve was fixed in place.<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance'', Kindle ed.</ref>\n\nWithin a few days the stalemate on the Smolensk front had become general. As of September 1 the 45th Corps consisted of the 88th and [[251st Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|251st Rifle Divisions]].<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], p. 217</ref> Western Front's offensive finally resumed on September 15 and by the end of the day Yartsevo was finally liberated. 45th Corps was transferred to [[68th Army (Soviet Union)|68th Army]] on September 18 and over the following week the 68th and 31st Armies pressed to encircle Smolensk, which was finally taken early in the morning of September 25.<ref>Robert Forczyk, ''Smolensk 1943: The Red Army's Relentless Advance'', Kindle ed.</ref> On October 9 the 88th came under the command of Col. Fyodor Trofimovich Kovtunov. During this month the division continued to advance towards the Belorussian border with 68th Army, but later that month 45th Corps rejoined the 31st Army.<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1943.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943], p. 275</ref>\n===Orsha Offensives===\n68th Army advanced westward south of the [[Dnieper River|Dniepr River]] in early October with 45th Corps to the rear, closing up to the defenses of the German [[XXVII Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|XXVII Army Corps]] late on October 8. The 88th immediately reinforced the assault of the [[159th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|159th Rifle Division]] across the [[Miareja River|Mereya River]], forcing the 18th Panzergrenadiers to withdraw westward. The division formed a forward detachment to pursue but the German division turned back towards the east and took up new defensive positions along the Rossasenka River on October 11. The Army prepared to resume its attacks the next day, but by now the 45th Corps was marching north to rejoin 31st Army.<ref>Glantz, ''Battle for Belorussia'', University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2016, pp. 66-67</ref>\n\n31st Army also began a new attempt to reach Orsha on October 12 with 45th Corps (now including the 220th Division) serving as its second echelon and reserve. The Army was positioned astride the Smolensk-Orsha highway north of the Dniepr. Western Front's offensive began after an artillery preparation of 85 minutes but 31st Army immediately stalled without any appreciable gains and at considerable cost. The offensive resumed the next day with reinforcements from the second echelon with no better results. Over the course of the fighting from October 12-18 the Front lost 5,858 personnel killed and 17,478 wounded. In preparation for a new effort 31st Army was further reinforced and regrouped its three corps south between the highway and the Dniepr, with 45th Corps in the center; the 88th and 251st Divisions were in first echelon and the 220th in second. The attack began early on October 21 following two hours and ten minutes of artillery fire. The shock groups smashed the defenses of the [[197th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|197th Infantry Division]] between the villages of Redki and Novaya, at considerable cost and by early evening had penetrated 4km deep on a front 1,000m wide toward the village of Kireevo, on the main rail line to Orsha. Two brigades of the [[2nd Guards Tank Corps]] were committed into the penetration but were soon halted by heavy German fire from the flanks. The attack was resumed the next day but gained 1,000m at most. On October 24 the second echelon divisions were committed in a final effort to break the German defenses but failed in part due to artillery ammunition shortages. The offensive was halted at nightfall on October 26 by which time the offensive capabilities of [[10th Guards Army (Soviet Union)|10th Guards]] and 31st Army were completely exhausted after gaining 4-6km at a combined cost of 4,787 killed and 14,315 wounded.<ref>Glantz, ''Battle for Belorussia'', pp. 71, 73-75, 79, 82-83, 85-87</ref>\n\nIn early November Western Front prepared for another attempt to break through the German defenses. The Front's first shock group consisted of the 10th Guards and 31st Armies on both sides of the Minsk highway, but by now their rifle divisions averaged only 4,500 personnel each. 45th Corps, south of Kireevo, faced the 119th Panzergrenadier Regiment of [[25th Panzergrenadier Division]]. The 88th was in the first echelon when the attack began on November 14 after a three-and-a-half hour artillery and air preparation, but was soon stopped in its tracks due to heavy machine gun fire. The fighting continued over the next four days but 45th Corps gained no more than 400m at considerable cost. The ''STAVKA'', however, ordered the offensive to continue, which it did beginning on November 30 after another regrouping. 31st and 10th Guards Armies were concentrated on a 12km-wide sector from Osintori to the Dniepr, with the 31st focused on just 3km of that with four divisions in first echelon and five in the second. In the event the attack made virtually no ground even after the second echelon was brought up, and the Front went over to the defense on December 5. The failure of the Orsha offensives was ascribed, apart from the strength of the German defenses, to a lack of training of Red Army replacements and a stereotyped use of artillery which did more to warn the German forces of attacks than to actually inflict damage. During December the ''STAVKA'' ordered Western Front to shift its efforts towards [[Vitebsk]].<ref>Glantz, ''Battle for Belorussia'', pp. 156-59, 162, 165-71</ref>\n\n==Operation Bagration==\nBy the beginning of January, 1944 the 88th, one of just four divisions remaining in 31st Army, had been assigned to the [[114th Rifle Corps]] with the 251st Division, but by a month later it was a separate division. In February it came under command of [[71st Rifle Corps]] with the 331st Division;<ref>[http://www.soldat.ru/files/f/boevojsostavsa1944.pdf Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944], pp. 13, 40, 70</ref> it would remain in this Corps for most of the rest of the war. On February 27 General Gluzdovsky was ordered to prepare yet another assault on the Orsha axis in cooperation with [[49th Army]] to his south. Since most of his Army was involved in offensive operations in the [[Babinavichy]] sector he only had his 71st Corps for this new attack, which began on March 5 and continued over the next four days. In the event the effort was unsuccessful at the cost to the two armies of another 1,898 killed and 5,639 wounded.<ref>Glantz, ''Battle for Belorussia'', pp. 381-83</ref>\n\nOn April 11 Western Front was disbanded and 31st Army was assigned to the new 3rd Belorussian Front, where it would remain until the last month of the war. Over the next two months the 88th got a much needed respite for rebuilding and replenishment. In the buildup to the Soviet summer offensive against Army Group Center on June 12-13 the 88th and [[192nd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|192nd Rifle Divisions]] of 71st Corps were shifted north to make room for the deployment of [[11th Guards Army]] on the sector north of the Dniepr. When the offensive began with probing attacks on June 22 those of 31st Army were driven back by heavy artillery and mortar fire. The following day the first echelon divisions of 71st Corps broke the German defense north of the Dniepr, and advanced 3km before being halted by increasing enemy resistance.<ref>Dunn, Jr., ''Soviet Blitzkrieg'', Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2008, pp. 139-41</ref> During the fighting near the Kireevo railway station Sen. Lieutenant [[Anna Nikandrova|Anna Alekseevna Nikandrova]], a [[Komsomol]] leader of the 426th Rifle Regiment, was distinguished for her gallantry. She used a hook ladder to help the soldiers of her company through an antitank ditch; later that day she blocked the embrasure of a German machinegun bunker with her body and was killed. On March 24, 1945 she was posthumously made a [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=1632. In Russian; English translation available.

Meanwhile, in the fighting around the Vitebsk salient, by June 24 the Soviets were torn by the classic dilemma of blitzkrieg warfare -- how many units to use to close the pocket and how many to keep pressing forward before the enemy had time to create defensive positions. [[39th Army (Soviet Union)|39th Army]], which was responsible for 3rd Belorussian Front's part of this encirclement, had only its [[84th Rifle Corps]] available for the battle for the city itself. As a result the 88th was moved north and attached to this Corps.<ref>Dunn, Jr., ''Soviet Blitzkrieg'', p. 104</ref><ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', ed. & trans. R. W.

Over the next two days, as Hitler refused permission for the Corps to break out, the Soviet forces prepared to liquidate the pocket, which began at 0900 hours on June 27, preceded by a massive barrage of artillery and rockets. By noon the defenders had been broken into small pockets and during the afternoon the remnants surrendered.

At the same time the 71st Corps was overcoming limited resistance in the [[Naliboki forest]] with the assistance of partisans and reached the [[Berezina River]] by the end of the day.

On July 15 it was joined by elements of 71st Corps which took two more bridgeheads in the same area. At this point the Army commander, Col. Gen. [[Vasily Glagolev|V. V.

By the end of July 17 the 11th Guards, 5th and 31st Armies had together breached the river line on a 110km front and repelled all counterattacks.

On the first day 31st Army advanced as much as 15km. On the following day the entire German defense along the Neman was crushed and the Front advanced rapidly towards [[Vilkavi\u0161kis]]. However the Army soon ran into woodland and lake terrain which slowed the advance as stubborn resistance developed. The operation was generally halted on July 31.<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Operation Bagration'', Kindle ed., vol. 2, ch. 8</ref>\n===Goldap-Gumbinnen Operation===\nA new offensive into East Prussia began on October 16; 3rd Belorussian Front planned to drive directly from [[Gusev, Kaliningrad Oblast|Gumbinnen]] through [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]] to [[Kaliningrad|K\u00f6nigsberg]]. However, heavy German resistance soon stalled and even reversed this offensive. [[Go\u0142dap|Goldap]], to the south of the main drive, was soon taken, but German 4th Army committed its [[102nd Panzer Brigade|102nd Panzer]] and [[F\u00fchrer Grenadier Brigade|F\u00fchrer Grenadier Brigades]] to the fighting and retook it on October 25. In a surprise attack by 31st Army on October 28 the town again changed hands, but the situation soon deteriorated as further counterattacks struck home. By November 3 the 611th Rifle Regiment was surrounded and was ordered to break out to friendly lines the next night. The regimental banner was entrusted to Sen. Sergeant Andrei Nikolaievich Elgin, a squad leader of the regiment's sub-machine gun company. Elgin had the banner wrapped around his torso under his uniform before leading a team of four men out of the town along a single path through the woods and marshland to the east. When the route was blocked by a German machine gun post he charged it, throwing grenades until it was destroyed with the help of his men. Although wounded, Elgin refused to give up the banner and continued on. Later, while crossing between the lines the party was spotted by the light of flares and a German group attempted to capture it. With his sub-machine gun and grenades Elgin killed eight of the enemy but received a second wound which proved fatal. He finally handed over the banner to a rescue group before he died. On March 20, 1945 he was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=22932. In Russian, English translation available.

The objective of 3rd Belorussian Front was much as before: to penetrate the defenses north of the [[Masurian Lake District|Masurian Lakes]] in the Insterburg region and then advance to launch a frontal attack on K\u00f6nigsberg. 31st Army remained on the Front's left flank and in the early going was ordered to firmly defend the front south of Goldap. The 88th remained in 71st Corps with the [[220th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|220th]] and [[331st Rifle Division|331st Rifle Divisions]]. The Army went over to the offensive on January 22 and by the next day the German grouping facing it was in retreat. During that day the Corps captured the important road junction of Benkheim while the Army developed the offensive toward [[W\u0119gorzewo|Angerburg]] and L\u00f6tzen, advancing more than 45km before storming the heavily fortified strongpoint at the former location.

The [[129th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|129th Infantry]] and [[558th Grenadier Division|558th Grenadier]] and [[24th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|24th Panzer Divisions]] launched powerful counterattacks in an effort to encircle the 71st Corps and while they were unable to break into Landsberg they isolated it for several days, bypassing to the north and south and causing considerable havoc in the Soviet rear areas. Once communications were restored the Corps continued its advance in the direction of [[Kandyty|Kanditten]].<ref>Soviet General Staff, ''Prelude to Berlin'', p. 233</ref><ref>Boris Gorbachevsky, ''Through the Maelstrom'', ed. & trans.

On March 24 Sen. Sergeant Nikolai Mikhailovich Lazkov, an engineer reconnaissance squad leader of the 222nd Sapper Battalion, was made a Hero of the Soviet Union for his work in Belarus from January to June of 1944, during which time he led 96 night searches and defused 586 mines with his group. At the start of Operation Bagration, while operating behind enemy lines, his unit captured a bridge over the Orshitsa River north of Orsha and he organized its defense until relieved. He went on to a lengthy career in the postwar [[Soviet Army]], eventually reaching the rank of colonel.<ref>http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=23403.
