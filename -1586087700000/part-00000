Documentary evidence suggests that at the beginning of 20th century bride price, rather than dowry was the common custom, which often resulted in very poor boys remaining unmarried.<ref>Muni Buddhmal, Terapanth ke Drudhdharmi Shravak Arjunlalji Porwal, Kesrimal ji Surana Abhinanda Granth, 1982, p95</ref><ref>Parwar Directory, Pub.  Singhai Pannalal Raes ed. Pandit Tulsiram, 1924, p. 15</ref>\n\nStanley J.Tambiah claims the ancient [[Code of Manu]] sanctioned dowry and bridewealth in ancient India, but dowry was the more prestigious form and associated with the [[Brahmanic]] (priestly) caste. [[Bridewealth]] was restricted to the lower [[castes]], who were not allowed to give dowry. He cites two studies from the early 20th century with data to suggest that this pattern of dowry in upper castes and [[bridewealth]] in lower [[castes]] has persisted through the first half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Tambiah\n| first     = Stanley\n| title     = Bridewealth and Dowry\n| year      = 1973\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| location  = Cambridge UK\n| pages     = 68\u20139\n| author2   = Goody, Jack\n}}</ref> However, it is that marriages involved both reciprocal gifts between the two families, claims Tambiah, so that insofar as the groom's family gives the bridewealth, it tends to be given back as the culturally validated dowry to the bride as part of her conjugal estate.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Tambiah\n| first     = Stanley\n| title     = Bridewealth and Dowry\n| year      = 1973\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| location  = Cambridge UK\n| page      = 71\n| author2   = Goody, Jack\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Witzel]], in contrast, claims the ancient Indian literature suggests dowry practices were not significant during the [[Vedic period]].<ref>Witzel, Michael. \"Little Dowry, No Sati: The Lot of Women in the Vedic Period.\" ''Journal of South Asia Women Studies'' 2, no. 4 (1996).</ref> Witzel also notes that women in ancient India had property inheritance rights either by appointment or when they had no brothers.\n\nThe findings of MacDonell and Keith are similar to Witzel, and differ from Tambiah; they cite ancient Indian literature suggesting bridewealth was paid even in [[brahma]]- and [[daiva]]-types of marriage associated with the [[Brahmanic]] (priestly) upper caste. Dowry was not infrequent when the girl suffered from some bodily defect. Property rights for women increased in ancient India, suggest MacDonell and Keith, over the Epics era (200 BC to 700 AD).<ref>MacDonell, Arthur and Keith, Arthur.

Lochtefeld suggests that religious duties listed by [[Manusm\u1e5bti|Manu]] and others, such as 'the bride be richly adorned to celebrate marriage' were ceremonial dress and jewelry along with gifts that were her property, not property demanded by or meant for the groom; Lochtefeld further notes that bridal adornment is not currently considered as dowry in most people's mind.<ref>James G.

Available eyewitness observations from ancient India give a different picture. One of these are the eyewitness records from [[Alexander the Great]] conquest (''ca''. 300 BC) as recorded by Arrian and Megasthenes. Arrian first book mentions a lack of dowry,\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = They (these ancient Indian people) make their marriages accordance with this principle, for in selecting a bride they care nothing whether she has a dowry and a handsome fortune, but look only to her beauty and other advantages of the outward person.\n |source = [[Arrian]], ''The Invasion of India by [[Alexander the Great]]'', 3rd Century BC<ref>John Watson McCrindle (Translator), The Invasion of India by Alexander the Great as described by Arrian, Archibald Constable & Co.

The daughter took this inheritance amount with her when she married, claimed Al-Biruni, and she had no rights to income from her parents after her marriage or to any additional inheritance after her father's death. If her father died before her marriage, her guardian would first pay off her father's debt, then allocate a fourth of the remaining wealth to her upkeep till she is ready to marry, and then give the rest to her to take with her into her married life.<ref>Edward Sachau (Translat</ref>\n\n== Causes of the dowry ==\nVarious reasons have been suggested as cause of dowry practice in India. These include economic factors and social factors.\n\n=== Economic factors ===\nThere are many [[economic]] factors that contribute towards the system of dowry. Some of these include [[inheritance]] systems and the bride's economic status.\n\nSome suggestions point to economics and weak legal institutions on inheritance place women in disadvantage, with inheritances being left only to sons.<ref name=\"Dalmia 2005\" /> This leaves women dependent upon their husbands and in-laws, who keep the dowry when she marries.<ref name=\"Majumdar 2005 74\">{{cite book\n| last      = Majumdar\n| first     = Maya\n| title     = Encyclopaedia of Gender Equality Through Women Empowerment\n| year      = 2005\n| publisher = Sarup & Sons\n| isbn      = 9788176255486\n| pages     = 74\n}}</ref> Prior to 1956, including during the [[British Raj]], daughters had no rights of inheritance to their family's wealth. In 1956, India gave equal legal status to daughters and sons among [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]] and [[Jain]] families, under the [[Hindu Succession Act]] (India grants its Muslim population the [[Sharia]] derived personal status laws). Despite the new inheritance law, dowry has continued as a process whereby parental property is distributed to a daughter at her marriage by a social process, rather than after parents death by a slow court supervised process under [[Hindu Succession Act]] (1956).<ref>Lucy Carroll (1991), Daughter's Right of Inheritance in India: A Perspective on the Problem of Dowry, Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 25, No. 4, pages 791-809</ref>\n\nDowry gave, at least in theory, women economic and [[Economic security|financial security]] in their marriage in the form of movable goods. This helped prevent family wealth break-up and provided security to the bride at the same time.<ref name=\"Dalmia 2005\" /> This system can also be used as a [[premortem]] inheritance, as once a woman is presented with movable gifts, she may be cut off from the [[family estate]].<ref name=\"Teays 1991\">{{cite journal\n| last    = Teays\n| first   = Wanda\n| title   = The Burning Bride: The Dowry Problem in India\n| journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion\n| year    = 1991\n| volume  = 7\n| issue   = 2\n| pages   = 29\u201352\n}}</ref>\n\nFor many, dowry has become a greater financial burden on the family, and can leave families [[destitute]] based on the demands from the groom.<ref name=\"Dalmia 2005\" /><ref name=\"Rao 1980\" /> \nThe demand for dowry has increased over time.<ref name=\"srinivasan 2004\">{{cite journal\n| last    = Srinivasan\n| first   = Padma\n| author2 = Gary R.

In the north, marriage usually follows a [[patrilocal]] (lives with husband's family) system, where the groom is a non-related member of the family. This system encourages dowry perhaps due to the exclusion of the bride's family after marriage as a form of [[premortem]] [[inheritance]] for the bride.<ref name=\"Dalmia 2005\" /> In the south, marriage is more often conducted within the bride's family, for example with close relatives or cross-cousins, and in a closer physical distance to her family.  In addition, brides may have the ability to [[Inheritance|inherit]] land, which makes her more valuable in the marriage, decreasing the chance of dowry over the [[bride price]] system.<ref name=\"Dalmia 2005\" />\n\nIn addition to marriage customs that may influence dowry, social customs or [[rituals]], and parents expectations of dowry are important factors to consider.  A 1995 study showed that while attitudes of people are changing about dowry, dowry continues to prevail.<ref name=\"Rao 1980\">{{cite journal\n| last    = Rao\n| first   = V.V.

It is widespread among [[Hindus]] and other religions. For example, Indian [[Muslims]] call dowry as ''jahez'', justify the practice in terms of jahez-e-fatimi. Islamists classify jahez into two categories: The first comprises some essential articles for the outfit of the bride as well as for conjugal life. The other is made up of valuable goods, clothes, jewelry, an amount of money for the groom's family, which is settled on after bargaining. The ''jahez'' often far exceeds the cost of the ''[[baraat]]'' and marriage parties. The ''jahez'' is separate from cash payment as ''[[Mahr]]'' or dower that Sharia religious law requires.<ref name=Waheed />\n\n== Dowry in the modern era ==\n[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|300px|A social awareness campaign in India about dowries]]\nDowry has been a prevalent practice in India's modern era and in this context, it can be in the form of a payment of cash or gifts from the bride's family to the bridegroom's family upon marriage. There are variations on dowry prevalence based on geography and [[class (social)|class]].

Circa 1800.]]\nThe history of dowry in [[South Asia]] is not clear. Some scholars believe dowry was practiced in antiquity, but some do not. Historical eyewitness reports, as discussed below, suggest dowry in ancient India was insignificant, and daughters had inheritance rights, which by custom were exercised at the time of their marriage. Documentary evidence suggests that at the beginning of 20th century bride price, rather than dowry was the common custom, which often resulted in very poor boys remaining unmarried.<ref>Muni Buddhmal, Terapanth ke Drudhdharmi Shravak Arjunlalji Porwal, Kesrimal ji Surana Abhinanda Granth, 1982, p95</ref><ref>Parwar Directory, Pub.  Singhai Pannalal Raes ed. Pandit Tulsiram, 1924, p. 15</ref>\n\nStanley J.Tambiah claims the ancient [[Code of Manu]] sanctioned dowry and bridewealth in ancient India, but dowry was the more prestigious form and associated with the [[Brahmanic]] (priestly) caste. [[Bridewealth]] was restricted to the lower [[castes]], who were not allowed to give dowry. He cites two studies from the early 20th century with data to suggest that this pattern of dowry in upper castes and [[bridewealth]] in lower [[castes]] has persisted through the first half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Tambiah\n| first     = Stanley\n| title     = Bridewealth and Dowry\n| year      = 1973\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| location  = Cambridge UK\n| pages     = 68\u20139\n| author2   = Goody, Jack\n}}</ref> However, it is that marriages involved both reciprocal gifts between the two families, claims Tambiah, so that insofar as the groom's family gives the bridewealth, it tends to be given back as the culturally validated dowry to the bride as part of her conjugal estate.<ref>{{cite book\n| last      = Tambiah\n| first     = Stanley\n| title     = Bridewealth and Dowry\n| year      = 1973\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| location  = Cambridge UK\n| page      = 71\n| author2   = Goody, Jack\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Witzel]], in contrast, claims the ancient Indian literature suggests dowry practices were not significant during the [[Vedic period]].<ref>Witzel, Michael. \"Little Dowry, No Sati: The Lot of Women in the Vedic Period.\" ''Journal of South Asia Women Studies'' 2, no. 4 (1996).</ref> Witzel also notes that women in ancient India had property inheritance rights either by appointment or when they had no brothers.\n\nThe findings of MacDonell and Keith are similar to Witzel, and differ from Tambiah; they cite ancient Indian literature suggesting bridewealth was paid even in [[brahma]]- and [[daiva]]-types of marriage associated with the [[Brahmanic]] (priestly) upper caste. Dowry was not infrequent when the girl suffered from some bodily defect. Property rights for women increased in ancient India, suggest MacDonell and Keith, over the Epics era (200 BC to 700 AD).<ref>MacDonell, Arthur and Keith, Arthur. ''Vedic Index: Names and Subjects'', Indian Text Series (John Murray, London, 1912), Volume 1:482-485 \u30da\u30fc\u30b8\u51fa\u7248</ref>\n\nKane claims ancient literature suggests [[bridewealth]] was paid only in the [[asura]]-type of marriage that was considered reprehensible and forbidden by [[Manusm\u1e5bti|Manu]] and other ancient Indian scribes. Lochtefeld suggests that religious duties listed by [[Manusm\u1e5bti|Manu]] and others, such as 'the bride be richly adorned to celebrate marriage' were ceremonial dress and jewelry along with gifts that were her property, not property demanded by or meant for the groom; Lochtefeld further notes that bridal adornment is not currently considered as dowry in most people's mind.<ref>James G.

Available eyewitness observations from ancient India give a different picture. One of these are the eyewitness records from [[Alexander the Great]] conquest (''ca''. 300 BC) as recorded by Arrian and Megasthenes.

The daughter took this inheritance amount with her when she married, claimed Al-Biruni, and she had no rights to income from her parents after her marriage or to any additional inheritance after her father's death. If her father died before her marriage, her guardian would first pay off her father's debt, then allocate a fourth of the remaining wealth to her upkeep till she is ready to marry, and then give the rest to her to take with her into her married life.<ref>Edward Sachau (Translat</ref>\n\n== Causes of the dowry ==\nVarious reasons have been suggested as cause of dowry practice in India.

In 1956, India gave equal legal status to daughters and sons among [[Hindu]], [[Sikh]] and [[Jain]] families, under the [[Hindu Succession Act]] (India grants its Muslim population the [[Sharia]] derived personal status laws). Despite the new inheritance law, dowry has continued as a process whereby parental property is distributed to a daughter at her marriage by a social process, rather than after parents death by a slow court supervised process under [[Hindu Succession Act]] (1956).<ref>Lucy Carroll (1991), Daughter's Right of Inheritance in India: A Perspective on the Problem of Dowry, Modern Asian Studies, Vol. 25, No. 4, pages 791-809</ref>\n\nDowry gave, at least in theory, women economic and [[Economic security|financial security]] in their marriage in the form of movable goods. This helped prevent family wealth break-up and provided security to the bride at the same time.<ref name=\"Dalmia 2005\" /> This system can also be used as a [[premortem]] inheritance, as once a woman is presented with movable gifts, she may be cut off from the [[family estate]].<ref name=\"Teays 1991\">{{cite journal\n| last    = Teays\n| first   = Wanda\n| title   = The Burning Bride: The Dowry Problem in India\n| journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion\n| year    = 1991\n| volume  = 7\n| issue   = 2\n| pages   = 29\u201352\n}}</ref>\n\nFor many, dowry has become a greater financial burden on the family, and can leave families [[destitute]] based on the demands from the groom.<ref name=\"Dalmia 2005\" /><ref name=\"Rao 1980\" /> \nThe demand for dowry has increased over time.<ref name=\"srinivasan 2004\">{{cite journal\n| last    = Srinivasan\n| first   = Padma\n| author2 = Gary R.

In the north, marriage usually follows a [[patrilocal]] (lives with husband's family) system, where the groom is a non-related member of the family. This system encourages dowry perhaps due to the exclusion of the bride's family after marriage as a form of [[premortem]] [[inheritance]] for the bride.<ref name=\"Dalmia 2005\" /> In the south, marriage is more often conducted within the bride's family, for example with close relatives or cross-cousins, and in a closer physical distance to her family.  In addition, brides may have the ability to [[Inheritance|inherit]] land, which makes her more valuable in the marriage, decreasing the chance of dowry over the [[bride price]] system.<ref name=\"Dalmia 2005\" />\n\nIn addition to marriage customs that may influence dowry, social customs or [[rituals]], and parents expectations of dowry are important factors to consider.  A 1995 study showed that while attitudes of people are changing about dowry, dowry continues to prevail.<ref name=\"Rao 1980\">{{cite journal\n| last    = Rao\n| first   = V.V.

It is widespread among [[Hindus]] and other religions. For example, Indian [[Muslims]] call dowry as ''jahez'', justify the practice in terms of jahez-e-fatimi. Islamists classify jahez into two categories: The first comprises some essential articles for the outfit of the bride as well as for conjugal life. The other is made up of valuable goods, clothes, jewelry, an amount of money for the groom's family, which is settled on after bargaining. The ''jahez'' often far exceeds the cost of the ''[[baraat]]'' and marriage parties. The ''jahez'' is separate from cash payment as ''[[Mahr]]'' or dower that Sharia religious law requires.<ref name=Waheed />\n\n== Dowry in the modern era ==\n[[File:Say no to dowry.jpg|thumb|300px|A social awareness campaign in India about dowries]]\nDowry has been a prevalent practice in India's modern era and in this context, it can be in the form of a payment of cash or gifts from the bride's family to the bridegroom's family upon marriage. There are variations on dowry prevalence based on geography and [[class (social)|class]].

In first book of the Pentateuch, the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Israelites]] had come to live in Egypt in the [[Land of Goshen]] during a famine due to the fact that an Israelite, [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], had become a high official in the court of the [[pharaoh]]. Exodus begins with the deaths of Joseph and the ascension of a new pharaoh \"who did not know Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8). The pharaoh becomes concerned by the number and strength of Israelites in Egypt and enslaves them, commanding them to build at two \"supply cities\" called [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Rameses]] (Exodus 1:11).{{efn|The [[Septuagint]] version includes a reference to a third \"supply city\": \" On,  which  is  [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]\" (LXX Exodus 1:11, trans. Larry J. Perkins).}} The pharaoh also orders the slaughter at birth of all male Hebrew children. One Hebrew child, however, is rescued by being placed in a basket on the [[Nile]]. He is found and adopted by [[Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus)|Pharaoh's daughter]], who names him [[Moses]]. Moses eventually kills an Egyptian he sees beating a Hebrew slave, and is forced to flee to [[Midian]], marrying a daughter of the Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. The old pharaoh dies and a new one ascends to the throne.\n\nMoses, in Midian, goes to [[Mount Horeb]], where [[Yahweh]] appears in a [[Burning Bush]] and commands him to go to Egypt to free the Hebrew slaves and bring them to the [[promised land]] in [[Canaan]]. Yahweh also speaks to Moses's brother [[Aaron]]; they both assemble the Israelites and perform signs so that they believe in Yahweh's promise. Moses and Aaron then go to the Pharaoh and ask him to let the Israelites go into the desert for a religious festival, but the Pharaoh refuses and commands the Israelites to make [[bricks without straw]] and increases their workload. Moses and Aaron return to the Pharaoh and this time ask him to free the Israelites. The Pharaoh demands for Moses to perform a [[miracle]], and Aaron throws down [[Staff of Moses|Moses' staff]], which turns into a snake; however, the Pharaoh's magicians{{efn|These magicians are referred to in the Hebrew text as {{lang|he|\u1e25artumm\u00eem|italics=yes}}, which derives from [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] {{lang|egy|\u1e25rj-tp|italic=yes}} ([[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] {{lang|egy|p-hritob|italics=yes}}, {{lang-akk|\u1e25ar-tibi|italic=yes}}) a title meaning \"chief\" and shortened from \"chief lector priest\".{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=139}} The Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate Moses and Aaron's actions until the third plague (gnats), when they are the first to recognize that a divine power is at work (Exodus 8:19). In plague four (festering boils), they themselves are afflicted and no longer contest with Moses and Aaron.{{sfn|Assmann|2018|pp=139-142}}}} are also able to do this, though Moses' staff devours the others. The Pharaoh then refuses to let the Israelites go.\n\n[[File:Israel's Escape from Egypt.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Exodus from Egypt by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\nAfter this, Yahweh begins inflicting the [[Plagues of Egypt]] on the Egyptians for each time that Moses goes to Pharaoh and Pharaoh refuses to release the Israelites. Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate the first plagues, in which Yahweh turns the Nile to blood and produces a plague of frogs, but are unable to reproduce any plagues after the third, the plague of gnats. After each plague Pharaoh allows the Israelites to worship Yahweh to remove the plague, then refuses to free them. In the final plague, Yahweh kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, but the Israelites, who have been commanded to kill one lamb per family and smear its blood on their doorposts, are spared. Yahweh commands that the Israelites observe a festival as \"a perpetual ordinance\" to remember this event (Exodus 12:14). Pharaoh finally agrees to let the Israelites go after his firstborn son is killed. Yahweh leads the Israelites in the form of a [[pillar of cloud]] in the day and a [[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] at night. However, once the Israelites have already left, Pharaoh changes his mind and pursues the Israelites to the shore of the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses his staff to [[parting of the Red Sea|part the Red Sea]], and the Israelites cross on dry ground, but the sea closes down on the pursuing Egyptians, drowning them all.\n\nThe Israelites now begin to complain about Aaron and Moses, as Yahweh miraculously provided them first with water and food, eventually raining [[manna]] down for them to eat. [[Amalek]] attacks at [[Rephidim]] but is defeated in battle. Jethro comes to Moses with Moses's wife and sons; on Jethro's advice, Moses appoints judges for the tribes of Israel. The Israelites reach the [[Sinai Desert]] and Yahweh calls Moses to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where [[Yahweh]] reveals himself to his people and establishes the [[Ten Commandments]] and [[Mosaic covenant]]: the Israelites are to keep his ''torah'' (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will give them the land of Canaan. Yahweh establishes the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] and various rules for ritual worship, among other laws. However, in Moses's absence the Israelites sin against Yahweh by creating the idol of a [[golden calf]], and as retaliation Yahweh has the [[Levites]] kill three thousand people (Exodus 32:28) and Yahweh sends a plague on the Israelites. The Israelites now accept the covenant, build a [[tabernacle]] for Yahweh, and receive their laws. Yahweh commands Moses to take a [[census]] of the Israelites and establishes the duties of the Levites. Then the Israelites depart from Mount Sinai.\n\nYahweh commands Moses to send [[The Twelve Spies|twelve spies]] ahead to Canaan to scout the land. The spies discover that the Canaanites are strong, and, believing that the Israelites cannot defeat them, the spies falsely report to the Israelites that Canaan is full of giants so that the Israelites will not invade (Numbers 13:31-33). The Israelites refuse to go to Canaan, so Yahweh manifests himself and declares that the generation that left Egypt will have to pass away before the Israelites can enter Canaan. The Israelites will have to remain in the wilderness for forty years, and Yahweh kills the spies through a plague except for the righteous [[Joshua]] and [[Caleb]], who will be allowed to enter the promised land. A group of Israelites led by [[Korah]], son of Izhar, rebels against Moses, but Yahweh opens the earth and sends them living to [[Sheol]].\n\nThe Israelites come to the oasis of [[Kadesh Barnea]], where [[Miriam]] dies. The people are without water, so Yahweh commands Moses to get water from a rock by speaking to it, but Moses strikes the rock with his staff instead, for which Yahweh forbids him from entering the promised land. Moses sends a messenger to the king of [[Edom]] requesting passage through his land to Canaan, but the king refuses. The Israelites then go to [[Mount Hor]], where Aaron dies. The Israelites try to go around Edom, but the Israelites complain about lack of bread and water, so Yahweh sends a plague of poisonous snakes to afflict them. After Moses prays for deliverance, Yahweh has him create the [[brazen serpent]], and the Israelites who look at it are cured. The Israelites are soon in conflict with various other kingdoms, and king [[Balak]] of [[Moab]] attempts to have the seer [[Balaam]] curse the Israelites, but Balaam blesses the Israelites instead. Some Israelites begin having sexual relations with Moabite women and [[Heresy of Peor|worshipping Moabite gods]], so Yahweh orders Moses to [[impalement|impale]] the idolators and sends a plague, but the full extent of Yahweh's wrath is averted when [[Phinehas]] impales an Israelite and a Midianite woman having intercourse (Numbers 25:7-9). Yahweh commands the Israelites to destroy the Midianites and Moses and Phinehas take another census. They then conquer the lands of [[Og]] and [[Sihon]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], settling the [[Gadites]], [[Reubenites]], and half the [[Tribe of Manasseh]] there.\n\nMoses then addresses the Israelites for a final time on the banks of the [[Jordan River]], reviewing their travels and giving them further laws. Yahweh tells Moses to summon Joshua, whom Yahweh commissions to lead the conquest of Canaan. Yahweh tells Moses to ascend [[Mount Nebo]], from where he sees the promised land and where he dies.\n\n===Covenant and law===\nThe climax of the Exodus is the covenant (binding legal agreement) between God and Israel mediated by Moses at Sinai: Yahweh will protect Israel as his chosen people for all time, and  Israel will keep Yahweh's laws and worship only him.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The covenant is described in stages: at Exodus 24:3\u20138 the Israelites agree to abide by the \"book of the covenant\" that Moses has just read to them; shortly afterwards God writes the \"words of the covenant\" \u2013 the [[Ten Commandments]] \u2013 on stone tablets; and finally, as the people gather in Moab to cross into Canaan, the land God has promised them, Moses makes a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel \"beside the covenant he made with them at Horeb\" (Deuteronomy 29:1).{{sfn|McKenzie|2000|p=4\u20135}} The laws are set out in a number of codes:{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=146}}\n* [[Ethical Decalogue]] (i.e., the Ten Commandments), Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5;\n* The [[Covenant Code|Book of the Covenant]], Exodus 20:22\u201323:3;\n* [[Ritual Decalogue]], Exodus 34;\n* The ritual laws of [[Leviticus]] 1\u20136 and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1\u201310;\n* The [[Holiness Code]], Leviticus 17\u201326;\n* Deuteronomic Code, [[Deuteronomy]] 12\u201326.\n\n==Development and final composition==\n[[File:109.Ezra Reads the Law to the People.jpg|thumb|''Ezra Reads the Law to the People'' ([[Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']], 1866)]]\nThe earliest traces of the traditions behind the exodus appear in the northern prophets [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (possibly) and [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] (certainly), both active in the 8th century BCE in  northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], but their southern contemporaries [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and [[Book of Micah|Micah]] show no knowledge of an exodus.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}} (Micah 6:45 contains a reference to the exodus, which many scholars take to be an addition by a later editor.){{efn|Micah 6:45 (\"I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.

Weinberg and called the \"Citizen-Temple Community\", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=226\u2013227}} The books containing the Exodus story served as an \"identity card\" defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=225}}\n\n== Origins and historicity ==\n{{See also|Sources and parallels of the Exodus|Historicity of the Bible}}\nThere are two main positions on the historicity of the Exodus in modern scholarship.{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}} The majority position is that the biblical Exodus narrative has some ultimate historicity, although there is little of historical worth in the biblical narrative.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}}{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} The other main position, often associated with the school of [[Biblical minimalism]],{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=23-24}} is that the Exodus has no historical basis. Both positions are in agreement that the biblical Exodus narrative is best understood as a [[founding myth]] of the Jewish people, explaining their origins and providing an ideological foundation for their culture and institutions, not an accurate depiction of the history of the Israelites.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} A third position, that the biblical narrative is essentially correct (\"Biblical maximalism\"), is today held by \"few, if any [...] in mainstream scholarship, only on the more fundamentalist fringes.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}}\n\nMainstream scholarship no longer accepts the biblical Exodus account as accurate history for a number of reasons. No modern attempt to identify a historical Egyptian prototype for Moses has found wide acceptance, and no period in Egyptian history matches the Biblical accounts of the Exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=63-64}} Some elements of the story are clearly meant to be [[Miracle|miraculous]] and defy rational explanation, such as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] and the [[Crossing of the Red Sea]].{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=15-17}} Lester Grabbe argues that \"attempts to find naturalistic explanations [for these events] [...] miss the point: the aim of the narrative is to magnify the power of Yhwh and Moses.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=93}} The Bible also fails to mention the names of any of the Pharaohs involved in the Exodus narrative.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=69}} While [[ancientEgypt|ancient Egyptian]] texts from the [[New Kingdom]] mention \"Asiatics\" living in Egypt as slaves and workers, these people cannot be securely connected to the Israelites, and no contemporary Egyptian text mentions a large-scale exodus of slaves like that described in the Bible.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|pp=2-3}} The earliest surviving historical mention of the Israelites, the Egyptian [[Merneptah Stele]] (c. 1207 BCE), appears to place them in or around Canaan and gives no indication of any exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=65-67}} The numbers of people involved in the Exodus as given in the Bible are fanciful, as the [[Sinai Desert]] could never have supported the 603,550 Israelites mentioned in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1:46.{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=18-19}} Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion \u2013 that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible \u2013 seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence.\"{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=63}} Instead, modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlement, indicating a primarily Canaanite origin for Israel.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}\n\nA majority of scholars nevertheless still believes that the Exodus has some historical basis,{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} with Kenton Sparks referring to it as \"mythologized history.\"{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} Evidence in favor of historical traditions forming a background to the Exodus myth include the documented movements of small groups of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] into and out of Egypt during the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] and [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasties]], some elements of Egyptian [[folklore]] and culture in the Exodus narrative,{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=8-10}} and the names Moses, Aaron and Phinehas, which seem to have an Egyptian origin.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=65}} The expulsion of the [[Hyksos]], a Semitic group that had conquered much of Egypt, by the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt]] is frequently discussed as a potential historical parallel or origin for the story.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=78}}{{sfn|Redford|1992|pp=412\u2013413}} Avraham Faust and William Dever argue that a group of Egyptian origin, whom Dever cautiously identifies as \"the house of Joseph\",{{sfn|Dever|2003|p=231}} may have joined the Israelites after their initial [[ethnogenesis|formation]] in Canaan, and that their story could have become adopted as the national myth of the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=229\u2013231}}  It is also possible that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the late second millennium BCE may have aided the adoption of the story of a small group of Egyptian refugees by the native Canaanites among the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}} Most proposals for a historical Exodus of any sort place it in the sixteenth, fifteenth, or thirteenth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=77}} Alternatively, Nadav Na'aman argues that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the Nineteenth and especially the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] may have inspired the Exodus narrative, forming a \"[[collective memory]]\" of Egyptian oppression that was transferred from Canaan to Egypt itself in the popular consciousness.{{sfn|Na'aman|2011|pp=62-69}}\n\nSome scholars, including the biblical minimalists, show more skepticism toward ascribing any [[historicity]] at all to the exodus,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=95}}\nwith some arguing that the myth has its origins in the [[Babylonian exile|exilic]] and post-exilic Jewish community and has little to no historical basis.{{sfn|Russell|2009|pp=11-14}} Lester Grabbe, for instance, argues that \"[t]here is no compelling reason that the exodus has to be rooted in history,\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=84}} and that the details of the story more closely fit the seventh through the fifth centuries BCE than the traditional dating to the second millennium BCE.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=85}} Rejecting the traditional view that the Exodus records pre-exilic traditions, Philip R. Davies suggests that the story may have been inspired by the return to Israel of Israelites and Judaeans who were placed in Egypt as garrison troops by the [[Assyria]]ns in the fifth and sixth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=105}} Historian Graham Davies has criticized minimalist scholars for relying too heavily on archaeology, stating \"a historian cannot simply ignore the textual evidence (both biblical and non-biblical) that is relevant to an issue, and in this case the textual evidence purports, at least, to give a different view from that which archaeologists now tend to favor (or most of them, anyway).\"{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=25}}\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting, commemorating the Passover and Exodus]]\nThe Exodus is invoked daily in [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Jewish prayers]] and celebrated each year at the feasts of [[Pesach]] (Passover) and [[Shavuot]], the two being known respectively as \"the time of our freedom\" and \"the time our Torah was given\".{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The two are closely linked, with Pesach announcing that the freedom it introduces is only fully realised with the giving of the law (the Torah).{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} A third Jewish festival, [[Sukkot]], the Festival of Booths, is associated with the Israelites living in booths after they left their previous homes in Egypt.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The festivals now associated with the Exodus (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot) began as agricultural and seasonal feasts but became completely subsumed into the central Exodus myth of Israel's deliverance from oppression at the hands of God.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The fringes worn at the corners of traditional Jewish prayer shawls are described as a physical reminder of the obligation to observe the laws given at the climax of Exodus: \"Look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord\" (Numbers).{{sfn|Sarason|2015|p=53}}\n\nA number of historical events and situations have been compared to the Exodus. Many early American settlers interpreted their flight from Europe to a new life in America as a new exodus. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] recommended for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to depict Moses leading the Israelites across the Red Sea. African Americans suffering under slavery and racial oppression interpreted their situation in terms of the Exodus, making it a catalyst for social change.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=107}}{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=335}}{{sfn|Coomber|2012|p=123}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible|Judaism}}\n* [[Book of Joshua]], the continuation of the narrative in the conquest of Canaan\n* [[Ipuwer Papyrus]]\n* [[List of films based on the Bible#Moses (Exodus-Deuteronomy)|List of films related to the Exodus]]\n* [[Stations of the Exodus]]\n* [[Va'eira]], [[Bo (parsha)]], and [[Beshalach]]: [[parsha|Torah portions (''parashot'')]] telling the Exodus story\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last1          = Anderson\n| first1         = Bradford A.\n| last2          = Gooder\n| first2         = Paula\n| author-link2   = Paula Gooder\n| title          = An Introduction to the Study of the Pentateuch\n| year           = 2017\n| publisher      = Bloomsbury \n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=ebXFDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT135&dq=%22how+then+to+explain+the+emergence+of+the+exodus+tradition#v=onepage&q=%22how%20then%20to%20explain%20the%20emergence%20of%20the%20exodus%20tradition%3F%22&f=false\n| isbn           = 9780567656407\n| ref            = harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = The Invention of Religion: Faith and Covenant in the Book of Exodus\n| publisher      = Princeton University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=K7s7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| year           = 2018\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9781400889235\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt\n| publisher      = Harvard University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/books?id=IjUiie30Z9cC&pg=PA34\n| year           = 2009\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9780674020306\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|first=Jan \n|last=Assmann\n|title=From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsjmCwAAQBAJ\n|year=2014\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|isbn=978-977-416-631-0\n|ref=harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Bandstra\n| first          = Barry L.\n| title          = Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n| year           = 2008\n| publisher      = Cengage Learning\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn           = 978-0495391050\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Barmash\n| first          = Pamela\n| chapter        = Introduction: The Exodus: Central, Learning, and Generative\n| editor1-last   = Barmash\n| editor1-first  = Pamela\n| editor2-last   = Nelson\n| editor2-first  = W.

The covenant's terms are that Yahweh will protect his [[chosen people]], as long as they will keep his laws and exclusively worship him.{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}}{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The Exodus and its laws remain central to [[Judaism]], recounted daily in [[Jewish prayers]] and celebrated in festivals such as [[Passover]], as well as resonating with non-Jewish groups, from early American settlers fleeing persecution in Europe to [[African Americans]] striving for freedom and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]].{{sfn|Berlin|Brettler|2004}} [[Jan Assmann]] refers to it as possibly \"the most grandiose and influential story ever told.\"{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=1}}\n\nThe consensus of modern scholars is that the Bible does not give an accurate account of the origins of Israel, which formed as an entity in the central highlands of [[Canaan]] in the late second millennium BCE from the indigenous [[Canaanites|Canaanite]] culture.{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}}{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=6\u20137}}{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=81}} Most scholars believe that the story of the Exodus has some historical basis, but that any such basis has little resemblance to the story told in the Bible.{{sfn|Faust|2015|page=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} There is a widespread agreement that the composition of the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch, the biblical books which contain the Exodus narrative, took place in the [[Yehud Medinata|Middle Persian Period]] (5th century BCE),{{sfn|Romer|2008|p=2}} although the traditions behind it are older and can be found in the writings of the 8th-century BCE [[prophet]]s.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=63}}\n\n==Biblical narrative==\n===Narrative===\n[[File:1867 Edward Poynter - Israel in Egypt.jpg|thumb|400px|''Israel in Egypt'' ([[Edward Poynter]], 1867)]]\nThe story of the Exodus is told in the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]], the last four of the first five books of the bible (also called the [[Torah]] or Pentateuch). In first book of the Pentateuch, the [[Book of Genesis]], the [[Israelites]] had come to live in Egypt in the [[Land of Goshen]] during a famine due to the fact that an Israelite, [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], had become a high official in the court of the [[pharaoh]]. Exodus begins with the deaths of Joseph and the ascension of a new pharaoh \"who did not know Joseph\" (Exodus 1:8). The pharaoh becomes concerned by the number and strength of Israelites in Egypt and enslaves them, commanding them to build at two \"supply cities\" called [[Pithom]] and [[Pi-Ramesses|Rameses]] (Exodus 1:11).{{efn|The [[Septuagint]] version includes a reference to a third \"supply city\": \" On,  which  is  [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]]\" (LXX Exodus 1:11, trans. Larry J. Perkins).}} The pharaoh also orders the slaughter at birth of all male Hebrew children. One Hebrew child, however, is rescued by being placed in a basket on the [[Nile]]. He is found and adopted by [[Pharaoh's daughter (Exodus)|Pharaoh's daughter]], who names him [[Moses]]. Moses eventually kills an Egyptian he sees beating a Hebrew slave, and is forced to flee to [[Midian]], marrying a daughter of the Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. The old pharaoh dies and a new one ascends to the throne.\n\nMoses, in Midian, goes to [[Mount Horeb]], where [[Yahweh]] appears in a [[Burning Bush]] and commands him to go to Egypt to free the Hebrew slaves and bring them to the [[promised land]] in [[Canaan]]. Yahweh also speaks to Moses's brother [[Aaron]]; they both assemble the Israelites and perform signs so that they believe in Yahweh's promise. Moses and Aaron then go to the Pharaoh and ask him to let the Israelites go into the desert for a religious festival, but the Pharaoh refuses and commands the Israelites to make [[bricks without straw]] and increases their workload. Moses and Aaron return to the Pharaoh and this time ask him to free the Israelites. The Pharaoh demands for Moses to perform a [[miracle]], and Aaron throws down [[Staff of Moses|Moses' staff]], which turns into a snake; however, the Pharaoh's magicians{{efn|These magicians are referred to in the Hebrew text as {{lang|he|\u1e25artumm\u00eem|italics=yes}}, which derives from [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] {{lang|egy|\u1e25rj-tp|italic=yes}} ([[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] {{lang|egy|p-hritob|italics=yes}}, {{lang-akk|\u1e25ar-tibi|italic=yes}}) a title meaning \"chief\" and shortened from \"chief lector priest\".{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=139}} The Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate Moses and Aaron's actions until the third plague (gnats), when they are the first to recognize that a divine power is at work (Exodus 8:19). In plague four (festering boils), they themselves are afflicted and no longer contest with Moses and Aaron.{{sfn|Assmann|2018|pp=139-142}}}} are also able to do this, though Moses' staff devours the others. The Pharaoh then refuses to let the Israelites go.\n\n[[File:Israel's Escape from Egypt.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Exodus from Egypt by the Providence Lithograph Company, 1907]]\nAfter this, Yahweh begins inflicting the [[Plagues of Egypt]] on the Egyptians for each time that Moses goes to Pharaoh and Pharaoh refuses to release the Israelites. Pharaoh's magicians are able to replicate the first plagues, in which Yahweh turns the Nile to blood and produces a plague of frogs, but are unable to reproduce any plagues after the third, the plague of gnats. After each plague Pharaoh allows the Israelites to worship Yahweh to remove the plague, then refuses to free them. In the final plague, Yahweh kills all the firstborn children of Egypt, but the Israelites, who have been commanded to kill one lamb per family and smear its blood on their doorposts, are spared. Yahweh commands that the Israelites observe a festival as \"a perpetual ordinance\" to remember this event (Exodus 12:14). Pharaoh finally agrees to let the Israelites go after his firstborn son is killed. Yahweh leads the Israelites in the form of a [[pillar of cloud]] in the day and a [[Pillar of fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] at night. However, once the Israelites have already left, Pharaoh changes his mind and pursues the Israelites to the shore of the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses his staff to [[parting of the Red Sea|part the Red Sea]], and the Israelites cross on dry ground, but the sea closes down on the pursuing Egyptians, drowning them all.\n\nThe Israelites now begin to complain about Aaron and Moses, as Yahweh miraculously provided them first with water and food, eventually raining [[manna]] down for them to eat. [[Amalek]] attacks at [[Rephidim]] but is defeated in battle. Jethro comes to Moses with Moses's wife and sons; on Jethro's advice, Moses appoints judges for the tribes of Israel. The Israelites reach the [[Sinai Desert]] and Yahweh calls Moses to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], where [[Yahweh]] reveals himself to his people and establishes the [[Ten Commandments]] and [[Mosaic covenant]]: the Israelites are to keep his ''torah'' (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will give them the land of Canaan. Yahweh establishes the [[Kohen|Aaronic priesthood]] and various rules for ritual worship, among other laws. However, in Moses's absence the Israelites sin against Yahweh by creating the idol of a [[golden calf]], and as retaliation Yahweh has the [[Levites]] kill three thousand people (Exodus 32:28) and Yahweh sends a plague on the Israelites. The Israelites now accept the covenant, build a [[tabernacle]] for Yahweh, and receive their laws. Yahweh commands Moses to take a [[census]] of the Israelites and establishes the duties of the Levites. Then the Israelites depart from Mount Sinai.\n\nYahweh commands Moses to send [[The Twelve Spies|twelve spies]] ahead to Canaan to scout the land. The spies discover that the Canaanites are strong, and, believing that the Israelites cannot defeat them, the spies falsely report to the Israelites that Canaan is full of giants so that the Israelites will not invade (Numbers 13:31-33). The Israelites refuse to go to Canaan, so Yahweh manifests himself and declares that the generation that left Egypt will have to pass away before the Israelites can enter Canaan. The Israelites will have to remain in the wilderness for forty years, and Yahweh kills the spies through a plague except for the righteous [[Joshua]] and [[Caleb]], who will be allowed to enter the promised land. A group of Israelites led by [[Korah]], son of Izhar, rebels against Moses, but Yahweh opens the earth and sends them living to [[Sheol]].\n\nThe Israelites come to the oasis of [[Kadesh Barnea]], where [[Miriam]] dies. The people are without water, so Yahweh commands Moses to get water from a rock by speaking to it, but Moses strikes the rock with his staff instead, for which Yahweh forbids him from entering the promised land. Moses sends a messenger to the king of [[Edom]] requesting passage through his land to Canaan, but the king refuses. The Israelites then go to [[Mount Hor]], where Aaron dies. The Israelites try to go around Edom, but the Israelites complain about lack of bread and water, so Yahweh sends a plague of poisonous snakes to afflict them. After Moses prays for deliverance, Yahweh has him create the [[brazen serpent]], and the Israelites who look at it are cured. The Israelites are soon in conflict with various other kingdoms, and king [[Balak]] of [[Moab]] attempts to have the seer [[Balaam]] curse the Israelites, but Balaam blesses the Israelites instead. Some Israelites begin having sexual relations with Moabite women and [[Heresy of Peor|worshipping Moabite gods]], so Yahweh orders Moses to [[impalement|impale]] the idolators and sends a plague, but the full extent of Yahweh's wrath is averted when [[Phinehas]] impales an Israelite and a Midianite woman having intercourse (Numbers 25:7-9). Yahweh commands the Israelites to destroy the Midianites and Moses and Phinehas take another census. They then conquer the lands of [[Og]] and [[Sihon]] in [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], settling the [[Gadites]], [[Reubenites]], and half the [[Tribe of Manasseh]] there.\n\nMoses then addresses the Israelites for a final time on the banks of the [[Jordan River]], reviewing their travels and giving them further laws. Yahweh tells Moses to summon Joshua, whom Yahweh commissions to lead the conquest of Canaan. Yahweh tells Moses to ascend [[Mount Nebo]], from where he sees the promised land and where he dies.\n\n===Covenant and law===\nThe climax of the Exodus is the covenant (binding legal agreement) between God and Israel mediated by Moses at Sinai: Yahweh will protect Israel as his chosen people for all time, and  Israel will keep Yahweh's laws and worship only him.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=28-29}} The covenant is described in stages: at Exodus 24:3\u20138 the Israelites agree to abide by the \"book of the covenant\" that Moses has just read to them; shortly afterwards God writes the \"words of the covenant\" \u2013 the [[Ten Commandments]] \u2013 on stone tablets; and finally, as the people gather in Moab to cross into Canaan, the land God has promised them, Moses makes a new covenant between Yahweh and Israel \"beside the covenant he made with them at Horeb\" (Deuteronomy 29:1).{{sfn|McKenzie|2000|p=4\u20135}} The laws are set out in a number of codes:{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=146}}\n* [[Ethical Decalogue]] (i.e., the Ten Commandments), Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5;\n* The [[Covenant Code|Book of the Covenant]], Exodus 20:22\u201323:3;\n* [[Ritual Decalogue]], Exodus 34;\n* The ritual laws of [[Leviticus]] 1\u20136 and [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1\u201310;\n* The [[Holiness Code]], Leviticus 17\u201326;\n* Deuteronomic Code, [[Deuteronomy]] 12\u201326.\n\n==Development and final composition==\n[[File:109.Ezra Reads the Law to the People.jpg|thumb|''Ezra Reads the Law to the People'' ([[Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Gustave Dor\u00e9's illustrations for ''La Grande Bible de Tours'']], 1866)]]\nThe earliest traces of the traditions behind the exodus appear in the northern prophets [[Book of Amos|Amos]] (possibly) and [[Book of Hosea|Hosea]] (certainly), both active in the 8th century BCE in  northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], but their southern contemporaries [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] and [[Book of Micah|Micah]] show no knowledge of an exodus.{{sfn|Lemche|1985|p=327}} (Micah 6:45 contains a reference to the exodus, which many scholars take to be an addition by a later editor.){{efn|Micah 6:45 (\"I brought you up out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; I sent Moses to lead you, also Aaron and Miriam.

Weinberg and called the \"Citizen-Temple Community\", proposes that the Exodus story was composed to serve the needs of a post-exilic Jewish community organised around the Temple, which acted in effect as a bank for those who belonged to it.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=226\u2013227}} The books containing the Exodus story served as an \"identity card\" defining who belonged to this community (i.e., to Israel), thus reinforcing Israel's unity through its new institutions.{{sfn|Ska|2006|p=225}}\n\n== Origins and historicity ==\n{{See also|Sources and parallels of the Exodus|Historicity of the Bible}}\nThere are two main positions on the historicity of the Exodus in modern scholarship.{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}} The majority position is that the biblical Exodus narrative has some ultimate historicity, although there is little of historical worth in the biblical narrative.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}}{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} The other main position, often associated with the school of [[Biblical minimalism]],{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=23-24}} is that the Exodus has no historical basis. Both positions are in agreement that the biblical Exodus narrative is best understood as a [[founding myth]] of the Jewish people, explaining their origins and providing an ideological foundation for their culture and institutions, not an accurate depiction of the history of the Israelites.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}}{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} A third position, that the biblical narrative is essentially correct (\"Biblical maximalism\"), is today held by \"few, if any [...] in mainstream scholarship, only on the more fundamentalist fringes.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=36}}\n\nMainstream scholarship no longer accepts the biblical Exodus account as accurate history for a number of reasons. No modern attempt to identify a historical Egyptian prototype for Moses has found wide acceptance, and no period in Egyptian history matches the Biblical accounts of the Exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=63-64}} Some elements of the story are clearly meant to be [[Miracle|miraculous]] and defy rational explanation, such as the [[Plagues of Egypt]] and the [[Crossing of the Red Sea]].{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=15-17}} Lester Grabbe argues that \"attempts to find naturalistic explanations [for these events] [...] miss the point: the aim of the narrative is to magnify the power of Yhwh and Moses.\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2017|p=93}} The Bible also fails to mention the names of any of the Pharaohs involved in the Exodus narrative.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=69}} While [[ancientEgypt|ancient Egyptian]] texts from the [[New Kingdom]] mention \"Asiatics\" living in Egypt as slaves and workers, these people cannot be securely connected to the Israelites, and no contemporary Egyptian text mentions a large-scale exodus of slaves like that described in the Bible.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|pp=2-3}} The earliest surviving historical mention of the Israelites, the Egyptian [[Merneptah Stele]] (c. 1207 BCE), appears to place them in or around Canaan and gives no indication of any exodus.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|pp=65-67}} The numbers of people involved in the Exodus as given in the Bible are fanciful, as the [[Sinai Desert]] could never have supported the 603,550 Israelites mentioned in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 1:46.{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=18-19}} Archaeologists [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] say that while archaeology has found traces left by small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion \u2013 that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible \u2013 seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence.\"{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=63}} Instead, modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlement, indicating a primarily Canaanite origin for Israel.{{sfn|Barmash|2015b|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}\n\nA majority of scholars nevertheless still believes that the Exodus has some historical basis,{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} with Kenton Sparks referring to it as \"mythologized history.\"{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} Evidence in favor of historical traditions forming a background to the Exodus myth include the documented movements of small groups of [[Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] into and out of Egypt during the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] and [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasties]], some elements of Egyptian [[folklore]] and culture in the Exodus narrative,{{sfn|Meyers|2005|pp=8-10}} and the names Moses, Aaron and Phinehas, which seem to have an Egyptian origin.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=65}} The expulsion of the [[Hyksos]], a Semitic group that had conquered much of Egypt, by the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt]] is frequently discussed as a potential historical parallel or origin for the story.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=78}}{{sfn|Redford|1992|pp=412\u2013413}} Avraham Faust and William Dever argue that a group of Egyptian origin, whom Dever cautiously identifies as \"the house of Joseph\",{{sfn|Dever|2003|p=231}} may have joined the Israelites after their initial [[ethnogenesis|formation]] in Canaan, and that their story could have become adopted as the national myth of the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|pp=476\u2013477}}{{sfn|Dever|2003|pp=229\u2013231}}  It is also possible that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the late second millennium BCE may have aided the adoption of the story of a small group of Egyptian refugees by the native Canaanites among the Israelites.{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=477}} Most proposals for a historical Exodus of any sort place it in the sixteenth, fifteenth, or thirteenth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=77}} Alternatively, Nadav Na'aman argues that oppressive Egyptian rule of Canaan during the Nineteenth and especially the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]] may have inspired the Exodus narrative, forming a \"[[collective memory]]\" of Egyptian oppression that was transferred from Canaan to Egypt itself in the popular consciousness.{{sfn|Na'aman|2011|pp=62-69}}\n\nSome scholars, including the biblical minimalists, show more skepticism toward ascribing any [[historicity]] at all to the exodus,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=95}}\nwith some arguing that the myth has its origins in the [[Babylonian exile|exilic]] and post-exilic Jewish community and has little to no historical basis.{{sfn|Russell|2009|pp=11-14}} Lester Grabbe, for instance, argues that \"[t]here is no compelling reason that the exodus has to be rooted in history,\"{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=84}} and that the details of the story more closely fit the seventh through the fifth centuries BCE than the traditional dating to the second millennium BCE.{{sfn|Grabbe|2014|p=85}} Rejecting the traditional view that the Exodus records pre-exilic traditions, Philip R. Davies suggests that the story may have been inspired by the return to Israel of Israelites and Judaeans who were placed in Egypt as garrison troops by the [[Assyria]]ns in the fifth and sixth centuries BCE.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=105}} Historian Graham Davies has criticized minimalist scholars for relying too heavily on archaeology, stating \"a historian cannot simply ignore the textual evidence (both biblical and non-biblical) that is relevant to an issue, and in this case the textual evidence purports, at least, to give a different view from that which archaeologists now tend to favor (or most of them, anyway).\"{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=25}}\n\n==Cultural significance==\n[[File:A Seder table setting.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A Seder table setting, commemorating the Passover and Exodus]]\nThe Exodus is invoked daily in [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Jewish prayers]] and celebrated each year at the feasts of [[Pesach]] (Passover) and [[Shavuot]], the two being known respectively as \"the time of our freedom\" and \"the time our Torah was given\".{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The two are closely linked, with Pesach announcing that the freedom it introduces is only fully realised with the giving of the law (the Torah).{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} A third Jewish festival, [[Sukkot]], the Festival of Booths, is associated with the Israelites living in booths after they left their previous homes in Egypt.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The festivals now associated with the Exodus (Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot) began as agricultural and seasonal feasts but became completely subsumed into the central Exodus myth of Israel's deliverance from oppression at the hands of God.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=106}} The fringes worn at the corners of traditional Jewish prayer shawls are described as a physical reminder of the obligation to observe the laws given at the climax of Exodus: \"Look at it and recall all the commandments of the Lord\" (Numbers).{{sfn|Sarason|2015|p=53}}\n\nA number of historical events and situations have been compared to the Exodus. Many early American settlers interpreted their flight from Europe to a new life in America as a new exodus. [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] recommended for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] to depict Moses leading the Israelites across the Red Sea. African Americans suffering under slavery and racial oppression interpreted their situation in terms of the Exodus, making it a catalyst for social change.{{sfn|Tigay|2004|p=107}}{{sfn|Assmann|2018|p=335}}{{sfn|Coomber|2012|p=123}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible|Judaism}}\n* [[Book of Joshua]], the continuation of the narrative in the conquest of Canaan\n* [[Ipuwer Papyrus]]\n* [[List of films based on the Bible#Moses (Exodus-Deuteronomy)|List of films related to the Exodus]]\n* [[Stations of the Exodus]]\n* [[Va'eira]], [[Bo (parsha)]], and [[Beshalach]]: [[parsha|Torah portions (''parashot'')]] telling the Exodus story\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last1          = Anderson\n| first1         = Bradford A.\n| last2          = Gooder\n| first2         = Paula\n| author-link2   = Paula Gooder\n| title          = An Introduction to the Study of the Pentateuch\n| year           = 2017\n| publisher      = Bloomsbury \n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=ebXFDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT135&dq=%22how+then+to+explain+the+emergence+of+the+exodus+tradition#v=onepage&q=%22how%20then%20to%20explain%20the%20emergence%20of%20the%20exodus%20tradition%3F%22&f=false\n| isbn           = 9780567656407\n| ref            = harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = The Invention of Religion: Faith and Covenant in the Book of Exodus\n| publisher      = Princeton University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=K7s7DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| year           = 2018\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9781400889235\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Assmann\n| first          = Jan\n| title          = Moses the Egyptian: The Memory of Egypt\n| publisher      = Harvard University Press\n| url            = https://books.google.com/books?id=IjUiie30Z9cC&pg=PA34\n| year           = 2009\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn          = 9780674020306\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|first=Jan \n|last=Assmann\n|title=From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VsjmCwAAQBAJ\n|year=2014\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|isbn=978-977-416-631-0\n|ref=harv\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Bandstra\n| first          = Barry L.\n| title          = Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible\n| year           = 2008\n| publisher      = Cengage Learning\n| url            = https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| ref            = harv\n| isbn           = 978-0495391050\n}}\n:  {{cite book\n| last           = Barmash\n| first          = Pamela\n| chapter        = Introduction: The Exodus: Central, Learning, and Generative\n| editor1-last   = Barmash\n| editor1-first  = Pamela\n| editor2-last   = Nelson\n| editor2-first  = W.

He was the youngest of nine siblings. The producer and director [[Chetan Anand (producer and director)|Chetan Anand]] and the celebrated actor [[Dev Anand]] were his brothers, and among his sister was Sheel Kanta Kapur, mother of film director [[Shekhar Kapur]].<ref>Page 1, ''Romancing with Life&nbsp;\u2014 an autobiography'' by Dev Anand, Penguin books India (2007){{ISBN missing}}</ref>\n\nVijay married his niece, Sushma Kohli, the daughter of his older sister. This uncle-niece pairing is forbidden in much of Indian society and was a scandal when it happened. The couple married in the face of resistance from many quarters, not least their own families, but they had a happy marriage which lasted all their lives. They were blessed with a son, Vaibhav.<ref>http://huntnews.in/p/detail/c2446ea2731904ae8bb5fabbc433cd2f?xlang=en&uc_param_str=dnfrpfbivesscpgimibtbmntnijblauputoggdnw&pos=1456492056000&channel=entertainment&chncat=english {{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref><ref>http://www.bollywood.com/vijay-anands-family-ignored-iffi</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThough Vijay Anand has had a career as an actor, screenwriter, editor, and producer, he will primarily be remembered as a director. He made his directorial debut in 1957 with ''[[Nau Do Gyarah]].'' The film, where Vijay's brother Dev Anand played the leading role, was shot in only 40 days.<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040307/spectrum/main5.htm Profile], tribuneindia.com, 7 March 2004.</ref>\n\nSome of Vijay's other successful movies as director are ''[[Kala Bazar]]'' (1960), ''[[Guide (1965 film)|Guide]]'' (1965), ''[[Teesri Manzil]]'' (1966), ''[[Jewel Thief]]'' (1967), ''[[Johny Mera Naam]]'' (1970), ''[[Tere Mere Sapne (1971 film)|Tere Mere Sapne]]'' (1971), ''[[Ram Balram]]'' and ''[[Rajput]].'' Nearly all of these films were made by [[Navketan films]], the production company started by the Anand brothers themselves. A notable exception was ''Teesri Manzil'', which was produceb by [[Nasir Hussain]]. The period 1957-1970 must be reckoned the High Noon of Vijay Anand's career, as is evident from the films listed above. Vijay's 1965 film ''Guide'' starring Dev Anand and [[Waheeda Rehman]], which was based on [[R.K. Narayan]]'s novel of the same name, marked the acme of Vijay Anand's career. It was not only his biggest blockbuster but also his most critically acclaimed movie, celebrated by the masses, the classes and music-lovers alike. Navketan attempted an international release of an English-language remake of ''Guide,'' but without success.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nVijay Anand is known for his stylish song picturization, such as the numbers; \"O Haseena\" (''[[Teesri Manzil]]'' ), \"Kaaton Se Kheech ke yeh aanchal\" (''[[Guide (1965 film)|Guide]]'' ) and \"Honthon Mein Aisi Baat\" (''[[Jewel Thief]]'' ).<ref>[http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2004/feb/24rah1.htm rediff.com: The man who revolutionised Hindi film songs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs an actor, his most memorable roles were in the films ''[[Haqeeqat (1964 film)|Haqeeqat]]'' (1964), ''[[Kora Kagaz]]'' (1974), (in which he starred opposite [[Jaya Bachchan]]) and ''[[Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki]]'' (1978). ''Chor Chor'' was a  songless thriller in which Leena Chandavarkar was his heroine.

He was the youngest of nine siblings. The producer and director [[Chetan Anand (producer and director)|Chetan Anand]] and the celebrated actor [[Dev Anand]] were his brothers, and among his sister was Sheel Kanta Kapur, mother of film director [[Shekhar Kapur]].<ref>Page 1, ''Romancing with Life&nbsp;\u2014 an autobiography'' by Dev Anand, Penguin books India (2007){{ISBN missing}}</ref> \n\nVijay got married to his niece, Sushma Kohli, who was the daughter of Vijay's own older sister. This uncle-niece pairing is forbidden in much of Indian society and was a scandal when it happened. The couple married in the face of resistance from many quarters, not least their own families, but they had a happy marriage which lasted all their lives. They were blessed with a son, Vaibhav.<ref>http://huntnews.in/p/detail/c2446ea2731904ae8bb5fabbc433cd2f?xlang=en&uc_param_str=dnfrpfbivesscpgimibtbmntnijblauputoggdnw&pos=1456492056000&channel=entertainment&chncat=english {{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref><ref>http://www.bollywood.com/vijay-anands-family-ignored-iffi</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThough Vijay Anand has had a career as an actor, screenwriter, editor, and producer, he will primarily be remembered as a director. He made his directorial debut in 1957 with ''[[Nau Do Gyarah]].'' The film, where Vijay's brother Dev Anand played the leading role, was shot in only 40 days.<ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040307/spectrum/main5.htm Profile], tribuneindia.com, 7 March 2004.</ref>\n\nSome of Vijay's other successful movies as director are ''[[Kala Bazar]]'' (1960), ''[[Guide (1965 film)|Guide]]'' (1965), ''[[Teesri Manzil]]'' (1966), ''[[Jewel Thief]]'' (1967), ''[[Johny Mera Naam]]'' (1970), ''[[Tere Mere Sapne (1971 film)|Tere Mere Sapne]]'' (1971), ''[[Ram Balram]]'' and ''[[Rajput]].'' Nearly all of these films were made by [[Navketan films]], the production company started by the Anand brothers themselves. A notable exception was ''Teesri Manzil'', which was produceb by [[Nasir Hussain]]. The period 1957-1970 must be reckoned the High Noon of Vijay Anand's career, as is evident from the films listed above. Vijay's 1965 film ''Guide'' starring Dev Anand and [[Waheeda Rehman]], which was based on [[R.K. Narayan]]'s novel of the same name, marked the acme of Vijay Anand's career. It was not only his biggest blockbuster but also his most critically acclaimed movie, celebrated by the masses, the classes and music-lovers alike. Navketan attempted an international release of an English-language remake of ''Guide,'' but without success.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nVijay Anand is known for his stylish song picturization, such as the numbers; \"O Haseena\" (''[[Teesri Manzil]]'' ), \"Kaaton Se Kheech ke yeh aanchal\" (''[[Guide (1965 film)|Guide]]'' ) and \"Honthon Mein Aisi Baat\" (''[[Jewel Thief]]'' ).<ref>[http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2004/feb/24rah1.htm rediff.com: The man who revolutionised Hindi film songs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAs an actor, his most memorable roles were in the films ''[[Haqeeqat (1964 film)|Haqeeqat]]'' (1964), ''[[Kora Kagaz]]'' (1974), (in which he starred opposite [[Jaya Bachchan]]) and ''[[Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki]]'' (1978).

Transfer molding is different from [[compression molding]] in that the mold is enclosed [Hayward] rather than open to the fill plunger resulting in higher dimensional tolerances and less environmental impact.<ref name = \"Ornaghi\">{{Cite journal|last1=Ornaghi|first1=Heitor Luiz|last2=Bolner|first2=Alexandre Sonaglio|last3=Fiorio|first3=Rudinei|last4=Zattera|first4=Ademir Jose|last5=Amico|first5=Sandro Campos|date=2010-10-15|title=Mechanical and dynamic mechanical analysis of hybrid composites molded by resin transfer molding|journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|language=en|volume=118|issue=2|pages=887\u2013896|doi=10.1002/app.32388|issn=1097-4628}}</ref> Compared to [[Injection moulding|injection molding]], transfer molding uses higher pressures to uniformly fill the mold cavity. This allows thicker reinforcing fiber matrices to be more completely saturated by resin.<ref name=\"Ornaghi\" /> Furthermore, unlike injection molding the transfer mold casting material may start the process as a solid. This can reduce equipment costs and time dependency. The transfer process may have a slower fill rate than an equivalent injection molding processes.<ref name=\"Ornaghi\" />\n\n== Process ==\n[[File:Transfer molding.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Transfer Molding basic process]]\nThe mold interior surfaces may be gel-coated. If desired the mold is first pre-loaded with a reinforcing fiber matrix or preform.<ref name=\"Ornaghi\" /> Fiber content of a transfer molded composite can be as high as 60% by volume. The fill material may be a preheated solid or a liquid. It is loaded into a chamber known as the pot. A ram or plunger forces material from the pot into the heated mold cavity. If feed-stock is initially solid, the forcing pressure and mold temperature melt it.  Standard mold features such as sprue channels, a flow gate and ejector pins may be used. The heated mold ensures that the flow remains liquid for complete filling. Once filled the mold can be cooled at a controlled rate for optimal thermoset curing.\n\n== Variations ==\nThe industry identifies a variety of processes within the transfer molding category.  There are areas of overlap and the distinctions between each method may not be clearly defined.\n\n=== Resin transfer molding ===\n[[File:RTM process.png|thumb|Figure 2: Resin Transfer Molding 1: Cope 2: Drag 3: Clamp 4: Mixing chamber 5: Fiber preform 6: Heated mold 7: Resin 8: Curative]]\nResin transfer molding (RTM) uses a liquid thermoset resin to saturate a fiber preform placed in a closed mold.

Transfer molding is different from [[compression molding]] in that the mold is enclosed [Hayward] rather than open to the fill plunger resulting in higher dimensional tolerances and less environmental impact.<ref name = \"Ornaghi\">{{Cite journal|last1=Ornaghi|first1=Heitor Luiz|last2=Bolner|first2=Alexandre Sonaglio|last3=Fiorio|first3=Rudinei|last4=Zattera|first4=Ademir Jose|last5=Amico|first5=Sandro Campos|date=2010-10-15|title=Mechanical and dynamic mechanical analysis of hybrid composites molded by resin transfer molding|journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|language=en|volume=118|issue=2|pages=887\u2013896|doi=10.1002/app.32388|issn=1097-4628}}</ref> Compared to [[Injection moulding|injection molding]], transfer molding uses higher pressures to uniformly fill the mold cavity. This allows thicker reinforcing fiber matrices to be more completely saturated by resin.<ref name=\"Ornaghi\" /> Furthermore, unlike injection molding the transfer mold casting material may start the process as a solid. This can reduce equipment costs and time dependency. The transfer process may have a slower fill rate than an equivalent injection molding processes.<ref name=\"Ornaghi\" />\n\n== Process ==\n[[File:Transfer molding.svg|thumb|Figure 1: Transfer Molding basic process]]\nThe mold interior surfaces may be gel-coated. If desired the mold is first pre-loaded with a reinforcing fiber matrix or preform.<ref name=\"Ornaghi\" /> Fiber content of a transfer molded composite can be as high as 60% by volume. The fill material may be a preheated solid or a liquid. It is loaded into a chamber known as the pot. A ram or plunger forces material from the pot into the heated mold cavity. If feed-stock is initially solid, the forcing pressure and mold temperature melt it.  Standard mold features such as sprue channels, a flow gate and ejector pins may be used. The heated mold ensures that the flow remains liquid for complete filling. Once filled the mold can be cooled at a controlled rate for optimal thermoset curing.\n\n== Variations ==\nThe industry identifies a variety of processes within the transfer molding category.  There are areas of overlap and the distinctions between each method may not be clearly defined.\n\n=== Resin transfer molding ===\n[[File:RTM process.png|thumb|Figure 2: Resin Transfer Molding 1: Cope 2: Drag 3: Clamp 4: Mixing chamber 5: Fiber preform 6: Heated mold 7: Resin 8: Curative]]\nResin transfer molding (RTM) uses a liquid thermoset resin to saturate a fiber preform placed in a closed mold.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods.\n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas informed Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back as they thought nut seemd to be massing. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook started making plans to shift their corps closer  together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by building fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually dispersed through the corps of the army with two of the regiments, 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana being assigned to the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods.\n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas informed Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back as they thought nut seemd to be massing. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook started making plans to shift their corps closer  together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by building fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually dispersed through the corps of the army with two of the regiments, 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana being assigned to the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.
