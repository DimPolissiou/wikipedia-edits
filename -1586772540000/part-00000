Holmes was the subject of several books, a lengthy [[essay]] in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and two feature-length documentaries, and was the inspiration for two Hollywood movies (''[[Boogie Nights]]'' and ''[[Wonderland (2003 film)|Wonderland]]'').\n\n== Early life ==\nHolmes was born John Curtis Estes on August 8, 1944, in the small [[rural area|rural]] town of [[Ashville, Ohio|Ashville]], [[Ohio]], about {{convert|11|mi}} south of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. He was the youngest of four children born to 26-year-old Mary June (n\u00e9e Barton) Holmes, but the name of his father, [[rail transport|railroad]] worker Carl Estes, is left blank on his [[birth certificate]]. Mary had married Edgar Harvey Holmes, who was the father of her three older children - Dale, Edward and Anne. She and Holmes were married and [[divorce|divorced]] three times, as is documented by wedding certificates dated April 13, 1936, August 13, 1945, and September 12, 1947.<ref>Marriage records for Mary Barton Holmes and Edgar Holmes as researched at Familysearch.org  https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939L-FHK9-R, https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939L-F8D8-K https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:9392-B19G-F7 {{registration required}}</ref> At the time of their first marriage in 1936, Edgar was 35 years old and divorced, while Mary was 17.<ref name=\"Ohio marriage records\">{{cite web|title=Ohio marriage records|url= https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:9392-B19G-F7|website=FamilySearch.org}}{{registration required}}</ref> After divorcing for the third and final time, Edgar and Mary each married one more time.<ref>https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:939L-FH4R-X  https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KDMM-Y4X  {{registration required}}</ref>\n\nMary changed John's [[surname]] from Estes to Holmes when he was a child. In 1986, when Holmes applied for a passport for the first time prior to a trip to [[Italy]], his mother reportedly provided him with the handwritten copy of his original birth certificate, which led Holmes to learn that his biological father was Carl Estes.\n\nHolmes' mother was said to be a devout [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] and with her children regularly attended church in [[Millport, Pickaway County, Ohio|Millport]]. In contrast, his stepfather Edgar was an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who would come home inebriated, stumble about the house and even [[vomiting|vomit]] on the children. As a child, Holmes enjoyed a reprieve from his turbulent home life when he visited his maternal grandparents, John W. and Bessie (n\u00e9e Gillenwater) Barton.<ref name=\"Ohio marriage records\"/> Mary divorced Edgar when Holmes was a toddler and moved with her children to Columbus, where they lived in a [[affordable housing|low-income]] apartment project with a friend of Mary's and her own two children. The two women worked as clerks and waitresses in order to support their young children.\n\nWhen Holmes was age seven, his mother married Harold Bowman on December 31, 1951. Shortly afterward, Holmes and his family moved from Columbus and settled in the small town of [[Pataskala, Ohio|Pataskala]], about 17 miles east. Holmes recalled that Bowman was a good father until Holmes' younger half-brother David was born, at which point Bowman reportedly lost interest in his [[stepchildren]] and began neglecting them.<ref name=amerson/><ref name=wadd/>\n\nHolmes left home at age 15 and enlisted in the [[United States Army|Army]], with his mother's written permission. He spent most of the three years of his military service in [[West Germany]] in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].<ref name=wadd/> Upon his [[Military discharge|honorable discharge]] in 1963, Holmes moved to [[Los Angeles]], where he worked in a variety of jobs, including selling goods door-to-door and tending the vats at a [[Pearson Candy Company, Inc.#Signature Product: Pearson Coffee Nip|Coffee Nips]] factory. During his stint as an [[ambulance]] driver, Holmes met a [[nurse]] named Sharon Gebenini in December 1964.

The success of the film ''Johnny Wadd'' created an immediate demand for follow-ups, so Chinn followed up the same year with ''Flesh of the Lotus.'' Most of the subsequent Johnny Wadd films were written and directed by Chinn and produced by the Los Angeles-based company Freeway Films.\n\nWith the success of ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972), ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' (1973), [[porn chic|porn became chic]], although its legality was still hotly contested.

Professionally, it affected his ability to maintain an [[erection]], as is apparent from his flaccid performance in ''[[Insatiable (1980 film)|Insatiable]]'' (1980). To support himself and his drug habit, Holmes ventured into crime, selling drugs for gangs, [[Prostitution|prostituting]] himself to both men and women, as well as committing [[credit card fraud]] and various acts of [[petty theft]]. In 1976, Holmes met 15-year-old Dawn Schiller, whom he [[Child grooming|groomed]] and abused. After he became desperate for money, he forced her into prostitution and often beat her, which he did at least once in public.<ref>{{cite news|title=Holmes' Confession in Bathtub: Told Wife of Role in 4 Murders|date=April 14, 1988 |work=Los Angeles Times|author=Robert W.

In turn, Coxx introduced Holmes to [[Eddie Nash]], a drug dealer who owned several nightclubs, including the [[Starwood (nightclub)|Starwood]] in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/mb/peejay/kingdong4.html|title=King Dong|page=4}}</ref> At the same time, Holmes was closely associated with the [[Wonderland Gang]], a group of [[heroin]]-addicted cocaine dealers, so called for the [[rowhouse]] located on Wonderland Avenue in the [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, out of which they operated. Holmes frequently sold drugs for the gang. Gang members included [[Ron Launius|Ronnie Lee Launius]], [[David Clay Lind]], Joy Gold Miller, Billy DeVerell, and their wheel-man, [[Tracy McCourt]].\n\nAfter using more than his share of the gang's drugs,<ref name=\"In Too Deep\">{{cite news|title=In Too Deep|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Holmes was in trouble with the gang. In June 1981, Holmes told the gang's leaders, [[David Clay Lind]] and Ron Launius, about a large stash of drugs, money and jewelry Nash had in his house. Holmes helped to set up a [[Wonderland Gang#Nash robbery|home invasion and armed robbery]] that was committed on the morning of June 29, 1981. Although Holmes was not present during the robbery, Nash apparently suspected he had a part in it. After [[Forced confession|forcing Holmes to confess to his participation]] and threatening his life and those of Holmes' family, Nash dispatched [[Mob enforcer|enforcers]] and Holmes to exact [[revenge]] against the gang.\n\nIn the early hours of July 1, 1981, four of the gang's members were found murdered and a fifth severely battered and near death in their rowhouse. Holmes was allegedly present during the murders and left a left palm print (not \"bloody\" as Los Angeles media outlets covering the story erroneously reported) over one victim's [[Headboard (furniture)|headboard]], but it is unclear whether he participated in the killings. Holmes was questioned but was released due to lack of evidence; he refused to cooperate with the investigation. After spending nearly five months on the run with Schiller, Holmes was arrested in [[Florida]] on December 4, 1981 by former LAPD homicide detectives Frank Tomlinson and Tom Lange (who later gained fame for his involvement in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]]). Holmes was [[extradition|extradited]] to Los Angeles, and in March 1982, he was charged with personally committing all four murders. After a three-week trial, he was [[acquittal|acquitted]] of all charges except committing [[contempt of court]] on June 26, 1982.<ref>{{cite web |last=Scheeres |first=Julia |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/john_holmes/10.html |title=Miami \u2014 The Wonderland Murders \u2014 Crime Library |publisher=Trutv.com |accessdate=2014-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103184736/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/john_holmes/10.html |archive-date=January 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The murder trial was a landmark in the history of American trial procedure, as it was the first in which [[videotape]] was introduced as evidence.<ref>\"Wadd: The Life and Times of John C.

His drug addiction continued off-and-on, and although work was still plentiful, it was no longer as lucrative as it had been with the advent of cheaply made videotapes that saturated the porn market. Most of the feature porn films and videos he made during the 1980s were little more than [[cameo appearances]].\n\nIn February 1986, five or six months after testing negative, Holmes was diagnosed as [[HIV]]-positive. According to his second wife [[Misty Dawn|Laurie Holmes]], he claimed that he never used [[hypodermic needle]]s and that [[fear of needles|he was deathly afraid of them]]. Gebenini and friend/former colleague [[Bill Amerson]] separately confirmed later that Holmes could not have contracted HIV from intravenous drug use because he never used needles.<ref name=amerson/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1986, Holmes was offered a lucrative deal from Paradise Visuals, which was unaware he was HIV-positive, to travel to Italy to film what were to be his last two pornographic films. Holmes' penultimate film was ''The Rise of the Roman Empress'' (originally released in Italy as ''Carne bollente'') for director [[Riccardo Schicchi]].

In 1986, when Holmes applied for a passport for the first time prior to a trip to [[Italy]], his mother reportedly provided him with the handwritten copy of his original birth certificate, which led Holmes to learn that his biological father was Carl Estes.\n\nHolmes' mother was said to be a devout [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] and with her children regularly attended church in [[Millport, Pickaway County, Ohio|Millport]]. In contrast, his stepfather Edgar was an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] who would come home inebriated, stumble about the house and even [[vomiting|vomit]] on the children. As a child, Holmes enjoyed a reprieve from his turbulent home life when he visited his maternal grandparents, John W. and Bessie (n\u00e9e Gillenwater) Barton.<ref name=\"Ohio marriage records\"/> Mary divorced Edgar when Holmes was a toddler and moved with her children to Columbus, where they lived in a [[affordable housing|low-income]] apartment project with a friend of Mary's and her own two children. The two women worked as clerks and waitresses in order to support their young children.\n\nWhen Holmes was age seven, his mother married Harold Bowman on December 31, 1951. Shortly afterward, Holmes and his family moved from Columbus and settled in the small town of [[Pataskala, Ohio|Pataskala]], about 17 miles east.

To support himself and his drug habit, Holmes ventured into crime, selling drugs for gangs, [[Prostitution|prostituting]] himself to both men and women, as well as committing [[credit card fraud]] and various acts of [[petty theft]].

Holmes frequently sold drugs for the gang. Gang members included [[Ron Launius|Ronnie Lee Launius]], [[David Clay Lind]], Joy Gold Miller, Billy DeVerell, and their wheel-man, [[Tracy McCourt]].\n\nAfter using more than his share of the gang's drugs,<ref name=\"In Too Deep\">{{cite news|title=In Too Deep|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Holmes was in trouble with the gang. In June 1981, Holmes told the gang's leaders, [[David Clay Lind]] and Ron Launius, about a large stash of drugs, money and jewelry Nash had in his house. Holmes helped to set up a [[Wonderland Gang#Nash robbery|home invasion and armed robbery]] that was committed on the morning of June 29, 1981. Although Holmes was not present during the robbery, Nash apparently suspected he had a part in it. After [[Forced confession|forcing Holmes to confess to his participation]] and threatening his life and those of Holmes' family, Nash dispatched [[Mob enforcer|enforcers]] and Holmes to exact [[revenge]] against the gang.\n\nIn the early hours of July 1, 1981, four of the gang's members were found murdered and a fifth severely battered and near death in their rowhouse. Holmes was allegedly present during the murders and left a left palm print (not \"bloody\" as Los Angeles media outlets covering the story erroneously reported) over one victim's [[Headboard (furniture)|headboard]], but it is unclear whether he participated in the killings. Holmes was questioned but was released due to lack of evidence; he refused to cooperate with the investigation. After spending nearly five months on the run with Schiller, Holmes was arrested in [[Florida]] on December 4, 1981 by former LAPD homicide detectives Frank Tomlinson and Tom Lange (who later gained fame for his involvement in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]]). Holmes was [[extradition|extradited]] to Los Angeles, and in March 1982, he was charged with personally committing all four murders. After a three-week trial, he was [[acquittal|acquitted]] of all charges except committing [[contempt of court]] on June 26, 1982.<ref>{{cite web |last=Scheeres |first=Julia |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/john_holmes/10.html |title=Miami \u2014 The Wonderland Murders \u2014 Crime Library |publisher=Trutv.com |accessdate=2014-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103184736/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/john_holmes/10.html |archive-date=January 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The murder trial was a landmark in the history of American trial procedure, as it was the first in which [[videotape]] was introduced as evidence.<ref>\"Wadd: The Life and Times of John C.

His drug addiction continued off-and-on, and although work was still plentiful, it was no longer as lucrative as it had been with the advent of cheaply made videotapes that saturated the porn market. Most of the feature porn films and videos he made during the 1980s were little more than [[cameo appearances]].\n\nIn February 1986, five or six months after testing negative, Holmes was diagnosed as [[HIV]]-positive. According to his second wife [[Misty Dawn|Laurie Holmes]], he claimed that he never used [[hypodermic needle]]s and that [[fear of needles|he was deathly afraid of them]]. Gebenini and friend/former colleague [[Bill Amerson]] separately confirmed later that Holmes could not have contracted HIV from intravenous drug use because he never used needles.<ref name=amerson/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1986, Holmes was offered a lucrative deal from Paradise Visuals, which was unaware he was HIV-positive, to travel to Italy to film what were to be his last two pornographic films. Holmes' penultimate film was ''The Rise of the Roman Empress'' (originally released in Italy as ''Carne bollente'') for director [[Riccardo Schicchi]].
