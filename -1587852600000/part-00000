He suggested that, \"We should use the same media to remove the misconceptions, misquotations, misinterpretations, and misrepresentations about Islam.\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/> He claimed, [[western power]]s and [[western media|media]] play a double-standard strategy, who describe Muslims as [[extremist]]s and [[fundamentalist]]s to defame Islam.<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/><ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> He said, \"The maximum damage done to the image of Islam today is by the international media which is bombarding misconceptions about it day and night using an array of strategies. International media, be it print, audio, video, or online, use a number of strategies to malign Islam by first picking up the black sheep of the Muslim community, and portraying them as though they are exemplary Muslims.\" Naik also claimed the \"third and fourth\" strategy by international media is \"to pick a word from [[Quran]] or [[sunnah]] and mistranslate it\" and \"to malign Islam by saying something that does not belong to it\".<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nNaik also said, \"If a Muslim woman wears [[hijab]] or veil it is labeled as women subjugation, but if a [[nun]] does to the same it turns into a sign of respect and modesty. A 50-year-old Muslim marrying a 16-year-old girl (willingly) is a headline, but a 50-year-old non-Muslim raping a six-year-old girl appears as brief news or filler. They say Islam does not give [[Women's rights|rights to women]], and is an illogical [[religion]]. They portray Islam as the problem of humanity though it is the solution to all man's problems. The same applies to the misinterpreted words 'fundamentalist' and 'extremist' which are basically western words.<ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> A true Muslim must be an extremist in the correct direction, by being extremely kind, loving, tolerant, honest and just. While [[Indian people|Indians]] were [[Indian independence movement|fighting for their freedom]], the [[British government]] was labelling them as terrorists; same activity, same people, but two different labels. The same happened with Muslims who are labelled as terrorists in media, so we should look into backgrounds and reasons for an activity before labelling people.\" <ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nHe criticizes the portrayal of Muslims in films saying, \"Hundreds of movies were made in [[Hollywood]] to malign the image of Islam that a non-Muslim gets scared when he heard a Muslim saying '[[Allah Akbar]]', thinking that he is going to kill him. If anyone really wants to know how good Islam is, he or she has to study its authentic sources; the glorious [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] rather than looking to its followers ([[Muslim]]s) as is the case with a motorist whose reckless driving should be blamed for an accident rather than the latest [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes car]] he was driving. The best exemplary Muslim is the last and final messenger prophet [[Muhammad]], peace be upon him.\" He also criticized media for \"pick(ing) up Muslims who criticised Islam like [[Salman Rushdie]], and giv(ing) them awards\", saying, \"If a Muslim does something great, they may give him credit but ignore his religion or change his Muslim name like the Aristotle of the East, [[Avicenna]], whose real name was \"Ali Ibn Sina\".\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\n=== Other religions ===\n\n====Apostasy====\nNaik believes that Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|convert from Islam]] should not necessarily receive death sentences, but that under Islamic law those who leave Islam<ref name=\"hp10\" /> and then \"propagate the non-Islamic faith and speak against Islam\" should be put to death.<ref name=\"apostat4\">\n[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 \"Maldivian renounces Islam, gets attacked by Zakir Naik audience\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827113937/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 |date=27 August 2013}} May 2010.

He suggested that, \"We should use the same media to remove the misconceptions, misquotations, misinterpretations, and misrepresentations about Islam.\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/> He claimed, [[western power]]s and [[western media|media]] play a double-standard strategy, who describe Muslims as [[extremist]]s and [[fundamentalist]]s to defame Islam.<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/><ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> He said, \"The maximum damage done to the image of Islam today is by the international media which is bombarding misconceptions about it day and night using an array of strategies. International media, be it print, audio, video, or online, use a number of strategies to malign Islam by first picking up the black sheep of the Muslim community, and portraying them as though they are exemplary Muslims.\" Naik also claimed the \"third and fourth\" strategy by international media is \"to pick a word from [[Quran]] or [[sunnah]] and mistranslate it\" and \"to malign Islam by saying something that does not belong to it\".<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nNaik also said, \"If a Muslim woman wears [[hijab]] or veil it is labeled as women subjugation, but if a [[nun]] does to the same it turns into a sign of respect and modesty. A 50-year-old Muslim marrying a 16-year-old girl (willingly) is a headline, but a 50-year-old non-Muslim raping a six-year-old girl appears as brief news or filler. They say Islam does not give [[Women's rights|rights to women]], and is an illogical [[religion]]. They portray Islam as the problem of humanity though it is the solution to all man's problems. The same applies to the misinterpreted words 'fundamentalist' and 'extremist' which are basically western words.<ref name=\"Gambia3\"/> A true Muslim must be an extremist in the correct direction, by being extremely kind, loving, tolerant, honest and just. While [[Indian people|Indians]] were [[Indian independence movement|fighting for their freedom]], the [[British government]] was labelling them as terrorists; same activity, same people, but two different labels. The same happened with Muslims who are labelled as terrorists in media, so we should look into backgrounds and reasons for an activity before labelling people.\" <ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\nHe criticizes the portrayal of Muslims in films saying, \"Hundreds of movies were made in [[Hollywood]] to malign the image of Islam that a non-Muslim gets scared when he heard a Muslim saying '[[Allah Akbar]]', thinking that he is going to kill him. If anyone really wants to know how good Islam is, he or she has to study its authentic sources; the glorious [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] rather than looking to its followers ([[Muslim]]s) as is the case with a motorist whose reckless driving should be blamed for an accident rather than the latest [[Mercedes (marque)|Mercedes car]] he was driving. The best exemplary Muslim is the last and final messenger prophet [[Muhammad]], peace be upon him.\" He also criticized media for \"pick(ing) up Muslims who criticised Islam like [[Salman Rushdie]], and giv(ing) them awards\", saying, \"If a Muslim does something great, they may give him credit but ignore his religion or change his Muslim name like the Aristotle of the East, [[Avicenna]], whose real name was \"Ali Ibn Sina\".\"<ref name=\"Khaleej\"/>\n\n=== Other religions ===\n\n====Apostasy====\nNaik believes that Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|convert from Islam]] should not necessarily receive death sentences, but that under Islamic law those who leave Islam<ref name=\"hp10\" /> and then \"propagate the non-Islamic faith and speak against Islam\" should be put to death.<ref name=\"apostat4\">\n[http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 \"Maldivian renounces Islam, gets attacked by Zakir Naik audience\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827113937/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/news/30405 |date=27 August 2013 }}  May 2010.

In 1980 however, \"CLUB\" as they were commonly known, did manage to avoid relegation from the Professional First Division for the first time in their history. One of the highlights of the season was a 1\u20131 draw with eventual Champions [[Seiko SA]].  On 10 May 1980 at the HK Government Stadium CLUB defeated Kui Tan 1\u20130 with an 87th-minute penalty scored by John McGunnigle, meaning Kui Tan joined Urban Services in the drop that year.\n\nIn the past few years, HKFC opted not to take promotion to the First Division. In 2006, finally, the club accepted the promotion after winning the [[Hong Kong Second Division League|Second Division]].  After showing initial promise, they lost 4 league matches in a row between March and April 2007 and were relegated to the Second Division.  They did however become Champions of the [[Hong Kong Second Division League|Second Division]] again in April 2010 and returned to the [[Hong Kong First Division League|First Division]]. Therefore, HKFC is known as the [[Yo-yo club]] in Hong Kong soccer sector.\n\nIn 2016, two years after the establishment of the fully professional [[Hong Kong Premier League]], HKFC finally decided to seek promotion to the top flight after finishing as runners-up behind [[Tai Po FC|Tai Po]] in the [[2015\u201316 Hong Kong First Division League|2015\u201316 season]]. Their stay in the top flight only lasted a single season, however, as the club finished bottom in [[2016\u201317 Hong Kong Premier League|2016\u201317]] and dropped back down to the First Division.\n\nHKFC won the First Division for the first time in a century during the [[2017\u201318 Hong Kong First Division League|2017\u201318 season]], going unbeaten throughout the entire league campaign.

{"title_page": "Gillnetting", "text_new": "[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|300px|right|Oil painting of gillnetting, ''The salmon fisher'' by [[Eilif Peterssen]].]]\n\n'''Gillnetting''' is a common fishing method used by [[fishing industry|commercial]] and [[Artisanal fishing|artisanal]] fishers of all the oceans and in some freshwater and estuary areas. Gill nets are composed of vertical panels of netting that hang from a line with regularly spaced floaters that hold the line on the surface of the water. The floats are sometimes called \"corks\" and the line with corks is generally referred to as a \"cork line.\" The line along the bottom of the panels is generally weighted. Traditionally this line has been weighted with lead and may be referred to as  \"lead line.\"  A gill net is normally set in a straight line. Gill nets can be characterized by mesh size, as well as colour and type of filament from which they are made. Fish may be caught by gill nets in three ways:\n\n# Wedged&nbsp;\u2013 held by the mesh around the body.\n# Gilled&nbsp;\u2013 held by mesh slipping behind the [[operculum (fish)|opercula]].\n# Tangled&nbsp;\u2013 held by teeth, spines, [[maxilla|maxillaries]], or other protrusions without the body penetrating the mesh.\n\nMost often fish are gilled. A fish swims into a net and passes only part way through the mesh. When it struggles to free itself, the twine slips behind the gill cover and prevents escape.<ref>Murphy, B. and Willis, D. (1996) [http://www.afsbooks.org/x55029xm \"Fisheries Techniques: Second edition.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221024307/http://afsbooks.org/x55029xm |date=2013-02-21 }} Bethesda, MD: American Fisheries Society.</ref>\n\nGillnets are so effective that their use is closely monitored and regulated by fisheries management and [[enforcement]] agencies. [[Mesh size]], twine strength, as well as net length and depth are all closely regulated to reduce [[bycatch]] of non-target species. Gillnets have a high degree of size selectivity. Most [[Salmon#Salmon fisheries|salmon fisheries]] in particular have an extremely low incidence of catching non-target species.<ref>[http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/OSCRP/CRM/docs/Selective_Fisheries_JN_071220.pdf Selective Fisheries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224930/http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/OSCRP/CRM/docs/Selective_Fisheries_JN_071220.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }} ''Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife''.

''The Sea of Galilee and Its Fishermen in the New Testament,'' pp. 28-44. Kibbutz Ein Gev, Kinnereth Sailing Co.</ref> In North America, Native American fishermen used cedar canoes and natural fibre nets, e.g., made with nettles or the inner bark of cedar.<ref>Stewart, Hilary (1977). ''Indian Fishing: Early Methods on the Northwest Coast,'' p.79 in 1st paperback edition, 1982. Seattle, University of Washington Press.</ref> They would attach stones to the bottom of the nets as weights, and pieces of wood to the top, to use as floats. This allowed the net to suspend straight up and down in the water. Each net would be suspended either from shore or between two boats. Native fishers in the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska still commonly use gillnets in their fisheries for [[salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]].\n\nBoth drift gillnets and setnets have long been used by cultures around the world. There is evidence of fisheries exploitation, including gillnetting, going far back in Japanese history, with many specific details available from the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868).<ref>Ruddle, Kenneth and Akimich, Tomoya. \"Sea Tenure in Japan and the Southwestern Ryukyus,\" in Cordell, John, Ed.

London, David and Charles.</ref> These are but a few of the examples of historic gillnet fisheries around the world.\n\nGillnetting was an early fishing technology in colonial America,{{vague|reason=\"Colonial America\" is not a [[proper name]] of any region. (But \"colonial America\" is ambiguous among (at least) the New World, the 13 Colonies, and North America north of the [[Rio Grande]]|date=February 2018}} used for example, in fisheries for Atlantic salmon and shad.<ref>Netboy, Anthony (1973) ''The Salmon: Their Fight for Survival,'' pp. 181-182. Boston, Houghton Mifflin.</ref> Immigrant fishermen from northern Europe and the Mediterranean brought a number of different adaptations of the technology from their respective homelands with them to the rapidly expanding salmon fisheries of the Columbia River from the 1860s onward.<ref>Martin, 1994, p. 44.</ref> The boats used by these fisherman were typically around {{convert|25|ft|m|0}} long and powered by oars. Many of these boats also had small sails and were called \"row-sail\" boats. At the beginning of the 1900s, steam powered ships would haul these smaller boats to their fishing grounds and retrieve them at the end of each day. However, at that time [[gasoline|gas]] powered boats were beginning to make their appearance, and by the 1930s, the row-sail boat had virtually disappeared, except in Bristol Bay, Alaska, where motors were prohibited in the gillnet fishery by territorial law until 1951.<ref>Andrews, Ralph W. and Larsen, A.K. (1959). ''Fish and Ships'', p. 108. Seattle, Superior Publishing Co.</ref>\n[[File:MENDING A GILLNET ON THE DOCK AT ST. HELENS ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER - NARA - 548102.jpg|right|thumb|A fisherman repairs a gillnet (April 1973, [[St. Helens, Oregon]])]]\n\nIn 1931, the first powered drum was created by Laurie Jarelainen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The drum is a circular device that is set to the side of the boat and draws in the nets. The powered drum allowed the nets to be drawn in much faster and along with the faster gas powered boats, fisherman were able to fish in areas they had previously been unable to go into, thereby revolutionizing the fishing industry.\n\nDuring World War II, navigation and communication devices, as well as many other forms of maritime equipment (ex. depth-sounding and radar) were improved and made more compact. These devices became much more accessible to the average fisherman, thus making their range and mobility increasingly larger. It also served to make the industry much more competitive, as the fisherman were forced to invest more in boats and equipment to stay current with developing technology.\n\nThe introduction of fine [[synthetic fibre]]s such as [[nylon]] in the construction of fishing gear during the 1960s marked an expansion in the commercial use of gillnets. The new materials were cheaper and easier to handle, lasted longer and required less maintenance than natural fibres. In addition, [[Multifilament fishing line|multifilament nylon]], [[Monofilament fishing line|monofilament]] or [[Braided fishing line|multimonofilament fibres]] become almost invisible in water, so nets made with synthetic twines generally caught greater numbers of fish than natural fibre nets used in comparable situations.\n\nNylon is highly resistant to abrasion and degradation, hence the netting has the potential to last for many years if it is not recovered. This [[ghost fishing]] is of environmental concern. Attaching the gillnet floats with biodegradable material can reduce the problem.<ref name=\"gillnet\"/> However it is difficult to generalize about the longevity of ghost-fishing gillnets due to the varying environments in which they are used. Some researchers have found gill-nets still catching fish and crustaceans over a year after loss{{ref|Kaiser}}, while others have found lost nets destroyed by wave action within one month{{ref|Puente}} or overgrown with [[seaweed]]s, increasing their visibility and reducing their catching potential to such an extent that they became a microhabitat used by small fish.{{ref|Erzini}}\n\nThis type of net was heavily used by many [[Japan]]ese, [[South Korea]]n, and [[Taiwan]]ese fishing fleets on the high seas in the 1980s to target [[tuna]]s. Although highly selective with respect to size class of animals captured, gillnets are associated with high numbers of incidental captures of [[cetacea]]ns ([[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s). In the Sri Lankan gillnet fishery, one dolphin is caught for every 1.7\u20134.0 tonnes of tuna landed{{ref|Hall}}. This compares poorly with the rate of one dolphin per 70 tonnes of tuna landed in the eastern Pacific [[purse seine]] tuna fishery.\n\nMany types of gillnets are used by [[Fisheries science|fisheries scientists]] to monitor fish populations.<ref>Bruce Crawford. \"Variable Mesh Gill Nets (in Lakes).\" In Johnson, David, et al.

By altering the ratio of floats to weights, buoyancy changes,<ref>Martin 1994, pp. 52-57.</ref> and the net can therefore be set to fish at any depth in the water column. In commercial fisheries, the meshes of a gillnet are uniform in size and shape. Fish smaller than the mesh of the net pass through unhindered, while those too large to push their heads through the meshes as far as their gills are not retained. This gives gillnets the ability to target a specific size of fish, unlike other net gears such as [[trawling|trawls]], in which smaller fish pass through the meshes and all larger fish are captured in the net{{ref|Pawson}}.\n\n===Salmon===\nCommercial gillnet fisheries are still an important method of harvesting [[salmon]] in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. In the lower [[Columbia River]], non-Indian commercial salmon fisheries for spring Chinook have developed methods of selectively harvesting adipose fin clipped hatchery salmon using small mesh gillnets known as [[tangle net]]s or tooth nets.  Non-adipose fin clipped fish (primarily natural origin salmon) must be released.<ref>http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/01353/wdfw01353.pdf</ref> Fishery management agencies estimate a relatively low release [[Fish mortality|mortality rate]] on salmon and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] released from these small mesh gillnets.\n\nProblems that can arise from selective harvesting are smaller reproducing adult fish, as well as the unexpected mortality of the fish which sustain injuries from the gillnet but are not retained in the fishery. Most salmon populations include several [[Age class structure|age classes]], allowing for fish of different ages, and sizes, to reproduce with each other. A recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of [[Bristol Bay]] [[sockeye salmon]] to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests. The study found that the larger females (>550&nbsp;mm) of all age classes were most susceptible to harvest.<ref name=\"Kendall, Neala W 2009\">Kendall, Neala W, Jeffery J. Hard and Thomas P. Quinn. 2009. Quantifying Six Decades of Fishery Selection for Size and Age at Maturity in Sockeye Salmon. Evolutionary Applications. 523-536.</ref> The study suggests that smaller, younger fish were more likely to successfully traverse the gillnet fishery and reproduce than the larger fish. The study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946\u20132005 was 8&nbsp;mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs.<ref name=\"Kendall, Neala W 2009\"/> If a salmon enters a gillnet, but manages to escape, it can sustain injuries. These injuries can lead to a lower degree of reproductive success. A study aimed at quantifying mortality of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon due to gillnet-related injuries found that 11\u201329% of sockeye sustained fishery-related injuries attributable to gillnets, and 51% of those fish were expected to not reproduce.<ref>Baker, Matthew R and Daniel E Schindler. 2009.

Journal of Applied Ecology (46). 752-761.</ref>\n\nGillnets are sometimes a controversial gear type especially among sport fishers who argue they are inappropriate especially for salmon fisheries. These arguments are often related to allocation issues between commercial and recreational (sport) fisheries and not conservation issues.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.opb.org/news/article/gillnet-ban-angers-fishers/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608063729/http://www.opb.org/news/article/gillnet-ban-angers-fishers/ |archive-date=2013-06-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Most salmon fisheries, especially those targeting Pacific salmon in North America, are strictly managed to minimize total impacts to specific populations and salmon fishery managers continue to allow the use of gillnets in these fisheries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcouncil.org/salmon/background/|title=Background  -  Pacific Fishery Management Council|author=|date=|website=www.pcouncil.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, University of Washington Fisheries Professor Emeritus Stephen Mathews compared Puget Sound bycatch data for the non-treaty gillnet and purse seine keta salmon fisheries. He found that although neither fishery had major bycatch problems with nontarget salmonids, the gillnet fishery has substantially less impact on nontarget Chinook salmon. His fulltext report is available from the Washington State [http://soundcatch.org Puget Sound Salmon Commission].\n\n===Swordfish===\nGillnets are also used out in the deep sea for fisheries whose primary catch is swordfish. California driftnet fisheries have some of the highest rates of by-catch with 12 percent of the catch being the targeted swordfish while up to 68 percent of the catch being by-catch that will be tossed back to sea.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Alternatives===\nGiven the selective properties of gillnet fishing, alternative methods of harvest are currently being studied. Recent WDF&W reports suggest that purse seine is the most productive method with having highest [[catch per unit effort]] (CPUE), but has little information on the effectiveness of selectively harvesting hatchery-reared salmon.<ref>WDF&W. 2010. 2010 Alternative Gear Catch...</ref> More conclusive research has been conducted jointly between the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and Bonneville Power Administration on a 10-year study on selective harvest methods of hatchery origin salmon in the Upper Columbia River by purse seine and tangle net. Their 2009 and 2010 findings show that purse seines have a higher percentage of survivability and higher CPUE than does tangle nets.<ref>Colville Tribe. 2011. Major Results...</ref> A Colville Tribe biologist reports that during these two years the tribe harvested 3,163 hatchery Chinook while releasing 2,346 wild Chinook with only 1.4% direct or immediate mortality using purse seines,<ref>Rayton, Michael. 2010. Declaration of Support...</ref> whereas the tangle net was far less productive but had an approximate 12.5% mortality. Researchers commented that the use of recovery boxes and shortened periods between checking the nets would have likely decreased mortality rates. While there is data that shows success of selective methods of harvest at protecting wild and ESA listed salmon, there still must be social acceptance of new methods of fishing.\n\nThere have also been studies done to see differing strategies that could potentially decrease avian by-catch in coastal fisheries. These include three strategies that have a possible reduction in up to 75% of avian by-catch: gear modifications, where visual devices will be placed near the top of the net so birds will be able to see the nets; abundance-based fishery openings, where of birds will determine whether the nets will be set out or not; and time-of-day restrictions, which goes along with abundance- where bird by catch tended to occur at dawn and dusk, where as fish catch occurred mostly at dawn.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Novel Tools to Reduce Seabird Bycatch in Coastal Gillnet Fisheries|last=Melvin|first=Edward F.|date=December 1999|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.98426.x|volume=13|issue = 6|journal=Conservation Biology|pages=1386\u20131397}}</ref>\n\nFor marine mammal by-catch, field experiments have shown that the use of pingers on nets resulted in significantly lower numbers of by-catch than nets without pingers. After this study was completed by Jay Barlow, it was determined that there would be a 12-fold decrease in [[short-beaked common dolphin]]s caught, a 4-fold decrease in other [[cetacea]]ns and a 3-fold decrease in [[pinniped]]s for nets containing pingers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barlow|first=Jay|date=April 2003|title=FIELD EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT ACOUSTIC PINGERS REDUCE MARINE MAMMAL BYCATCH IN THE CALIFORNIA DRIFT GILL NET FISHERY|journal=Marine Mammal Science|volume=19|issue=2|pages=265\u2013283|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2003.tb01108.x|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdeptcommercepub/236}}</ref>\n\n==Types of gillnets==\nThe [[FAO]] classifies gillnet gear types as follows:\n\n===Set gillnets===\nSet gillnets consist of a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small [[Fishing float|floats]], usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the floatline, while [[Fishing sinker|lead weights]] are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead cored rope, which does not need additional weight. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting [[pelagic]], [[demersal]] or [[benthic]] species. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net haulers or net drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with [[Artisan fishing|artisanal fisheries]] because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based on the relationship of fuel/fish.<ref name=\"gillnet\">[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/219/en Gillnets]</ref>\n\n===Encircling gillnets===\nEncircling gillnets are gillnets set vertically in shallow water, with the floatline remaining at the surface so they encircle fish. Small open boats or canoes can be used to set the net around the fish. Once the fish are encircled, the fishers shout and splash the water to panic the fish so they gill or entangle themselves. There is little negative impact on the environment.<ref name=\"FAO:Gillnets\" /> As soon as the gear is set the scaring takes place and the net is hauled back in. The fish are alive and [[discards]] can be returned to the sea. Encircling gillnets are commonly used by groups of small-scale fishers, and does not require other equipment.<ref name=\"FAO:Gillnets\">[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/221/en Gillnets]</ref>\n\n[[File:Drawing of a gill netter.png|thumb|A gill netter]]\n\n===Combined gillnets-trammel nets===\nThis bottom-set gear has two parts:\n* the upper part is a standard gillnet where semi-[[Demersal fish|demersal]] or [[pelagic fish]] can be gilled\n* the lower part is a trammel net where bottom fish can entangle.\n\nThe combined nets are maintained more or less vertically in the usual way by floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline. They are set on the bottom. After a time depending on the target species, they are hauled on board. Traditional combined nets were hauled by hand, especially on smaller boats. Recent hydraulic driven net haulers are now common. The gilled, entangled and enmeshed fish are removed from the net by hand. Of some concern with this method is [[ghost fishing]] by lost nets and [[bycatch]] of diving seabirds. Nets combined in this way were first used in the Mediterranean.<ref>[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/252/en Combined gillnets-trammel nets]</ref>\n\n===Drift nets===\n{{main|Drift net}}\nA '''drift net''' consists of one or more panels of webbing fastened together. They are left free to drift with the current, usually near the surface or not far below it. Floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline keep them vertical. Drift nets drift with the current while they are connected with the operating vessel, the driftnetter or [[Drifter (fishing boat)|drifter]].\n\nDrift nets are usually used to catch [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] [[forage fish]] such as [[herring]] and [[sardine]]s, and also larger [[pelagic fish]] such as [[tuna]], [[salmon]] and pelagic [[squid]]. Net haulers are usually used to set and haul driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern with this type of net is the [[bycatch]] of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the [[high seas]] was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.<ref>[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/220/en Driftnets]</ref>\n\n===Gillnets and entangling nets===\nThe tangle net, or tooth net, originated in British Columbia, Canada, as a gear specifically developed for selective fisheries.<ref>Petrunia, William Mark (1997). \"Tooth Net Fishery. Report on Scientific License 96.149.\" Jan. 5, 1997.</ref> Tangle nets have smaller mesh sizes than standard gillnets. They are designed to catch fish by their nose or jaw, enabling bycatch to be resuscitated and released unharmed. Tangle nets as adapted to the mark-selective fishery for spring Chinook salmon on the lower Columbia River have a standard mesh size of 4-1/4&nbsp;inches (10.8&nbsp;cm.). Short net lengths and soak times are used in an effort to land fish in good condition. Tangle nets are typically used in situations where the release of certain (usually wild) fish unharmed is desirable. In a typical situation calling for the use of a tangle net, for instance, all fish retaining their adipose fins (usually wild) must be returned to the water. Tangle nets are used in conjunction with a live recovery box, which acts as a resuscitation chamber for unmarked fish that appear lethargic or stressed before their release into the water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salmonforall.org/tanglenet/|title=Salmon For All   \u00bb A Sustainable Fishery|author=|date=|website=www.salmonforall.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/219/en Gillnets and entangling nets]</ref>\n<!--\n===Gillnets and entangling nets (not specified)===\n<ref>[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/219/en Gillnets and entangling nets (not specified)]</ref>\n\n===Fixed gillnets (on stakes)===\n<ref>[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/219/en Fixed gillnets (on stakes)]</ref>\n-->\n\n==Historical images==\n{{multiple image\n | align = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header            = Salmon gillnetting\n | header_align      = center\n | image1    = Salmon gill net boat.jpg\n | width1    = 244\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = <center>Salmon gill net boat with drum</center>\n | image2    = Repairing salmon gill net.jpg\n | width2    = 136\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = <center>Repairing salmon gillnet</center>\n | image3    = Gill net hauled in over a power-driven drum.jpg\n | width3    = 285\n | alt3      = \n | caption3  = <center>Hauling the gill net over the power-driven drum</center>\n | image4    = Removing salmon from gillnet.jpg\n | width4    = 187\n | alt4      = \n | caption4  = <center>Removing salmon from the gillnet</center>\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n#{{note|Erzini}} Erzini, K.

Gill nets are composed of vertical panels of netting that hang from a line with regularly spaced floaters that hold the line on the surface of the water. The floats are sometimes called \"corks\" and the line with corks is generally referred to as a \"cork line.\" The line along the bottom of the panels is generally weighted. Traditionally this line has been weighted with lead and may be referred to as  \"lead line.\"  A gill net is normally set in a straight line. Gill nets can be characterized by mesh size, as well as colour and type of filament from which they are made. Fish may be caught by gill nets in three ways:\n\n# Wedged&nbsp;\u2013 held by the mesh around the body.\n# Gilled&nbsp;\u2013 held by mesh slipping behind the [[operculum (fish)|opercula]].\n# Tangled&nbsp;\u2013 held by teeth, spines, [[maxilla|maxillaries]], or other protrusions without the body penetrating the mesh.\n\nMost often fish are gilled. A fish swims into a net and passes only part way through the mesh. When it struggles to free itself, the twine slips behind the gill cover and prevents escape.<ref>Murphy, B. and Willis, D. (1996) [http://www.afsbooks.org/x55029xm \"Fisheries Techniques: Second edition.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221024307/http://afsbooks.org/x55029xm |date=2013-02-21 }} Bethesda, MD: American Fisheries Society.</ref>\n\nGillnets are so effective that their use is closely monitored and regulated by fisheries management and [[enforcement]] agencies. [[Mesh size]], twine strength, as well as net length and depth are all closely regulated to reduce [[bycatch]] of non-target species. Gillnets have a high degree of size selectivity. Most [[Salmon#Salmon fisheries|salmon fisheries]] in particular have an extremely low incidence of catching non-target species.<ref>[http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/OSCRP/CRM/docs/Selective_Fisheries_JN_071220.pdf Selective Fisheries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224930/http://www.dfw.state.or.us/fish/OSCRP/CRM/docs/Selective_Fisheries_JN_071220.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }} ''Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife''.

''The Sea of Galilee and Its Fishermen in the New Testament,'' pp. 28-44. Kibbutz Ein Gev, Kinnereth Sailing Co.</ref> In North America, Native American fishermen used cedar canoes and natural fibre nets, e.g., made with nettles or the inner bark of cedar.<ref>Stewart, Hilary (1977). ''Indian Fishing: Early Methods on the Northwest Coast,'' p.79 in 1st paperback edition, 1982. Seattle, University of Washington Press.</ref> They would attach stones to the bottom of the nets as weights, and pieces of wood to the top, to use as floats. This allowed the net to suspend straight up and down in the water. Each net would be suspended either from shore or between two boats. Native fishers in the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska still commonly use gillnets in their fisheries for [[salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]].\n\nBoth drift gillnets and setnets have long been used by cultures around the world. There is evidence of fisheries exploitation, including gillnetting, going far back in Japanese history, with many specific details available from the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868).<ref>Ruddle, Kenneth and Akimich, Tomoya. \"Sea Tenure in Japan and the Southwestern Ryukyus,\" in Cordell, John, Ed.

Many of these boats also had small sails and were called \"row-sail\" boats. At the beginning of the 1900s, steam powered ships would haul these smaller boats to their fishing grounds and retrieve them at the end of each day. However, at that time [[gasoline|gas]] powered boats were beginning to make their appearance, and by the 1930s, the row-sail boat had virtually disappeared, except in Bristol Bay, Alaska, where motors were prohibited in the gillnet fishery by territorial law until 1951.<ref>Andrews, Ralph W. and Larsen, A.K. (1959). ''Fish and Ships'', p. 108. Seattle, Superior Publishing Co.</ref>\n[[File:MENDING A GILLNET ON THE DOCK AT ST. HELENS ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER - NARA - 548102.jpg|right|thumb|A fisherman repairs a gillnet (April 1973, [[St. Helens, Oregon]])]]\n\nIn 1931, the first powered drum was created by Laurie Jarelainen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The drum is a circular device that is set to the side of the boat and draws in the nets. The powered drum allowed the nets to be drawn in much faster and along with the faster gas powered boats, fisherman were able to fish in areas they had previously been unable to go into, thereby revolutionizing the fishing industry.\n\nDuring World War II, navigation and communication devices, as well as many other forms of maritime equipment (ex. depth-sounding and radar) were improved and made more compact. These devices became much more accessible to the average fisherman, thus making their range and mobility increasingly larger. It also served to make the industry much more competitive, as the fisherman were forced to invest more in boats and equipment to stay current with developing technology.\n\nThe introduction of fine [[synthetic fibre]]s such as [[nylon]] in the construction of fishing gear during the 1960s marked an expansion in the commercial use of gillnets. The new materials were cheaper and easier to handle, lasted longer and required less maintenance than natural fibres. In addition, [[Multifilament fishing line|multifilament nylon]], [[Monofilament fishing line|monofilament]] or [[Braided fishing line|multimonofilament fibres]] become almost invisible in water, so nets made with synthetic twines generally caught greater numbers of fish than natural fibre nets used in comparable situations.\n\nNylon is highly resistant to abrasion and degradation, hence the netting has the potential to last for many years if it is not recovered. This [[ghost fishing]] is of environmental concern. Attaching the gillnet floats with biodegradable material can reduce the problem.<ref name=\"gillnet\"/> However it is difficult to generalize about the longevity of ghost-fishing gillnets due to the varying environments in which they are used. Some researchers have found gill-nets still catching fish and crustaceans over a year after loss{{ref|Kaiser}}, while others have found lost nets destroyed by wave action within one month{{ref|Puente}} or overgrown with [[seaweed]]s, increasing their visibility and reducing their catching potential to such an extent that they became a microhabitat used by small fish.{{ref|Erzini}}\n\nThis type of net was heavily used by many [[Japan]]ese, [[South Korea]]n, and [[Taiwan]]ese fishing fleets on the high seas in the 1980s to target [[tuna]]s. Although highly selective with respect to size class of animals captured, gillnets are associated with high numbers of incidental captures of [[cetacea]]ns ([[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s). In the Sri Lankan gillnet fishery, one dolphin is caught for every 1.7\u20134.0 tonnes of tuna landed{{ref|Hall}}. This compares poorly with the rate of one dolphin per 70 tonnes of tuna landed in the eastern Pacific [[purse seine]] tuna fishery.\n\nGillnets are sometimes used by [[Fisheries science|fisheries scientists]] to monitor fish populations.<ref>Bruce Crawford. \"Variable Mesh Gill Nets (in Lakes).\" In Johnson, David, et al.

There is also a compensation plan proposed in the bill for fishery participants who stop using large-scale nets.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Selectivity==\n[[Image:Gillnet selectivity.png|thumb|300px|Selectivity properties of a gillnet on a hypothetical population]]\n\nGillnets are a series of panels of meshes with a weighted \"foot rope\" along the bottom, and a ''headline'', to which floats are attached. By altering the ratio of floats to weights, buoyancy changes,<ref>Martin 1994, pp. 52-57.</ref> and the net can therefore be set to fish at any depth in the water column. In commercial fisheries, the meshes of a gillnet are uniform in size and shape. Fish smaller than the mesh of the net pass through unhindered, while those too large to push their heads through the meshes as far as their gills are not retained. This gives gillnets the ability to target a specific size of fish, unlike other net gears such as [[trawling|trawls]], in which smaller fish pass through the meshes and all larger fish are captured in the net{{ref|Pawson}}.\n\n===Salmon===\nCommercial gillnet fisheries are still an important method of harvesting [[salmon]] in Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. In the lower [[Columbia River]], non-Indian commercial salmon fisheries for spring Chinook have developed methods of selectively harvesting adipose fin clipped hatchery salmon using small mesh gillnets known as [[tangle net]]s or tooth nets.  Non-adipose fin clipped fish (primarily natural origin salmon) must be released.<ref>http://wdfw.wa.gov/publications/01353/wdfw01353.pdf</ref> Fishery management agencies estimate a relatively low release [[Fish mortality|mortality rate]] on salmon and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] released from these small mesh gillnets.\n\nProblems that can arise from selective harvesting are smaller reproducing adult fish, as well as the unexpected mortality of the fish which sustain injuries from the gillnet but are not retained in the fishery. Most salmon populations include several [[Age class structure|age classes]], allowing for fish of different ages, and sizes, to reproduce with each other. A recent 2009 study looked at 59 years of catch and escapement data of [[Bristol Bay]] [[sockeye salmon]] to determine age and size at maturity trends attributable to the selectivity of commercial gillnet harvests. The study found that the larger females (>550&nbsp;mm) of all age classes were most susceptible to harvest.<ref name=\"Kendall, Neala W 2009\">Kendall, Neala W, Jeffery J. Hard and Thomas P. Quinn. 2009. Quantifying Six Decades of Fishery Selection for Size and Age at Maturity in Sockeye Salmon. Evolutionary Applications. 523-536.</ref> The study suggests that smaller, younger fish were more likely to successfully traverse the gillnet fishery and reproduce than the larger fish. The study also found that the average length of sockeye harvested from 1946\u20132005 was 8&nbsp;mm larger than the sockeye who escaped the gillnet fishery to spawn, reducing the fecundity of the average female by 5%, or 104 eggs.<ref name=\"Kendall, Neala W 2009\"/> If a salmon enters a gillnet, but manages to escape, it can sustain injuries. These injuries can lead to a lower degree of reproductive success. A study aimed at quantifying mortality of Bristol Bay sockeye salmon due to gillnet-related injuries found that 11\u201329% of sockeye sustained fishery-related injuries attributable to gillnets, and 51% of those fish were expected to not reproduce.<ref>Baker, Matthew R and Daniel E Schindler. 2009. Unaccounted Mortality in Salmon Fisheries:  Non-retention in Gillnets and Effects on Estimates of Spawners. Journal of Applied Ecology (46). 752-761.</ref>\n\nGillnets are sometimes a controversial gear type especially among sport fishers who argue they are inappropriate especially for salmon fisheries. These arguments are often related to allocation issues between commercial and recreational (sport) fisheries and not conservation issues.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.opb.org/news/article/gillnet-ban-angers-fishers/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608063729/http://www.opb.org/news/article/gillnet-ban-angers-fishers/ |archive-date=2013-06-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Most salmon fisheries, especially those targeting Pacific salmon in North America, are strictly managed to minimize total impacts to specific populations and salmon fishery managers continue to allow the use of gillnets in these fisheries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcouncil.org/salmon/background/|title=Background  -  Pacific Fishery Management Council|author=|date=|website=www.pcouncil.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, University of Washington Fisheries Professor Emeritus Stephen Mathews compared Puget Sound bycatch data for the non-treaty gillnet and purse seine keta salmon fisheries. He found that although neither fishery had major bycatch problems with nontarget salmonids, the gillnet fishery has substantially less impact on nontarget Chinook salmon. His fulltext report is available from the Washington State [http://soundcatch.org Puget Sound Salmon Commission].\n\n===Swordfish===\nGillnets are also used out in the deep sea for fisheries whose primary catch is swordfish. California driftnet fisheries have some of the highest rates of by-catch with 12 percent of the catch being the targeted swordfish while up to 68 percent of the catch being by-catch that will be tossed back to sea.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Alternatives===\nGiven the selective properties of gillnet fishing, alternative methods of harvest are currently being studied. Recent WDF&W reports suggest that purse seine is the most productive method with having highest [[catch per unit effort]] (CPUE), but has little information on the effectiveness of selectively harvesting hatchery-reared salmon.<ref>WDF&W. 2010. 2010 Alternative Gear Catch...</ref> More conclusive research has been conducted jointly between the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and Bonneville Power Administration on a 10-year study on selective harvest methods of hatchery origin salmon in the Upper Columbia River by purse seine and tangle net. Their 2009 and 2010 findings show that purse seines have a higher percentage of survivability and higher CPUE than does tangle nets.<ref>Colville Tribe. 2011. Major Results...</ref> A Colville Tribe biologist reports that during these two years the tribe harvested 3,163 hatchery Chinook while releasing 2,346 wild Chinook with only 1.4% direct or immediate mortality using purse seines,<ref>Rayton, Michael. 2010. Declaration of Support...</ref> whereas the tangle net was far less productive but had an approximate 12.5% mortality. Researchers commented that the use of recovery boxes and shortened periods between checking the nets would have likely decreased mortality rates. While there is data that shows success of selective methods of harvest at protecting wild and ESA listed salmon, there still must be social acceptance of new methods of fishing.\n\nThere have also been studies done to see differing strategies that could potentially decrease avian by-catch in coastal fisheries. These include three strategies that have a possible reduction in up to 75% of avian by-catch: gear modifications, where visual devices will be placed near the top of the net so birds will be able to see the nets; abundance-based fishery openings, where of birds will determine whether the nets will be set out or not; and time-of-day restrictions, which goes along with abundance- where bird by catch tended to occur at dawn and dusk, where as fish catch occurred mostly at dawn.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Novel Tools to Reduce Seabird Bycatch in Coastal Gillnet Fisheries|last=Melvin|first=Edward F.|date=December 1999|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.98426.x|volume=13|issue = 6|journal=Conservation Biology|pages=1386\u20131397}}</ref>\n\nFor marine mammal by-catch, field experiments have shown that the use of pingers on nets resulted in significantly lower numbers of by-catch than nets without pingers. After this study was completed by Jay Barlow, it was determined that there would be a 12-fold decrease in [[short-beaked common dolphin]]s caught, a 4-fold decrease in other [[cetacea]]ns and a 3-fold decrease in [[pinniped]]s for nets containing pingers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barlow|first=Jay|date=April 2003|title=FIELD EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT ACOUSTIC PINGERS REDUCE MARINE MAMMAL BYCATCH IN THE CALIFORNIA DRIFT GILL NET FISHERY|journal=Marine Mammal Science|volume=19|issue=2|pages=265\u2013283|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2003.tb01108.x|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdeptcommercepub/236}}</ref>\n\n==Types of gillnets==\nThe [[FAO]] classifies gillnet gear types as follows:\n\n===Set gillnets===\nSet gillnets consist of a single netting wall kept vertical by a floatline (upper line/headrope) and a weighted groundline (lower line/footrope). Small [[Fishing float|floats]], usually shaped like eggs or cylinders and made of solid plastic, are evenly distributed along the floatline, while [[Fishing sinker|lead weights]] are evenly distributed along groundline. The lower line can also be made of lead cored rope, which does not need additional weight. The net is set on the bottom, or at a distance above it and held in place with anchors or weights on both ends. By adjusting the design these nets can fish in surface layers, in mid water or at the bottom, targeting [[pelagic]], [[demersal]] or [[benthic]] species. On small boats gillnets are handled by hand. Larger boats use hydraulic net haulers or net drums. Set gillnets are widely used all over the world, and are employed both in inland and sea waters. They are popular with [[Artisan fishing|artisanal fisheries]] because no specialized gear is needed, and it is low cost based on the relationship of fuel/fish.<ref name=\"gillnet\">[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/219/en Gillnets]</ref>\n\n===Encircling gillnets===\nEncircling gillnets are gillnets set vertically in shallow water, with the floatline remaining at the surface so they encircle fish. Small open boats or canoes can be used to set the net around the fish. Once the fish are encircled, the fishers shout and splash the water to panic the fish so they gill or entangle themselves. There is little negative impact on the environment.<ref name=\"FAO:Gillnets\" /> As soon as the gear is set the scaring takes place and the net is hauled back in. The fish are alive and [[discards]] can be returned to the sea. Encircling gillnets are commonly used by groups of small-scale fishers, and does not require other equipment.<ref name=\"FAO:Gillnets\">[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/221/en Gillnets]</ref>\n\n[[File:Drawing of a gill netter.png|thumb|A gill netter]]\n\n===Combined gillnets-trammel nets===\nThis bottom-set gear has two parts:\n* the upper part is a standard gillnet where semi-[[Demersal fish|demersal]] or [[pelagic fish]] can be gilled\n* the lower part is a trammel net where bottom fish can entangle.\n\nThe combined nets are maintained more or less vertically in the usual way by floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline. They are set on the bottom. After a time depending on the target species, they are hauled on board. Traditional combined nets were hauled by hand, especially on smaller boats. Recent hydraulic driven net haulers are now common. The gilled, entangled and enmeshed fish are removed from the net by hand. Of some concern with this method is [[ghost fishing]] by lost nets and [[bycatch]] of diving seabirds. Nets combined in this way were first used in the Mediterranean.<ref>[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/252/en Combined gillnets-trammel nets]</ref>\n\n===Drift nets===\n{{main|Drift net}}\nA '''drift net''' consists of one or more panels of webbing fastened together. They are left free to drift with the current, usually near the surface or not far below it. Floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline keep them vertical. Drift nets drift with the current while they are connected with the operating vessel, the driftnetter or [[Drifter (fishing boat)|drifter]].\n\nDrift nets are usually used to catch [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]] [[forage fish]] such as [[herring]] and [[sardine]]s, and also larger [[pelagic fish]] such as [[tuna]], [[salmon]] and pelagic [[squid]]. Net haulers are usually used to set and haul driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern with this type of net is the [[bycatch]] of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the [[high seas]] was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.<ref>[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/220/en Driftnets]</ref>\n\n===Gillnets and entangling nets===\nThe tangle net, or tooth net, originated in British Columbia, Canada, as a gear specifically developed for selective fisheries.<ref>Petrunia, William Mark (1997). \"Tooth Net Fishery. Report on Scientific License 96.149.\" Jan. 5, 1997.</ref> Tangle nets have smaller mesh sizes than standard gillnets. They are designed to catch fish by their nose or jaw, enabling bycatch to be resuscitated and released unharmed. Tangle nets as adapted to the mark-selective fishery for spring Chinook salmon on the lower Columbia River have a standard mesh size of 4-1/4&nbsp;inches (10.8&nbsp;cm.). Short net lengths and soak times are used in an effort to land fish in good condition. Tangle nets are typically used in situations where the release of certain (usually wild) fish unharmed is desirable. In a typical situation calling for the use of a tangle net, for instance, all fish retaining their adipose fins (usually wild) must be returned to the water. Tangle nets are used in conjunction with a live recovery box, which acts as a resuscitation chamber for unmarked fish that appear lethargic or stressed before their release into the water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salmonforall.org/tanglenet/|title=Salmon For All   \u00bb A Sustainable Fishery|author=|date=|website=www.salmonforall.org|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/219/en Gillnets and entangling nets]</ref>\n<!--\n===Gillnets and entangling nets (not specified)===\n<ref>[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/219/en Gillnets and entangling nets (not specified)]</ref>\n\n===Fixed gillnets (on stakes)===\n<ref>[[FAO]]: Fishing Gear Types: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/219/en Fixed gillnets (on stakes)]</ref>\n-->\n\n==Historical images==\n{{multiple image\n | align = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header            = Salmon gillnetting\n | header_align      = center\n | image1    = Salmon gill net boat.jpg\n | width1    = 244\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = <center>Salmon gill net boat with drum</center>\n | image2    = Repairing salmon gill net.jpg\n | width2    = 136\n | alt2      = \n | caption2  = <center>Repairing salmon gillnet</center>\n | image3    = Gill net hauled in over a power-driven drum.jpg\n | width3    = 285\n | alt3      = \n | caption3  = <center>Hauling the gill net over the power-driven drum</center>\n | image4    = Removing salmon from gillnet.jpg\n | width4    = 187\n | alt4      = \n | caption4  = <center>Removing salmon from the gillnet</center>\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n#{{note|Erzini}} Erzini, K.
