By binding specifically to surface structures on an infectious particle, neutralizing antibodies prevent it from interacting with its [[Host (biology) |host cells]] it might infect and destroy. \n\n==Mechanism==\nIn order to enter cells, virus particles and intracellular bacteria use molecules on their surfaces to interact with the [[cell surface receptor]]s of their target cell which allows them to enter the cell and start their [[Viral replication |replication cycle]].<ref name=\"PoV1\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Virology, Volume 1: Molecular Biology |date=2015 |publisher=ASM Press |isbn=978-1555819330 |page=31 |edition=4th}}</ref> Neutralising antibodies can inhibit the infectivity by binding to the pathogen and block the molecules needed for cell entry. This can either be due to the antibodies statically interfering with the pathogens attaching to host cell receptors or prevent particles from undergoing structural changes often needed for successful cell entry.\nNeutralising antibodies are also important in neutralizing the toxic effects of bacterial toxins. An example of a neutralizing antibody is [[diphtheria antitoxin]], which can neutralize the biological effects of [[diphtheria toxin]].<ref name=\"Path-1\">{{cite web|last=Treffers|first=Henry P.|date=2014|title=Neutralizing antibody|url= https://www.accessscience.com/content/neutralizing-antibody/450600|doi=10.1036/1097-8542.450600|work=AccessScience|publisher=McGraw-Hill}}</ref> The pathogen-antibody complex is eventually taken up and degraded by macrophages.<ref name=\"PoV2\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Virology, Volume 2: Pathogenesis and Control |date=2015 |publisher=ASM Press |isbn=978-1-555-81951-4 |page=125 |edition=4th }}</ref> Neutralizing antibodies are not effective against extracellular bacteria, as the binding of antibodies does not prevent bacteria from replicating.

Nonneutralizing antibodies, or binding antibodies, bind specifically to the pathogen, but do not interfere with their infectivity, because they might not bind at the right place. They can be important to flag the particle for [[immune cells]], signaling that this antigen has been targeted, after which the antigen is processed and consequently destroyed by recruited immune cells.<ref name=\"schmaljohn2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Schmaljohn |first1=AL |title=Protective antiviral antibodies that lack neutralizing activity: precedents and evolution of concepts. |journal=Current HIV Research |date=July 2013 |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=345\u201353 |doi=10.2174/1570162x113116660057 |pmid=24191933}}</ref> Neutralizing antibodies on the other hand can neutralize the biological effects of the antigen  without a need for immune cells.\n\n==Production==\n{{see also|B cell}}\n\nAntibodies are produced and secreted by [[B cell]]s. When B cells are produced in the [[bone marrow]], the genes that encode the antibodies undergo random [[genetic recombination]] ([[V(D)J recombination]]) which results in every mature B cell producing antibodies that differ in their [[amino acid]] sequence in the [[Fragment antigen-binding|antigen-binding region]], such that every B cell produces antibodies that able to bind to a different [[antigen]]s on the surface of pathogens.<ref name=\"Jung2004\">{{cite journal |last1=Jung |first1=David |last2=Alt |first2=Frederick W |title=Unraveling V(D)J Recombination |journal=Cell |date=January 2004 |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=299\u2013311 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00039-X|pmid=14744439 }}</ref> A strong diversity in the antibody repertoire allows the immune system to recognise a plethora of pathogens which can come in all different forms and sizes. During an infection only antibodies that bind to the pathogen with high affinity are produced. This is achieved by [[clonal selection]] of a single B cell clone: B cells are recruited to the site of infection by sensing [[interferon]]s that are released by the infected cells as part of the [[Innate immune system |innate immune response]]. B cells display [[B-cell receptor]]s on their cell surface, which is just the antibody anchored to the cell membrane. When the B-cell receptor binds to its cognate antigen with high affinity, an intracellular [[Cell signaling|signalling cascade]] is triggered. In addition to binding to an antigen, B cells need to be stimulated by [[cytokine]]s produced by [[T helper cell]]s as part of the [[Cell-mediated immunity|cellular]] response of the immune system against the pathogen. Once a B cell is fully activated it rapidly proliferates and differentiates into [[plasma cell]]s. Plasma cells can then secrete the antigen-specific antibody in large quantities.<ref name=\"JanewayBcells\">{{cite book |title=Janeway's immunobiology |date=2012 |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=978-0-8153-4243-4 |pages=389\u2013404 |edition=8th}}</ref>\n\n==Medical uses of neutralising antibodies==\n\nNeutralizing antibodies are used for [[passive immunisation]], and can be used for patients even if they  do not have a healthy immune system\nIn the early 20th century, infected patients were injected with [[antiserum]], which is the [[blood serum]] of a previously infected and recovered patient containing [[polyclonal antibodies]] against the infectious agent.

B cells display [[B-cell receptor]]s on their cell surface, which is just the antibody anchored to the cell membrane. When the B-cell receptor binds to its cognate antigen with high affinity, an intracellular [[Cell signaling|signalling cascade]] is triggered. \nIn addition to binding to an antigen, B cells need to be stimulated by [[cytokine]]s produced by [[T helper cell]]s as part of the [[Cell-mediated immunity|cellular]] response of the immune system against the pathogen.\nOnce a B cell is fully activated it rapidly proliferates and differentiates into [[plasma cell]]s.
