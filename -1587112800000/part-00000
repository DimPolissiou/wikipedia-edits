The caller called the taskforce on several times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in and around the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old pharmacist; Vladimir Rhychta who was later arrested on the 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect driving a Commodore identical to the bomb car just before the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> In a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table. Crupi was later arrested by detectives in Sydney and was brought back to Melbourne. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the Daimler crashed. The driver fled on foot for a few kilometres where he carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. The pieces of the number plates; CCH-997 matched to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK) | VK Commodore]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April.\n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, the officer identified the driver as armed robber; Peter Reed. Reed was known to the police and had being suspected in several armed robberies and car rebirthing scams.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref>\n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's VIN on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's chassis were found to be identical to the Commodore used in the bombing, providing the link between the Donvale robbery, the stolen Daimler, and the Russell Street Bombing.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing [[fingerprint]]s belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before His Honour Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced.

It operates on both the [[Proastiakos]] suburban rail line as a well as [[Line 3 (Athens Metro)|Line 3]] of the [[Athens Metro]].  It is the first and only train station in Greece that is not managed by GaiOSE, a subsidiary of [[Hellenic Railways Organisation|OSE]], the national rail company. It is owned by the airport, which charges the train operating companies ([[TrainOSE]] and [[Athens Metro|STASY]]) fees to use it.\n\n==History==\nThe station opened in 2004. Although it was projected that only [[commuter rail]] would use the station, Attiko Metro (the company that used to manage the [[Athens Metro]]; merged with Tram S.A. to form STASY) decided to extend [[Line 3 (Athens Metro)|line 3]] to the airport. However, building new tracks was not economically viable, so the route would be served by dual-voltage 2nd Generation Trains and would share tracks with [[Proastiakos Athens|Proastiakos]] trains between a tunnel portal just after Doukissis Plakentias Station and the Airport. Because of the limited availability of these trains (7 in total), only 2 trains per hour reach the station, leaving the airport at the hour and every half hour from 06:30 to 22:30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stasy.gr/index.php?id=70&L=1|title=Airport Routes|website=Urban Rail Transport SA|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe decision to extend metro line 3 to the Airport forced a change to the station design; metro trains have a higher floor than Proastiakos trains, so the central track had to be lowered. This is why initial services to the airport did not use any stations between Doukissis Plakentias and the airport. The intermediate stations did not have the tracks lowered; parts of the platforms were raised in 2006. After that all intermediate stations were used by both services, Proastiakos and the Athens Metro.\n\n==Platforms==\nAthens Airport Station has two island platforms and three tracks. Track 1 is not used due to low traffic, Track 2 is used by the Metro, and Track 3 is used by Proastiakos. All trains terminate at this station.\n\n==Access==\nThe railway station is immediately adjacent to the airport terminal, which is accessible by an elevated walkway. Because of the additional cost of using the station, there is a surcharge for passengers entering or exiting at the airport. As of 2018, the base fare to the airport is \u20ac10 with varying prices for round trips or groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.athenstransport.com/english/tickets/ |title=Athens Transport Tickets and Cards |publisher=Athens Transport |accessdate=2018-02-20}}</ref>\n\n==Future developments==\nAs the airport's passenger numbers are rising, services may get denser and platform 1 could be used again. Moreover, for many years there have been plans to extend Proastiakos services to [[Rafina]], a suburb of Athens and the third largest harbour of the city as well. Although original plans show the line branching off the main one after Pallini or Doukissis Plakentias Station, then running in a reserved-for-this-purpose median of the A64 Mount Hymmetus Ring Road and then extending to Rafina, recent plans have called for an extension of the line from the Airport. Such an extension would be shorter and less expensive to build, however, it has been unpopular due to the fact that the travelling time from and to Rafina will be longer and certain areas will not be served.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=150>\nFile:Athens International Airport footbridge and hotel.jpg|Athens International Airport , view of the footbridge to the station and the hotel beside it.

The Zulu language possesses several click sounds typical of Southern African languages, not found in the rest of Africa. The Nguni people have coexisted with other Southern tribes like the San and Khoi.\n\nZulu, like most indigenous Southern African languages, was not a [[written language]] until the arrival of missionaries from Europe, who documented the language using the [[Latin script]]. \nThe first grammar book of the Zulu language was published in [[Norway]] in 1850 by the Norwegian missionary [[Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder|Hans Schreuder]].<ref>Rakkenes, \u00d8ystein (2003) ''Himmelfolket: En Norsk H\u00f8vding i Zululand'', Oslo: Cappelen Forlag, pp. 63\u201365</ref> The first written document in Zulu was a Bible translation that appeared in 1883. In 1901, [[John Dube]] (1871\u20131946), a Zulu from Natal, created the [[Ohlange Institute]], the first native educational institution in South Africa. He was also the author of ''Insila kaShaka'', the first novel written in Zulu (1930). Another pioneering Zulu writer was [[Rolfes Robert Reginald Dhlomo|Reginald Dhlomo]], author of several historical novels of the 19th-century leaders of the Zulu nation: ''U-Dingane'' (1936), ''U-Shaka'' (1937), ''U-Mpande'' (1938), ''U-Cetshwayo'' (1952) and ''U-Dinizulu'' (1968). Other notable contributors to Zulu literature include [[Benedict Wallet Vilakazi]] and, more recently, [[Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali]].\n\nThe written form of Zulu was controlled by the [[Zulu Language Board]] of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. This board has now been disbanded and superseded by the Pan South African Language Board<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pansalb.org.za/ |title=pansalb.org.za |access-date=17 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217141039/http://www.pansalb.org.za/ |archive-date=17 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which promotes the use of all eleven official languages of South Africa.\n\n==Contemporary usage==\nEnglish, Dutch and later [[Afrikaans]] had been the only official languages used by all South African governments before 1994. However, in the [[Kwazulu]] [[bantustan]] the Zulu language was widely used. All education in the country at the high-school level was in English or Afrikaans. Since the demise of apartheid in 1994, Zulu has been enjoying a marked revival. Zulu-language television was introduced by the [[SABC]] in the early 1980s and it broadcasts news and many shows in Zulu. Zulu radio is very popular and newspapers such as ''isoLezwe'',<ref>[http://www.isolezwe.co.za/ isolezwe.co.za]</ref> ''Ilanga''<ref>[http://www.ilanganews.co.za/ ilanganews.co.za]</ref> and ''UmAfrika'' in the Zulu language are available in [[Kwazulu-Natal]] province and in [[Johannesburg]]. In January 2005 the first full-length feature film in Zulu, ''[[Yesterday (2004 film)|Yesterday]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]].\n\nSouth African [[matriculation]] requirements no longer specify which South African language needs to be taken as a second language, and some people have made the switch to learning Zulu. However people taking Zulu at high-school level overwhelmingly take it as a first language: according to statistics, [[Afrikaans]] is still over 30 times more popular than Zulu as a ''second'' language. The mutual intelligibility of many [[Nguni languages]] has increased the likelihood of Zulu becoming the [[lingua franca]] of the eastern half of the country, although the political dominance of Xhosa-speaking people on national level militates against this.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} (The predominant language in the [[Western Cape]] and [[Northern Cape]] is Afrikaans \u2013 see the map below.)\n\nIn the 1994 film ''[[The Lion King]]'', in the \"[[Circle of Life]]\" song, the phrases ''Ingonyama nengw' enamabala'' (English: ''A lion and a leopard spots''), ''Nans' ingonyama bakithi Baba'' (English: ''Here comes a lion, Father'') and ''Siyonqoba'' (English: ''We will conquer'') were used. In some movie songs, like \"This Land\", the voice says ''Busa leli zwe bo'' (''Rule this land'') and ''Busa ngothando bo'' (''Rule with love'') were used too.\n\nThe song ''[[Siyahamba]]'' is a South African hymn originally written in the Zulu language that became popular in North American churches in the 1990s.\n\n===Standard vs urban Zulu===\n[[standard language|Standard]] Zulu as it is taught in schools, also called \"deep Zulu\" (''isiZulu esijulile''), differs in various respects from the language spoken by people living in cities (urban Zulu, ''isiZulu sasedolobheni''). Standard Zulu tends to be [[Linguistic purism|purist]], using derivations from Zulu words for new concepts, whereas speakers of urban Zulu use [[loan words]] abundantly, mainly from English. For example: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Standard Zulu\n! urban Zulu\n!

Recent loanwords contain {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} in other positions, e.g. ''isekhondi'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0sek\u02b0o\u02d0ndi/}} \"second\", ''ibhayisikili'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0bajisiki\u02d0li/}} \"bicycle\".\n# The [[slack voice|slack-voiced]] consonants are [[depressor consonant]]s.

This feature is shared with several other languages of Southern Africa, but it is very rare in other regions. There are three basic articulations of clicks in Zulu:\n* [[Dental click|Denti-alveolar]] {{IPA|/\u01c0/}}, comparable to a sucking of teeth, as the sound one makes for 'tsk tsk'.\n* [[Postalveolar click|Alveolar]] {{IPA|/!/}}, comparable to a bottle top 'pop'.\n* [[Alveolar lateral click|Lateral]] {{IPA|/\u01c1/}}, comparable to a click that one may do for a walking horse.\n\nEach articulation covers five click consonants, with differences such as being slack-voiced, [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] or [[nasalisation|nasalised]], for a total of 15.\n\n===Phonotactics===\n\nZulu syllables are canonically (N)C(w)V, and words must always end in a vowel. Consonant clusters consist of any consonant, optionally preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal consonant (so-called \"prenasalisation\", described in more detail below) and optionally followed by the consonant {{IPA|/w/}}.\n\nIn addition, syllabic {{IPA|/m\u0329/}} occurs as a reduction of former {{IPA|/mu/}}, and acts like a true syllable: it can be syllabic even when not word-initial, and can also carry distinctive tones like a full syllable. It does not necessarily have to be homorganic with the following consonant, although the difference between homorganic nonsyllabic {{IPA|/mC/}} and syllabic {{IPA|/m\u0329C/}} is distinctive, e.g. ''umpetshisi'' {{IPA|/um\u0329p\u00e9t\u0283i\u02d0si/}} \"peach tree\" (5 syllables) versus ''impoko'' {{IPA|/\u00edmpo\u02d0\u0260o/}} \"grass flower\" (3 syllables). Moreover, sequences of syllabic ''m'' and homorganic ''m'' can occur, e.g. ''ummbila'' {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329mb\u00ed\u02d0la/}} \"maize\" (4 syllables).\n\nRecent loanwords from languages such as English may violate these constraints, by including additional consonant clusters that are not native to Zulu, such as in ''igremu'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0gre\u02d0mu/}} \"[[gram]]\". There may be some variation between speakers as to whether clusters are broken up by an [[epenthetic vowel]] or not, e.g. ''ikhompiyutha'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0k\u02b0ompiju\u02d0t\u02b0a/}} or ''ikhompyutha'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0k\u02b0ompju\u02d0t\u02b0a/}} \"computer\".\n\n===Prosody===\n\n====Stress====\n\nStress in Zulu words is mostly predictable and normally falls on the penultimate syllable of a word. It is accompanied by allophonic lengthening of the vowel. When the final vowel of a word is long due to contraction, it receives the stress instead of the preceding syllable.\n\nLengthening does not occur on all words in a sentence, however, but only those that are sentence- or phrase-final. Thus, for any word of at least two syllables, there are two different forms, one with penultimate length and one without it, occurring in complementary distribution. In some cases, there are morphemic alternations that occur as a result of word position as well. The remote demonstrative pronouns may appear with the suffix ''-ana'' when sentence-final, but only as ''-\u0101'' otherwise. Likewise, the recent past tense of verbs ends in ''-ile'' sentence-finally, but is reduced to ''-\u0113'' medially. Moreover, a falling tone can only occur on a long vowel, so the shortening has effects on tone as well.\n\nSome words, such as ideophones or interjections, can have stress that deviates from the regular pattern.\n\n====Tone====\n\nLike almost all other [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and other [[African languages]], Zulu is [[tonal Languages|tonal]]. There are three main ''tonemes'': low, high and falling. Zulu is conventionally written without any indication of tone, but tone can be distinctive in Zulu. For example, the words for \"priest\" and \"teacher\" are both spelled ''umfundisi'', but they are pronounced with different tones: {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329f\u00fandisi/}} for the \"priest\" meaning, and {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329fund\u00edsi/}} for the \"teacher\" meaning.\n\nIn principle, every syllable can be pronounced with either a high or a low tone. However, low tone does not behave the same as the other two, as high tones can \"spread\" into low-toned syllables while the reverse does not occur. A low tone is therefore better described as the ''absence'' of any toneme; it is a kind of default tone that is overridden by high or falling tones. The falling tone is a sequence of high-low, and occurs only on long vowels. The penultimate syllable can also bear a falling tone when it is long due to the word's position in the phrase. However, when it shortens, the falling tone becomes disallowed in that position.{{clarify|reason=What happens to it?|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn principle, every [[morpheme]] has an inherent underlying tone pattern which does not change regardless of where it appears in a word. However, like most other Bantu languages, Zulu has [[word tone]], meaning that the pattern of tones acts more like a template to assign tones to individual syllables, rather than a direct representation of the pronounced tones themselves. Consequently, the relationship between underlying tone patterns and the tones that are actually pronounced can be quite complex. Underlying high tones tend to surface rightward from the syllables where they are underlyingly present, especially in longer words.\n\n====Depressor consonants====\n\nThe breathy consonant phonemes in Zulu are [[depressor consonant]]s, or depressors for short. Depressor consonants have a lowering effect on pitch, adding a non-phonemic low-tone onset to the normal tone of the syllable. Thus, in syllables with depressor consonants, high tones are realised as rising, and falling tones as rising-then-falling. In both cases, the pitch does not reach as high as in non-depressed syllables. The possible tones on a syllable with a voiceless consonant like ''hla'' are {{IPA|[\u026c\u00e1 \u026c\u00e2 \u026c\u00e0]}}, and the possible tones of a breathy consonant syllable, like ''dla'', are {{IPA|[\u026e\u01ce\u0324 \u026ea\u0324\u1dc8 \u026e\u00e0\u0324]}}. A depressor has no effect on a syllable that's already low, but it blocks assimilation to a preceding high tone, so that the tone of the depressor syllable and any following low-tone syllables stays low.\n\n===Phonological processes===\n\n====Prenasalisation====\n\nPrenasalisation occurs whenever a consonant is preceded by a homorganic nasal, either lexically or as a consequence of prefixation. The most notable case of the latter is the class 9 noun prefix ''in-'', which ends in a homorganic nasal. Prenasalisation triggers several changes in the following consonant, some of which are phonemic and others allophonic. The changes can be summed as follows:<ref>Rycroft & Ngcobo (1979) ''Say it in Zulu'', p. 6</ref><ref>''Zulu-English dictionary'', C.M. Doke & B.W. Vilakazi</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A toneless syllable between a high-tone syllable and another tonic syllable assimilates to that high tone. That is, if the preceding syllable ends on a high tone and the following syllable begins with a high tone (because it is high or falling), the intermediate toneless syllable has its pitch raised as well. When the preceding syllable is high but the following is toneless, the medial toneless syllable adopts a high-tone onset from the preceding syllable, resulting in a falling tone contour.\n\nFor example, the English word ''spoon'' was borrowed into Zulu as ''isipunu'', phonemically {{IPA|/\u00edsip\u00fanu/}}. The second syllable ''si'' assimilates to the surrounding high tones, raising its pitch, so that it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00eds\u00edp\u02bc\u00fa\u02d0n\u00f9]}} sentence-finally. If tone pitch is indicated with numbers, with 1 highest and 9 lowest pitch, then the pitches of each syllable can be denoted as 2-4-3-9.<ref>''Zulu-English Dictionary'', Doke, 1958</ref> The second syllable is thus still lower in pitch than both of the adjacent syllables.\n\n====Tone displacement====\n\nDepressor consonants have an effect called ''tone displacement''. Tone displacement occurs whenever a depressor occurs with a high tone, and causes the tone on the syllable to shift rightward onto the next syllable. If the next syllable is long, it gets a falling tone, otherwise a regular high tone. If the penultimate syllable becomes high (not falling), the final syllable [[dissimilation|dissimilates]] and becomes low if it wasn't already. Tone displacement is blocked under the following conditions:\n* When the syllable has a long vowel.\n* When the following syllable also has a depressor consonant.\n* When the following syllable is the final syllable, and is short.\n\nWhenever tone displacement is blocked, this results in a depressor syllable with high tone, which will have the low-tone onset as described above. When the following syllable already has a high or falling tone, the tone disappears from the syllable as if it had been shifted away, but the following syllable's tone is not modified.\n\nSome examples:\n* ''izipunu'' \"spoons\", the plural of ''isipunu'' from the previous section, is phonemically {{IPA|/\u00edzip\u00fanu/}}. Because {{IPA|/z/}} is a depressor consonant, tone assimilation is prevented. Consequently, the word is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u00edz\u00ecp\u02bc\u00fa\u02d0n\u00f9]}} sentence-finally, with low tone in the second syllable.\n* ''izintombi'' \"girls\" is phonemically {{IPA|/iz\u00edntomb\u00ed/}}. {{IPA|/z/}} is a depressor, and is not blocked, so the tone shifts to the third syllable. This syllable can be either long or short depending on sentence position. When long, the pronunciation is {{IPA|[\u00ecz\u00ecnt\u00f4mb\u00ed]}}, with a falling tone. However, when the third syllable is short, the tone is high, and dissimilation of the final syllable occurs, resulting in {{IPA|[\u00ecz\u00ecnt\u00f3mb\u00ec]}}.\n* ''nendoda'' \"with a man\" is phonemically {{IPA|/n\u02b1\u00e9ndoda/}}. {{IPA|/n\u02b1/}} is a depressor, but so is {{IPA|/d/}}, so tone displacement is blocked. Consequently, the pronunciation is {{IPA|[n\u02b1\u011bnd\u0254\u0300\u02d0d\u00e0]}}, with rising pitch in the first syllable due to the low-onset effect.\n\n====Palatalisation====\n\n[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalisation]] is a change that affects labial and alveolar consonants whenever they are immediately followed by {{IPA|/j/}}. While palatalisation occurred historically, it is still productive, and occurs as a result of the addition of suffixes beginning with {{IPA|/j/}}. A frequent example is the diminutive suffix ''-yana''.\n\nMoreover, Zulu does not generally tolerate sequences of a labial consonant plus {{IPA|/w/}}. Whenever {{IPA|/w/}} follows a labial consonant, it changes to {{IPA|/j/}}, which then triggers palatalisation of the consonant. This effect can be seen in the locative forms of nouns ending in ''-o'' or ''-u'', which changes to ''-weni'' and ''-wini'' respectively in the locative. If a labial consonant immediately precedes, palatalisation is triggered. The change also occurs in nouns beginning in ''ubu-'' with a stem beginning with a vowel.\n\nThe following changes occur as a result of palatalisation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

A common former practice was to indicate the implosive {{IPA|/\u0253/}} using the special letter ''\u0253'', while the digraph ''bh'' would then be simply written as ''b''. Some references may also write ''h'' after letters to indicate that they are of the depressor variety, e.g. ''mh'', ''nh'', ''yh'', a practice that is standard in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] orthography.\n\nVery early texts, from the early 20th century or before, tend to omit the distinction between plain and aspirated voiceless consonants, writing the latter without the ''h''.\n\nNouns are written with their prefixes as one orthographical word. If the prefix ends with a vowel (as most do) and the noun stem also begins with a vowel, a hyphen is inserted in between, e.g. ''i-Afrika''. This occurs only with loanwords.\n\n==Morphology==\n{{main article|Zulu grammar}}\nHere are some of the main features of Zulu:\n\n* Word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].\n* Morphologically, it is an [[agglutinative language]].\n* As in other Bantu languages, Zulu nouns are classified into [[noun class|morphological classes]] or ''[[grammatical gender|genders]]'' (16 in Zulu), with different prefixes for singular and plural. Various parts of speech that qualify a noun must agree with the noun according to its gender. Such agreements usually reflect part of the original class with which it is agreeing. An example is the use of the class 'aba-':\n\n::'''B'''onke '''aba'''ntu '''aba'''qatha '''ba'''sepulazini '''ba'''yagawula.\n\n::''All the strong people of the farm are felling (trees).''\n\n:The various agreements that qualify the word 'abantu' (people) can be seen in effect.\n\n* Its verbal system shows a combination of temporal and aspectual categories in their finite paradigm. Typically verbs have two stems, one for present-undefinite and another for perfect. Different prefixes can be attached to these verbal stems to specify subject agreement and various degrees of past or future tense. For example, in the word ''uyathanda'' (\"he loves\"), the present stem of the verb is ''-thanda'', the prefix ''u-'' expresses third-person singular subject and ''-ya-'' is a filler that is used in short sentences.\n:Suffixes are also put into common use to show the causative or reciprocal forms of a verb stem.\n* Most property words (words encoded as adjectives in English) are represented by relative. In the sentence ''umuntu ubomvu'' (\"the person is red\"), the word ''ubomvu'' (root ''-bomvu'') behaves like a verb and uses the agreement prefix ''u-''. however, there are subtle differences; for example, it does not use the prefix ''ya-''.\n\n===Morphology of root ''Zulu''===\nThe root can be combined with a number of prefixes and thus create other words. For example, here is a table with a number of words constructed from the roots -''Zulu'' and ''-ntu'' (the root for ''person/s'', ''people''):\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Zulu language possesses several click sounds typical of Southern African languages, not found in the rest of Africa. The Nguni people have coexisted with other Southern tribes like the San and Khoi.\n\nZulu, like most indigenous Southern African languages, was not a [[written language]] until the arrival of missionaries from Europe, who documented the language using the [[Latin script]]. \nThe first grammar book of the Zulu language was published in [[Norway]] in 1850 by the Norwegian missionary [[Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder|Hans Schreuder]].<ref>Rakkenes, \u00d8ystein (2003) ''Himmelfolket: En Norsk H\u00f8vding i Zululand'', Oslo: Cappelen Forlag, pp. 63\u201365</ref> The first written document in Zulu was a Bible translation that appeared in 1883. In 1901, [[John Dube]] (1871\u20131946), a Zulu from Natal, created the [[Ohlange Institute]], the first native educational institution in South Africa. He was also the author of ''Insila kaShaka'', the first novel written in Zulu (1930). Another pioneering Zulu writer was [[Rolfes Robert Reginald Dhlomo|Reginald Dhlomo]], author of several historical novels of the 19th-century leaders of the Zulu nation: ''U-Dingane'' (1936), ''U-Shaka'' (1937), ''U-Mpande'' (1938), ''U-Cetshwayo'' (1952) and ''U-Dinizulu'' (1968). Other notable contributors to Zulu literature include [[Benedict Wallet Vilakazi]] and, more recently, [[Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali]].\n\nThe written form of Zulu was controlled by the [[Zulu Language Board]] of [[KwaZulu-Natal]]. This board has now been disbanded and superseded by the Pan South African Language Board<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pansalb.org.za/ |title=pansalb.org.za |access-date=17 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217141039/http://www.pansalb.org.za/ |archive-date=17 December 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which promotes the use of all eleven official languages of South Africa.\n\n==Contemporary usage==\nEnglish, Dutch and later [[Afrikaans]] had been the only official languages used by all South African governments before 1994. However, in the [[Kwazulu]] [[bantustan]] the Zulu language was widely used. All education in the country at the high-school level was in English or Afrikaans. Since the demise of apartheid in 1994, Zulu has been enjoying a marked revival. Zulu-language television was introduced by the [[SABC]] in the early 1980s and it broadcasts news and many shows in Zulu. Zulu radio is very popular and newspapers such as ''isoLezwe'',<ref>[http://www.isolezwe.co.za/ isolezwe.co.za]</ref> ''Ilanga''<ref>[http://www.ilanganews.co.za/ ilanganews.co.za]</ref> and ''UmAfrika'' in the Zulu language are available in [[Kwazulu-Natal]] province and in [[Johannesburg]]. In January 2005 the first full-length feature film in Zulu, ''[[Yesterday (2004 film)|Yesterday]]'', was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]].\n\nSouth African [[matriculation]] requirements no longer specify which South African language needs to be taken as a second language, and some people have made the switch to learning Zulu. However people taking Zulu at high-school level overwhelmingly take it as a first language: according to statistics, [[Afrikaans]] is still over 30 times more popular than Zulu as a ''second'' language. The mutual intelligibility of many [[Nguni languages]] has increased the likelihood of Zulu becoming the [[lingua franca]] of the eastern half of the country, although the political dominance of Xhosa-speaking people on national level militates against this.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} (The predominant language in the [[Western Cape]] and [[Northern Cape]] is Afrikaans \u2013 see the map below.)\n\nIn the 1994 film ''[[The Lion King]]'', in the \"[[Circle of Life]]\" song, the phrases ''Ingonyama nengw' enamabala'' (English: ''A lion and a leopard spots''), ''Nans' ingonyama bakithi Baba'' (English: ''Here comes a lion, Father'') and ''Siyonqoba'' (English: ''We will conquer'') were used. In some movie songs, like \"This Land\", the voice says ''Busa leli zwe bo'' (''Rule this land'') and ''Busa ngothando bo'' (''Rule with love'') were used too.\n\nThe song ''[[Siyahamba]]'' is a South African hymn originally written in the Zulu language that became popular in North American churches in the 1990s.\n\n===Standard vs urban Zulu===\n[[standard language|Standard]] Zulu as it is taught in schools, also called \"deep Zulu\" (''isiZulu esijulile''), differs in various respects from the language spoken by people living in cities (urban Zulu, ''isiZulu sasedolobheni''). Standard Zulu tends to be [[Linguistic purism|purist]], using derivations from Zulu words for new concepts, whereas speakers of urban Zulu use [[loan words]] abundantly, mainly from English. For example: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Standard Zulu\n! urban Zulu\n! English\n|-\n| ''umakhalekhukhwini''\n| ''icell''\n| cell/mobile phone\n|-\n| ''Ngiyezwa''\n| ''Ngiya-andastenda''\n| I understand\n|}\nThis situation has led to problems in education because standard Zulu is often not understood by young people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Magagula|first=Constance Samukelisiwe|title=Standard Versus Non-standard IsiZulu: A Comparative Study Between Urban and Rural Learners' Performance and Attitude|year=2009|publisher=University of KwaZulu-Natal|location=Durban}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{IPA notice}}\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n===Vowels===\n[[File:Zulu vowel chart.svg|right|upright=1.13|thumb|Zulu vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Wade|1996}}]]\nZulu has a simple vowel system consisting of five vowels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!

They are {{IPA|[\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u0254]}} otherwise:\n* ''umgibeli'' \"passenger\", phonetically {{IPA|[\u00fam\u0329\u0300\u0261\u00ec\u0253\u00e9(\u02d0)l\u00ec]}}\n* ''ukupheka'' \"to cook\", phonetically {{IPA|[\u00f9\u0260\u00fap\u02b0\u025b\u0300(\u02d0)\u0260\u00e0]}}\n\nThere is limited [[vowel length]] in Zulu, as a result of the contraction of certain syllables. For example, the word ''ithambo'' {{IPA|/\u00ed\u02d0t\u02b0\u00e1mb\u00f3/}} \"bone\", is a contraction of an earlier ''ilithambo'' {{IPA|/\u00edl\u00edt\u02b0\u00e1mb\u00f3/}}, which may still be used by some speakers. Likewise, ''uphahla'' {{IPA|/\u00fa\u02d0p\u02b0a\u026ca/}} \"roof\" is a contraction of earlier ''uluphahla'' {{IPA|/ul\u00fap\u02b0a\u026ca/}}. In addition the vowel of the penultimate syllable is allophonically lengthened phrase- or sentence-finally.\n\n===Consonants===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Zulu phonemes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Dental consonant|Dental]]/[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!

The latter two phonemes occur almost exclusively root-initially, while {{IPA|/\u0260/}} appears exclusively medially. Recent loanwords contain {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} in other positions, e.g. ''isekhondi'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0sek\u02b0o\u02d0ndi/}} \"second\", ''ibhayisikili'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0bajisiki\u02d0li/}} \"bicycle\".\n# The [[slack voice|slack-voiced]] consonants are [[depressor consonant]]s. These have a lowering effect on the tone of their syllable. \n# The consonant {{IPA|/\u014b/}} occurs in some dialects as a reduction of the cluster {{IPA|/n\u0261/}} when it is not in stem-initial position, and is therefore always slack-voiced.\n# The trill {{IPA|/r/}} is not native to Zulu and occurs only in expressive words and in recent borrowings from European languages.\n\nThe use of [[click consonant]]s is one of the most distinctive features of Zulu. This feature is shared with several other languages of Southern Africa, but it is very rare in other regions. There are three basic articulations of clicks in Zulu:\n* [[Dental click|Denti-alveolar]] {{IPA|/\u01c0/}}, comparable to a sucking of teeth, as the sound one makes for 'tsk tsk'.\n* [[Postalveolar click|Alveolar]] {{IPA|/!/}}, comparable to a bottle top 'pop'.\n* [[Alveolar lateral click|Lateral]] {{IPA|/\u01c1/}}, comparable to a click that one may do for a walking horse.\n\nEach articulation covers five click consonants, with differences such as being slack-voiced, [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] or [[nasalisation|nasalised]], for a total of 15.\n\n===Phonotactics===\n\nZulu syllables are canonically (N)C(w)V, and words must always end in a vowel. Consonant clusters consist of any consonant, optionally preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal consonant (so-called \"prenasalisation\", described in more detail below) and optionally followed by the consonant {{IPA|/w/}}.\n\nIn addition, syllabic {{IPA|/m\u0329/}} occurs as a reduction of former {{IPA|/mu/}}, and acts like a true syllable: it can be syllabic even when not word-initial, and can also carry distinctive tones like a full syllable. It does not necessarily have to be homorganic with the following consonant, although the difference between homorganic nonsyllabic {{IPA|/mC/}} and syllabic {{IPA|/m\u0329C/}} is distinctive, e.g. ''umpetshisi'' {{IPA|/um\u0329p\u00e9t\u0283i\u02d0si/}} \"peach tree\" (5 syllables) versus ''impoko'' {{IPA|/\u00edmpo\u02d0\u0260o/}} \"grass flower\" (3 syllables). Moreover, sequences of syllabic ''m'' and homorganic ''m'' can occur, e.g. ''ummbila'' {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329mb\u00ed\u02d0la/}} \"maize\" (4 syllables).\n\nRecent loanwords from languages such as English may violate these constraints, by including additional consonant clusters that are not native to Zulu, such as in ''igremu'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0gre\u02d0mu/}} \"[[gram]]\". There may be some variation between speakers as to whether clusters are broken up by an [[epenthetic vowel]] or not, e.g. ''ikhompiyutha'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0k\u02b0ompiju\u02d0t\u02b0a/}} or ''ikhompyutha'' {{IPA|/i\u02d0k\u02b0ompju\u02d0t\u02b0a/}} \"computer\".\n\n===Prosody===\n\n====Stress====\n\nStress in Zulu words is mostly predictable and normally falls on the penultimate syllable of a word. It is accompanied by allophonic lengthening of the vowel. When the final vowel of a word is long due to contraction, it receives the stress instead of the preceding syllable.\n\nLengthening does not occur on all words in a sentence, however, but only those that are sentence- or phrase-final. Thus, for any word of at least two syllables, there are two different forms, one with penultimate length and one without it, occurring in complementary distribution. In some cases, there are morphemic alternations that occur as a result of word position as well. The remote demonstrative pronouns may appear with the suffix ''-ana'' when sentence-final, but only as ''-\u0101'' otherwise. Likewise, the recent past tense of verbs ends in ''-ile'' sentence-finally, but is reduced to ''-\u0113'' medially. Moreover, a falling tone can only occur on a long vowel, so the shortening has effects on tone as well.\n\nSome words, such as ideophones or interjections, can have stress that deviates from the regular pattern.\n\n====Tone====\n\nLike almost all other [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and other [[African languages]], Zulu is [[tonal Languages|tonal]]. There are three main ''tonemes'': low, high and falling. Zulu is conventionally written without any indication of tone, but tone can be distinctive in Zulu. For example, the words for \"priest\" and \"teacher\" are both spelled ''umfundisi'', but they are pronounced with different tones: {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329f\u00fandisi/}} for the \"priest\" meaning, and {{IPA|/\u00fam\u0329fund\u00edsi/}} for the \"teacher\" meaning.\n\nIn principle, every syllable can be pronounced with either a high or a low tone. However, low tone does not behave the same as the other two, as high tones can \"spread\" into low-toned syllables while the reverse does not occur. A low tone is therefore better described as the ''absence'' of any toneme; it is a kind of default tone that is overridden by high or falling tones. The falling tone is a sequence of high-low, and occurs only on long vowels. The penultimate syllable can also bear a falling tone when it is long due to the word's position in the phrase. However, when it shortens, the falling tone becomes disallowed in that position.{{clarify|reason=What happens to it?|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn principle, every [[morpheme]] has an inherent underlying tone pattern which does not change regardless of where it appears in a word. However, like most other Bantu languages, Zulu has [[word tone]], meaning that the pattern of tones acts more like a template to assign tones to individual syllables, rather than a direct representation of the pronounced tones themselves. Consequently, the relationship between underlying tone patterns and the tones that are actually pronounced can be quite complex. Underlying high tones tend to surface rightward from the syllables where they are underlyingly present, especially in longer words.\n\n====Depressor consonants====\n\nThe breathy consonant phonemes in Zulu are [[depressor consonant]]s, or depressors for short. Depressor consonants have a lowering effect on pitch, adding a non-phonemic low-tone onset to the normal tone of the syllable. Thus, in syllables with depressor consonants, high tones are realised as rising, and falling tones as rising-then-falling. In both cases, the pitch does not reach as high as in non-depressed syllables. The possible tones on a syllable with a voiceless consonant like ''hla'' are {{IPA|[\u026c\u00e1 \u026c\u00e2 \u026c\u00e0]}}, and the possible tones of a breathy consonant syllable, like ''dla'', are {{IPA|[\u026e\u01ce\u0324 \u026ea\u0324\u1dc8 \u026e\u00e0\u0324]}}. A depressor has no effect on a syllable that's already low, but it blocks assimilation to a preceding high tone, so that the tone of the depressor syllable and any following low-tone syllables stays low.\n\n===Phonological processes===\n\n====Prenasalisation====\n\nPrenasalisation occurs whenever a consonant is preceded by a homorganic nasal, either lexically or as a consequence of prefixation. The most notable case of the latter is the class 9 noun prefix ''in-'', which ends in a homorganic nasal. Prenasalisation triggers several changes in the following consonant, some of which are phonemic and others allophonic. The changes can be summed as follows:<ref>Rycroft & Ngcobo (1979) ''Say it in Zulu'', p. 6</ref><ref>''Zulu-English dictionary'', C.M. Doke & B.W. Vilakazi</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A toneless syllable between a high-tone syllable and another tonic syllable assimilates to that high tone. That is, if the preceding syllable ends on a high tone and the following syllable begins with a high tone (because it is high or falling), the intermediate toneless syllable has its pitch raised as well. When the preceding syllable is high but the following is toneless, the medial toneless syllable adopts a high-tone onset from the preceding syllable, resulting in a falling tone contour.\n\nFor example, the English word ''spoon'' was borrowed into Zulu as ''isipunu'', phonemically {{IPA|/\u00edsip\u00fanu/}}. The second syllable ''si'' assimilates to the surrounding high tones, raising its pitch, so that it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u00eds\u00edp\u02bc\u00fa\u02d0n\u00f9]}} sentence-finally. If tone pitch is indicated with numbers, with 1 highest and 9 lowest pitch, then the pitches of each syllable can be denoted as 2-4-3-9.<ref>''Zulu-English Dictionary'', Doke, 1958</ref> The second syllable is thus still lower in pitch than both of the adjacent syllables.\n\n====Tone displacement====\n\nDepressor consonants have an effect called ''tone displacement''. Tone displacement occurs whenever a depressor occurs with a high tone, and causes the tone on the syllable to shift rightward onto the next syllable. If the next syllable is long, it gets a falling tone, otherwise a regular high tone. If the penultimate syllable becomes high (not falling), the final syllable [[dissimilation|dissimilates]] and becomes low if it wasn't already. Tone displacement is blocked under the following conditions:\n* When the syllable has a long vowel.\n* When the following syllable also has a depressor consonant.\n* When the following syllable is the final syllable, and is short.\n\nWhenever tone displacement is blocked, this results in a depressor syllable with high tone, which will have the low-tone onset as described above. When the following syllable already has a high or falling tone, the tone disappears from the syllable as if it had been shifted away, but the following syllable's tone is not modified.\n\nSome examples:\n* ''izipunu'' \"spoons\", the plural of ''isipunu'' from the previous section, is phonemically {{IPA|/\u00edzip\u00fanu/}}. Because {{IPA|/z/}} is a depressor consonant, tone assimilation is prevented. Consequently, the word is pronounced as {{IPA|[\u00edz\u00ecp\u02bc\u00fa\u02d0n\u00f9]}} sentence-finally, with low tone in the second syllable.\n* ''izintombi'' \"girls\" is phonemically {{IPA|/iz\u00edntomb\u00ed/}}. {{IPA|/z/}} is a depressor, and is not blocked, so the tone shifts to the third syllable. This syllable can be either long or short depending on sentence position. When long, the pronunciation is {{IPA|[\u00ecz\u00ecnt\u00f4mb\u00ed]}}, with a falling tone. However, when the third syllable is short, the tone is high, and dissimilation of the final syllable occurs, resulting in {{IPA|[\u00ecz\u00ecnt\u00f3mb\u00ec]}}.\n* ''nendoda'' \"with a man\" is phonemically {{IPA|/n\u02b1\u00e9ndoda/}}. {{IPA|/n\u02b1/}} is a depressor, but so is {{IPA|/d/}}, so tone displacement is blocked. Consequently, the pronunciation is {{IPA|[n\u02b1\u011bnd\u0254\u0300\u02d0d\u00e0]}}, with rising pitch in the first syllable due to the low-onset effect.\n\n====Palatalisation====\n\n[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalisation]] is a change that affects labial and alveolar consonants whenever they are immediately followed by {{IPA|/j/}}. While palatalisation occurred historically, it is still productive, and occurs as a result of the addition of suffixes beginning with {{IPA|/j/}}. A frequent example is the diminutive suffix ''-yana''.\n\nMoreover, Zulu does not generally tolerate sequences of a labial consonant plus {{IPA|/w/}}. Whenever {{IPA|/w/}} follows a labial consonant, it changes to {{IPA|/j/}}, which then triggers palatalisation of the consonant. This effect can be seen in the locative forms of nouns ending in ''-o'' or ''-u'', which changes to ''-weni'' and ''-wini'' respectively in the locative. If a labial consonant immediately precedes, palatalisation is triggered. The change also occurs in nouns beginning in ''ubu-'' with a stem beginning with a vowel.\n\nThe following changes occur as a result of palatalisation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

A common former practice was to indicate the implosive {{IPA|/\u0253/}} using the special letter ''\u0253'', while the digraph ''bh'' would then be simply written as ''b''. Some references may also write ''h'' after letters to indicate that they are of the depressor variety, e.g. ''mh'', ''nh'', ''yh'', a practice that is standard in [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] orthography.\n\nVery early texts, from the early 20th century or before, tend to omit the distinction between plain and aspirated voiceless consonants, writing the latter without the ''h''.\n\nNouns are written with their prefixes as one orthographical word. If the prefix ends with a vowel (as most do) and the noun stem also begins with a vowel, a hyphen is inserted in between, e.g. ''i-Afrika''. This occurs only with loanwords.\n\n==Morphology==\n{{main article|Zulu grammar}}\nHere are some of the main features of Zulu:\n\n* Word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]].\n* Morphologically, it is an [[agglutinative language]].\n* As in other Bantu languages, Zulu nouns are classified into [[noun class|morphological classes]] or ''[[grammatical gender|genders]]'' (16 in Zulu), with different prefixes for singular and plural. Various parts of speech that qualify a noun must agree with the noun according to its gender. Such agreements usually reflect part of the original class with which it is agreeing. An example is the use of the class 'aba-':\n\n::'''B'''onke '''aba'''ntu '''aba'''qatha '''ba'''sepulazini '''ba'''yagawula.\n\n::''All the strong people of the farm are felling (trees).''\n\n:The various agreements that qualify the word 'abantu' (people) can be seen in effect.\n\n* Its verbal system shows a combination of temporal and aspectual categories in their finite paradigm. Typically verbs have two stems, one for present-undefinite and another for perfect. Different prefixes can be attached to these verbal stems to specify subject agreement and various degrees of past or future tense. For example, in the word ''uyathanda'' (\"he loves\"), the present stem of the verb is ''-thanda'', the prefix ''u-'' expresses third-person singular subject and ''-ya-'' is a filler that is used in short sentences.\n:Suffixes are also put into common use to show the causative or reciprocal forms of a verb stem.\n* Most property words (words encoded as adjectives in English) are represented by relative. In the sentence ''umuntu ubomvu'' (\"the person is red\"), the word ''ubomvu'' (root ''-bomvu'') behaves like a verb and uses the agreement prefix ''u-''. however, there are subtle differences; for example, it does not use the prefix ''ya-''.\n\n===Morphology of root ''Zulu''===\nThe root can be combined with a number of prefixes and thus create other words. For example, here is a table with a number of words constructed from the roots -''Zulu'' and ''-ntu'' (the root for ''person/s'', ''people''):\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

{"title_page": "Protein combining", "text_new": "{{See also|protein (nutrient)|protein quality|complete protein}}\n'''Protein combining''' (or '''protein complementing''') is a dietary theory for [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] nutrition that purports to optimize the [[biological value]] of protein intake. According to the theory, [[vegetarian]] and [[vegan]] diets may provide an insufficient amount of some [[essential amino acids]], making protein combining with multiple foods necessary to obtain a [[complete protein]]. The terms ''complete'' and ''incomplete'' are outdated in relation to plant protein. The position of the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] is that protein from a variety of plant foods eaten during the course of a day supplies enough of all essential amino acids when caloric requirements are met.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Melina|first=Vesanto|last2=Craig|first2=Winston|last3=Levin|first3=Susan|date=2016-12-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31192-3/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=116|issue=12|pages=1971|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2016.09.025|issn=2212-2672|pmid=27886704|via=http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx}}</ref>\n\nThough it is undisputed that diverse foods can be combined to make up for their respective limiting amino acids, a general consensus has emerged among nutrition scientist and writers contrary to the original vegetarian nutrition dogmas of the 1970s. First, such foods do not need to be combined within a single meal. Second, though historically protein combining was promoted as a method of compensating for supposed deficiencies in vegetables as foods, studies on essential amino acid contents in plant proteins have shown that vegetarians and vegans typically do not actually need to complement plant proteins in each meal to reach the desired level of essential amino acids as long as their diets are varied and caloric requirements are met.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=V.

To avoid such a deficiency, either a complementary food high in the limiting amino acid (such as legumes which are high in [[lysine]], in the case of rice) or quantities of rice greater than that necessary to meet caloric intake needs would be required. This is not an issue when eating a varied diet. Amino acids are not stored and may be excreted sooner than complemented, under limiting conditions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}  \n\n==Concept==\nProtein nutrition is complex because any [[proteinogenic amino acid]] may be the [[limiting factor]] in [[metabolism]]. Mixing [[livestock feed]]s can optimize for growth, or minimize cost while maintaining adequate growth. Similarly, [[human nutrition]] is subject to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]]: The lowest level of one of the essential amino acids will be the limiting factor in metabolism.\n:If the content of a single indispensable amino acid in the diet is less than the individual\u2019s requirement, then it will limit the utilization of other amino acids and thus prevent the normal rates of synthesis even when the total nitrogen intake level is adequate.

[[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Burr Osborne]] continued what Ritthausen started and published ''The Vegetable Proteins'' in 1909. Thus [[Yale University]] was the early center of protein nutrition, where [[William Cumming Rose]] was a student. Osborne also worked to determine the essentials, and later led the [[Biochemistry]] Department at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nWhen Ritthausen died in 1912, Osborne praised his efforts in biochemistry:\n:As a result of his later work he proved that wide differences exist between different food proteins; and he was the first to direct attention to this fact, and to discuss its probable bearing on their relative value in nutrition.<ref>[[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Osborne, Thomas Burr]] (1913) \"In Memoriam: Heinrich Ritthausen\", ''Biochemical Bulletin'' 2:338, published by the [[Columbia University]] Biochemical Association</ref>\n\nOsborne then joined forces with [[Lafayette Mendel]] at the [[Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station]] to determine the [[essential amino acid]]s.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, [[Nevin S. Scrimshaw]] took this knowledge to India and Guatemala. He designed meals using local vegetables to fight against the scourge of [[kwashiorkor]]. In Guatemala he used the combination of cottonseed flour with maize, while in India he combined peanut flour with wheat.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/nevin-s-scrimshaw-obituary-0211.html Scrimshaw obituary] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]</ref>\n\n==Popularization==\nIn 1954, [[Adelle Davis]] published ''Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit'', which described the importance of combining \"incomplete\" proteins to make \"complete\" proteins, and advised that any incomplete proteins not complemented within one hour could not be used by the body.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Adelle|title=Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit|date=1954|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|isbn=4-87187-961-5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, [[Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9]] published ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'', which explained how essential amino acids might be obtained from complementary sources in [[vegetarian nutrition]]. The book became a [[bestseller]] :\n:An extension of a one-page handout that Lapp\u00e9 had circulated among her fellow improvisors in Berkeley, ''Diet for a Small Planet'' (1971) soon became ''the'' vegetarian text of the [[ecology movement]], selling in the next ten years almost two million copies in three editions and six languages.<ref>Warren Belasco (1989) ''Appetite for Change: how the counterculture took on the food industry 1966 \u2014 1988'', page 56, [[Pantheon Books]] {{ISBN|0394543998}}</ref>\n\nLapp\u00e9 wrote:\n:Complementary protein combinations make for delicious [[recipe]]s \u2013 they are combinations that formed the basis of the world\u2019s traditional [[cuisine]]s.

Rig\u00f3:\n:The [[biological value]] of proteins in general, hence also of grain-proteins, is fundamentally determined by the ratio between the essential amino acids to be found in [[cereal]]s and the requirement of essential amino acids of the living creature, consuming protein...the most important way of raising the biological value ... [is] given by the technique of complementing.<ref>Rig\u00f3, J.

The bases of reference are the amino acids indispensable to human nutrition, and the ideal proportioning of these amino acids in a meal. They explain, \"complementation involves consuming two or more foods together to yield an amino acid pattern that is better than the sum of the two foods alone.\"<ref name=FW>{{Cite journal | last1 = Woolf | first1 = P.

In combating the myth that meat is the only way to get high-quality protein, I reinforced another myth. I gave the impression that in order to get enough protein without meat, considerable care was needed in choosing foods. Actually, it is much easier than I thought.\n\n:\"With three important exceptions, there is little danger of protein deficiency in a plant food diet. The exceptions are diets very heavily dependent on [1] [[fruit]] or on [2] some tubers, such as [[sweet potato]]es or [[cassava]], or on [3] [[junk food]] (refined flours, sugars, and fat). Fortunately, relatively few people in the world try to survive on diets in which these foods are virtually the sole source of calories. In all other diets, if people are getting enough calories, they are virtually certain of getting enough protein.\"<ref name=FML/>{{rp|162}}\n\nNecessity of protein combining was not asserted. Rather, the increased [[biological value]] of meals where proteins are combined was noted. In a concession, Lapp\u00e9 removed from the second edition \"charts that indicate exact proportions of complementary proteins\".<ref name=FML/>{{rp|239}}\n\nThe American Dietetic Association reversed itself in its 1988 position paper on vegetarianism. Suzanne Havala, the primary author of the paper, recalls the research process:\n:There was no basis for [protein combining] that I could see.... I began calling around and talking to people and asking them what the justification was for saying that you had to complement proteins, and there was none. And what I got instead was some interesting insight from people who were knowledgeable and actually felt that there was probably no need to complement proteins. So we went ahead and made that change in the paper.  [Note: The paper was approved by peer review and by a delegation vote before becoming official.]\n\nIn 1994, Vernon Young and Peter Pellett published their paper that became the definitive contemporary guide to protein metabolism in humans. It also confirmed that complementing proteins at meals was totally unnecessary. Thus, people who avoid consuming animal protein do not need to be at all concerned about amino acid imbalances from the plant proteins that make up their usual diets.<ref name=\"VRYoung\">{{cite journal | author=Young VR, Pellett PL | title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=59 | issue=5&nbsp;Suppl | year=1994 | pages=1203S\u20131212S | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.long| pmid=8172124 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s}}</ref>\n\nWhile many plant proteins are lower in one or more essential amino acids than animal proteins, especially [[lysine]], and to a lesser extent [[methionine]] and [[threonine]], eating a variety of plants can serve as a well-balanced and complete source of amino acids.<ref name=\"VRYoung\" />\n\nPediatrician [[Charles R.

First, such foods do not need to be combined within a single meal. Second, though historically protein combining was promoted as a method of compensating for supposed deficiencies in vegetables as foods, studies on essential amino acid contents in plant proteins have shown that vegetarians and vegans typically do not actually need to complement plant proteins in each meal to reach the desired level of essential amino acids as long as their diets are varied and caloric requirements are met. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=V.

To avoid such a deficiency, either a complementary food high in the limiting amino acid (such as legumes which are high in [[lysine]], in the case of rice) or quantities of rice greater than that necessary to meet caloric intake needs would be required.

Mixing [[livestock feed]]s can optimize for growth, or minimize cost while maintaining adequate growth.

[[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Burr Osborne]] continued what Ritthausen started and published ''The Vegetable Proteins'' in 1909. Thus [[Yale University]] was the early center of protein nutrition, where [[William Cumming Rose]] was a student. Osborne also worked to determine the essentials, and later led the [[Biochemistry]] Department at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nWhen Ritthausen died in 1912, Osborne praised his efforts in biochemistry:\n:As a result of his later work he proved that wide differences exist between different food proteins; and he was the first to direct attention to this fact, and to discuss its probable bearing on their relative value in nutrition.<ref>[[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Osborne, Thomas Burr]] (1913) \"In Memoriam: Heinrich Ritthausen\", ''Biochemical Bulletin'' 2:338, published by the [[Columbia University]] Biochemical Association</ref>\n\nOsborne then joined forces with [[Lafayette Mendel]] at the [[Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station]] to determine the [[essential amino acid]]s.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, [[Nevin S. Scrimshaw]] took this knowledge to India and Guatemala. He designed meals using local vegetables to fight against the scourge of [[kwashiorkor]]. In Guatemala he used the combination of cottonseed flour with maize, while in India he combined peanut flour with wheat.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/nevin-s-scrimshaw-obituary-0211.html Scrimshaw obituary] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]</ref>\n\n==Popularization==\nIn 1954, [[Adelle Davis]] published ''Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit'', which described the importance of combining \"incomplete\" proteins to make \"complete\" proteins, and advised that any incomplete proteins not complemented within one hour could not be used by the body.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Adelle|title=Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit|date=1954|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|isbn=4-87187-961-5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, [[Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9]] published ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'', which explained how essential amino acids might be obtained from complementary sources in [[vegetarian nutrition]]. The book became a [[bestseller]] :\n:An extension of a one-page handout that Lapp\u00e9 had circulated among her fellow improvisors in Berkeley, ''Diet for a Small Planet'' (1971) soon became ''the'' vegetarian text of the [[ecology movement]], selling in the next ten years almost two million copies in three editions and six languages.<ref>Warren Belasco (1989) ''Appetite for Change: how the counterculture took on the food industry 1966 \u2014 1988'', page 56, [[Pantheon Books]] {{ISBN|0394543998}}</ref>\n\nLapp\u00e9 wrote:\n:Complementary protein combinations make for delicious [[recipe]]s \u2013 they are combinations that formed the basis of the world\u2019s traditional [[cuisine]]s. We use them naturally in our cooking without even being aware of it.

Rig\u00f3:\n:The [[biological value]] of proteins in general, hence also of grain-proteins, is fundamentally determined by the ratio between the essential amino acids to be found in [[cereal]]s and the requirement of essential amino acids of the living creature, consuming protein...the most important way of raising the biological value ... [is] given by the technique of complementing.<ref>Rig\u00f3, J. (1985) \"Nutritional Functions of Cereals\", in ''Amino Acid Composition and Biological Value of Cereal'', Radomir L\u00e1sztity & M\u00e1t\u00e9 Hidv\u00e9gi editors, [[International Association for Cereal Chemistry]]</ref>\n\nIn 2011 [[PLOS ONE]]published an article investigating the specifics of protein combining for 1251 plant-based foods. The bases of reference are the amino acids indispensable to human nutrition, and the ideal proportioning of these amino acids in a meal. They explain, \"complementation involves consuming two or more foods together to yield an amino acid pattern that is better than the sum of the two foods alone.\"<ref name=FW>{{Cite journal | last1 = Woolf | first1 = P.

In combating the myth that meat is the only way to get high-quality protein, I reinforced another myth. I gave the impression that in order to get enough protein without meat, considerable care was needed in choosing foods. Actually, it is much easier than I thought.\n\n:\"With three important exceptions, there is little danger of protein deficiency in a plant food diet. The exceptions are diets very heavily dependent on [1] [[fruit]] or on [2] some tubers, such as [[sweet potato]]es or [[cassava]], or on [3] [[junk food]] (refined flours, sugars, and fat). Fortunately, relatively few people in the world try to survive on diets in which these foods are virtually the sole source of calories. In all other diets, if people are getting enough calories, they are virtually certain of getting enough protein.\"<ref name=FML/>{{rp|162}}\n\nNecessity of protein combining was not asserted. Rather, the increased [[biological value]] of meals where proteins are combined was noted. In a concession, Lapp\u00e9 removed from the second edition \"charts that indicate exact proportions of complementary proteins\".<ref name=FML/>{{rp|239}}\n\nThe American Dietetic Association reversed itself in its 1988 position paper on vegetarianism. Suzanne Havala, the primary author of the paper, recalls the research process:\n:There was no basis for [protein combining] that I could see.... I began calling around and talking to people and asking them what the justification was for saying that you had to complement proteins, and there was none. And what I got instead was some interesting insight from people who were knowledgeable and actually felt that there was probably no need to complement proteins. So we went ahead and made that change in the paper.  [Note: The paper was approved by peer review and by a delegation vote before becoming official.]\n\nIn 1994, Vernon Young and Peter Pellett published their paper that became the definitive contemporary guide to protein metabolism in humans. It also confirmed that complementing proteins at meals was totally unnecessary. Thus, people who avoid consuming animal protein do not need to be at all concerned about amino acid imbalances from the plant proteins that make up their usual diets.<ref name=\"VRYoung\">{{cite journal | author=Young VR, Pellett PL | title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=59 | issue=5&nbsp;Suppl | year=1994 | pages=1203S\u20131212S | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.long| pmid=8172124 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s}}</ref>\n\nWhile many plant proteins are lower in one or more essential amino acids than animal proteins, especially [[lysine]], and to a lesser extent [[methionine]] and [[threonine]], eating a variety of plants can serve as a well-balanced and complete source of amino acids.<ref name=\"VRYoung\" />\n\nPediatrician [[Charles R.
