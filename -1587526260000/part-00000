Tiger barbs may sometimes be confused with ''[[Puntigrus anchisporus]]'', which are similar in appearance.\n\n==Description==\nThe tiger barb can grow to about {{convert|7-10|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} long and {{convert|3-4|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} wide, although they are often smaller when kept in captivity. Some can grow to around 13 centimeters as well. Native fish are silver to brownish yellow with four vertical black stripes and red fins and snout. The green tiger barb is the same size and has the same nature as the normal barb, but has a green body. The green tiger barb, often called the moss green tiger barb, can vary considerably in how green it looks; to some people it looks nearly black. Albino barbs are a light yellow with four barely visible stripes.\n\n==Habitat==\nTiger barbs have been reported to be found in clear or turbid shallow waters of moderately flowing streams. They live in Indonesia, Borneo,  [[tropical climate]]s and prefer water with a 6.0&ndash;8.0 [[pH]], a water hardness of 5&ndash;19 [[dGH]], and a temperature range of 77 - 82 [[Fahrenheit|\u00b0F]] or 25 - 27.8&nbsp;\u00b0C. Their discovery in swamp lakes subject to great changes in water level suggests a wide tolerance to water quality fluctuations. Their average lifespan is six years.\n\n==Commercial importance==\n[[File:Green tiger barb.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Green tiger barb]]\nThe tiger barb is one of over 70 species of barb with commercial importance in the aquarium trade. Of the total ornamental fish species imported into the United States in 1992, only 20 species account for more than 60% of the total number of specimens reported, with tiger barbs falling at tenth on the list, with 2.6 million individuals imported. (Chapman et al. 1994). Barbs that have been selectively bred to emphasize bright color combinations have grown in popularity and production over the last 20 years.{{when|date=March 2016}} Examples of colour morphs (not hybrids) of tiger barb include highly [[melanistic]] green tiger barbs that reflect green over their black because of the [[Tyndall effect]], gold tiger barbs and albino tiger barbs.\n[[File:A Male Tiger barb.png|thumb|left|200px|Male tiger barb]]\n\n==In the aquarium==\n[[File:green tiger barb school.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A school of green tiger barbs in a 20-gallon tank.]]\nThe tiger barb, an active schooling fish, is usually kept in groups of six or more. They are often aggressive in numbers less than five, and are known fin nippers. Semi aggressive fish form a [[pecking order]] in the pack which they may extend to other fish, giving them a reputation for nipping at the fins of other fish, especially if they are wounded or injured. They are thus not recommended for tanks with slower, more peaceful fishes such as [[betta]]s, [[gourami]]s, angelfish and others with long, flowing fins. They do, however, work well with many fast-moving fish such as [[danio]]s, [[platy (fish)|platy]]s and most catfish. When in large enough groups, however, they tend to spend most of their time chasing each other and leave other species of fish alone. They dwell primarily at the water's mid-level. One of the best tankmates for the tiger barb provided there is considerable space is the [[clown loach]], which will school with the tiger barbs and act as they do, and the tigers act as the loaches do.\nTiger barbs do best in soft, slightly acidic water. The tank should be well lit with ample vegetation, about two-thirds of the tank space. These barbs are omnivorous, and will consume processed foods such as flakes and crisps, as well as live foods. They are relatively greedy with their food consumption and can become aggressive during feeding time. Tiger barbs seem more susceptible than other species to cottonmouth ([[columnaris]]), a bacterial infection.\n\nThe tiger barb was also used to make genetically modified fish sold as [[GloFish]] (fluorescent colored fish).\n\n==Breeding==\n[[File:Puntius tetrazona001.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A ''P. tetrazona'' close to sexual maturity]]\nThe tiger barb usually attains sexual maturity at a body length of {{convert|2|to|3|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} in total length, or at approximately six to seven weeks of age. The females are larger with a rounder belly and a mainly black dorsal fin, while the males have a bright, red nose with a distinct red line above the black on their dorsal fins. The egg-layers tend to spawn several hundred eggs in the early morning in clumps of plants. On average, 300 eggs can be expected from each spawn in a mature broodstock population, although the number of eggs released will increase with the maturity and size of the fish. Spawned eggs are adhesive, negatively buoyant in freshwater and average 1.18 \u00b1 0.05&nbsp;mm in diameter.\n\nTiger barbs have been documented to spawn as many as 500 eggs per female (Scheurmann 1990; Axelrod 1992). Females can spawn at approximately two week intervals (Munro et al. 1990).\n\nOnce [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] is finished, they will usually eat any of the eggs they can find.\n\n==Common hybrids==\n\nInterspecific and intraspecific hybridization is done to achieve different colors and patterns to satisfy market demand for new tiger barb varieties.   Gold and albino tiger barbs are examples of commercially produced fish based on recessive xanthic (yellow) and albino genes. These are not hybrids.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of freshwater aquarium fish species]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q729207}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tiger Barb}}\n[[Category:Puntigrus]]\n[[Category:Barbs (fish)]]\n[[Category:Fish described in 1855]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish of Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Freshwater fish of Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Borneo]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2015}}\n{{one source|date=November 2014}}\n}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| image = Tiger barb fish.jpg\n| image_caption= Tiger barb schooling\n| taxon = Puntigrus tetrazona\n| display_parents = 3\n| authority = ([[Pieter Bleeker|Bleeker]], 1855)\n| synonyms = * ''Capoeta tetrazona'' <small>Bleeker, 1855</small>\n* ''Barbus tetrazona'' <small>(Bleeker, 1855)</small>\n* ''Barbus tetrazona tetrazona'' <small>(Bleeker, 1855)</small>\n* ''Puntius tetrazona'' <small>(Bleeker, 1855)</small>\n* ''Systomus tetrazona'' <small>(Bleeker, 1855)</small>\n}}\n[[File:Tiger Barb 700.jpg|thumb|Tiger barb in an aquarium]]\n\nThe '''tiger barb''' or '''Sumatra barb''' (''Puntigrus tetrazona''),<ref name=Kottelat2013>Kottelat, M.

He was the middle child of Michael and Divona Lewis.  His parents were practicing Scientologists and Johnny was himself a Scientologist for most of his life.

His debut feature film performance premiered in 2004, in [[New Line Cinema]]'s ''[[Raise Your Voice]]'', and he followed that up with Miramax Films' ''[[Underclassman]]'' in 2005. He co-starred as Pearce Chase, one of five siblings on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] series ''[[Quintuplets]]'', and appeared in the movie ''[[Raise Your Voice]]'' (2004) alongside [[Hilary Duff]]. He [[guest star]]red in four episodes of the [[Nickelodeon]] television series ''[[Drake & Josh]]'' as Scottie, one of Drake's bandmates, and from 2005 to 2006, he played [[List of recurring characters in The O.C.#Dennis .22Chilli.22 Childress|Dennis \"Chili\" Childress]] on ''[[The O.C.]]''. Lewis also had a guest spot in the third episode of [[Smallville (season 5)|''Smallville'' season 5]].\n\nHe also starred in the film ''Magic Valley'' (2011), which premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].

He pleaded no contest to charges of assault with a deadly weapon in the case.<ref name=\"Warning\"/> The second arrest came about six weeks after the first, with Lewis accused of attempting to break into a woman's home. He pleaded no contest in that case as well. Considering the cases, a probation official expressed that he was \"very concerned for the well-being of not only the community but that of the defendant\", that Lewis suffered from mental health issues as well as chemical dependency, and that Lewis would \"continue to be a threat to any community he may reside in\".<ref name=\"Warning\"/>  Lewis was released from a [[Los Angeles County, California]], jail on September 21, 2012, five days before his death.<ref name=\"Warning\"/>\n\n==Psychiatric diagnosis==\nOn October 30, 2011, Lewis suffered head injuries from a high-speed motorcycle accident. Though an [[MRI]] was recommended, and Lewis's father scheduled  MRI tests twice, Lewis refused to take them. Lewis's father also states that he \"pursued and encouraged psychiatric treatment for his son. It was Johnny who refused to comply.\"<ref name=\"Bill Jensen 1 of 3\"/> He started manifesting bizarre and illogical behavior from that point on and concurrent to his ensuing legal troubles.\n\nBill Jensen reported in [[Los Angeles (magazine)|''Los Angeles'' magazine]] that Lewis and his attorneys pushed for rehab for marijuana addiction. When Lewis rejected this, they pursued rehab for alcoholism, to avoid trial.<ref name=\"Bill Jensen 1 of 3\"/>\n\nIn early August 2012, Lewis was well enough to be granted provisional out-patient status. He made a deal with the District Attorney of the San Fernando Court - his freedom for \"time served\". Lewis was assured that he would likely just spend a couple more days in jail, no more. The couple of days turned into nearly two more months, during which he suffered a severe downturn in health and spirits.
