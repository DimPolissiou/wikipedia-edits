TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)\"\n* \"Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes.

Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, Nebraska; Omaha, Nebraska; Nebraska City, Nebraska; St. Joseph, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface.

TransCanada arbitrarily and improperly adjusted spill factors to produce an estimate of one major spill on the {{convert|1,673|mi|km|abbr=on}} of pipeline about every five years, but federal data on the actual incidence of spills on comparable pipelines indicate a more likely average of almost two major spills per year. (The existing Keystone I pipeline has had one major spill and 11 smaller spills in its first year of operation.)\"\n* \"Analysis of the time needed to shut down the pipeline shows that response to a leak at a river crossing could conservatively take more than ten times longer than the 11 minutes and 30 seconds that TransCanada assumes.

Contaminants from a spill at the Platte River crossing would travel downstream unabated into the Missouri River for several hundred miles affecting drinking water intakes for hundreds of thousands of people (e.g., Lincoln, Nebraska; Omaha, Nebraska; Nebraska City, Nebraska; St. Joseph, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri) as well as aquatic habitats and recreational activities. In addition, other constituents from the spill would pose serious risks to humans and to aquatic species in the river.\"\n* \"The worst-case site for such a spill is in the Sandhills region of Nebraska. The Sandhills are ancient sand dunes that have been stabilized by grasses. Because of their very permeable geology, nearly 100 percent of the annual rainfall infiltrates to a very shallow aquifer, often less than 20 feet below the surface.

{"title_page": "Twydall Profile", "text_new": "[[File:Twydall Profile.png|thumb|right|A section through the ditch and rampart of a fortification using the Twydall Profile.]]\nThe '''Twydall Profile''' was a style of [[fortification]] used in [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[British Empire|Imperial]] [[polygonal fort]]s at the end of the 19th century. The sloping earthworks employed in the Twydall Profile were intended to be quick and inexpensive to construct and to be effective in the face of the more powerful [[artillery]] and [[high explosive]] ammunition being introduced at that time. The name comes from the village of [[Twydall]] in [[Kent]], where the first forts of this type were built.\n\n==Origins==\nThe design of the Twydall Profile emerged following the [[Siege of Plevna]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877 to 1878]]. There, the hastily constructed [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[fieldwork]]s had successfully withstood repeated [[Russian Empire|Russian]] assaults between July and September 1877; the Russians finally took the town after defeating an attempted Turkish breakout in December. The reason for the effectiveness of the Turkish defences was attributed to two factors; firstly, that the force of the Russian shells had been absorbed by the Turkish earthworks and secondly, that the defenders had been armed with American [[breech loading]] and [[repeating rifle]]s and had been able to break up the attacking [[infantry]] formations before they had reached their objectives.<ref>Lowry,  Bernard (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zqD1fiJFRJwC&pg=PA92&dq=%22Twydall+Profile%22+Fortifications+From+the+Tudors+to+the+Cold+War&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PGp7VLeMDKSC7gam_wE&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Twydall%20Profile%22%20Fortifications%20From%20the%20Tudors%20to%20the%20Cold%20War&f=false ''Discovering Fortifications: From the Tudors to the Cold War''] Shire Books, {{ISBN|978-0747806516}} (pp. 91-92)</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a huge investment had been made in the previous decades in a considerable number of large fortifications to defend the [[Royal Navy Dockyard|naval dockyard]]s, collectively known as the [[Palmerston Forts]]. Not only had many of these been designed to mount artillery which was now obsolete, but the intended defensive scheme for the dockyard at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham in Kent]] had never been completed. The solution, devised and promoted by the forward thinking [[military engineer]], [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] Sir [[George Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe|George Sydenham Clarke]], was for a smaller, less expensive type of fort or [[redoubt]], which could be manned by infantry and mobile [[field artillery]] rather than large guns fixed in deep emplacements. Previous forts had relied on defence against an infantry attack by means of a deep ditch with steep walls, often [[revetment|revetted]] with stone, brick or concrete, known as the scarp (facing outwards) and the [[counterscarp]] (facing inwards). The fort was further protected by [[caponier]]s and [[counterscarp#Counterscarp gallery|counterscarp galleries]]; positions from which rifle or light artillery fire could be directed along the ditch. In the proposed new redoubts, all of this would be replaced by sloping earth banks, intended to maximise the effect of the defenders' rifles and minimise the effect of the attackers' artillery.\n\nIn 1885, a pair of small forts were accordingly built by way of an experiment, designed to protect the eastern overland approaches to Chatham, near the village of [[Twydall]]. [[Woodlands Redoubt]] and [[Grange Redoubt]] were collectively known as the '''Twydall Redoubts''' and were intended to prove the effectiveness of the new system and how quickly and cheaply they could be constructed. Under the direction of [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Sir Andrew Clarke]], the Inspector-General of Fortifications,<ref>Dyer, Nick (2003), ''British Fortification in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries'', The Palmerston Forts Society, {{ISBN|978-0-9523634-6-0}} (p. 25)</ref> Woodlands Fort was built by a civilian contractor within a month, for the sum of \u00a31,800. Grange Fort was built by the [[Royal Engineers]]. Sir Andrew reported that the full cost of the project was \"...\u00a36,000 as opposed to at least \u00a345,000 for the old type [of fort]\". The redoubts each had a central row of bomb proof [[casemates]] in which the infantry garrison could shelter and was surrounded by a low earthen [[Defensive wall|rampart]], on which field guns could be sited and a [[banquette]] or fire step and [[parapet]], over which the infantry could fire their rifles. The shallow ditch was crossed by a [[drawbridge]] at the rear; however, neither work had the barracks, fixed artillery emplacements, [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s or caponiers that might have been expected in a fort of this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianforts.co.uk/pdf/datasheets/grangewoodlands.pdf |title=Grange and Woodland Redoubt |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.victorianforts.co.uk |publisher=Victorian Forts and Artillery |accessdate=30 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nIn the study of fortification, the term \"profile\" means the form of a defensive structure when viewed as a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] in the vertical [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].<ref>Straith,  Hector (1851), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EFkBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR7&dq=fortification+terms+%22profile%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mSp7VK7mIYjX7Aby3oBo&ved=0CB8Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=fortification%20terms%20%22profile%22&f=false ''Introductory Essay to the Study of Fortification''], Parker, Furnivall and Parker, London (p.3)</ref> The Twydall Profile consists of a simple earthen [[Defensive wall|rampart]], built as low as possible; between 10 and 15 feet (3 and 4.5 metres) and not greater than 20 feet (6 metres) was recommended. From the crest of the rampart continuous gentle slope, ideally of a [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] of 1 in 10, falling to 15 or 20 feet (4.5 or 6 metres) below the original surface of the ground. At the foot of the slope is an unclimbable [[palisade]] made of angled steel [[Wikt:paling|paling]]s, often referred to as a \"[[Dacoit]] fence\", recommended to be 9 feet 6 inches (2.9 metres) tall.

The sloping earthworks employed in the Twydall Profile were intended to be quick and inexpensive to construct and to be effective in the face of the more powerful [[artillery]] and [[high explosive]] ammunition being introduced at that time. The name comes from the village of [[Twydall]] in [[Kent]], where the first forts of this type were built.\n\n==Origins==\nThe design of the Twydall Profile emerged following the [[Siege of Plevna]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877 to 1878]]. There, the hastily constructed [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[fieldwork]]s had successfully withstood repeated [[Russian Empire|Russian]] assaults between July and September 1877; the Russians finally took the town after defeating an attempted Turkish breakout in December. The reason for the effectiveness of the Turkish defences was attributed to two factors; firstly, that the force of the Russian shells had been absorbed by the Turkish earthworks and secondly, that the defenders had been armed with American [[breech loading]] and [[repeating rifle]]s and had been able to break up the attacking [[infantry]] formations before they had reached their objectives.<ref>Lowry,  Bernard (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zqD1fiJFRJwC&pg=PA92&dq=%22Twydall+Profile%22+Fortifications+From+the+Tudors+to+the+Cold+War&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PGp7VLeMDKSC7gam_wE&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Twydall%20Profile%22%20Fortifications%20From%20the%20Tudors%20to%20the%20Cold%20War&f=false ''Discovering Fortifications: From the Tudors to the Cold War''] Shire Books, {{ISBN|978-0747806516}} (pp. 91-92)</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, a huge investment had been made in the previous decades in a considerable number of large fortifications to defend the [[Royal Navy Dockyard|naval dockyard]]s, collectively known as the [[Palmerston Forts]]. Not only had many of these been designed to mount artillery which was now obsolete, but the intended defensive scheme for the dockyard at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham in Kent]] had never been completed. The solution, devised and promoted by the forward thinking [[military engineer]], [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] Sir [[George Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe|George Sydenham Clarke]], was for a smaller, less expensive type of fort or [[redoubt]], which could be manned by infantry and mobile [[field artillery]] rather than large guns fixed in deep emplacements. Previous forts had relied on defence against an infantry attack by means of a deep ditch with steep walls, often [[revetment|revetted]] with stone, brick or concrete, known as the scarp (facing outwards) and the [[counterscarp]] (facing inwards). The fort was further protected by [[caponier]]s and [[counterscarp#Counterscarp gallery|counterscarp galleries]]; positions from which rifle or light artillery fire could be directed along the ditch. In the proposed new redoubts, all of this would be replaced by sloping earth banks, intended to maximise the effect of the defenders' rifles and minimise the effect of the attackers' artillery.\n\nIn 1885, a pair of small forts were accordingly built by way of an experiment, designed to protect the eastern overland approaches to Chatham, near the village of [[Twydall]]. [[Woodlands Redoubt]] and [[Grange Redoubt]] were collectively known as the '''Twydall Redoubts''' and were intended to prove the effectiveness of the new system and how quickly and cheaply they could be constructed. Under the direction of [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer)|Sir Andrew Clarke]], the Inspector-General of Fortifications,<ref>Dyer, Nick (2003), ''British Fortification in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries'', The Palmerston Forts Society, {{ISBN|978-0-9523634-6-0}} (p. 25)</ref> Woodlands Fort was built by a civilian contractor within a month, for the sum of \u00a31,800. Grange Fort was built by the [[Royal Engineers]]. Sir Andrew reported that the full cost of the project was \"...\u00a36,000 as opposed to at least \u00a345,000 for the old type [of fort]\". The redoubts each had a central row of bomb proof [[casemates]] in which the infantry garrison could shelter and was surrounded by a low earthen [[Defensive wall|rampart]], on which field guns could be sited and a [[banquette]] or fire step and [[parapet]], over which the infantry could fire their rifles. The shallow ditch was crossed by a [[drawbridge]] at the rear; however, neither work had the barracks, fixed artillery emplacements, [[magazine (artillery)|magazine]]s or caponiers that might have been expected in a fort of this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianforts.co.uk/pdf/datasheets/grangewoodlands.pdf |title=Grange and Woodland Redoubt |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=www.victorianforts.co.uk |publisher=Victorian Forts and Artillery |accessdate=30 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nIn the study of fortification, the term \"profile\" means the form of a defensive structure when viewed as a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] in the vertical [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].<ref>Straith,  Hector (1851), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EFkBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR7&dq=fortification+terms+%22profile%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mSp7VK7mIYjX7Aby3oBo&ved=0CB8Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=fortification%20terms%20%22profile%22&f=false ''Introductory Essay to the Study of Fortification''], Parker, Furnivall and Parker, London (p.3)</ref> The Twydall Profile consists of a simple earthen [[Defensive wall|rampart]], built as low as possible; between 10 and 15 feet (3 and 4.5 metres) and not greater than 20 feet (6 metres) was recommended.

NON-IRANIAN LANGUAGES (1) Overview \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Cadusii lived in Cadusia \u2013 a mountainous district of [[Atropatene|Media Atropatene]] on the south-west shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], between the parallels of 39\u00b0 and 37\u00b0 North latitude. This district was probably bounded on the North by the river Cyrus (today [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura]], in the former Soviet Republic of [[Azerbaijan]], historically known as [[Arran (Republic of Azerbaijan)|Arran]] and [[Caucasian Albania]]), and on the South by the river Mardus (today [[Sefid River]]), and corresponds with the modern [[Iran]]ian provinces of [[Gilan]] and [[Ardabil Province|Ardabil]].\n\nThey are described by [[Strabo]]{{r|stra_11}} as a warlike tribe of mountaineers, fighting chiefly on foot, and well skilled in the use of the short spear or [[pilum|javelin]]. It is possible that the name of the [[Gelae (tribe)|Gelae]] (Gilites) \u2013 a tribe who are constantly associated with the Cadusii, to the point of considering the former the national name for the Cadusii{{r|plin_6.18}} \u2013 has been preserved in the modern ''Gilan''.\n\nNo mention of the Cadusii has been found in Caucasian or Middle Eastern sources, and they are known only through Greek and Latin sources.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before the Persian Empire===\nThey appear to have constantly been at war with their neighbours. First subjected by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], if we believe to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]]' doubtful sources,{{r|diod_2.3}} they were then brought in at least nominal subjection to the [[Medes]], until they rebelled at the time of the king of the Medes [[Artaeus]]. In [[Ctesias]]' tale (reported by Diodorus) the war originated from an offence the king gave to an able powerful [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]], called [[Parsodes]]. After the offence Parsodes retired himself in the Cadusii's land with a small force and he attached himself with the most powerful of the local lords by offering his sister in marriage to him. At this point the country, who was subject to at least a nominal subjugation to the Medes, rebelled and chose as its war-leader Parsodes, giving him command of their army. Against these the Medes armed no less than eight hundred thousand men (these are the numbers given by Ctesias, which shouldn't be given much trust). Artaeus failed miserably in his attempt to reconquer the Cadusii and Parsodes was triumphantly elected king by the winners. Parsodes waged continuous raids in [[Medes|Media]] for all his long kingdom, and so did those who succeeded him, generating a state of perpetual enmity and warfare between Cadusii and Medes that continued until the fall of the Medes in 559 BC.<!---{{r|diod_1.33}} undefined reference---> But it must be remembered that all Greek records on the East before Cyrus must be treated with the utmost skepticism{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}. This said, it may be that behind this legend there is a part of truth if we believe some scholars who identify Artaeus with [[Herodotus]]' [[Deioces]], or better Duyakku, an important Mede chief in the age of Assyrian hegemony. Another point of interest in this story is that Ctesias here mentions for the first time the Cadusii. What seems more certain (in the report of [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]) is that near to the end of the Mede kingdom the Cadusii played an important role in bringing its downfall by allying themselves with the Medes' enemies, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]].\n\n===Cadusii and Persians===\nIt does not seem that the Persians had initially great difficulties in submitting the Cadusii; they were immediately loyal allies of [[Cyrus II of Persia|Cyrus the Great]] (559\u2013529 BC), firstly against the Medes and secondly against the [[Babylonians]].{{r|xen1_5.3_4}} And their submission seems to have been something more than nominal considering that [[Xenophon]] tells us that Cyrus assigned to a son called Tanaoxares (probably [[Smerdis of Persia|Smerdis]]) the [[satrapy]] of Cadusia.{{r|xen1_8.7}} But by the times of [[Darius I of Persia|Darius the Great]] Persian full control on the region must have suffered a partial setback, since we never hear their name in Herodotus or in Persian inscriptions in the lists of peoples and territories being part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|empire]]. In an unknown year they had been, it would seem, successfully submitted and probably added to the satrapy of [[Medes|Media]] or that of [[Hyrcania]]; this because it is told that in 406 BC [[Cyrus the Younger]], a son of the High King [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]] (423\u2013404 BC), had just led an expedition against the Cadusii in revolt.{{r|xen2_2.1.13}} Cyrus' expedition was a success as three years later the Cadusii fought at [[Cunaxa]] under the banners of [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] (404\u2013358 BC) against Cyrus. But their obedience to Artaxerxes II didn't keep long; we see them rebelling in 385 and 358 BC. The [[Artaxerxes' II Cadusian Campaign|first rebellion was defeated]] by a great army led by the same Artaxerxes. In the victory paid a key role the king's advisor [[Tiribazus]], who smartly tricked the chief rebels in submitting themselves to the king. Another man who distinguished himself in the campaign was [[Datames]], who would rise to become one of the most brilliant Persian generals.{{r|plut_24_nepos_1_diod_15.8_10}} The conflict of 358 under [[Artaxerxes III of Persia|Artaxerxes III]] (358\u2013338 BC) was the last major clash between Cadusii and Persians; for the last years of the empire the Cadusii remained submissive. This war was important since it gave an occasion for the Persian general Codomannus, to distinguish himself in a sole combat against a Cadusian chief; an action that paved him the road to the throne as [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] (336\u2013330 BC).{{r|diod_17.6_just_10.3}}\n\n===Alexander the Great and aftermath===\nIn the Macedonian conquest of the east the Cadusii remained loyal to the Persians all the way up to Darius III's bitter end; we read of their cavalry fighting against [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] at [[Gaugamela]] (331 BC) and of preparing to send reinforcements to the High King after the battle. But at the end they were subdued by Alexander's general [[Parmenion]].{{r|diod_17.59_curt_4.15_arr_3.8_19}} In the subsequent Eastern wars they are mentioned as the allies of one or other party. After the division of Alexander's empire they became part of the [[Seleucid empire]]; in this context we read of them fighting for the Seleucids in the [[battle of Raphia]] against the Egyptians (217 BC), and their name is cited by [[Antiochus III]]'s (223\u2013187 BC) envoys at [[Aegium]] to the [[Achaean League|Achaeans]] as one of the many people under the sway of the Seleucids. But the crushing [[Roman republic|Romans]] victory at [[Battle of Magnesia|Magnesia]] started the disintegration of Seleucid power and the loss of all eastern territories. From this moment, little is known of Cadusian history; they seem to have been early submitted by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]].

NON-IRANIAN LANGUAGES (1) Overview \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Cadusii lived in Cadusia \u2013 a mountainous district of [[Atropatene|Media Atropatene]] on the south-west shores of the [[Caspian Sea]], between the parallels of 39\u00b0 and 37\u00b0 North latitude. This district was probably bounded on the North by the river Cyrus (today [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura]], in the former Soviet Republic of [[Azerbaijan]], historically known as [[Arran (Republic of Azerbaijan)|Arran]] and [[Caucasian Albania]]), and on the South by the river Mardus (today [[Sefid River]]), and corresponds with the modern [[Iran]]ian provinces of [[Gilan]] and [[Ardabil Province|Ardabil]].\n\nThey are described by [[Strabo]]{{r|stra_11}} as a warlike tribe of mountaineers, fighting chiefly on foot, and well skilled in the use of the short spear or [[pilum|javelin]]. It is possible that the name of the [[Gelae (tribe)|Gelae]] (Gilites) \u2013 a tribe who are constantly associated with the Cadusii, to the point of considering the former the national name for the Cadusii{{r|plin_6.18}} \u2013 has been preserved in the modern ''Gilan''.\n\nNo mention of the Cadusii has been found in Caucasian or Middle Eastern sources, and they are known only through Greek and Latin sources.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before the Persian Empire===\nThey appear to have constantly been at war with their neighbours. First subjected by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], if we believe to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]]' doubtful sources,{{r|diod_2.3}} they were then brought in at least nominal subjection to the [[Medes]], until they rebelled at the time of the king of the Medes [[Artaeus]]. In [[Ctesias]]' tale (reported by Diodorus) the war originated from an offence the king gave to an able powerful [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]], called [[Parsodes]]. After the offence Parsodes retired himself in the Cadusii's land with a small force and he attached himself with the most powerful of the local lords by offering his sister in marriage to him. At this point the country, who was subject to at least a nominal subjugation to the Medes, rebelled and chose as its war-leader Parsodes, giving him command of their army. Against these the Medes armed no less than eight hundred thousand men (these are the numbers given by Ctesias, which shouldn't be given much trust). Artaeus failed miserably in his attempt to reconquer the Cadusii and Parsodes was triumphantly elected king by the winners. Parsodes waged continuous raids in [[Medes|Media]] for all his long kingdom, and so did those who succeeded him, generating a state of perpetual enmity and warfare between Cadusii and Medes that continued until the fall of the Medes in 559 BC.<!---{{r|diod_1.33}} undefined reference---> But it must be remembered that all Greek records on the East before Cyrus must be treated with the utmost skepticism{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}. This said, it may be that behind this legend there is a part of truth if we believe some scholars who identify Artaeus with [[Herodotus]]' [[Deioces]], or better Duyakku, an important Mede chief in the age of Assyrian hegemony. Another point of interest in this story is that Ctesias here mentions for the first time the Cadusii. What seems more certain (in the report of [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]) is that near to the end of the Mede kingdom the Cadusii played an important role in bringing its downfall by allying themselves with the Medes' enemies, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]].\n\n===Cadusii and Persians===\nIt does not seem that the Persians had initially great difficulties in submitting the Cadusii; they were immediately loyal allies of [[Cyrus II of Persia|Cyrus the Great]] (559\u2013529 BC), firstly against the Medes and secondly against the [[Babylonians]].{{r|xen1_5.3_4}} And their submission seems to have been something more than nominal considering that [[Xenophon]] tells us that Cyrus assigned to a son called Tanaoxares (probably [[Smerdis of Persia|Smerdis]]) the [[satrapy]] of Cadusia.{{r|xen1_8.7}} But by the times of [[Darius I of Persia|Darius the Great]] Persian full control on the region must have suffered a partial setback, since we never hear their name in Herodotus or in Persian inscriptions in the lists of peoples and territories being part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|empire]]. In an unknown year they had been, it would seem, successfully submitted and probably added to the satrapy of [[Medes|Media]] or that of [[Hyrcania]]; this because it is told that in 406 BC [[Cyrus the Younger]], a son of the High King [[Darius II of Persia|Darius II]] (423\u2013404 BC), had just led an expedition against the Cadusii in revolt.{{r|xen2_2.1.13}} Cyrus' expedition was a success as three years later the Cadusii fought at [[Cunaxa]] under the banners of [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] (404\u2013358 BC) against Cyrus. But their obedience to Artaxerxes II didn't keep long; we see them rebelling in 385 and 358 BC. The [[Artaxerxes' II Cadusian Campaign|first rebellion was defeated]] by a great army led by the same Artaxerxes. In the victory paid a key role the king's advisor [[Tiribazus]], who smartly tricked the chief rebels in submitting themselves to the king. Another man who distinguished himself in the campaign was [[Datames]], who would rise to become one of the most brilliant Persian generals.{{r|plut_24_nepos_1_diod_15.8_10}} The conflict of 358 under [[Artaxerxes III of Persia|Artaxerxes III]] (358\u2013338 BC) was the last major clash between Cadusii and Persians; for the last years of the empire the Cadusii remained submissive. This war was important since it gave an occasion for the Persian general Codomannus, to distinguish himself in a sole combat against a Cadusian chief; an action that paved him the road to the throne as [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] (336\u2013330 BC).{{r|diod_17.6_just_10.3}}\n\n===Alexander the Great and aftermath===\nIn the Macedonian conquest of the east the Cadusii remained loyal to the Persians all the way up to Darius III's bitter end; we read of their cavalry fighting against [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] at [[Gaugamela]] (331 BC) and of preparing to send reinforcements to the High King after the battle. But at the end they were subdued by Alexander's general [[Parmenion]].{{r|diod_17.59_curt_4.15_arr_3.8_19}} In the subsequent Eastern wars they are mentioned as the allies of one or other party. After the division of Alexander's empire they became part of the [[Seleucid empire]]; in this context we read of them fighting for the Seleucids in the [[battle of Raphia]] against the Egyptians (217 BC), and their name is cited by [[Antiochus III]]'s (223\u2013187 BC) envoys at [[Aegium]] to the [[Achaean League|Achaeans]] as one of the many people under the sway of the Seleucids. But the crushing [[Roman republic|Romans]] victory at [[Battle of Magnesia|Magnesia]] started the disintegration of Seleucid power and the loss of all eastern territories. From this moment, little is known of Cadusian history; they seem to have been early submitted by the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. As their allies [[Mark Antony|Mark Anthony]] met them in 36 BC during his Parthian campaign; and two centuries later [[Caracalla]] in 216 repeated the campaign also entering in contact with the Cadusii. Excepting a forged letter by a Cadusian chief named Velonus to the Sasanian king [[Shapur I]] in 260, this is practically the last source that speaks of the Cadusii as an existing people; at this point they seem to vanish probably merging with other Caspian tribes.

Cosmopolitan Book was sold to [[Farrar & Rinehart]] in 1931.<ref name=\"cosmobook\" /> After two years of leasing them to Eleanor \"Cissy\" Patterson (of the McCormick-Patterson family that owned the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''), Hearst sold her the ''Washington Times'' and ''Herald'' in 1939; she merged them to form the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]''. That year he also bought the ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' from Paul Block (who bought it from the Pfisters in 1929), absorbing his afternoon ''Wisconsin News'' into the morning publication. Also in 1939, he sold the ''Atlanta Georgian'' to Cox Newspapers, which merged it with the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.\n\nHearst, with his chain now owned by his creditors after a 1937 liquidation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/devil-and-mr-hearst/|title=The Devil and Mr. Hearst|last=Frank|first=Dana|date=June 22, 2000|website=The Nation}}</ref>, also had to merge some of his morning papers into his afternoon papers. In Chicago, he combined the morning ''Herald-Examiner'' and the afternoon ''American'' into the ''Herald-American'' in 1939. This followed the 1937 combination of the New York ''Evening Journal'' and the morning ''American'' into the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', the sale of the ''[[Omaha Daily Bee]]'' to the ''[[World-Herald]]''. Abandoning the morning market was harmful in the long run for Hearst's media holdings as most of his remaining newspapers became afternoon papers. Newspapers in Rochester, Syracuse and Fort Worth were sold or closed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAfternoon papers were a profitable business in pre-television days, often outselling their morning counterparts featuring stock market information in early editions, while later editions were heavy on sporting news with results of baseball games and horse races. Afternoon papers also benefited from continuous reports from the battlefront during [[World War II]]. After the war, however, both television news and suburbs experienced an explosive growth; thus, evening papers were more affected than those published in the morning, whose circulation remained stable while their afternoon counterparts' sales plummeted. Another major blow was the fact that beginning in the 1950s, football and baseball games were being played later in the afternoon to fit television schedules and now stretched through early in the evening, preventing afternoon papers from publishing all the results.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1947, Hearst produced an early television newscast for the [[DuMont Television Network]]: ''[[I.N.S. Telenews]]'', and in 1948 he became the owner of one of the first television stations in the country, [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. \n\nThe earnings of Hearst's three morning papers, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'', and ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', supported the company's money-losing afternoon publications such as the ''Los Angeles Herald-Express'', the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', and the ''[[Chicago American]]''. The company sold the latter paper in 1956 to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s owners, who changed it to the tabloid-size ''Chicago Today'' in 1969 and ceased publication in 1974). In 1960, Hearst also sold the ''[[Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph]]'' to the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' and the ''Detroit Times'' to ''[[The Detroit News]]''. After a lengthy strike it sold the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' to the afternoon ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' in 1962. The same year Hearst's Los Angeles papers \u2013 the morning ''Examiner'' and the afternoon ''Herald-Express'' \u2013 merged to become the evening ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]''. The [[1962-63 New York City newspaper strike]] left the city with no papers for over three months, with the ''Journal-American'' one of the earliest strike targets of the Typographical Union. The ''Boston Record'' and the ''Evening American'' merged in 1961 as the ''Record-American'' and in 1964, the ''Baltimore News-Post'' became the ''Baltimore News-American''.\n\nIn 1953 Hearst Magazines bought ''[[Sports Afield]]'' magazine, which it published until 1999 when it sold the journal to [[Robert E. Petersen]]. In 1958, Hearst's International News Service merged with E.W. Scripps' [[United Press]], forming [[United Press International]] as a response to the growth of the [[Associated Press]] and [[Reuters]]. The following year Scripps-Howard's ''San Francisco News'' merged with Hearst's afternoon ''San Francisco Call-Bulletin''. Also in 1959, Hearst acquired the paperback book publisher [[Avon (publisher)|Avon Books]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864911,00.html|title=The Press: Quiet Deal|date=August 31, 1959|work=Time|access-date=April 23, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the Hearst Corporation began pursuing [[Joint Operating Agreement]]s (JOA's). It reached the first agreement with the DeYoung family, proprietors of the afternoon ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', which began to produce a joint Sunday edition with the ''Examiner''. In turn, the ''Examiner'' became an evening publication, absorbing the ''[[The San Francisco Call|News-Call-Bulletin]]''. The following year, the ''Journal-American'' reached another JOA with another two landmark New York City papers: the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' and [[Scripps-Howard]]'s ''[[New York World-Telegram|World-Telegram and Sun]]'' to form the ''New York World Journal Tribune'' (recalling the names of the city's mid-market dailies), which collapsed after only a few months.\n\nThe 1962 merger of the ''Herald-Express'' and ''Examiner'' in Los Angeles led to the termination of many journalists who began to stage a 10-year strike in 1967. The effects of the strike accelerated the pace of the company's demise, with the ''Herald Examiner'' ceasing publication November 2, 1989.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Last Los Angeles Herald-Examiner Strike| url=https://library.csun.edu/SCA/Peek-in-the-Stacks/Examiner| date=February 3, 2014| website=[[California State University Northridge]] [[Oviatt Library]]| accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Newspaper shifts===\nHearst moved into hardcover publishing by acquiring [[Arbor House]] in 1978 and [[William Morrow and Company]] in 1981.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/16/arts/donald-fine-75-publisher-of-suspenseful-best-sellers.html|title=Donald Fine, 75, Publisher Of Suspenseful Best Sellers|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|date=August 16, 1997|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 24, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Hearst acquires leading book publisher| agency=United Press International| accessdate=August 28, 2018| url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/02/13/Hearst-acquires-leading-book-publisher/5505350888400/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the company sold the ''[[Boston Herald|Boston Herald American]]'' \u2014the result of the 1972 merger of Hearst's ''Record-American & Advertiser'' with the ''Herald-Traveler'' \u2014 to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1982/11/18/Murdoch-Hearst-agree-on-sale-of-Boston-Herald-American/3484406443600/|title=Murdoch, Hearst agree on sale of Boston Herald American|website=UPI|language=en|access-date=August 20, 2019}}</ref> which renamed the paper as ''[[The Boston Herald]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/22/us/boston-newspaper-renamed.html|title=Boston Newspaper Renamed|last=Ap|date=December 22, 1982|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 20, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> competing to this day with the ''[[Boston Globe]]''.\n\nIn 1986, Hearst bought the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' and that same year closed the 213-year-old ''[[Baltimore News-American]]'' after a failed attempt to reach a JOA with [[Arunah Shepherdson Abell|A.S.

Cosmopolitan Book was sold to [[Farrar & Rinehart]] in 1931.<ref name=\"cosmobook\" /> After two years of leasing them to Eleanor \"Cissy\" Patterson (of the McCormick-Patterson family that owned the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''), Hearst sold her the ''Washington Times'' and ''Herald'' in 1939; she merged them to form the ''[[Washington Times-Herald]]''. That year he also bought the ''[[The Milwaukee Sentinel|Milwaukee Sentinel]]'' from Paul Block (who bought it from the Pfisters in 1929), absorbing his afternoon ''Wisconsin News'' into the morning publication. Also in 1939, he sold the ''Atlanta Georgian'' to Cox Newspapers, which merged it with the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]''.\n\nHearst, with his chain now owned by his creditors after a 1937 liquidation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/devil-and-mr-hearst/|title=The Devil and Mr. Hearst|last=Frank|first=Dana|date=June 22, 2000|website=The Nation}}</ref>, also had to merge some of his morning papers into his afternoon papers. In Chicago, he combined the morning ''Herald-Examiner'' and the afternoon ''American'' into the ''Herald-American'' in 1939. This followed the 1937 combination of the New York ''Evening Journal'' and the morning ''American'' into the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', the sale of the ''[[Omaha Daily Bee]]'' to the ''[[World-Herald]]''. Abandoning the morning market was harmful in the long run for Hearst's media holdings as most of his remaining newspapers became afternoon papers. Newspapers in Rochester, Syracuse and Fort Worth were sold or closed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAfternoon papers were a profitable business in pre-television days, often outselling their morning counterparts featuring stock market information in early editions, while later editions were heavy on sporting news with results of baseball games and horse races. Afternoon papers also benefited from continuous reports from the battlefront during [[World War II]]. After the war, however, both television news and suburbs experienced an explosive growth; thus, evening papers were more affected than those published in the morning, whose circulation remained stable while their afternoon counterparts' sales plummeted. Another major blow was the fact that beginning in the 1950s, football and baseball games were being played later in the afternoon to fit television schedules and now stretched through early in the evening, preventing afternoon papers from publishing all the results.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1947, Hearst produced an early television newscast for the [[DuMont Television Network]]: ''[[I.N.S. Telenews]]'', and in 1948 he became the owner of one of the first television stations in the country, [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. \n\nThe earnings of Hearst's three morning papers, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Examiner]]'', and ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'', supported the company's money-losing afternoon publications such as the ''Los Angeles Herald-Express'', the ''[[New York Journal-American]]'', and the ''[[Chicago American]]''. The company sold the latter paper in 1956 to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s owners, who changed it to the tabloid-size ''Chicago Today'' in 1969 and ceased publication in 1974). In 1960, Hearst also sold the ''[[Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph]]'' to the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' and the ''Detroit Times'' to ''[[The Detroit News]]''. After a lengthy strike it sold the ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' to the afternoon ''[[Milwaukee Journal]]'' in 1962. The same year Hearst's Los Angeles papers \u2013 the morning ''Examiner'' and the afternoon ''Herald-Express'' \u2013 merged to become the evening ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner]]''. The [[1962-63 New York City newspaper strike]] left the city with no papers for over three months, with the ''Journal-American'' one of the earliest strike targets of the Typographical Union. The ''Boston Record'' and the ''Evening American'' merged in 1961 as the ''Record-American'' and in 1964, the ''Baltimore News-Post'' became the ''Baltimore News-American''.\n\nIn 1953 Hearst Magazines bought ''[[Sports Afield]]'' magazine, which it published until 1999 when it sold the journal to [[Robert E. Petersen]]. In 1958, Hearst's International News Service merged with E.W. Scripps' [[United Press]], forming [[United Press International]] as a response to the growth of the [[Associated Press]] and [[Reuters]]. The following year Scripps-Howard's ''San Francisco News'' merged with Hearst's afternoon ''San Francisco Call-Bulletin''. Also in 1959, Hearst acquired the paperback book publisher [[Avon (publisher)|Avon Books]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,864911,00.html|title=The Press: Quiet Deal|date=1959-08-31|work=Time|access-date=2019-04-23|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, the Hearst Corporation began pursuing [[Joint Operating Agreement]]s (JOA's). It reached the first agreement with the DeYoung family, proprietors of the afternoon ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', which began to produce a joint Sunday edition with the ''Examiner''.

{"title_page": "Domain registration", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2017}}\n\n'''Domain registration''' is the process of acquiring a [[domain name]] from a domain name [[Domain name registrar|registrar]].\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1993 the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]], in conjunction with several public and private entities, created [[InterNIC]] to maintain a central database that contains all the registered domain names and the associated IP addresses in the U.S. (other countries maintain their own NICs (Network Information Centers) -- there is a link below that discusses Canada's system, for example). [[Network Solutions]], a member of InterNIC, was chosen to administer and maintain the growing number of Internet domain names and IP addresses. This central database is copied to Top Level Domain (TLD) servers around the world and creates the primary routing tables used by every computer that connects to the Internet.\n\nEach [[ICANN]]-accredited registrar must pay a fixed fee of US$4,000 plus a variable fee. The sum of variable registrar fees is intended to total US$3.8 million.<ref>[https://www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/adopted-budget-2007-06-29-en ICANN Adopted Budget: Fiscal Year 2007\u20142008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216221230/https://www.icann.org/resources/unthemed-pages/adopted-budget-2007-06-29-en |date=February 16, 2016 }}</ref> The competition created by the shared registration system enables end users to choose from many registrars offering a range of related services at varying prices.\n\n==Designated registrar==\nDomain registration information is maintained by the domain name registries, which contract with domain registrars to provide registration services to the public. An end user selects a registrar to provide the registration service, and that registrar becomes the ''designated registrar'' for the domain chosen by the user.\n\nOnly the designated registrar may modify or delete information about domain names in a central registry database. It is not unusual for an end user to switch registrars, invoking a [[#Domain_name_transfer|domain transfer]] process between the registrars involved, that is governed by specific domain name transfer policies.\n\nAlthough the dedicated registrar is the only entity that can modify or delete information regarding domain names in the central registry, there are many [https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/reseller-2013-05-03-en domain resellers] that allow you to sell domains. You do not have to become a designated [[registrar]] in order to sell and register domains. \n\nWhen a registrar registers a <kbd>com</kbd> domain name for an end-user, it must pay a maximum annual fee of US$7.34 to [[VeriSign]], the registry operator for <kbd>com</kbd>, and a US$0.18 annual administration fee to ICANN. Most domain registrars price their services and products to address both the annual fees and the administration fees that must be paid to ICANN. [[Barrier to entry|Barriers to entry]] into the bulk registrar industry are high for new companies without an existing customer base.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nMany registrars also offer registration through reseller affiliates. An end-user registers either directly with a registrar, or indirectly through one or more layers of resellers.  As of 2010, the retail cost generally ranges from a low of about $7.50 per year to about $35 per year for a simple domain registration, although registrars often drop the price far lower&nbsp;\u2013 sometimes even free&nbsp;\u2013 when ordered with other products.\n\nThe maximum period of registration for a domain name is  10 years. Some registrars offer longer periods of up to 100 years,<ref>{{cite web| title=Protect Your Domain Name Registration Into The Next Century|url=https://www.networksolutions.com/domain-name-registration/popup-100-yr-term.jsp}}</ref> but such offers involve the registrar renewing the registration for their customer; the 100-year registration would not be in the official registration database.\n\n==DNS hosting==\n{{main|DNS hosting|Domain name system}}\nRegistration of a domain name establishes a set of [[Start of Authority]] (SOA) records in the DNS servers of the parent domain, indicating the [[IP address]] (or domain name) of DNS servers that are ''authoritative'' for the domain.  This provides merely a reference for how to find the domain data&nbsp;\u2013 not the actual domain data.\n\nRegistration of a domain does not automatically imply the provision of DNS services for the registered domain. Most registrars do offer [[DNS hosting]] as an optional free service for domains registered through them.  If DNS services are not offered, or the end-user opts out, the end-user is responsible for procuring or self-hosting DNS services.  Without DNS services for the domain, the registration is essentially useless for Internet services, although this situation is often encountered with [[domain parking]] and [[cybersquatting]].\n\n==Domain name transfer==<!--[[domain transfer]] redirects here-->\nA domain name transfer is the process of changing the designated registrar of a domain name. ICANN has defined a ''Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars''.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Policy on Transfer of Registrations between Registrars {{!}} Takes effect 1 June 2012|url= http://www.icann.org/en/transfers/policy-en.htm|publisher= [[ICANN]]|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}</ref> The usual process of a domain name transfer is:\n# The end user verifies that the [[whois]] admin contact info is correct, particularly the email address; obtains the authentication code ([[Transfer secret|EPP transfer code]]) from the old registrar, and removes any [[domain lock]] that has been placed on the registration.  If the whois information had been out of date and is now updated, the end-user should wait 12\u201324 hours before proceeding further, to allow time for the updated data to propagate.\n# The end user contacts the new registrar with the wish to transfer the domain name to their service, and supplies the authentication code.\n# The gaining Registrar must obtain express authorization from either the Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact. A transfer may only proceed if confirmation of the transfer is received by the gaining Registrar from one of these contacts. The authorization must be made via a valid Standardized Form of Authorization, which may be sent e.g. by e-mail to the e-mail addresses listed in the WHOIS. The Registered Name Holder or the Administrative Contact must confirm the transfer. The new registrar starts electronically the transfer of the domain with the help of the authentication code (auth code).\n# The old registrar will contact the end user to confirm the authenticity of this request.  The end user may have to take further action with the old registrar, such as returning to the online management tools, to re-iterate their desire to proceed, in order to expedite the transfer.\n# The old registrar will release authority to the new registrar.\n# The new registrar will notify the end user of transfer completion.  The new registrar may have automatically copied over the domain server information, and everything on the website will continue to work as before.  Otherwise, the domain server information will need to be updated with the new registrar.\n\nAfter this process, the new registrar is the domain name's designated registrar. The process may take about five days.  In some cases, the old registrar may intentionally delay the transfer as long as allowable.  After transfer, the domain cannot be transferred again for 60 days, except back to the previous registrar.\n\nIt is unwise to attempt to transfer a domain immediately before it expires. In some cases, a transfer can take up to 14 days, meaning that the transfer may not complete before the registration expires. This could result in loss of the domain name registration and failure of the transfer.  To avoid this, end users should either transfer well before the expiration date, or renew the registration before attempting the transfer.<ref>[https://www.dyndns.com/support/kb/domain_expirations.html]</ref>\n\nIf a domain registration expires, irrespective of the reason, it can be difficult, expensive, or impossible for the original owner to get it back.  After the expiration date, the domain status often passes through several management phases, often for a period of months; usually it does not simply become generally available.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.icann.org/en/registrars/gtld-lifecycle.htm|title= ICANN Lifecycle of a gTLD domain.}}</ref>\n\nThe lists appear to all use at most 16 publicly available generic TLDs (gTLDs) that existed as of December 2009, plus .us.
