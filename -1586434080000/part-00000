The notion of \"the right to be forgotten\" is derived from numerous pre-existing European ideas. There is a longstanding belief in the United Kingdom, specifically under the [[Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974|Rehabilitation of Offenders Act]], that after a certain period of time, many criminal convictions are \"spent\", meaning that information regarding said person should not be regarded when obtaining insurance or seeking employment.

In the United States, transparency, the right of free speech according to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and the right to know have typically been favoured over the obliteration of truthfully published information regarding individuals and corporations. The term \"right to be forgotten\" is a relatively new idea, though on May 13, 2014, the [[European Court of Justice]] legally solidified that the \"right to be forgotten\" is a human right when they ruled against Google in the ''[[Google v Gonz\u00e1lez|Costeja]]'' case.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynskey|first=Orla|date=May 2015|title=Control over Personal Data in a Digital Age: Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja Gonzalez.|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/61944/1/__lse.ac.uk_storage_LIBRARY_Secondary_libfile_shared_repository_Content_Lynskey%2C%20O_Control%20personal%20data_Lynskey_Control%20personal%20data_2015.pdf|journal=Modern Law Review|volume=78|issue=3|pages=522\u2013534|via=|doi=10.1111/1468-2230.12126}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the [[European Union]] adopted the [[Data Protection Directive|European Data Protection Directive]] (Directive 95/46/EC) to regulate the processing of personal data.<ref>Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.

The right to be forgotten, specifically, is a matter of EU-US relations when applied to cross-border data flow, as it raises questions about territorial sovereignty. The structure of the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian international system]] assumes that the reach of a country's jurisdiction is limited to its geographic territory.<ref name=\"Stephen J.

Kobrin 2004 pp 111-131\"/>\n\nThe regulatory differences on the right to be forgotten along with numerous other data protection rights have shaped discussions and negotiations on trans-Atlantic data privacy regulations. A case in point is the EU and the United States' endeavors to develop the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|Safe Harbor]] agreement, a data transfer pact that enables the transfer of data between the EU and US companies in a manner consistent with the EU's data protection schemes.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">The Council: Common Position (EC) no. 95</ref> Article 25 of the Data Protection Directive articulates that cross-border transfer of data can take place only if the \"third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection,\" meaning that the country meets the EU's minimum standards of data protection.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The standards include, among many provisions, a component that protects the right to \"opt out\" of further processing or transmission of personal data, under the assumption that data may not be further processed in ways inconsistent with the intent for which they were collected.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nGiven the inconsistencies between the EU and the United States on numerous [[digital privacy]] regulations, including the right to be forgotten, Article 25 poses a threat to trans-Atlantic data flows. Therefore, the EU and the United States entered into negotiations to mediate the differences through the Safe Harbor agreement, which as a result of debate and discussion between the two parties, requires companies to provide individuals with the choice or opportunity to \"opt out\" and afford other protections.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nUnder the pressures of the mass surveillance carried out by the US government on European citizens' data, the Safe Harbor agreement has been invalidated by the [[European Court of Justice|European Union Court of Justice]] in its [[Max Schrems|''Schrems'' case.]] The Safe Harbor agreement has now been replaced by the [[EU-US Privacy Shield|Privacy Shield principles]].\n\n==Draft European Data Protection Regulation==<!-- do not decapitalise; this is a proper noun -->\n{{main|General Data Protection Regulation}}\n{{update|section|date=February 2018}}\nThe 2012 draft European Data Protection Regulation Article 17 detailed the \"right to be forgotten and to erasure\".<ref name=\"europa1\">{{Citation |year=2012 |title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) |at=Article 17 \"Right to be forgotten and to erasure\" |publisher=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf }}</ref> Under Article 17 individuals to whom the data appertains are granted the right to \"obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data, especially in relation to personal data which are made available by the data subject while he or she was a child or where the data is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected for, the subject withdraws consent, the storage period has expired, the data subject objects to the processing of personal data or the processing of data does not comply with other regulation\".<ref name=\"europa1\"/>\n\nThe EU defines \"data controllers\" as \"people or bodies that collect and manage personal data\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/data-collection/index_en.htm |title=Who can collect and process personal data? - Justice |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2014-06-26 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> The EU General Data Protection Regulation requires data controllers who have been informed that an individual has requested the deletion of any links to or copies of information must \"take all reasonable steps, including technical measures, in relation to data for the publication of which the controller is responsible, to inform third parties which are processing such data, that a data subject requests them to erase any links to, or copy or replication of that personal data.

Researchers and authors behind Oblivion say that \"it is essential to develop techniques that at least partly automate this process and are scalable to Internet size.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Oblivion helps the humans that operate the forms at Google ensure that ill-intending users cannot \"blacklist links to Internet sources that do not affect them.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, tests have proven that Oblivion handles requests at a rate of 278 per second.<ref name=\":3\" /> The software allows Google, the government, and the user to work together to get content removed quickly and for just cause. In order to ensure that the program works quickly, is secure for its users and is impervious to fake take-down requests, Oblivion uses a three-part system.\n\nIn the first part, Oblivion requires a user to submit identification about themselves \u2013 not limited to \"name, age, and nationality.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Oblivion then enables a user to automatically find and tag his or her disseminated personal information using natural language processing and image recognition techniques and file a request in a privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion will scan the article for attributes that match information that has been submitted by the user. Second, Oblivion provides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism, asserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online resource. The author of a request is then issued an \"ownership token\"<ref name=\":3\" /> that confirms the articles they submitted for evaluation include sensitive personal information. The automated eligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that only legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding links from search results. In the third and last phase, this \"ownership token\" is submitted to Google, accompanied by the user's concerns as to what information should be deleted.<ref name=\":3\" /> Google's staff is then allowed to decide for themselves if they want to delete this information or not - but thanks to Oblivion, they know that the information in question is valid.\n\nResearchers with Oblivion, however, have noted that it comes with some limitations. The software is lacking a human element, therefore it cannot decide on its own \"whether or not a piece of information is public interest and should therefore not be removed from Google search results.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Researchers have conducted comprehensive evaluations, showing that Oblivion is suitable for large-scale deployment once it is fine-tuned.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nData deletion protocols around the death of a user is another consideration.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lott-Lavigna |first1=Ruby |title=The weird rise of cyber funerals |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/cyber-funerals |accessdate=19 February 2019 |work=[[Wired UK]] |date=17 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Accountability]]\n* [[Article 29 Working Party]]\n* [[Fundamental rights]]\n* ''[[Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez]]''\n* [[General Data Protection Regulation]]\n* [[Information privacy]]\n* [[International human rights law]]\n* [[Internet privacy]]\n*[[Search engine privacy]]\n* ''[[Martin v.

The notion of \"the right to be forgotten\" is derived from numerous pre-existing European ideas. There is a longstanding belief in the United Kingdom, specifically under the [[Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974|Rehabilitation of Offenders Act]], that after a certain period of time, many criminal convictions are \"spent\", meaning that information regarding said person should not be regarded when obtaining insurance or seeking employment.

In the United States, transparency, the right of free speech according to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], and the right to know have typically been favoured over the obliteration of truthfully published information regarding individuals and corporations. The term \"right to be forgotten\" is a relatively new idea, though on May 13, 2014, the [[European Court of Justice]] legally solidified that the \"right to be forgotten\" is a human right when they ruled against Google in the ''[[Google v Gonz\u00e1lez|Costeja]]'' case.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynskey|first=Orla|date=May 2015|title=Control over Personal Data in a Digital Age: Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja Gonzalez.|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/61944/1/__lse.ac.uk_storage_LIBRARY_Secondary_libfile_shared_repository_Content_Lynskey%2C%20O_Control%20personal%20data_Lynskey_Control%20personal%20data_2015.pdf|journal=Modern Law Review|volume=78|issue=3|pages=522\u2013534|via=|doi=10.1111/1468-2230.12126}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, the [[European Union]] adopted the [[Data Protection Directive|European Data Protection Directive]] (Directive 95/46/EC) to regulate the processing of personal data.<ref>Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.

Therefore, the EU and the United States entered into negotiations to mediate the differences through the Safe Harbor agreement, which as a result of debate and discussion between the two parties, requires companies to provide individuals with the choice or opportunity to \"opt out\" and afford other protections.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nUnder the pressures of the mass surveillance carried out by the US government on European citizens' data, the Safe Harbor agreement has been invalidated by the [[European Court of Justice|European Union Court of Justice]] in its [[Max Schrems|''Schrems'' case.]] The Safe Harbor agreement has now been replaced by the [[EU-US Privacy Shield|Privacy Shield principles]].\n\n==Draft European Data Protection Regulation==<!-- do not decapitalise; this is a proper noun -->\n{{main|General Data Protection Regulation}}\n{{update|section|date=February 2018}}\nThe 2012 draft European Data Protection Regulation Article 17 detailed the \"right to be forgotten and to erasure\".<ref name=\"europa1\">{{Citation |year=2012 |title=Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation) |at=Article 17 \"Right to be forgotten and to erasure\" |publisher=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf }}</ref> Under Article 17 individuals to whom the data appertains are granted the right to \"obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data, especially in relation to personal data which are made available by the data subject while he or she was a child or where the data is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected for, the subject withdraws consent, the storage period has expired, the data subject objects to the processing of personal data or the processing of data does not comply with other regulation\".<ref name=\"europa1\"/>\n\nThe EU defines \"data controllers\" as \"people or bodies that collect and manage personal data\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/data-collection/index_en.htm |title=Who can collect and process personal data? - Justice |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date=2014-06-26 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}</ref> The EU General Data Protection Regulation requires data controllers who have been informed that an individual has requested the deletion of any links to or copies of information must \"take all reasonable steps, including technical measures, in relation to data for the publication of which the controller is responsible, to inform third parties which are processing such data, that a data subject requests them to erase any links to, or copy or replication of that personal data.

Researchers and authors behind Oblivion say that \"it is essential to develop techniques that at least partly automate this process and are scalable to Internet size.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Oblivion helps the humans that operate the forms at Google ensure that ill-intending users cannot \"blacklist links to Internet sources that do not affect them.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, tests have proven that Oblivion handles requests at a rate of 278 per second.<ref name=\":3\" /> The software allows Google, the government, and the user to work together to get content removed quickly and for just cause. In order to ensure that the program works quickly, is secure for its users and is impervious to fake take-down requests, Oblivion uses a three-part system.\n\nIn the first part, Oblivion requires a user to submit identification about themselves \u2013 not limited to \"name, age, and nationality.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Oblivion then enables a user to automatically find and tag his or her disseminated personal information using natural language processing and image recognition techniques and file a request in a privacy-preserving manner. Oblivion will scan the article for attributes that match information that has been submitted by the user. Second, Oblivion provides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism, asserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online resource. The author of a request is then issued an \"ownership token\"<ref name=\":3\" /> that confirms the articles they submitted for evaluation include sensitive personal information. The automated eligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that only legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding links from search results. In the third and last phase, this \"ownership token\" is submitted to Google, accompanied by the user's concerns as to what information should be deleted.<ref name=\":3\" /> Google's staff is then allowed to decide for themselves if they want to delete this information or not - but thanks to Oblivion, they know that the information in question is valid.\n\nResearchers with Oblivion, however, have noted that it comes with some limitations. The software is lacking a human element, therefore it cannot decide on its own \"whether or not a piece of information is public interest and should therefore not be removed from Google search results.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Researchers have conducted comprehensive evaluations, showing that Oblivion is suitable for large-scale deployment once it is fine-tuned.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nData deletion protocols around the death of a user is another consideration.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lott-Lavigna |first1=Ruby |title=The weird rise of cyber funerals |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/cyber-funerals |accessdate=19 February 2019 |work=[[Wired UK]] |date=17 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Accountability]]\n* [[Article 29 Working Party]]\n* [[Fundamental rights]]\n* ''[[Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez]]''\n* [[General Data Protection Regulation]]\n* [[Information privacy]]\n* [[International human rights law]]\n* [[Internet privacy]]\n*[[Search engine privacy]]\n* ''[[Martin v.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed.

He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[Once Upon a Crime]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished (1995 film)|Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (1996 film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor. Subsequently, Hamilton has hosted the live stage adaptation of the show, ''[[The Price Is Right Live!]]''. In August 2008, Hamilton co-starred in ''Coma'', a web series on [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Madsen, George Hamilton and Paul Ben-Victor Star in Coma, an Original Web Series Premiering On Crackle.com|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=73148|publisher=webwire.com|date=August 22, 2008|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref> Hamilton was executive producer of the 2009 film ''[[My One and Only (film)|My One and Only]]'', which is loosely based on his early life and relationship with his mother.\n\nHamilton was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame on August 12, 2009&nbsp;\u2013 his 70th birthday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daylife.com/photo/0bMv0nZ2Ce94v |title=Content Marketing Platform - B2B and B2C Content Marketing Technology - NewsCred |publisher=Daylife.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304070010/http://www.daylife.com/photo/0bMv0nZ2Ce94v |archivedate=March 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508121758/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars+dedicated+by+date.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=May 8, 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> Hamilton appeared as a contestant on the UK edition of ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished (1995 film)|Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''Playback'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

The engines were mid-mounted in the chassis, and the cylinders were horizontal.  Drive was to the rear wheels via a 4-speed gearbox and chain. The gearbox is in 2 parts, linked by a connecting rod, the left one containing 2nd and 4th gear, and the right 1st, 3rd and reverse.\n\nThe 2-cylinder engine is rated at 9 HP, and is just over 2.5 liters in size. A [[total-loss oiling system]] is used on the car, lubricating 6 main oil-ways. James & Browne also launched a 4-cylinder version (16 HP), of a similar design to the horizontal 2-cylinder engine.\n\nIn 1906 a vertical-engined car was introduced known as the Vertex and available as either a 20&nbsp;hp four or 30/40&nbsp;hp six-cylinder.\n\n== Surviving cars ==\nOnly two of their cars are known to have survived, one built in 1902 and the other in 1904.\n\n===1902 model===\nThe car was built in 1902 and transported by train from the James and Browne works in [[Hammersmith, London]] to Albrighton Station, [[Shropshire]]. The first owner was Mr. Norman McLean of The Blue House, [[Tong, Shropshire]]. Mr Mclean had the car painted in the colours of his stables which were yellow with black lining. The car was then moved to [[Tong Castle]], the home of Miss Hartley, his future wife. The Hartley family had leased [[Tong Castle]] from Lord Bradford since 1855. Miss Hartley\u2019s brother was [[John Hartley (tennis)]], the winner of the Wimbledon Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Championship in 1879 and 1880.\n\nMr. McLean decided that some alterations to the car were required and instructed Mr. Ernest Roy Spencer to carry out the work. The Spencers were blacksmiths and ran their business at 15 Broadway, [[Shifnal]],<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Watts |editor-first=Sylvia |title=Shifnal, A Pictorial History |year=1989 |publisher= |isbn=0-85033-686-4}}</ref> around three miles from [[Tong Castle]]. \n\nIn 1910 Mr. McLean decided that he no longer had a use for the car and virtually gave it to Ernest Spencer for a nominal sum of \u00a320. The car was moved to Ernest Spencer\u2019s business premises. Mr. Spencer decided that Mr. Mclean\u2019s colour scheme was too conspicuous for general use and drinking trips, so decided to paint the car battleship grey with black piping. Mr. Spencer intended to convert the car to a pick-up truck for his business and fitted it with magneto ignition and a windscreen. However, with the outbreak of [[World War 1]] in Summer 1914, the car was mothballed and stored in a shed at the back of the premises and stayed there until 1929. \n\nIn 1929 it was decided to enter the car in the Old Crocks' Run to Brighton. The less permanent alterations to the car were removed and it was returned to as near original condition as possible. The car was entered in the Old Crocks' Run to Brighton on Sunday 20th October (entry number 25) and departed from the Mall at around 9am. The ambitious cargo for the journey to Brighton consisted of five passengers, their luggage and a quantity of beer. The car had a good run but lost time when the battery terminals shook loose, and was the fifth car to arrive in Brighton.\n\nIn December 1929, ownership of the car passed to Mr. Herbert Ford who purchased the car from the Spencers for the sum of \u00a335. Mr. Ford was a local man and shrewd businessman, and had owned nearby [[Lilleshall Hall]] since 1927. In 1930, Mr. Ford opened some pleasure gardens for the public at [[Lilleshall Hall]], and these included an amusement park, narrow gauge railway and children's playgrounds. The car was used as an attraction in the amusement park. Mr. Ford and his friend, Mr. T.R. Price, entered the car in the 1933 Old Crocks' Run on Sunday 12th November 1933. The car (entry number 21) completed the run successfully with an average speed of 19.61 mph. \n\nIn October 1934, the car was purchased by John Garland and Dick Riddle, two students at the City and Guilds College, part of [[Imperial College London]] The car has been an active part of college life from 1934 to the present day. The car is still maintained by students and is driven in many events including the [[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run]].\n\n===1904 model===\nThe first owner of the 1904 car was The Reverend Dr. John Darlington, the vicar of St Mark's Church, [[Kennington]] in London, who also owned a house in [[Curry Rivel]], near [[Taunton]] in Somerset. The Reverend had originally owned a Peugeot which had badly let him down in 1905, and as a friend of his had a reliable two-cylinder James & Browne car he visited the Showroom in Oxford Street and asked to buy a car \"like the one my friend owns\".  Browne remembered this visit as he had to advise Darlington that the Company had ceased making two-cylinder models in 1904, but he could offer Darlington a new four-cylinder 1905 model. Darlington was adamant that he wanted a two-cylinder car, so it was arranged that an unused two-cylinder engine, gearbox and transmission from the workshop be fitted into a compatible spare chassis, but with a later model body designed for the four-cylinder car.\n\nErnest Proctor, who was employed at the Westcroft Works, was given the job of assembling this hybrid car, which comprised a very early two-cylinder engine - number 30 - of 1901 or 1902 vintage, a 1904 chassis - number 126, and a body destined for four-cylinder car number 156.\n\nTechnical data:\n:Engine: No.30. Twin-cylinder horizontal, each cylinder 4\" dia. x 6\" stroke. Inlet valves suction operated: exhaust valves mechanically operated. Water-cooled, with no pump or cooling fan.\n:Ignition: 6 volt battery producing ignition via 2 trembler coils (originally also fitted with magneto with switching between trembler and magneto as required). Conventional spark plugs.\n:Lubrication: Drip feed from reservoir on dashboard via sight glasses to 6 oiling points on main bearings and pistons.\n:Gearboxes: Two boxes - one for 1st. 3rd. and reverse, the other for 2nd. and 4th. with a sliding shaft between the two. Lubrication by splash feed in each box.\n:Transmission: Main drive from engine to gear boxes via heavy steel spur gear into a mating 'Buffoline' rawhide gear attached to the flywheel on the crank shaft.\n:Final Drive: By two chains via a differential.\n:Brakes: Foot brake operates on transmission. Hand brake is a conventional drum brake on the rear wheels only.\n:Wheels/tires: Originally wooden wheels with solid tires, but these were changed in the early years to Sankey type metal wheels and fitted with balloon tires.\n:Lighting: Side and rear lamps - oil (paraffin). Headlamps acetylene - gas produced from carbide/water accumulator.\n\nThe car was first registered Y184 and was delivered to Darlington at Kennington Vicarage on 10 March 1906. It was used in London until it was driven to Curry Rivel on 23 April 1906 by Henry Lucas, a James & Browne salesman, who remained with the owner for some time after delivery, to teach him how to drive and maintain the vehicle.\n\nThe car was driven by Darlington, accompanied by his eldest son John, in 1913/1914, on a 2,000 mile tour of Europe. At the outbreak of World War 1, the car was taken back to Kennington where it remained until about 1925, when John Darlington Jr. \"got it going again\", and drove it back to Curry Rivel. By this time Dr. Darlington had purchased an Armstrong, so the James & Browne was stored in a barn. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhen the James & Browne Company ceased trading, Henry Lucas (the salesman and chauffeur) with his colleague and friend Ernest Proctor were both made redundant. Lucas, with a partner John Drake, started a motor business in Egham, Surrey called the Egham Motor Company, and in 1914 asked Proctor to join them as Works Manager.\n\nWhile on holiday in Somerset in 1938, Lucas called at the house in Curry Rivel to see what had happened to the Darlington family; Dr. Darlington was still there and so was the James & Browne car..... in the barn. Dr. Darlington gave the car to Lucas who brought it back to Egham where he and Proctor restored it. It was then kept in the showroom of The Egham Motor Company for many years.\n\nHowever, when applying to register the car after its restoration, it was discovered that Dr. Darlington had transferred the original registration number, Y184, to his Armstrong, which was (and we believe, still is) on the road! \nSomerset County Council allocated the nearest unused number to the James & Browne ...Y182 - hence the temporary 2 was fixed over the 4 on the original number plates.\n\nAfter World War II the car was officially dated by the [[Veteran Car Club of Great Britain|Veteran Car Club]] as a 1904 model, and Lucas and Proctor entered it in the [[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run|London to Brighton Run]] in November 1948 - the first London to Brighton run for the car. Henry Lucas was driving and Ernest Proctor was passenger.\n\nProctor's eldest son, Sidney, joined his father and Henry on many of the early runs, until Ernest died in 1958.\nBy 1963, Lucas had become too infirm to continue to look after the car and, as he had no children, he sold the car to Sidney Proctor. On Sidney\u2019s death the car passed to his son. The car was in the Proctor family until it was auctioned in November 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bonhams: 1904 James & Browne 9hp Twin Cylinder Rear Entrance Tonneau 126|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/15346/lot/305/}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Stand 81, [[Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders|SMM&T]] 5th International Motor Exhibition February 1906==\n[[File:James & Browne car advertisement circa late 1906.png|thumb]]\nJames & Browne's display from the official catalogue:<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433112039171&view=1up&seq=9 The Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders]</ref>\n:16-HP 4-cylinder ''J & B'' chassis: 4 speeds, 1 reverse, fitted with patent motor starter.

The engines were mid-mounted in the chassis, and the cylinders were horizontal.  Drive was to the rear wheels via a 4-speed gearbox and chain. The gearbox is in 2 parts, linked by a connecting rod, the left one containing 2nd and 4th gear, and the right 1st, 3rd and reverse.\n\nThe 2-cylinder engine is rated at 9 HP, and is just over 2.5 liters in size. A [[total-loss oiling system]] is used on the car, lubricating 6 main oil-ways. James & Browne also launched a 4-cylinder version (16 HP), of a similar design to the horizontal 2-cylinder engine.\n\nIn 1906 a vertical-engined car was introduced known as the Vertex and available as either a 20&nbsp;hp four or 30/40&nbsp;hp six-cylinder.\n\n== Surviving cars ==\nOnly two of their cars are known to have survived, one built in 1902 and the other in 1904.\n\n===1902 model===\nThe car was built in 1902 and transported by train from the James and Browne works in [[Hammersmith, London]] to Albrighton Station, [[Shropshire]]. The first owner was Mr. Norman McLean of The Blue House, [[Tong, Shropshire]]. Mr Mclean had the car painted in the colours of his stables which were yellow with black lining. The car was then moved to [[Tong Castle]], the home of Miss Hartley, his future wife. The Hartley family had leased [[Tong Castle]] from Lord Bradford since 1855. Miss Hartley\u2019s brother was [[John Hartley (tennis)]], the winner of the Wimbledon Gentlemen\u2019s Singles Championship in 1879 and 1880.\n\nMr. McLean decided that some alterations to the car were required and instructed Mr. Ernest Roy Spencer to carry out the work. The Spencers were blacksmiths, of [[Shifnal]],<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Watts |editor-first=Sylvia |title=Shifnal, A Pictorial History |year=1989 |publisher= |isbn=0-85033-686-4}}</ref> and ran their business at 15 Broadway, [[Shifnal]], around three miles from [[Tong Castle]]. \n\nIn 1910 Mr. McLean decided that he no longer had a use for the car and virtually gave it to Ernest Spencer for a nominal sum of \u00a320. The car was moved to Ernest Spencer\u2019s business premises. Mr. Spencer decided that Mr. Mclean\u2019s colour scheme was too conspicuous for general use and drinking trips, so decided to paint the car battleship grey with black piping. Mr. Spencer intended to convert the car to a pick-up truck for his business and fitted it with magneto ignition and a windscreen. However, with the outbreak of [[World War 1]] in Summer 1914, the car was mothballed and stored in a shed at the back of the premises and stayed there until 1929. \n\nIn 1929 it was decided to enter the car in the Old Crocks' Run to Brighton. The less permanent alterations to the car were removed and it was returned to as near original condition as possible. The car was entered in the Old Crocks' Run to Brighton on Sunday 20th October (entry number 25) and departed from the Mall at around 9am. The ambitious cargo for the journey to Brighton consisted of five passengers, their luggage and a quantity of beer. The car had a good run but lost time when the battery terminals shook loose, and was the fifth car to arrive in Brighton.\n\nIn December 1929, ownership of the car passed to Mr. Herbert Ford who purchased the car from the Spencers for the sum of \u00a335. Mr. Ford was a local man and shrewd businessman, and had owned nearby [[Lilleshall Hall]] since 1927. In 1930, Mr. Ford opened some pleasure gardens for the public at [[Lilleshall Hall]], and these included an amusement park, narrow gauge railway and children's playgrounds. The car was used as an attraction in the amusement park. Mr. Ford and his friend, Mr. T.R. Price, entered the car in the 1933 Old Crocks' Run on Sunday 12th November 1933. The car (entry number 21) completed the run successfully with an average speed of 19.61 mph. \n\nIn October 1934, the car was purchased by John Garland and Dick Riddle, two students at the City and Guilds College, part of [[Imperial College London]] The car has been an active part of college life from 1934 to the present day. The car is still maintained by students and is driven in many events including the [[London to Brighton Veteran Car Run]].\n\n===1904 model===\nThe first owner of the 1904 car was The Reverend Dr. John Darlington, the vicar of St Mark's Church, [[Kennington]] in London, who also owned a house in [[Curry Rivel]], near [[Taunton]] in Somerset.

Miffonis specialized in the construction of [[lighthouse|lighthouses]]. He studied in civil engineering at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1905, after obtaining his diploma, he accepted an offer of employment with the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] in Canada for work with the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses), newly created. Miffonis' work was supervised by the Chief Engineer of the Commission, [[William P. Anderson|William Patrick Anderson]], a fervent promoter of [[reinforced concrete]] in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nThe recruitment of Miffonis, for his competence in the use of concrete, corresponded with an intense period of maritime infrastructure construction in Canada, and in particular, the construction of lighthouses. During the first three years of the Commission, Miffonis developed and patented in 1908 plans for the design of tapered reinforced concrete lighthouses with [[flying buttresses]]. \n\nThe importance of Miffonis' role in the construction of Canadian lighthouses between 1908 and 1913 was underestimated until the rediscovery of his correspondence with Anderson. In 1913, Miffonis published a work presenting calculations showing the use of reinforced concrete and its advantages in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nAt then end of the [[First World War]], there was little construction of new lighthouses and Miffonis ended his career with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. \n\n== Biography ==\n=== Education and arrival in Canada ===\nHenri de Miffonis was born in France in 1882.<ref name=\"BVp54\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=54-55|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref> He received his education at the University of Paris during a time when reinforced concrete was revolutionizing the building industry in France and was considered the leading edge in its use as a new material.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/> Miffonis was profoundly influenced by this assessment and the use of reinforced concrete was a key element of his career.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/>\n\nIn 1905, Henri de Miffonis joined the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans as an engineer for the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses).<ref name=\"BVp52\"/> This commission was created in February 1904 to respond to pressure from shipowners asking the Canadian authorities to aid in navigation along the Canadian coasts.<ref name=\"BVp19\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=19-20|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref><ref name=\"GCC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/fra/GCC/USQUE_Commission_phares |title=Historique de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re canadienne et des Services de la Marine - La Commission des phares |website=www.gcc-ccg.gc.ca|author=Thomas E.

The Assistant Chief Engineer, B. H. Fraser, mentioned that Miffonis was an educated man, possessing a grand culture and a great knowledge of [[mathematics]] and [[mechanics]] and one of the best theorists of the Department.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/> All of these qualities, as well as the needs of the ''Commission des phares'', result in Miffonis being assigned to the head office of the commission in [[Ottawa]] rather than one of the regional offices.<ref name=BVp54/> The hiring of the French engineer reassured the Department of Fisheries and Oceans about the use of reinforced concrete as a material for the construction of the new lighthouses erected at the beginning of the 20th century.<ref name=BVp52/>\n\n=== Career at the Commission de phares ===\nThe arrival of Miffonis corresponded to a prosperous period of construction of reinforced concrete lighthouses in Canada.<ref name=\"BVp52\"/>\n\nThe initial forecast of the ''Commission de phares'' noted that fourteen towers had be constructed of reinforced concrete, but in the end, more than twenty-five lighthouses were constructed with the material between 1906 and 1914.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/> The first five reinforced concrete lighthouses were built by the Steel Concrete Company of [[Montr\u00e9al]] between 1906 and 1908, the company chosen because they posessed a great deal of expertise using concrete. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans was dependent on this firm to complete the towers in a reasonable timeframe.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/><ref name=\"BVp56\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=56-57|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref>\n\nThe five reinforced concrete lighthouses constructed by the Steel Concrete Co. used plans from the Chief Engineer of the company, Emil Andrew Wallberg.<ref name=\"BVp56\"/> Wallberg's plans called for round towers without buttresses.<ref name=\"BVp56\"/> Their construction, along with Wallberg's plans, were a source of conflict with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans because the Department preferred the lighthouses to be built using their own plans.<ref name=\"BVp56\"/> The conflict escalated when Wallberg asked for a patent in May 1907 for the reinforced round tower design, a request which the Department contested in August on the basis of the refusal of Wallberg to use the plans furnished by the Department.<ref name=\"BVp56\"/> All the same, Wallberg obtained his patent in 1908. The Department, however, obtained success in regards to the choice of the plans, as lighthouses being built from the end of 1908 were required to be constructed according to the Department's directives using a mainly tapered form.<ref name=\"BVp56\"/>\n\n[[File:Plan d'une tour de phare en b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 brevet 112206.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Plan of a reinforced concrete tower, patent application filed in 1907 by Miffonis.|Plan of a reinforced concrete tower, patent application filed in 1907 by Miffonis.]]\nMeanwhile, Miffonis applied for a patent for his plans of reinforced concrete lighthouses with flying butresses in June 1907, about a month after the patent application of Wallberg.<ref name=\"BVp60\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|p=60-61|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref><ref name=\"BVp56\"/> Miffonis' request described the physical characteristics of his model of a concrete tower and the differences between his plan and the models of concrete towers already patented;

Miffonis specialized in the construction of [[lighthouse|lighthouses]]. He studied in civil engineering at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1905, after obtaining his diploma, he accepted an offer of employment with the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] in Canada for work with the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses), newly created. Miffonis' work was supervised by the Chief Engineer of the Commission, [[William P. Anderson|William Patrick Anderson]], a fervent promoter of [[reinforced concrete]] in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nThe recruitment of Miffonis, for his competence in the use of concrete, corresponded with an intense period of maritime infrastructure construction in Canada, and in particular, the construction of lighthouses. During the first three years of the Commission, Miffonis developed and patented in 1908 plans for the design of tapered reinforced concrete lighthouses with [[flying buttresses]]. \n\nThe importance of Miffonis' role in the construction of Canadian lighthouses between 1908 and 1913 was underestimated until the rediscovery of his correspondence with Anderson. In 1913, Miffonis published a work presenting calculations showing the use of reinforced concrete and its advantages in the construction of lighthouses.\n\nAt then end of the [[First World War]], there was little construction of new lighthouses and Miffonis ended his career with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. \n\n== Biography ==\n=== Education and arrival in Canada ===\nHenri de Miffonis was born in France in 1882.<ref name=\"BVp54\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=54-55|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref> He received his education at the University of Paris during a time when reinforced concrete was revolutionizing the building industry in France and was considered the leading edge in its use as a new material.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/> Miffonis was profoundly influenced by this assessment and the use of reinforced concrete was a key element of his career.<ref name=\"BVp54\"/>\n\nIn 1905, Henri de Miffonis joined the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans as an engineer for the ''Commission des phares'' (Commission of Lighthouses).<ref name=\"BVp52\"/> This commission was created in February 1904 to respond to pressure from shipowners asking the Canadian authorities to aid in navigation along the Canadian coasts.<ref name=\"BVp19\">{{cite book|author1=Brigitte Violette|author2=L\u00e9\u00efc Godbout|title=La station d'aide \u00e0 la navigation de Pointe-au-P\u00e8re et son phare de b\u00e9ton arm\u00e9 : centenaire d'une construction audacieuse, 1909-2009|location=Qu\u00e9bec|publisher=Parcs Canada|date=2009|pp=19-20|isbn=9781100920429}}</ref><ref name=\"GCC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/fra/GCC/USQUE_Commission_phares |title=Historique de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re canadienne et des Services de la Marine - La Commission des phares |website=www.gcc-ccg.gc.ca|author=Thomas E.
