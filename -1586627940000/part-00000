By 1993 Troche and Turner ended their relationship and Troche moved to New York where she wrote several scripts.<ref name=\"glbtq.com\"/> Rose Troche says mixing business and romance on a bisexual film set can be a recipe for disaster.

Made on a shoestring budget, it was one of the truly \"independent\" films of the mid 90s, and certainly one of the first in the lesbian genre. It premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 1994. The film was co-written and co-produced with [[Guinevere Turner]], who was Troche's boyfriend at the time. Her next feature film was ''[[Bedrooms and Hallways]]'' (1998) which explored [[Human male sexuality|sexuality]].<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Bedrooms Hallways (1998) FILM REVIEW; The Dissolving Boundary Between Gay and Straight|first=Stephen|last=Holden|authorlink=Stephen Holden|date=September 3, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C04E5DA143AF930A3575AC0A96F958260}}</ref>\n\nShe also directed ''[[The Safety of Objects]]'' (2001), which was adapted from the short stories of [[A.

It was the first film to be sold to a distributor during the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. With the small amount of approximately $8000, started their road to a Samuel Goldwyn $450,000 sale.  Help along the way with Vachon's company Killer Films who contributed $5000 when funds ran out and John Pierson bankrolled the remaining $53,000. \"Troche's Latina identity was (problematically) written out of the marketing campaign and the film was promoted on the basis of her gender and sexuality.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Holmlund|first=Chris|title=Contemporary American Independent Film: From the Margins to the Mainstream|date=August 1, 2004|pages=202\u2013203}}</ref> The film was released during gay pride month in June 1994 and eventually grossed $2.4 million.

The film was backed by a major studio so it was completed fast. It was a film that was exploring the romantic complications among a diverse group of gay, straight, and undecided characters.<ref name=\"glbtq.com\"/> Troche said she wanted to make a film \"that's genderless, without sexual identity and politics.\" The movie is a sex farce that tries to challenge conventional and rigid views on gender and sexual orientation. The film won the Audience Award at the 1998 London Film Festival.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n====''The Safety of Objects''====\nTroche returned to the United States, and to her previous supporter, Christine Vachon, and British financiers in order to direct ''[[The Safety of Objects]]'' (2001).

Virtual libraries of compounds may be generated in various ways to explore chemical space and hypothesize novel compounds with desired properties. Virtual libraries of classes of compounds (drugs, natural products, diversity-oriented synthetic products) were recently generated using the FOG (fragment optimized growth) algorithm.<ref>{{cite journal|title=FOG: Fragment Optimized Growth Algorithm for the de Novo Generation of Molecules occupying Druglike Chemical | last=Kutchukian | first=Peter  |author2=Lou, David |author3=Shakhnovich, Eugene  |journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling | year=2009 |volume=49 | pages=1630\u20131642|doi=10.1021/ci9000458|pmid=19527020|issue=7 }}</ref>  This was done by using cheminformatic tools to train transition probabilities of a [[Markov chain]] on authentic classes of compounds, and then using the Markov chain to generate novel compounds that were similar to the training database.\n\n=== Virtual screening ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{main|Virtual screening}}\nIn contrast to [[high-throughput screening]], virtual screening involves computationally\nscreening ''[[in silico]]'' libraries of compounds, by means of various methods such as\n[[docking (molecular)|docking]], to identify members likely to possess desired properties\nsuch as [[biological activity]] against a given target. In some cases, [[combinatorial chemistry]] is used in the development of the library to increase the efficiency in mining the chemical space. More commonly, a diverse library of small molecules or [[natural product]]s is screened.\n\n===Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)===\n{{main|Quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship}}\nThis is the calculation of [[quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship]] and [[QSPR|quantitative structure property relationship]] values, used to predict the activity of compounds from their structures. In this context there is also a strong relationship to [[chemometrics]]. Chemical [[expert system]]s are also relevant, since they represent parts of chemical knowledge as an ''[[in silico]]'' representation.

He was the son of a tenant farmer, the eldest of three children. His family name is noted on the first parish register in Pitton, where his family had been shepherds and farmers since the early 1600s.<ref>''Salisbury Journal'', 2 November 1989, page 9.</ref> Whitlock was later to chronicle the history of his native village in ''The Lost Village'', which noted the changes in Pitton from the 1920s to the 1980s. A subsequent volume, ''The Victorian Village'' recounted 19th century life there.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, ''The Times'', 30 November 1995.</ref> Educated at [[Bishop Wordsworth's School]], Salisbury, Whitlock had planned to attend university to study history but family circumstances during the Great Depression thwarted any such hopes and he followed his father into farming.\n\nWhitlock's collection of correspondence, diaries and papers is housed at the [[Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre]], Chippenham.<ref>NRA catalogue reference: NRA 44109 Whitlock, details available at: https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/N14009912</ref>\n\n==Author==\nWhitlock began writing for local newspapers in 1930 when he spotted a gap in the market, as the local press did not include coverage of his home village. Two years later was given a column in the ''[[Western Gazette]]'' which he continued to write for the next 50 years.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, ''Western Gazette'', 2 November 1995.</ref> His local and regional newspaper writing led to further commissions. In 1944, [[Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald]], editor of [[The Field (magazine)|''The Field'']], invited Whitlock to submit a series of articles on farming. This resulted in his appointment as farming correspondent, a position he held from 1946 to 1974.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, ''The Times'', 30 November 1995.</ref>\n\nLater regular newspaper commissions included columns in ''[[the Daily Telegraph]]'' and, latterly, ''[[the Guardian Weekly]]''.<ref>A selection of Whitlock\u2019s ''Guardian Weekly'' articles is available online at:\nhttps://www.shortnorth.com/Whitlock/WhitlockEssays.html.</ref> Collections of his ''Guardian Weekly'' articles were published in two books: ''Letters from an English Village'' (1988) and ''Letters from the English Countryside'' (1992).\n\nWhitlock occasionally wrote under the pseudonyms of Edwin Mould (in ''The Field'') and Madge Reynolds (in a column \"Madge Reynolds' Diary\" in ''Farm & Country'' magazine in the 1960s).\n\nWhitlock's most lasting legacy is his prodigious output of books. His first book, ''Peasant's Heritage'' (1947),<ref>Ralph Whitlock, ''Peasant's heritage'', London: Herbert Jenkins, 1947</ref> charted his first-hand experience at farming; much of the book is a narrative devoted to his life as a farm labourer. Many titles were to follow, including books on species, history and folklore, textbooks, and series of children's books. His final title, ''O Who Will Marry Me? A Book of Country Love'',<ref>Ralph Whitlock, ''O who will marry me? A book of country love'', Bradford-on-Avon: Ex Libris Press, 1995</ref> was published in February of the year of his death.\n\n==Broadcaster==\nAs a broadcaster, Whitlock was best known for ''Cowleaze Farm'' which was part of the long-running [[Children's Hour]] radio series slot on the [[BBC Home Service]]. Scripted into 20 to 25-minute stories on the life of a farmer, the series ran from 1945 to 1962.<ref>The ''Radio Times'' records the first broadcast of ''Cowleaze Farm'', \u2018A visit to Cowleaze Farm', on 9 April 1945, and the final broadcast 'Avonchurch Fair' on 13 September 1962.</ref> In each episode Whitlock would take young listeners on a tour through the farm, accompanied by his dog Towser. In ''Cowleaze Farm'' he played himself as Farmer Whitlock, while the part of his wife was mainly played by Phyllis Smale, but also by [[Vivienne Chatterton]] and [[Constance Chapman]]. Four ''Cowleaze Farm'' books were published between 1948 and 1964.<ref>''Cowleaze Farm'', London: Herbert Jenkins, 1948;''Harvest at Cowleaze'', London: Herbert Jenkins, 1951; ''Cowleaze Farm in winter'', London: Herbert Jenkins, 1951; and, ''A year on Cowleaze Farm'', London: Phoenix House 1964.</ref>\n\nFrom 1947 to 1949, Whitlock presented a series on the [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] and Home Service, titled ''Bird Song of the Month'',<ref>First broadcast on the West of England Service, 4 June 1947 as ''Bird song in June'', ''Radio Times'', 20 June 1947, page 20.</ref> a forerunner of ''[[Tweet of the Day]]''. Each programme featured recordings of birds by ornithologist [[Ludwig Karl Koch|Ludwig Koch]] which could be heard during the month ahead. These programmes and other one-off talks and features presented by Whitlock were produced in Bristol by the founder of the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[Desmond Hawkins]].\n\nBy the late 1940s, Whitlock's minor celebrity status resulted in a foray onto panel game shows such as ''[[What Do You Know?]]'' and ''[[Round Britain Quiz]]'' on the radio (1954\u20135 and 1957),<ref>The ''Radio Times'' records Whitlock\u2019s first appearance on ''What do you Know?'' as 20 November 1954 and ''Round Britain Quiz'' as 18 April 1957.</ref> and television's ''Ask Me Another'' (1958\u201360), as well as the early regional TV magazine programme ''Westward Ho!'' (1956).<ref>''Radio Times'', 29 January 1956, page 36; ''Wiltshire Times and Trowbridge Advertiser'', 11 February 1956, page 6.</ref>\n\n==Farmer and conservationist==\nWhitlock began working in farming after leaving school in 1930, working with his father Edwin 'Ted'. The '30s was a tough decade for small-scale farmers. The Whitlocks shed their sheep, diversifying into vegetables, flowers, and chickens. Despite further expansion into dairy farming, 'the struggle was never ending'.<ref>Tom Fort, ''The village news: The truth behind England's rural idyll'', London: Simon & Schuster, 2017.</ref> All the income Whitlock earned from writing was ploughed into the farm yet the overdraft grew and, when his father died in 1963, he left nothing.\n\nFour years after his father's death, Whitlock lost in a court battle with [[Wiltshire County Council]] and was evicted from the 50 acres he had farmed for 23 years.<ref>'Agricultural Land Tribunal case between WCC and Ralph Whitlock, tenant of Pitton', reference F9/140/2, available at the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre, Chippenham.</ref> The land was divided up between neighbouring farms. Despite having a further 140 acres, he decided to retire from farming.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, the ''Daily Telegraph'', 18 November 1995.</ref>\n\nWhitlock's knowledge of farming, forestry and conservation is reflected in his broadcast output which dealt with the then ground-breaking issues of [[conservation biology|conservation]] and [[sustainability]]. For instance, in 1950, he presented a series of five weekly programmes on the BBC Home Service (now [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]), titled ''The Changing Forest''.<ref>''Radio Times'', 7 July 1950, page 8.</ref> As two-thirds of Britain's woodlands had been felled to meet the war effort, Whitlock examined the work of the [[Forestry Commission]] and its aim to bring five million acres (approx. 2.02m hectares) into productive woodland over the next 50 years. The series covered the forests of Thetford Chase, the New Forest, Kielder, Rheola Forest, and the Lake District.\n\nWhitlock was a founder trustee and honorary warden of the [[Bentley Wood|Bentley Wood Charitable Trust]] near [[West Dean, Wiltshire]], a nature reserve which is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]. The 665-hectare site had been acquired in 1983 through a bequest of Lady Colman.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, ''The Times'', 30 November 1995.</ref>\n\nIn 1988 Whitlock was awarded a certificate of merit from the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] for his conservation work.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, ''Salisbury Journal'', 26 October 1995.</ref>\n\n==Methodist Missionary Society==\nWhitlock was also a Methodist lay preacher. On retiring from farming in 1968, he took up the position of agricultural consultant to the Methodist Missionary Society.

He was the son of a tenant farmer, the eldest of three children. His family name is noted on the first parish register in Pitton, where his family had been shepherds and farmers since the early 1600s.<ref>''Salisbury Journal'', 2 November 1989, page 9.</ref> Whitlock was later to chronicle the history of his native village in ''The Lost Village'', which noted the changes in Pitton from the 1920s to the 1980s. A subsequent volume, ''The Victorian Village'' recounted 19th century life there.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, ''The Times'', 30 November 1995.</ref> Educated at [[Bishop Wordsworth's School]], Salisbury, Whitlock had planned to attend university to study history but family circumstances during the Great Depression thwarted any such hopes and he followed his father into farming.\n\nWhitlock's collection of correspondence, diaries and papers is housed at the [[Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre]], Chippenham.<ref>NRA catalogue reference: NRA 44109 Whitlock, details available at: https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/N14009912</ref>\n\n==Author==\nWhitlock began writing for local newspapers in 1930 when he spotted a gap in the market, as the local press did not include coverage of his home village. Two years later was given a column in the ''[[Western Gazette]]'' which he continued to write for the next 50 years.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, ''Western Gazette'', 2 November 1995.</ref> His local and regional newspaper writing led to further commissions. In 1944, [[Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald]], editor of [[The Field (magazine)|''The Field'']], invited Whitlock to submit a series of articles on farming. This resulted in his appointment as farming correspondent, a position he held from 1946 to 1974.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, ''The Times'', 30 November 1995.</ref>\n\nLater regular newspaper commissions included columns in ''[[the Daily Telegraph]]'' and, latterly, ''[[the Guardian Weekly]]''.<ref>A selection of Whitlock\u2019s ''Guardian Weekly'' articles is available online at:\nhttps://www.shortnorth.com/Whitlock/WhitlockEssays.html.</ref> Collections of his ''Guardian Weekly'' articles were published in two books: ''Letters from an English Village'' (1988) and ''Letters from the English Countryside'' (1992).\n\nWhitlock occasionally wrote under the pseudonyms of Edwin Mould (in ''The Field'') and Madge Reynolds (in a column \"Madge Reynolds' Diary\" in ''Farm & Country'' magazine in the 1960s).\n\nWhitlock's most lasting legacy is his prodigious output of books. His first book, ''Peasant's Heritage'' (1947),<ref>Ralph Whitlock, ''Peasant's heritage'', London: Herbert Jenkins, 1947</ref> charted his first-hand experience at farming; much of the book is a narrative devoted to his life as a farm labourer. Many titles were to follow, including books on species, history and folklore, textbooks, and series of children's books. His final title, ''O Who Will Marry Me? A Book of Country Love'',<ref>Ralph Whitlock, ''O who will marry me? A book of country love'', Bradford-on-Avon: Ex Libris Press, 1995</ref> was published in February of the year of his death.\n\n==Broadcaster==\nAs a broadcaster, Whitlock was best known for ''Cowleaze Farm'' which was part of the long-running [[Children's Hour]] radio series slot on the [[BBC Home Service]]. Scripted into 20 to 25-minute stories on the life of a farmer, the series ran from 1945 to 1962.<ref>The ''Radio Times'' records the first broadcast of ''Cowleaze Farm'', \u2018A visit to Cowleaze Farm', on 9 April 1945, and the final broadcast 'Avonchurch Fair' on 13 September 1962.</ref> In each episode Whitlock would take young listeners on a tour through the farm, accompanied by his dog Towser. In ''Cowleaze Farm'' he played himself as Farmer Whitlock, while the part of his wife was mainly played by Phyllis Smale, but also by [[Vivienne Chatterton]] and [[Constance Chapman]]. Four ''Cowleaze Farm'' books were published between 1948 and 1964.<ref>''Cowleaze Farm'', London: Herbert Jenkins, 1948;''Harvest at Cowleaze'', London: Herbert Jenkins, 1951; ''Cowleaze Farm in winter'', London: Herbert Jenkins, 1951; and, ''A year on Cowleaze Farm'', London: Phoenix House 1964.</ref>\n\nFrom 1947 to 1949, Whitlock presented a series on the [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]] and Home Service, titled ''Bird Song of the Month'',<ref>First broadcast on the West of England Service, 4 June 1947 as ''Bird song in June'', ''Radio Times'', 20 June 1947, page 20.</ref> a forerunner of ''[[Tweet of the Day]]''. Each programme featured recordings of birds by ornithologist [[Ludwig Karl Koch|Ludwig Koch]] which could be heard during the month ahead. These programmes and other one-off talks and features presented by Whitlock were produced in Bristol by the founder of the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[Desmond Hawkins]].\n\nBy the late 1940s, Whitlock's minor celebrity status resulted in a foray onto panel game shows such as ''[[What Do You Know?]]'' and ''[[Round Britain Quiz]]'' on the radio (1954\u20135 and 1957),<ref>The ''Radio Times'' records Whitlock\u2019s first appearance on ''What do you Know?'' as 20 November 1954 and ''Round Britain Quiz'' as 18 April 1957.</ref> and television's ''Ask Me Another'' (1958\u201360), as well as the early regional TV magazine programme ''Westward Ho!'' (1956).<ref>''Radio Times'', 29 January 1956, page 36; ''Wiltshire Times and Trowbridge Advertiser'', 11 February 1956, page 6.</ref>\n\n==Farmer and conservationist==\nWhitlock began working in farming after leaving school in 1930, working with his father Edwin 'Ted'. The '30s was a tough decade for small-scale farmers. The Whitlocks shed their sheep, diversifying into vegetables, flowers, and chickens. Despite further expansion into dairy farming, 'the struggle was never ending'.<ref>Tom Fort, ''The village news: The truth behind England's rural idyll'', London: Simon & Schuster, 2017.</ref> All the income Whitlock earned from writing was ploughed into the farm yet the overdraft grew and, when his father died in 1963, he left nothing.\n\nFour years after his father's death, Whitlock lost in a court battle with [[Wiltshire County Council]] and was evicted from the 50 acres he had farmed for 23 years.<ref>'Agricultural Land Tribunal case between WCC and Ralph Whitlock, tenant of Pitton', reference F9/140/2, available at the Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre, Chippenham.</ref> The land was divided up between neighbouring farms. Despite having a further 140 acres, he decided to retire from farming.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, the ''Daily Telegraph'', 18 November 1995.</ref>\n\nWhitlock's knowledge of farming, forestry and conservation is reflected in his broadcast output which dealt with the then ground-breaking issues of [[conservation biology|conservation]] and [[sustainability]]. For instance, in 1950, he presented a series of five weekly programmes on the BBC Home Service (now [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]), titled ''The Changing Forest''.<ref>''Radio Times'', 7 July 1950, page 8.</ref> As two-thirds of Britain's woodlands had been felled to meet the war effort, Whitlock examined the work of the [[Forestry Commission]] and its aim to bring five million acres (approx. 2.02m hectares) into productive woodland over the next 50 years. The series covered the forests of Thetford Chase, the New Forest, Kielder, Rheola Forest, and the Lake District.\n\nWhitlock was a founder trustee and honorary warden of the [[Bentley Wood|Bentley Wood Charitable Trust]] near [[West Dean, Wiltshire]], a nature reserve which is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]. The 665-hectare site had been acquired in 1983 through a bequest of Lady Colman.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, ''The Times'', 30 November 1995.</ref>\n\nIn 1988 Whitlock was awarded a certificate of merit from the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] for his conservation work.<ref>Whitlock's obituary, ''Salisbury Journal'', 26 October 1995.</ref>\n\n==Methodist Missionary Society==\nWhitlock was also a Methodist lay preacher. On retiring from farming in 1968, he took up the position of agricultural consultant to the Methodist Missionary Society. For the next five years he travelled extensively through East and Central Africa, West Africa, India, Indonesia, Haiti and Belize.<ref>John Pritchard, ''Methodists and their Missionary Societies 1900-1996'', Abingdon: Routledge (Methodist Studies Series), 2013, page 243.</ref> His wartime experience of bringing marginal land into cultivation was to stand him in good stead when advising peasant farmers,<ref>Whitlock's obituary, the ''Guardian'', 13 November 1995, page 11.</ref> reclaiming land in Benin and the Gambia, while his [[dowsing]] skills secured a reliable water supply to a tribe in northern Ghana.<ref>Whitlock\u2019s definitive UK book on water divining was first published by David & Charles in 1982.</ref>\n\nPersonal insights gained on his travels as agricultural consultant were used in ''Thinking About Food'', a children's text book about producing food for increasing populations, which was part of Lutterworth's World Development Series.<ref>\nRalph Whitlock, ''Thinking about Food'', Guildford: Lutterworth Press (World Development series), 1980.</ref>\n\nOn returning to the UK in 1973, Whitlock retired to Somerset but returned to Wiltshire ten years later, settling in [[Winterslow]], a few miles from Pitton.<ref>''Salisbury Journal'', 2 November 1989, page 9.</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Non-fiction books===\n*''Peasant's heritage'' (1947)\n*''Common British birds'' (1948)\n*''Wiltshire (Visions of England)'' (1949)\n*''The other side of the fence'' (1950)\n*''Rare and extinct birds of Britain'' (1953)\n*''Wild life on the farm'' (1953)\n*''The land first'' (1954)\n*''Salisbury Plain'' (1955)\n*''Farming as a career'' (1959)\n*''A short history of farming in Britain'' (1965)\n*''Farming from the road.

Arsenal were the champions and Chelsea, who had spent heavily throughout the season, were the runners up. Arsenal ended the season [[The Invincibles (football)|without a single defeat]] \u2013 the first team ever to do so in a 38-game league season and the second team overall (the first was [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1889, 115 years earlier, during a 22-game league season).\n\n==Season summary==\n\nHaving qualified for the Champions' League the previous season, Chelsea were bolstered by a \u00a3100&nbsp;million outlay on world-class players, a spree funded by the extensive financial resources of their new owner [[Roman Abramovich]]. Manchester United's attack was as strong as ever thanks to free-scoring [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]], but the midfield was weakened following the \u00a325&nbsp;million pre-season sale of [[David Beckham]] to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and the centre of defence suffered a more severe setback after [[Rio Ferdinand]] was ruled out for the final four months of the season after being found guilty of the \"failure or refusal to take a drugs test\". The case of Rio Ferdinand started a debate about punishments relating to drug testing in football, with there being differing views on whether the punishment was too harsh or too lenient. Ferdinand's club sought to make direct comparisons with an earlier case of Manchester City reserve player who had in fact committed a lesser drug testing offence and as a result escaped with only a fine.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/motive-is-always-considered-in-deciding-guilt-576995.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Motive is always considered in deciding guilt | first=Nick | last=Harris | date=18 December 2003 | accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref> [[Manchester City F.C.|City]] themselves had just moved from [[Maine Road]] to the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/the-club/club-history|title=Club History|publisher=Manchester City Football Club }}</ref>\n\nArsenal, meanwhile, had only signed German goalkeeper [[Jens Lehmann]] in the 2003 close season, but French striker [[Thierry Henry]] was instrumental in Arsenal's success. Away from the Premier League, [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]]'s team suffered disappointment in the cup competitions. They were knocked-out by [[2003\u201304 Football League Cup|League Cup]] eventual winners Middlesbrough in the semi-finals. They lost their defence of the [[2003\u201304 FA Cup|FA Cup]] (which they held for two seasons in a row) after losing to eventual winners Manchester United in the semi-final. Arsenal were knocked out of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] quarter-finals by Chelsea (3\u20132 on aggregate). These blows in the FA Cup and Champions League came within a few days of each other, and it was feared that Arsenal might squander their lead of the Premier League for the second successive season, but Arsenal thumped [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] only days later. Arsenal's [[The Invincibles (football)|Invincibles]] finished the season with 26 wins, 12 draws, 0 defeats and 90 points.\n\nThe three relegation spots were occupied by three teams bracketed together on 33 points. [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] followed the trend of many other newly promoted Premier League clubs and were relegated just one season after reaching the top division. The other relegation place went to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], whose playing fortunes had dipped in the past two seasons after [[David O'Leary]] was sacked as manager and club debts had risen so high that many star players had to be sold. As a result, Leeds were finally relegated from the Premier League after 14 years of top division football \u2013 just three seasons after they had reached the Champions League semifinals.\n\nIn his third season as Middlesbrough manager, [[Steve McClaren]] had guided the Teessiders to their first ever major trophy \u2013 sealed with a 2\u20131 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] final. McClaren was also the first English manager to win a major trophy since Brian Little guided [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] to League Cup success in 1996. He was also the first manager to take Middlesbrough into European competition \u2013 they would be competing in the 2004\u201305 [[UEFA Cup]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2002\u201303 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], returning to the top flight after an absence of fifteen, one and nineteen years respectively. This was also Portsmouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers' first season in the Premier League. They replaced [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] after spending time in the top flight for ten, one and four years respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2003\u201304 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long=-0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.4977|long=-1.9057|label_size=80|label=West Midlands|mark=Yellow pog.svg|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.728569 |long=-2.489206 |label_size=80|label=[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|{{nowrap|Blackburn Rovers}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.580578 |long=-2.535644 |label_size=80|label=[[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|{{nowrap|Bolton Wanderers}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.438846 |long=-2.966285 |label_size=80|label=[[Everton F.C.|Everton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.704069 |long=-1.341731 |label_size=80|label=[[Leeds United F.C.|{{nowrap|Leeds United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.620392 |long=-1.142267 |label_size=80|label=[[Leicester City F.C.|{{nowrap|Leicester City}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.430845 |long=-2.960823 |label_size=80|label=[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.47     |long=-2.25     |label_size=80|label=[[Manchester City F.C.|{{nowrap|Manchester&nbsp;City}}]]<br>[[Manchester United F.C.|{{nowrap|Manchester&nbsp;United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.578219 |long=-1.216822 |label_size=80|label=[[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]\n|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.974 |long=-1.614 |label_size=80|label=[[Newcastle United F.C.|{{nowrap|Newcastle United}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.796344 |long=-1.063803 |label_size=80|label=[[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.905826 |long=-1.390975 |label_size=80|label=[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]|position=left}}\n\n<!--DISPLAY OF LONDON TEAMS IN UPPER RIGHT CORNER-->\n{{Location map~ |England |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png |marksize=1 |lat=55.7 |long=-0.2 |label_size=80|label='''[[Football in London|London]]&nbsp;teams:'''<br />\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<br />\n[[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]<br />\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]<br />\n[[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]<br/>\n[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham&nbsp;Hotspur]]\n|position=right}}\n\n<!--DISPLAY OF WEST MIDLANDS TEAMS IN UPPER LEFT CORNER-->\n{{Location map~ |England |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png |marksize=1 |lat=55.7 |long=-6.7 |label_size=80|label='''[[List of football clubs in the West Midlands|{{nowrap|West Midlands}}]]&nbsp;teams:'''<br />\n[[Aston Villa F.C.|{{nowrap|Aston Villa}}]]<br />\n[[Birmingham City F.C.|{{nowrap|Birmingham City}}]]<br />\n[[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|{{nowrap|Wolverhampton Wanderers}}]]|position=right}}\n\n}}\n\n{{Location map+|Greater London\n |width=300\n |float=right\n |caption=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |alt=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |places =\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.552 |long=-0.097 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=left}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.4863   |long=0.0363    |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.481667 |long=-0.191111 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.509167 |long=-0.232222 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=left}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.5974   |long=-0.0716   |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|{{nowrap|Tottenham<br />Hotspur}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+|West Midlands\n |width=300\n |float=right\n |caption=West Midlands Premier League football clubs\n |alt=West Midlands Premier League football clubs\n |places =\n {{Location map~ |West Midlands |lat=52.509167 |long=-1.884722 |mark=Yellow pog.svg |label='''[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |West Midlands |lat=52.475703 |long=-1.868056 |mark=Yellow pog.svg |label='''[[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=bottom}}\n {{Location map~ |West Midlands |lat=52.590278 |long=-2.130278 |mark=Yellow pog.svg |label='''[[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Arsenal were the champions and Chelsea, who had spent heavily throughout the season, were the runners up. Arsenal ended the season [[The Invincibles (football)|without a single defeat]] \u2013 the first team ever to do so in a 38-game league season and the second team overall (the first was [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in 1889, 115 years earlier, during a 22-game league season).\n\n==Season summary==\n\nHaving qualified for the Champions' League the previous season, Chelsea were bolstered by a \u00a3100&nbsp;million outlay on world-class players, a spree funded by the extensive financial resources of their new owner [[Roman Abramovich]]. Manchester United's attack was as strong as ever thanks to free-scoring [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]], but the midfield was weakened following the \u00a325&nbsp;million pre-season sale of [[David Beckham]] to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and the centre of defence suffered a more severe setback after [[Rio Ferdinand]] was ruled out for the final four months of the season after being found guilty of the \"failure or refusal to take a drugs test\". The case of Rio Ferdinand started a debate about punishments relating to drug testing in football, with there being differing views on whether the punishment was too harsh or too lenient. Ferdinand's club sought to make direct comparisons with an earlier case of Manchester City reserve player who had in fact committed a lesser drug testing offence and as a result escaped with only a fine.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/motive-is-always-considered-in-deciding-guilt-576995.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Motive is always considered in deciding guilt | first=Nick | last=Harris | date=18 December 2003 | accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref> [[Manchester City F.C.|City]] themselves had just moved from [[Maine Road]] to the [[City of Manchester Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcfc.co.uk/the-club/club-history|title=Club History|publisher=Manchester City Football Club }}</ref>\n\nArsenal, meanwhile, had only signed German goalkeeper [[Jens Lehmann]] in the 2003 close season, but French striker [[Thierry Henry]] was instrumental in Arsenal's success. Away from the Premier League, [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]]'s team suffered disappointment in the cup competitions. They were knocked-out by [[2003\u201304 Football League Cup|League Cup]] eventual winners Middlesbrough in the semi-finals. They lost their defence of the [[2003\u201304 FA Cup|FA Cup]] (which they held for two seasons in a row) after losing to eventual winners Manchester United in the semi-final. Arsenal were knocked out of the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] quarter-finals by Chelsea (3\u20132 on aggregate). These blows in the FA Cup and Champions League came within a few days of each other, and it was feared that Arsenal might squander their lead of the Premier League for the second successive season, but Arsenal thumped [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] only days later. Arsenal's [[The Invincibles (football)|Invincibles]] finished the season with 26 wins, 12 draws, 0 defeats and 90 points.\n\nThe three relegation spots were occupied by three teams bracketed together on 33 points. [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] followed the trend of many other newly promoted Premier League clubs and were relegated just one season after reaching the top division. The other relegation place went to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], whose playing fortunes had dipped in the past two seasons after [[David O'Leary]] was sacked as manager and club debts had risen so high that many star players had to be sold. As a result, Leeds were finally relegated from the Premier League after 14 years of top division football \u2013 just three seasons after they had reached the Champions League semifinals.\n\nIn his third season as Middlesbrough manager, [[Steve McClaren]] had guided the Teessiders to their first ever major trophy \u2013 sealed with a 2\u20131 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] final. McClaren was also the first English manager to win a major trophy since Brian Little guided [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] to League Cup success in 1996. He was also the first manager to take Middlesbrough into European competition \u2013 they would be competing in the 2004\u201305 [[UEFA Cup]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2002\u201303 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], returning to the top flight after an absence of fifteen, one and nineteen years respectively. This was also Portsmouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers' first season in the Premier League.
