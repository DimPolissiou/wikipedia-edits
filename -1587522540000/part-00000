Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Greg Adams of Allmusic considered her voice to resemble that of a \"pop-oriented\" singer rather than country. Nonetheless, he still considered her voice to be country. \"...today she seems like [[Kitty Wells]] compared to some of the pure pop that has since passed for country,\" Adams wrote.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Greg |title=''Thanks, Hank!'' -- Jeannie Seely -- Review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/thanks-hank%21-mw0000967234 |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Image===\nAs a performer and entertainer, Seely's image has often been a subject of discussion.

In his office, she convinced Devine to wear a miniskirt regularly. \"Okay, this is what America is wearing and I\u2019ll make you a deal. I won\u2019t wear a miniskirt in the back door if you don\u2019t let anybody wear one in the front door,\" she told him.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burns |first1=Ken |title=''Country Music'' (The Sons and Daughters of America) |journal=[[PBS]] |date=September 2019}}</ref> Seely was also among the first female artists to wear other contemporary fashion items, including [[go-go boot]]s, [[pantsuit]]s and [[jeans|denim jeans]]. Prior to Seely, many female country performers entertained in [[gingham|gingham]] and wore dresses on stage. According to Mary Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann, Seely \"broke the Opry's gingham curtain\". Seely later reflected on her choice of stage attire. \"I never planned to set any sort of trend. I'm about like any other normal American girl my age.

Oermann, Seely's stage presence and personality was unlike that of her predecessors. \"When she arrived in Nashville in 1965, women were still expected to portray the submissive country sweetheart.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car. Mrs. Seely also brought her children to country music shows at a local venue named Hillbilly Park. At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

Proving that women can sing about sex too...\"<ref name=\"Top 5\"/> Horton also explained that her material could be considered classic country.

They won the first [[Football at the Southeast Asian Games|Southeast Asian Games]] in 1959 in [[Thailand]].

The Vietnam War, a war that occurred between two states, had a tremendous impact and delayed the development of football in the country. Because of the war, Vietnam, by then, a major football force in Asia, started losing its reputation as the war ruined the country. Thus, the conflict had greatly reduced Vietnamese football ability and weakened the country seriously. However, the following [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War]] and [[Sino-Vietnamese War]], and global sanctions against the country, had depleted the nation's football team and turned Vietnam into one of the weakest teams in the world and Asia overall. For this reason, Vietnamese football can be still considered as new and unknown for the rest of the world, in spite of its long standing history as Vietnam only rejoined global football in 1991.\n\n=== Post Vietnam War and redevelopment era (1991\u20142013) ===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300|align=left\n| image1 = Vietnam football team My Dinh AFF Cup 2008.jpg\n| image2 = \u0110i b\u00e3o 28 th\u00e1ng 12.jpg\n| image3 = AFFcup08vie.jpg\n| image4 = Vi\u1ec7t Nam v\u00f4 \u0111\u1ecbch AFF 2008.jpg\n| footer = Scenes during the final of [[2008 AFF Championship]].

but rather the national flag. The few other AFC members to not feature the logo includes Syria, North Korea, Singapore and Iraq; and is the only Southeast Asian team alongside Singapore to not feature the logo. Despite the country unveiling a logo for the national football team in 2017, the logo has yet to be incorporated on to the national jersey due to the majority of negative responses from fans, though it has been changing more toward a positive opinion.<ref>https://meebec.com/logo-doi-tuyen-viet-nam/</ref>\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nThe national team of Vietnam has been known by several nicknames, the most commonly are \"''R\u1ed3ng V\u00e0ng''\" (Golden Dragons) which is influenced from the history of Vietnam including the legend of [[L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n]], the dragon King in Vietnamese folk story who gave the Vietnamese identity for his people, and also appeared in former emblems of Vietnamese dynasty as well as [[South Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/asian-football/afc-asian-cup/1025476/back-the-golden-dragons-southeast-asia-unites-as-vietnam-fly-the-asean-flag-at-afc-asian-cup-2019/|title=Back the Golden Dragons: Southeast Asia unites as Vietnam fly the ASEAN flag at AFC Asian Cup 2019|publisher=Fox Sports Asia|date=23 January 2019|accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref> Another nickname is the \"''Nh\u1eefng chi\u1ebfn binh sao V\u00e0ng''\" (Golden Star warriors) which is derived from the national flag of Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hanoitimes.vn/vietnam-football-team-when-golden-star-warriors-get-emboldened-2033.html|title=Vietnam football team: when Golden Star warriors get emboldened|author=Linh Pham|work=Hanoi Times|date=20 January 2019|accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref> The local media and people in Vietnam also refer the national team as simply as \"''Tuy\u1ec3n''\" (The Selection).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.zing.vn/tien-linh-va-trong-hung-xung-dang-len-tuyen-post997667.html|title=Ti\u1ebfn Linh v\u00e0 Tr\u1ecdng H\u00f9ng x\u1ee9ng \u0111\u00e1ng l\u00ean tuy\u1ec3n|trans-title='Ti\u1ebfn Linh and Tr\u1ecdng H\u00f9ng deserve to be recruited'|author=Ki\u1ec7t Tr\u1ea7n|language=Vietnamese|publisher=Zing.vn|date=4 October 2019|accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Supporters ==\n[[File:Vietnam vs. Japan AFC Asian Cup 2019 9.jpg|thumb|right|Vietnamese supporters during the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]], in all red and yellow star attire similar as in the colour of the [[flag of Vietnam]].]]\n\nThere are two major supporters for the national team, namely Vietnam Football Supporters or VFS ({{lang-vi|H\u1ed9i C\u1ed5 \u0111\u1ed9ng vi\u00ean B\u00f3ng \u0111\u00e1 Vi\u1ec7t Nam}}) which was founded in 2014 and Vietnam Golden Stars or VGS ({{lang-vi|H\u1ed9i C\u1ed5 \u0111\u1ed9ng vi\u00ean Sao v\u00e0ng Vi\u1ec7t Nam}}) which was founded in 2017.\n\nWhen the national team won big matches, the streets are often overwhelmed by large Vietnamese crowds, demonstrating nationalist chants, singing Vietnamese nationalist songs.<ref name=\"surge of patriotism\"/> Vietnamese passionate supporters have been witnessed during [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]] when the team defeated the UAE 2\u20130 and later, the lone Southeast Asian side to sneak into the quarter-finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tienphong.vn/xa-hoi/mung-doi-tuyen-viet-nam-vao-tu-ket-asian-cup-2007-89953.tpo|title=M\u1eebng \u0111\u1ed9i tuy\u1ec3n Vi\u1ec7t Nam v\u00e0o t\u1ee9 k\u1ebft ASIAN Cup 2007|trans-title=Celebrate the Vietnamese team in 2007 ASIAN Cup quarter-finals|author1=H\u1ed3ng V\u0129nh|author2=Nh\u01b0 \u00dd|language=Vietnamese|publisher=Ti\u1ec1n Phong|accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref> During the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]], Vietnamese fans were euphoric in celebration after beating Jordan in the round of sixteen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.vov.vn/sports/football-fans-storm-city-streets-to-celebrate-historic-asian-cup-victory-390909.vov|title=Football fans storm city streets to celebrate historic Asian Cup victory|publisher=Voice of Vietnam|date=21 January 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nEven in smaller tournaments, Vietnamese fans are also noted for large celebration, such as when Vietnam won the [[2008 AFF Championship]] and [[2018 AFF Championship]], and recently [[2018 AFC U-23 Championship]] which their [[Vietnam national under-23 football team|Olympic team]] finished second after losing the [[2018 AFC U-23 Championship Final|final]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/24/c_136920125.htm|title=Vietnamese people celebrate U23 national soccer team's victory|author=Cheng Cheng|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=24 January 2018|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Venues ==\n{{main|M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium}}\n\nThe Vietnamese national team mainly plays at [[M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium]], although other venues are also used.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam did not have any specific training centre for the national team.

The matches between these two teams are always likened to the \"El Classico\" of Southeast Asian football and are followed with much interest in both countries. Vietnam as [[South Vietnam national football team|South Vietnam]] first faced Thailand at the [[Football at the 1959 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games|1959 Southeast Asian Games]] and won the 2 matches, in the group stage and the final. Despite currently having the better overall record compared with Thailand with 22 wins, 6 draws and 19 losses after 47 matches, Vietnam has generally poor results against Thailand since its reintegration into international football in 1991. After the match between two teams in November 2019 in [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Second Round|the second round]] of the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Vietnam has faced Thailand in 24 matches at the national team level since 1991, the overall results being 3 wins, 6 draws and 15 losses. Despite this, Vietnam, since reintegration to world's football, is renowned for its performance that ''punching above the weight'', while Thailand has struggled harder to do the same.\n\nVietnam's most memorable win against Thailand was in the final of the [[2008 AFF Championship]], when a 2\u20131 win in the first leg in Bangkok set them up for their first ever title, which they secured after a 1\u20131 draw in Hanoi<ref>https://seasia.co/2017/09/17/omg-this-is-asia-s-top-5-football-rivalries</ref>.\n\n===Indonesia===\nVietnam has also developed a rivalry with [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]]. They have faced each other in 37 matches, with Vietnam having the poorer record with 11 wins, 10 draws and 16 losses. During the 20 year period from [[1999]] to [[2019]], Vietnam only drew and lost against Indonesia in official tournaments. This series of winless matches began after the 1\u20130 win over Indonesia in 1999 in the semi-finals of the [[Football at the 1999 Southeast Asian Games|1999 SEA Games]], and lasted 12 matches, with 7 draws and 5 losses, and finally ended when Vietnam won 3\u20131 against Indonesia in October 2019 in the second round of the 2022 World Cup qualification in Indonesia, also the first-ever Vietnamese victory against Indonesia in the Indonesian territory at any football competitions and friendlies. During this period, Vietnam only won against Indonesia 3\u20132 in a friendly match in [[2016]].\n\n===Singapore===\nWhile [[Singapore national football team|Singapore]] was still a force in the ASEAN football until [[2012]], this team was also a rival of Vietnam. They have faced each other in 39 matches, with Vietnam dominating with 21 wins, 13 draws and 5 losses. Since just rejoining with international football in 1991, Vietnam experienced, in the period from [[1993]] to 1998, poorer head-to-head record against Singapore; especially the failure in the [[1998 AFF Championship]] final. However, since [[1998]], Vietnam has been maintaining a series of unbeaten matches against Singapore until now. It is worth noting that Vietnam's winning matches in this period against Singapore have never exceeded 1 goal and there were 6 out of the 12 matches that had drawn results, although Vietnam still won in the remaining 6 matches.\n\n===Malaysia===\nAs South Vietnam, the Vietnamese side had a poorer performance, with only 3 wins, 3 draws and 7 losses, during that time the Malaysians posed as a formidable side in Asia. Since reintegration, however, Vietnam has overwhelmed in the head-to-head record against [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia]] with 12 wins, 3 draws and only 5 losses in 20 games since 1991. \"''Golden Dragon''\" has also been maintaining the series of unbeaten match against Malaysia since 2014.\n\n== Competitive record ==\n=== FIFA World Cup ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The Vietnam War, a war that occurred between two states, had a tremendous impact and delayed the development of football in the country. Because of the war, Vietnam, by then, a major football force in Asia, started losing its reputation as the war ruined the country. Thus, the conflict had greatly reduced Vietnamese football ability and weakened the country seriously. However, the following [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War]] and [[Sino-Vietnamese War]], and global sanctions against the country, had depleted the nation's football team and turned Vietnam into one of the weakest teams in the world and Asia overall. For this reason, Vietnamese football can be still considered as new and unknown for the rest of the world, in spite of its long standing history as Vietnam only rejoined global football in 1991.\n\n=== Post Vietnam War and redevelopment era (1991\u20142013) ===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300|align=left\n| image1 = Vietnam football team My Dinh AFF Cup 2008.jpg\n| image2 = \u0110i b\u00e3o 28 th\u00e1ng 12.jpg\n| image3 = AFFcup08vie.jpg\n| image4 = Vi\u1ec7t Nam v\u00f4 \u0111\u1ecbch AFF 2008.jpg\n| footer = Scenes during the final of [[2008 AFF Championship]].

but rather the national flag. The few other AFC members to not feature the logo includes Syria, North Korea, Singapore and Iraq; and is the only Southeast Asian team alongside Singapore to not feature the logo. Despite the country unveiling a logo for the national football team in 2017, the logo has yet to be incorporated on to the national jersey due to the majority of negative responses from fans, though it has been changing more toward a positive opinion.<ref>https://meebec.com/logo-doi-tuyen-viet-nam/</ref>\n\n=== Nicknames ===\nThe national team of Vietnam has been known by several nicknames, the most commonly are \"''R\u1ed3ng V\u00e0ng''\" (Golden Dragons) which is influenced from the history of Vietnam including the legend of [[L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n]], the dragon King in Vietnamese folk story who gave the Vietnamese identity for his people, and also appeared in former emblems of Vietnamese dynasty as well as [[South Vietnam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/asian-football/afc-asian-cup/1025476/back-the-golden-dragons-southeast-asia-unites-as-vietnam-fly-the-asean-flag-at-afc-asian-cup-2019/|title=Back the Golden Dragons: Southeast Asia unites as Vietnam fly the ASEAN flag at AFC Asian Cup 2019|publisher=Fox Sports Asia|date=23 January 2019|accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref> Another nickname is the \"''Nh\u1eefng chi\u1ebfn binh sao V\u00e0ng''\" (Golden Star warriors) which is derived from the national flag of Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hanoitimes.vn/vietnam-football-team-when-golden-star-warriors-get-emboldened-2033.html|title=Vietnam football team: when Golden Star warriors get emboldened|author=Linh Pham|work=Hanoi Times|date=20 January 2019|accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref> The local media and people in Vietnam also refer the national team as simply as \"''Tuy\u1ec3n''\" (The Selection).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.zing.vn/tien-linh-va-trong-hung-xung-dang-len-tuyen-post997667.html|title=Ti\u1ebfn Linh v\u00e0 Tr\u1ecdng H\u00f9ng x\u1ee9ng \u0111\u00e1ng l\u00ean tuy\u1ec3n|trans-title='Ti\u1ebfn Linh and Tr\u1ecdng H\u00f9ng deserve to be recruited'|author=Ki\u1ec7t Tr\u1ea7n|language=Vietnamese|publisher=Zing.vn|date=4 October 2019|accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Supporters ==\n[[File:Vietnam vs. Japan AFC Asian Cup 2019 9.jpg|thumb|right|Vietnamese supporters during the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]], in all red and yellow star attire similar as in the colour of the [[flag of Vietnam]].]]\n\nThere are two major supporters for the national team, namely Vietnam Football Supporters or VFS ({{lang-vi|H\u1ed9i C\u1ed5 \u0111\u1ed9ng vi\u00ean B\u00f3ng \u0111\u00e1 Vi\u1ec7t Nam}}) which was founded in 2014 and Vietnam Golden Stars or VGS ({{lang-vi|H\u1ed9i C\u1ed5 \u0111\u1ed9ng vi\u00ean Sao v\u00e0ng Vi\u1ec7t Nam}}) which was founded in 2017.\n\nWhen the national team won big matches, the streets are often overwhelmed by large Vietnamese crowds, demonstrating nationalist chants, singing Vietnamese nationalist songs.<ref name=\"surge of patriotism\"/> Vietnamese passionate supporters have been witnessed during [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]] when the team defeated the UAE 2\u20130 and later, the lone Southeast Asian side to sneak into the quarter-finals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tienphong.vn/xa-hoi/mung-doi-tuyen-viet-nam-vao-tu-ket-asian-cup-2007-89953.tpo|title=M\u1eebng \u0111\u1ed9i tuy\u1ec3n Vi\u1ec7t Nam v\u00e0o t\u1ee9 k\u1ebft ASIAN Cup 2007|trans-title=Celebrate the Vietnamese team in 2007 ASIAN Cup quarter-finals|author1=H\u1ed3ng V\u0129nh|author2=Nh\u01b0 \u00dd|language=Vietnamese|publisher=Ti\u1ec1n Phong|accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref> During the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]], Vietnamese fans were euphoric in celebration after beating Jordan in the round of sixteen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.vov.vn/sports/football-fans-storm-city-streets-to-celebrate-historic-asian-cup-victory-390909.vov|title=Football fans storm city streets to celebrate historic Asian Cup victory|publisher=Voice of Vietnam|date=21 January 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nEven in smaller tournaments, Vietnamese fans are also noted for large celebration, such as when Vietnam won the [[2008 AFF Championship]] and [[2018 AFF Championship]], and recently [[2018 AFC U-23 Championship]] which their [[Vietnam national under-23 football team|Olympic team]] finished second after losing the [[2018 AFC U-23 Championship Final|final]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/24/c_136920125.htm|title=Vietnamese people celebrate U23 national soccer team's victory|author=Cheng Cheng|agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]]|date=24 January 2018|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Venues ==\n{{main|M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium}}\n\nThe Vietnamese national team mainly plays at [[M\u1ef9 \u0110\u00ecnh National Stadium]], although other venues are also used.\n\nIn the past, Vietnam did not have any specific training centre for the national team.

The matches between these two teams are always likened to the \"El Classico\" of Southeast Asian football and are followed with much interest in both countries. Vietnam as [[South Vietnam national football team|South Vietnam]] first faced Thailand at the [[Football at the 1959 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games|1959 Southeast Asian Games]] and won the 2 matches, in the group stage and the final. Despite currently having the better overall record compared with Thailand with 22 wins, 6 draws and 19 losses after 47 matches, Vietnam has generally poor results against Thailand since its reintegration into international football in 1991. After the match between two teams in November 2019 in [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Second Round|the second round]] of the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Vietnam has faced Thailand in 24 matches at the national team level since 1991, the overall results being 3 wins, 6 draws and 15 losses. Despite this, Vietnam, since reintegration to world's football, is renowned for its performance that ''punching above the weight'', while Thailand has struggled harder to do the same.\n\nVietnam's most memorable win against Thailand was in the final of the [[2008 AFF Championship]], when a 2\u20131 win in the first leg in Bangkok set them up for their first ever title, which they secured after a 1\u20131 draw in Hanoi<ref>https://seasia.co/2017/09/17/omg-this-is-asia-s-top-5-football-rivalries</ref>.\n\n===Indonesia===\nVietnam has also developed a rivalry with [[Indonesia national football team|Indonesia]]. They have faced each other in 37 matches, with Vietnam having the poorer record with 11 wins, 10 draws and 16 losses. During the 20 year period from [[1999]] to [[2019]], Vietnam only drew and lost against Indonesia in official tournaments. This series of winless matches began after the 1\u20130 win over Indonesia in 1999 in the semi-finals of the [[Football at the 1999 Southeast Asian Games|1999 SEA Games]], and lasted 12 matches, with 7 draws and 5 losses, and finally ended when Vietnam won 3\u20131 against Indonesia in October 2019 in the second round of the 2022 World Cup qualification in Indonesia, also the first-ever Vietnamese victory against Indonesia in the Indonesian territory at any football competitions and friendlies. During this period, Vietnam only won against Indonesia 3\u20132 in a friendly match in [[2016]].\n\n===Singapore===\nWhile [[Singapore national football team|Singapore]] was still a force in the ASEAN football until [[2012]], this team was also a rival of Vietnam. They have faced each other in 39 matches, with Vietnam dominating with 21 wins, 13 draws and 5 losses. Since just rejoining with international football in 1991, Vietnam experienced, in the period from [[1993]] to 1998, poorer head-to-head record against Singapore; especially the failure in the [[1998 AFF Championship]] final. However, since [[1998]], Vietnam has been maintaining a series of unbeaten matches against Singapore until now. It is worth noting that Vietnam's winning matches in this period against Singapore have never exceeded 1 goal and there were 6 out of the 12 matches that had drawn results, although Vietnam still won in the remaining 6 matches.\n\n===Malaysia===\nAs South Vietnam, the Vietnamese side had a poorer performance, with only 3 wins, 3 draws and 7 losses, during that time the Malaysians posed as a formidable side in Asia. Since reintegration, however, Vietnam has overwhelmed in the head-to-head record against [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia]] with 12 wins, 3 draws and only 5 losses in 20 games since 1991. \"''Golden Dragon''\" has also been maintaining the series of unbeaten match against Malaysia since 2014.\n\n== Competitive record ==\n=== FIFA World Cup ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Fireman challenged corporate America to become more socially responsible and demonstrated that all corporations could succeed financially, while simultaneously serving the public good. He sold Reebok to Adidas in 2006, but his life and business ventures continue to reflect his philanthropy in serving people and communities throughout the country today. \n\n==Early Life and Education==\nFireman was born February 14, 1944 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, MA]] to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref name=rynecki>{{cite news|last1=Rynecki|first1=David|title=FIREMAN'S FANTASY|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/10/17/8358052/index.htm|accessdate=18 October 2015|publisher=Fortune|date=17 October 2005}}</ref> and raised in the working-class city of [[Brockton, Massachusetts]], also called 'Shoe City'.

In 1995 Fireman purchased a mile of neglected and decaying New Jersey shoreline along the Hudson River that was an eyesore. The land the Liberty National lies upon has a unique and storied history including an ammunition depot during World War I, and a prisoner of war camp during World War II, and more recently as an oil refinery and warehouse for industrial goods. However, the land when Fireman originally toured the site was \u201ca toxic moonscape of corroded oil tanks, contaminated soil, and rusting warehouses.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/24/golf-barclays-pga-lifestyle-sports-golf-liberty-national.html|title=Inside A $250 Million Golf Course|last=Bertoni|first=Steven|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \u201cI loved the site and the historical value with the Statue of Liberty, and the city, and it was on the water,\u201d Fireman says. \u201cI just plunged into it because I thought it would be a phenomenal golf site and improve the world.

Liberty National also hosts junior golf tournaments, the First Tee of New Jersey, and local high school golf teams from Jersey City practice and play their home matches at the course.  \n\n==Philanthropy==\n\nThe Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation was created in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=www.ppffound.org/about/|title=The Paul and Phyllis Fireman Charitable Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since its inception, the foundation has distributed over $165 million to charitable organizations with a focus primarily on improving the communities of both Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\nAddressing homelessness has been a major initiative of the foundation.

Beyond financial success, he is well known as a business visionary and a champion for human rights. Fireman challenged corporate America to become more socially responsible and demonstrated that all corporations could succeed financially, while simultaneously serving the public good. He sold Reebok to Adidas in 2006, but his life and business ventures continue to reflect his philanthropy in serving people and communities throughout the country today. \n\n==Early Life and Education==\nFireman was born February 14, 1944 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge, MA]] to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref name=rynecki>{{cite news|last1=Rynecki|first1=David|title=FIREMAN'S FANTASY|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/10/17/8358052/index.htm|accessdate=18 October 2015|publisher=Fortune|date=17 October 2005}}</ref> and raised in the working-class city of [[Brockton, Massachusetts]], also called 'Shoe City'.

As the family business declined, Fireman sought new opportunities. \n\nWhile attending a sporting goods show in Chicago in 1979 Fireman met Joe Foster, the owner of a British running shoe company founded in 1895 called Reebok.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/reebok-cofounder-shares-3-rules-for-startup-success-2017-4|title=Reebok co-founder shares 3 rules for startup success|last=Johnson|first=Kieron|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Fireman acquired the North American sales rights to [[Reebok]] in 1979 and eventually bought the British-based parent company outright in 1984.<ref name=\"lat\" /><ref name=\"healy\" /> Reebok capitalized on the increasing popularity of aerobics in California and introduced the world\u2019s first aerobic shoe designed specifically for women in 1982 called Freestyle.

In 1986, Reebok became one of the first companies to pull out of South Africa because of the country's practice of apartheid and two years later Reebok sponsored the Amnesty International Human Rights Now tour.

In 1995 Fireman purchased a mile of neglected and decaying New Jersey shoreline along the Hudson River that was an eyesore. The land the Liberty National lies upon has a unique and storied history including an ammunition depot during World War I, and a prisoner of war camp during World War II, and more recently as an oil refinery and warehouse for industrial goods. However, the land when Fireman originally toured the site was \u201ca toxic moonscape of corroded oil tanks, contaminated soil, and rusting warehouses.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/07/24/golf-barclays-pga-lifestyle-sports-golf-liberty-national.html|title=Inside A $250 Million Golf Course|last=Bertoni|first=Steven|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \u201cI loved the site and the historical value with the Statue of Liberty, and the city, and it was on the water,\u201d Fireman says. \u201cI just plunged into it because I thought it would be a phenomenal golf site and improve the world.
