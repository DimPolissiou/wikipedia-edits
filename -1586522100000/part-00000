They are controlled by the [[Luxembourg Basketball Federation]]. \n\nLuxembourg has qualified for the [[EuroBasket]] three times, in [[EuroBasket 1946|1946]], [[EuroBasket 1951|1951]], and [[EuroBasket 1955|1955]]. Their best result came in eighth place at their first EuroBasket appearance in 1946. Although the national team has yet to qualify for the [[FIBA World Cup]] or [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Basketbal Nederland tegen Luxemburg in Apollohal Amsterdam, Bestanddeelnr 910-8505.jpg|thumb|A match against [[Netherlands national basketball team|Netherlands]] in 1959]]\n[[File:Ire v Lux 02.jpg|thumb|Against [[Ireland national basketball team|Ireland]] in 2009]]\n[[File:PZK 20140824 Koszalin 99991.jpg|thumb|Against [[Poland national basketball team|Poland]] in 2014]]\n===EuroBasket 1946===\nLuxembourg's first [[EuroBasket]] appearance was at [[EuroBasket 1946]] in [[Geneva]]. They found themselves heavily over-matched in the preliminary round. Losing all of their matches and being outscored by 113 points over three games finishing in last place in the group. The semifinal round, which was essentially a 7th\u201310th place classification round for Luxembourg, saw their first win.  They defeated [[England national basketball team|England]] 50\u201327.  This advanced them to a playoff for 7th and 8th places; they were defeated by [[Belgium national basketball team|Belgium]] to finish 8th out of the ten team competition.\n\n===EuroBasket 1951===\nLuxembourg next competed at the [[EuroBasket 1951]] competition in [[Paris]].  They lost all four of their preliminary round games, putting them in fifth place in their group of 5.  Since they were seeded into a group of five teams rather than a group of four teams (the 18 teams were divided into 4 groups, 2 groups with 5 teams and 2 groups with 4 teams), Luxembourg had to play an elimination game against [[Denmark national basketball team|Denmark]] for the right to advance into the classification rounds.  The winner could potentially place as high as 9th; the loser was relegated to 17th place.\n\nLuxembourg was able to get a final half-court shot off before time expired, but the ball bounced off the rim and the team was served their fifth and final loss of the tournament.\n\n===EuroBasket 1955===\nAt [[EuroBasket 1955]] in [[Budapest]] was where Luxembourg next appeared.  They lost all four of their preliminary round games, and were relegated to the classification rounds.  In the first round, Luxembourg was able to win 2 games against [[Denmark national basketball team|Denmark]] and [[Sweden national basketball team|Sweden]], finishing third in the group.  There they lost their 13th\u201316th place semifinal, but won the 15th/16th place final to finish the tournament 15th out of the 18 teams.\n\n===Later years===\nAfter EuroBasket 1955 the national team has struggled qualifying for major international basketball tournaments. Though, they have competed at smaller competitions such as the [[FIBA European Championship for Small Countries|European Championship for Small Countries]] and [[Games of the Small States of Europe]].\n\n==Competitive record==\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n===EuroBasket===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:

'''Luxembourg national basketball team''' ({{lang-lb|L\u00ebtzebuergesch Basketballnationalequipe}}, {{lang-fr|\u00c9quipe du Luxembourg de basketball}}, {{lang-ger|Luxemburgische Basketballnationalmannschaft}}) represents [[Luxembourg]] in men's international [[basketball]] tournaments. They are controlled by the [[Luxembourg Basketball Federation]]. \n\nLuxembourg has qualified for the [[EuroBasket]] three times, in [[EuroBasket 1946|1946]], [[EuroBasket 1951|1951]], and [[EuroBasket 1955|1955]]. Their best result came in eighth place at their first EuroBasket appearance in 1946. Although the national team has yet to qualify for the [[FIBA World Cup]] or [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Basketbal Nederland tegen Luxemburg in Apollohal Amsterdam, Bestanddeelnr 910-8505.jpg|thumb|A match against [[Netherlands national basketball team|Netherlands]] in 1959]]\n[[File:Ire v Lux 02.jpg|thumb|Against [[Ireland national basketball team|Ireland]] in 2009]]\n[[File:PZK 20140824 Koszalin 99991.jpg|thumb|Against [[Poland national basketball team|Poland]] in 2014]]\n===EuroBasket 1946===\nLuxembourg's first [[EuroBasket]] appearance was at [[EuroBasket 1946]] in [[Geneva]]. They found themselves heavily over-matched in the preliminary round. Losing all of their matches and being outscored by 113 points over three games finishing in last place in the group. The semifinal round, which was essentially a 7th\u201310th place classification round for Luxembourg, saw their first win.  They defeated [[England national basketball team|England]] 50\u201327.  This advanced them to a playoff for 7th and 8th places; they were defeated by [[Belgium national basketball team|Belgium]] to finish 8th out of the ten team competition.\n\n===EuroBasket 1951===\nLuxembourg next competed at the [[EuroBasket 1951]] competition in [[Paris]].  They lost all four of their preliminary round games, putting them in fifth place in their group of 5.  Since they were seeded into a group of five teams rather than a group of four teams (the 18 teams were divided into 4 groups, 2 groups with 5 teams and 2 groups with 4 teams), Luxembourg had to play an elimination game against [[Denmark national basketball team|Denmark]] for the right to advance into the classification rounds.  The winner could potentially place as high as 9th; the loser was relegated to 17th place.\n\nLuxembourg was able to get a final half-court shot off before time expired, but the ball bounced off the rim and the team was served their fifth and final loss of the tournament.\n\n===EuroBasket 1955===\nAt [[EuroBasket 1955]] in [[Budapest]] was where Luxembourg next appeared.  They lost all four of their preliminary round games, and were relegated to the classification rounds.  In the first round, Luxembourg was able to win 2 games against [[Denmark national basketball team|Denmark]] and [[Sweden national basketball team|Sweden]], finishing third in the group.  There they lost their 13th\u201316th place semifinal, but won the 15th/16th place final to finish the tournament 15th out of the 18 teams.\n\n===Later years===\nAfter EuroBasket 1955 the national team has struggled qualifying for major international basketball tournaments.

She rose to prominence for her work in various studio and [[independent film]]s in the 1970s, frequently portraying eccentric and offbeat characters, and established herself as a figure of [[New Hollywood]]. Her career spanned over 50 years, and includes nearly 200 credits in both independent and mainstream films. Black received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two [[Golden Globe Awards]], as well as an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nA native of suburban [[Chicago]], Black studied theater at [[Northwestern University]] before dropping out and relocating to New York City. She performed on Broadway in 1965 before making her major film debut in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966). Black relocated to California and was cast as an acid-tripping prostitute in [[Dennis Hopper]]'s road film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969). This led to a lead in the drama ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' (1970), in which she played a hopeless waitress, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]]. Black made her first major commercial picture with the disaster film ''[[Airport 1975]]'' (1974), and her subsequent appearance as Myrtle Wilson in [[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|''The Great Gatsby'']] (1974) won her a second Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBlack starred as a glamorous country singer in [[Robert Altman]]'s ensemble musical drama ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), also writing and performing two songs for the soundtrack, which won a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media|Best Score Soundtrack]]. Her portrayal of an aspiring actress in [[John Schlesinger]]'s drama ''[[The Day of the Locust (film)|The Day of the Locust]]'' (also 1975) earned her a third Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress]]. She subsequently took on four roles in [[Dan Curtis]]' anthology horror film ''[[Trilogy of Terror]]'' (1975), followed by Curtis's supernatural horror feature, ''[[Burnt Offerings (film)|Burnt Offerings]]'' (1976). The same year, she starred as a con artist in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s final film, ''[[Family Plot]]''.\n\nIn 1982, Black starred as a [[trans woman]] in the Robert Altman-directed Broadway debut of ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', a role she also reprised in Altman's subsequent [[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|film adaptation]]. She next starred in the comedy ''[[Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?]]'' (1983), followed by [[Tobe Hooper]]'s remake of ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1986). For much of the late 1980s and 1990s, Black starred in a variety of [[arthouse film|arthouse]], independent, and horror films, as well as writing her own screenplays. She had a leading role as a villainous mother in [[Rob Zombie]]'s ''[[House of 1000 Corpses]]'' (2003), which cemented her status as a [[cult film|cult]] horror icon. She continued to star in low-profile films throughout the early 2000s, as well as working as a [[playwright]] before her death from ampullary cancer in 2013.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1939\u20131959: Early life===\nBlack was born Karen Blanche Ziegler on July 1, 1939, in [[Park Ridge, Illinois]],{{sfn|Segrave|Martin|1990|p=85}} the daughter of Elsie Mary ([[married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Reif), a writer of several prize-winning children's novels, and Norman Arthur Ziegler, an engineer and businessman.{{sfn|Segrave|Martin|1990|p=85}}<ref name=mit>{{cite news| last=Frisbie| first=Thomas| title=Elsie \"Peggy\" Ziegler: Wrote history-based books for young adults| newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| date=June 18, 2008| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-1216323741E85B88.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106001031/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-1216323741E85B88.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=November 6, 2012}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tglaAAAAYAAJ&q=karen%20black%20father%20engineer| title=Current Biography Yearbook| year=1977| publisher=H.

She rose to prominence for her work in various studio and [[independent film]]s in the 1970s, frequently portraying eccentric and offbeat characters, and established herself as a figure of [[New Hollywood]]. Her career spanned over 50 years, and includes nearly 200 credits in both independent and mainstream films. Black received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two [[Golden Globe Awards]], as well as an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]].\n\nA native of suburban [[Chicago]], Black studied theater at [[Northwestern University]] before dropping out and relocating to New York City. She performed on Broadway in 1965 before making her major film debut in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[You're a Big Boy Now]]'' (1966). Black relocated to California and was cast as an acid-tripping prostitute in [[Dennis Hopper]]'s road film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969). This led to a lead in the drama ''[[Five Easy Pieces]]'' (1970), in which she played a hopeless waitress, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress]]. Black made her first major commercial picture with the disaster film ''[[Airport 1975]]'' (1974), and her subsequent appearance as Myrtle Wilson in [[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|''The Great Gatsby'']] (1974) won her a second Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBlack starred as a glamorous country singer in [[Robert Altman]]'s ensemble musical drama ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975), also writing and performing two songs for the soundtrack, which won a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media|Best Score Soundtrack]]. Her portrayal of an aspiring actress in [[John Schlesinger]]'s drama ''[[The Day of the Locust (film)|The Day of the Locust]]'' (also 1975) earned her a third Golden Globe nomination, this time for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress]]. She subsequently took on four roles in [[Dan Curtis]]' anthology horror film ''[[Trilogy of Terror]]'' (1975), followed by Curtis's supernatural horror feature, ''[[Burnt Offerings (film)|Burnt Offerings]]'' (1976). The same year, she starred as a con artist in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s final film, ''[[Family Plot]]''.\n\nIn 1982, Black starred as a [[trans woman]] in the Robert Altman-directed Broadway debut of ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]'', a role she also reprised in Altman's subsequent [[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|film adaptation]]. She next starred in the comedy ''[[Can She Bake a Cherry Pie?]]'' (1983), followed by [[Tobe Hooper]]'s remake of ''[[Invaders from Mars (1986 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1986).
