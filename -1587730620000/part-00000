It came three years after their breakthrough album, ''[[Different Class]]'', and was eagerly anticipated. In 2013, ''[[NME]]'' ranked it at number 166 in its list of [[NME's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref>[http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_500_greatest_albums_2013.htm Rocklist.net NME: The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time : October 2013<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Background and release==\nAs with the band's previous album, ''[[Different Class]]'', it reached No. 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/29508/pulp/ |title=Pulp full official chart |publisher=officialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}</ref> and was well received critically, earning Pulp a third successive nomination for the 1998 [[Mercury Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercuryprize.com/aoty/track.php?TrackID=128 |title=Mercury Prize Shortlist |publisher=mercuryprize.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}</ref>\n\nA subsequent release in the UK later in 1998 came with a bonus live CD entitled \"This Is Glastonbury\". A deluxe edition of ''This Is Hardcore'' was released on 11 September 2006. It contained a second disc of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], demos and rarities.\n\nThe cover photo was art directed by [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]] and the American painter [[John Currin]] who is known for his figurative paintings of exaggerated female forms. The model photographed is [[Ksenia Sobchak]] and the images were further digitally manipulated by Howard Wakefield who also designed the album.<ref>Cocker, Jarvis [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1034489,00.html 'They're not grotesque \u2013 they're beautiful'] Retrieved 11 December 2007.</ref> Currin was also the art director for the \"[[Help the Aged (song)|Help the Aged]]\" video, based on his painting \"The Never Ending Story\".

A deluxe edition of ''This Is Hardcore'' was released on 11 September 2006. It contained a second disc of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], demos and rarities.\n\nThe cover photo was art directed by [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]] and the American painter [[John Currin]] who is known for his figurative paintings of exaggerated female forms.

Huckabee]] and Aaron Hart have split the role of Bobby Draper in the first season, while Hart takes over for the second season. [[Jared Gilmore]] plays Bobby throughout the third and fourth season.</small>\n\n==Primary characters==\n\n===Don Draper===\n{{main|Don Draper}}\n'''Donald \"Don\" Draper''' (n\u00e9 '''Dick Whitman'''; [[Jon Hamm]]) born 1926, is the [[creative director]] at Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency; he eventually rises to become a partner. He later becomes a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Draper is the series' [[protagonist]], and more storylines focus on him than on other characters.\n\n===Peggy Olson===\n{{main|Peggy Olson}}\n'''Margaret \"Peggy\" Olson''' ([[Elisabeth Moss]]), upon introduction, is the ostensibly na\u00efve \"new girl\" at Sterling Cooper. She was originally Draper's secretary, but showed surprising talent and initiative, including a knack&mdash;similar to Draper's&mdash;for understanding the consumer's mind. Don promotes her to copywriter, and she eventually accepts a copy chief position with Ted Chaough's firm, CGC, only to find herself once again working for Don following a merger.\n\n===Pete Campbell===\n{{main|Pete Campbell}}\n'''Peter \"Pete\" Campbell''' ([[Vincent Kartheiser]]) is an ambitious young account executive whose father-in-law controls the advertising for [[Clearasil]], a Sterling Cooper account. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he becomes more competitive with Don as the series progresses, and ultimately becomes a partner of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.\n\n===Betty (Draper) Francis===\n{{main|Betty Draper}}\n'''Elizabeth \"Betty\" Francis''' (n\u00e9e '''Hofstadt''', formerly '''Draper'''; [[January Jones]]) is the ex-wife of Don Draper (who affectionately called her \"Betts,\" or on occasion \"Birdy\") and mother of their three children, Sally, Bobby, and Gene. Her family home was in Elkins Park, Pa., and she graduated from [[Bryn Mawr College]].  She speaks fluent Italian. She is the archetypal dissatisfied 1960s housewife, who dutifully turned her back on her education and professional career (as a model) to become a homemaker. After obtaining a divorce from Don, she marries Henry Francis and moves to [[Rye, New York|Rye]] in late 1965. Despite no longer being married to Don, Betty is shown to harbor feelings for him.\n\n===Joan Harris===\n{{main|Joan Holloway}}\n'''Joan P. Harris''' (n\u00e9e '''Holloway'''; [[Christina Hendricks]]) is first depicted as an office manager at Sterling Cooper, who acts as a professional and social mentor, as well as an occasional rival, to Peggy Olson, much as Don Draper is to Pete Campbell. Throughout the course of the series, Joan has a long-standing affair with Roger Sterling, which results in their conceiving a son. She ascribes the boy's fatherhood to her husband, a physician serving as a military officer in Vietnam, whom she later divorces. Joan eventually rises up to the level of partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce and the following SC&P, and chooses to create her own firm after SC&P is absorbed by McCann Erickson.\n\n===Roger Sterling===\n{{main|Roger Sterling}}\n'''Roger H. Sterling, Jr.''' ([[John Slattery]]), was one of the two managing partners of Sterling Cooper, and later a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Roger's relationship with Lucky Strike, one of Sterling Coopers most lucrative accounts, is key to the story from the outset.\n\n== Supporting characters ==\n\n=== Sal Romano ===\n'''Salvatore \"Sal\" Romano''' ([[Bryan Batt]]) is the Italian-American [[art director]] at Sterling Cooper, originally from [[Baltimore]]. Sal turned down a proposition from a male employee of Belle Jolie Cosmetics midway through the first season, admitting that though he has thought about having relationships with men, he has never acted on this impulse. He joins the other men of Sterling Cooper in flirting with the women in the workplace. He speaks to his mother in Italian. Sal is shown to have a sarcastic side to his personality, mocking Pete after he nearly loses his job and laughing at Freddy Rumsen urinating himself. Between Seasons 1 and 2, Sal marries a childhood friend, Kitty ([[Sarah Drew]]).<ref>[http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/episode201 Mad Men - For Those Who Think Young \u2013 AMC]. Amctv.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-23. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223011130/http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/episode201 |date=December 23, 2010 }}</ref> The two entertain Ken Cosgrove for dinner during the Season 2 episode \"The Gold Violin\", during which Sal seems taken with his guest. Kitty shows signs of frustration at being ignored, expressing that something is wrong in their marriage.\n\nIn the Season 3 premiere, Don Draper sees Sal alone with a partly-dressed, male hotel bellhop, but subtly assures Sal he will keep silent by drawing Sal's attention to the ad slogan they had been working on for raincoats: \"Limit your exposure\". Later in the third season, with Don's encouragement, Sal branches out into directing commercials for the company. Meanwhile, Sal and Kitty have not had sex in several months and Kitty tells Sal she needs \"tending to\". He assures her that he loves her, but his mind is elsewhere due to pressures at work. Illustrations popular in magazine advertisements in the 1950s and early 1960s are going out of style in favor of photographs, so he fears he will lose his job as an illustrator. Later in the scene, Kitty is in bed and Sal vividly demonstrates how the [[Ann-Margret]] look-alike will dance and sing \"[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]\" in his commercial, with lyrics changed for [[Pepsi]]'s new diet drink [[Patio (soda)|Patio]]. Kitty nods but appears uncomfortable with Sal's flamboyant performance.\n\nIn the Season 3 episode \"Wee Small Hours\", Sal rejects the advances of Lee Garner, Jr., a married [[Lucky Strike]] executive who, in retaliation, calls Harry Crane and demands Sal's removal from the account. When Harry fails to pass this on, Garner walks out of a subsequent meeting. Roger fires Sal on the spot. Don supports Roger's decision on the basis that the company can afford to lose him rather than Lucky Strike and regards Sal with disdain, implying that he should have just given Garner what he wanted. In Sal's last appearance, he calls his wife late at night from a payphone located in a park, a group of men nearby. He does not tell her he has been fired, only that he will be arriving home late.\n\n=== Paul Kinsey ===\n'''Paul Kinsey''' ([[Michael Gladis]]) is a copywriter at Sterling Cooper. He initially features as part of the group of unmarried or childless young ad men in the Sterling Cooper office, who spend a lot of their time drinking, flirting, and gossiping. Paul tries out a lot of identities for himself throughout the series, never seeming to feel comfortable where he belongs. In addition to his creative duties at Sterling Cooper, Paul is a writer, and in the Season 1 episode \"Nixon vs. Kennedy\", his drunken co-workers find a play he wrote and act it out, although it is not very good, and it seems to ridicule a lot of his co-workers. Paul dated Joan prior to the beginning of the series, but Joan ended the relationship because, according to Joan, Paul \"has a big mouth\". When a then-naive Peggy begins to work at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary, Paul hits on her, but Peggy rejects him, as she is secretly attracted to Pete. In Season 2, Paul dates a black woman who is involved in [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Joan makes fun of his relationship with his black girlfriend, as she believes he is seeing her only to appear interesting. She dumps Paul while they are [[Civil Rights Movement#Voter registration organizing|registering black voters in the South]]. He is \"slumming\" by living in a run-down neighborhood popular among beatniks in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], and espouses more [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] ideas and attitudes than his fellow young copywriters.  Joan, however, mocks him for this lifestyle, proclaiming that he is simply pretentious and wants to believe he is better than the people he works with. He steals an IBM Selectric typewriter from the Sterling Cooper offices because he says as a writer, he needs it. This leads to a secretary being blamed and almost fired. He is originally from New Jersey and attended [[Princeton University|Princeton]] on a scholarship, two facts he is eager to hide. A fan of science fiction and ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', he has a notably Kennedy-era fascination with space.\n\nAs opposed to other characters who smoke cigarettes, Paul smokes a [[tobacco pipe|pipe]]. He is a moderate drinker and says he likes to [[effects of cannabis|get high]] \"whenever [he] can\".\n\nIn Season 2, Paul grows an [[Orson Welles]] beard and later quotes passages from Welles' ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|War of the Worlds]]'' radio broadcast. He initially encourages Peggy to pursue copywriting, noting, \"There ''are'' female copywriters\", but it immediately becomes clear this is merely an attempt to seduce her. He later becomes jealous and pettily competitive when her skill becomes indisputable.  He realizes Peggy and Don have creative \"magic\" together when it comes to advertising ideas and slogans and is annoyed, especially as his own contributions become less favored by Don and, as a result, diminish his importance at the firm. Paul expresses considerable anger when he realizes Peggy was chosen by Don to join the new agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, while he was not.\n\nIn the Season 5 episode \"[[Christmas Waltz (Mad Men)|Christmas Waltz]]\", he reappears as a devotee of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement, which he has joined at least partly to win the affections of a girl.  (His advertising career has apparently stalled, since he bounced between a few other agencies before becoming a Hare Krishna.)  He contacts [[List of Mad Men characters#Harry Crane|Harry Crane]] to ask him to pass on his [[spec script]] for ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' to Harry's contacts at NBC. The script is terrible, but Harry, feeling guilty because he has had sex with Paul's Hare Krishna girlfriend, and not wanting to deal with Paul's problems, praises the script and gives Paul $500 and a ticket to Los Angeles so he can start afresh. He advises Paul not to submit the script to the ''Star Trek'' production team due to \"studio politics,\" and instead recommends that he write his own original stories. Paul expresses considerable gratitude toward Harry, telling him he is the first person to actually do something for him, completely unaware of Harry's lies.\n\n=== Ken Cosgrove ===\n'''Kenneth \"Ken\" Cosgrove''' ([[Aaron Staton]]) is an account executive at Sterling Cooper. Pete says Ken is the son of a salesman from [[Burlington, Vermont]], and Ken tells Fillmore Auto Parts he grew up in rural Vermont. Ken says his mother is heavyset and works as a nurse at a state hospital. He attended [[Columbia University]], and before getting married lived in [[Murray Hill, Manhattan|Murray Hill]]. He is easygoing, confident, and generally happy, with a genuine artist's skills. He writes as a hobby and took a job in advertising because he heard there was money in it. In the early seasons, he gives the impression of being very successful at his job while not caring much about it&mdash;certainly not caring about his success in the office the way Peter and Harry do.\n\nHe initially appears as a member of the younger set of junior account men and copywriters at Sterling Cooper, seeming to spend more office time drinking, flirting and gossiping than working. Ken has literary aspirations and has been published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'',<ref>{{cite news|work=The Atlantic Monthly|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/05/tapping-a-maple-on-a-cold-vermont-morning/393344/|date=May 2015|title=Tapping a Maple on a Cold Vermont Morning |author=Cosgrove, Ken}}</ref> an accomplishment that elicits jealousy from both Pete Campbell and Paul Kinsey.\n\nIn Season 2, it is revealed that Ken makes considerably more money than his co-worker Harry Crane ($300/week vs. $200/week). In Season 3, Ken and Pete are promoted, sharing the role of Accounts Director, which infuriates Pete (who wanted the role all to himself) while Ken is completely unruffled. While not as outwardly ambitious as Pete, he has proven to be a competent executive and an exceptionally talented creative thinker, eclipsing Pete as a rising star at Sterling Cooper. Eventually, Ken is promoted above Pete, to the latter's fury, particularly when Ken is so blas\u00e9 about the promotion and about learning that Pete is sharing the position with him. When he gets married he becomes the only one of the central characters on the show to never be shown cheating on his wife. He maintains a healthy separation between his personal and professional lives, refusing to use family connections to succeed.\n\nBecause Pete Campbell was approached first and agreed to join SCDP, Ken is not asked to join the new firm and is not seen in the earlier episodes in Season 4. It turns out that he leaves Sterling Cooper and goes to McCann Erickson. However, Ken, unhappy at McCann, later joins SCDP, bringing [[Birds Eye]] and other clients with him, and agrees to serve under Pete. There are limits to what Ken will do, however: he refuses to try to bring his father-in-law's business over to SCDP because he does not want to mix his personal and professional lives, something Pete has no qualms doing.  Later in Season 4, Ken is having dinner with his fianc\u00e9e, Cynthia, and future in-laws when he learns that [[Lucky Strike]], SCDP's biggest client by far, is taking their business to another agency.\n\nIn the Season 5 premiere he is happily married, and he and his new wife attend Don's surprise birthday party. Ken is also shown to have continued writing in his off-hours and has published [[science fiction]] stories using the [[pseudonym]] of Ben Hargrove, which the prestigious publishing house of [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux|Farrar Straus]] wants to publish, a fact he tries to keep secret from his co-workers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mad-men-heres-that-awkward-look-on-everyones-face-when-they-hear-about-ken-cosgroves-story-about-robots-2012-4?op=1#ixzz3aVEeClM5|work=Business Insider|title=Mad Men: Here's That Awkward Look On Everyone's Face When They Hear About Ken Cosgrove's Story About Robots|author=Stampler, Laura| date= April 16, 2012}}</ref> At the end of \"[[Signal 30]]\", Ken tells Peggy Olson that Roger Sterling is forcing him to abandon writing fiction as he feels it takes away time from his work for the firm. He continues to do so under the new pen name Dave Algonquin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2012/04/mad_men_recap_signal_30.html|work=The Star-Ledger|title='Mad Men' recap, 'Signal 30': Red-faced and white-knuckled|author=Maurer, Mark|date= April 16, 2012}}</ref> In \"Commissions and Fees,\" Don and Roger manage to secure Ken's father-in-law as a client on their own. Ken doesn't mind working on the account since it was acquired without his help, but in exchange for feigning ignorance to Cynthia, Ken demands that Pete be excluded from the proceedings.\n\nIn Season 6, Ken has been given a spacious office on SCDP's second floor, and appears to be on somewhat friendlier terms with Pete, even giving him advice when the latter finds himself in a very awkward situation. He dislikes the new employee Bob Benson.  After the acquisition of the new Chevy account and the subsequent merger with CGC, Ken is assigned to deal with the account, necessitating that he be in Detroit more and more often.  Ken's happy-go-lucky attitude begins to fade, and the number of things he has to do for work that he does not like, increase. He is forced to spend time away from his family in Detroit, and he is injured by the Chevy car executives while engaging in leisure activities with them. In \"[[The Crash (Mad Men)|The Crash]]\", while under the influence of a \"mild stimulant\" that is intended to help SCDP employees to work the extra hours needed on the Chevy account, Ken demonstrates that he is a talented [[tap dance]]r, but can't remember clearly whether he learned the skill from his mother or his first girlfriend. Most seriously, in \"Quality of Mercy\", Ken is wounded in a hunting accident by a pair of Chevy executives, resulting in the loss of an eye. Deciding that Chevy is too much for him, he returns to New York full-time to support the newly pregnant Cynthia.\n\nDuring Season 7, Ken reveals he has a son, Edward. Cynthia is growing frustrated with Ken facing increased pressure at work, and she encourages him to leave the advertising business and write the [[Great American Novel]] he has dreamed of doing. After his father-in-law retires from [[Dow Chemical]], Ken presents him with a gift of golf clubs as a client. The same day, Roger, under pressure by McCann executives who are still angry at Ken leaving and taking the Birdseye account with him, fires him and gives his accounts to Pete. Ken, never really enamored of his job, was about to quit advertising and pursue Cynthia's suggestion to be a full-time writer, but being fired infuriates him so much that he takes a job as the head of advertising with Dow Chemical. In light of Ken's new position, Roger and Pete attempt to mend fences with him, especially when SC&P seeks to retain some autonomy from McCann-Erickson by proposing to move operations to Los Angeles. However, instead of becoming a writer, Ken sees an opportunity to get revenge for their dismissive treatment. Rather than drop SC&P as Dow's agency, he informs them he will retain them but make their life difficult. He is last seen in the final episode having lunch with Joan (proposing an opportunity for her to coordinate a promotional film for Dow), confident in his new position, and glad to be no longer with his former company.\n\n=== Harry Crane ===\n'''Harold \"Harry\" Crane''' ([[Rich Sommer]]) was a media buyer at Sterling Cooper. He initially is part of the group of young and unmarried or newly married members of the Creative and Accounts teams. Harry is originally from [[Wisconsin]] and is a [[University of Wisconsin]] alumnus, the only one of Pete's close friends who did not attend an [[Ivy League]] school (Ken went to Columbia, Pete to [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], and Paul to [[Princeton University|Princeton]]). He is married to Jennifer, who works at the phone company. In early seasons, they seem to have one of the happier and more egalitarian marriages on the show; Harry is honest with his wife and is shown asking her advice about his problems at work. He flirts with women but is faithful to his wife until he has too much to drink at an office party and has a [[one-night stand]] with Hildy, Pete's secretary. He confesses the infidelity to Jennifer, who kicks him out of their home for a time.  Harry and Jennifer appear to have resolved that issue by Season 2, and they have a daughter named Beatrice. In Season 6 it is mentioned that they also now have twin sons, Nathan and Steven.\n\nHarry is initially a bit of a pushover, accepting far less in pay in negotiations than he could have asked for, and his non-confrontational attitude causes him to mishandle a situation that leads to the firing of his friend and co-worker, Sal Romano. Despite these flaws, Harry is the only member of the firm to recognize the importance of television to the firm, and he subsequently creates and puts himself in charge of Sterling Cooper's television department. Later, when Sterling Cooper is in the process of being sold, Harry mistakenly thinks they are considering opening a West Coast office and believes he will be the person to move to California.\n\nIn Season 3, he is the only Sterling Cooper executive who is promoted by the firm's British owner as part of a short-lived company reorganization. Harry later accepts an offer to join Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce as \"Head of Media\". By Season 4, a more confident and slimmer, if smarmier, Harry shows great progress at work, as he is often seen making deals with television networks on the new agency's behalf.  We see him flirting with Peggy's friends as well, and it is implied that he cheats on his wife but has learned to keep it from her. In typical awkward Harry fashion, he sees prostitutes while in California for work, but pays them in [[Traveler's cheque|traveler's cheques]]. When he calls Joey Baird into his office and tells him that he has a particular look suited to television, Baird interprets it as a homosexual advance and becomes wary of him.\n\nDuring the season 5 premiere, Megan mentions to Peggy that Don really doesn't like Harry, and thus wouldn't want him to attend his birthday party. Nonetheless, Harry is invited and attends. Given his mild social awkwardness, he is seemingly unaware of Don's opinion of him. The next day at the office, Megan catches Harry making lewd comments about her performance of \"[[Zou Bisou Bisou]]\" and he is briefly concerned that he could lose his job. Also in Season 5, he is approached by former close friend Paul Kinsey, who is now a [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] and is floundering. He has sex with Paul's Hare Krishna girlfriend without Paul's knowledge. Immediately afterwards, she tells Harry that he disgusts her and she only had sex with him so that he would no longer try to rescue Paul from the Krishnas. Indeed, later, Paul, wanting to escape the Krishnas, approaches Harry for help&mdash;he has written a spec script for ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' and wants to know if it will be successful. Harry lies to Paul and assures him it's a great script (when in truth he and Peggy agree it is not only terrible but borderline racist), and urges him to leave immediately for California, giving him $500 (nearly $4000 in 2016 dollars) and a [[First class (aviation)|first class]] plane ticket on [[American Airlines]] for the trip. Paul expresses gratitude and feels Harry is a true friend, when in fact Harry's lies and desire to get Paul away from him are evidence of him simply not wanting to deal with Paul.\n\nIn Season 6, Harry's personality has changed considerably from his days at Sterling Cooper; he has become arrogant and full of prideful boasting about the Media Department. His jealousy manifests itself when Joan fires his secretary, Scarlett, for falsifying her time card. He orders Scarlett back to work and then bursts into a partners' meeting, displaying considerable anger over the fact that Joan was promoted to partner when he had been passed over several times, particularly as his accomplishments happened \"in broad daylight.\" Bert and Roger later give him a generous commission on \"Broadway Joe on Broadway\", a last-minute musical special he created to improve Dow Chemical's image, but flatly reject his demand to become a partner, Bert observing that Harry's outspoken criticism of their decision is the only genuinely impressive thing he's ever done.  Don and Roger both despise Harry. When Martin Luther King Jr. is assassinated, Pete is outraged by Harry's fretting over the ad time lost to news coverage, which leads to a brief but intense shouting match in which Pete accuses Harry of being a racist. Harry takes it as a given that he will soon be made partner. Bert, at the meeting of Harry's outburst, assures Joan that will never happen.\n\nDuring Season 7, Jim Cutler takes a dualistic view of Harry: on the one hand he says that Harry's TV work is hugely successful and will be a major part of SC&P in the future, but he also bluntly tells Harry \"you may be the most dishonest man I have ever worked with.\" Jim decides that Harry should finally be offered a partnership and the senior partners agree, though Joan and Roger are outspoken in their opposition. Harry is surprised to run into Don when they both end up at a Los Angeles party for one of Megan's actress friends. The two men are uncomfortable at the event and go to a bar, where Harry says he wishes Don was back (which Don barely notices) before stating that Jim and Lou Avery are planning a major cigarette-company account bid because that will allow them to get rid of Don (which Don very much notices, and uses when he crashes the meeting and ultimately ruins the account bid). In \"Waterloo\", Harry has not yet signed his approved partnership deal, wanting to hold out for more money, and Roger tells him that he \"missed the boat\" and that the idea of his becoming partner is now off the table. Harry has once again failed to read a situation properly, and his boastful posturing thus results in him losing an enormous amount of money when McCann Erickson buys Sterling Cooper, where even the 5% stake Joan had is worth at least $1,500,000. Later, Megan contacts Harry to see if he can help her with her acting career. Harry just assumes this means she will have sex with him in exchange.  When she refuses and leaves in disgust, he quickly goes to see Don, who is unaware of the proposition, to assure him that his soon-to-be-ex-wife Megan is \"crazy\" and Don shouldn't believe anything she says. By the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series finale]], Harry is last seen wearing a fur coat and eating cookies as he awaits a final lunch with Pete and Peggy.\n\n=== Rachel Menken ===\n'''Rachel Katz''' (n\u00e9e '''Menken'''; [[Maggie Siff]]) is the Jewish head of a department store who becomes romantically involved with Draper after she comes to Sterling Cooper in search of an advertising agency to revamp her business' image. Don's first encounter with Rachel, in the pilot, is at a meeting where he pitches the idea of using coupons to attract more customers to the store. Rachel disagrees with the tactic, asserting that she would like to attract wealthier customers. Draper is unhappy with hearing a woman talk to him assertively at the business table. He storms out of the meeting, but Roger Sterling later asks him to reconcile with Rachel, as she is worth $3 million. At his dinner with Rachel, Don questions her desire to work in business, confused that she would choose the \"stress\" of work over the comforts of married life. Rachel confidently replies that business is a thrill and adds that she's never been in love. Don mocks this addition, asserting that love doesn't exist; it was invented by ad men. He goes on to say that everyone is essentially alone \u2013 that people live alone and die alone. Rachel responds that she knows what it is like to be disconnected and feel out of place, and she sees that in Don. Something about the statement seems to intrigue Don, but Rachel ends the meeting, promising to come back to Sterling Cooper for another meeting on Monday morning.\n\nAt the second meeting, in the third episode, Rachel is irked that none of the admen on her team have been to her store. Don solves the problem by meeting her there that afternoon. While there she gives him a pair of medieval knight cuff links and takes him to her favorite place in the store, the roof - where the store keeps its patrol dogs. Rachel explains that she was always close to the dogs as a young girl because her father liked to work a lot. Other than her sister, the dogs were her only companions, as her mother died while giving birth to her. After her revelation, Don kisses her. He tells her he is married, which stuns her. She feels foolish and asks that he put someone else on her account at the firm.\n\nIn the tenth episode, when Roger has a heart attack, Don goes to Rachel's apartment and asks to come in; he has been highly affected by Roger's condition. She keeps her distance, while trying to console him. Don tries to kiss her, telling her she knows everything about him. She stops him and urges him to go to his wife. At this point Don kisses her again, saying, \"This is it. This is all there is\". She consents, and their affair begins. The episode ends with Don's confiding in Rachel the nature of his upbringing.\n\nWhen Pete Campbell blackmails Don, he comes to Rachel with the suggestion that they run away together to Los Angeles. She reminds him of his duty to his children and questions whether he would want to abandon his children after having grown up without a father. When Don persists, Rachel comes to the realization that he does not want to run away with her; he just wants to run away. She calls him a coward. Their relationship seems to collapse from that point on, and they break up sometime between the first and second seasons. Apparently, Rachel was so upset that her father complains to Bert Cooper, who in turn asks Don, \"Why is this man calling me?\" Cooper later reports she was sent on an extended \"ocean cruise\" to heal her psyche.\n\nDon encounters her again in Season 2, while he is dining out with Bobbie Barrett. Rachel introduces them to her husband, Tilden Katz. Though it appears that Don is only momentarily shaken by the news of Rachel's marriage, four episodes later, after drinking heavily with Roger and Freddie Rumsen, he gives his name as \"Tilden Katz\" to a bouncer outside an underground club Roger is trying to get them into.\n\nIn Season 7, Don has a vision of Rachel attending a [[casting call]] for aspiring models. When he tries to contact her, Don discovers that Rachel had died the previous week. During a [[shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] conducted in her memory, Don learns that Rachel suffered from [[leukemia]] and that she had two children. Her sister, with whom Rachel was close and in whom she confided about her relationship with Don, is not happy to see him. She pointedly says that Rachel \"had it all\", makes it clear her life was better for not having Don in it, and is curt until Don takes the hint and leaves.\n\n=== Bert Cooper ===\n'''Bertram \"Bert\" Cooper''' ([[Robert Morse]]) is the senior partner<ref>[http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/cast/bcooper AMC Cast and Crew] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209071428/http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/cast/bcooper |date=2008-12-09 }}</ref> of Sterling Cooper, a crafty old gentleman who is treated with considerable deference by Roger Sterling and Don Draper. He founded the agency in 1923 with Roger Sterling's father.  Cooper's late wife introduced Roger and his first wife, Mona, and Cooper keeps a picture of young Roger and Roger's father in his office. Cooper lectures Roger about being dependent on smoking and criticizes him for his love life. Cooper is not present in the office's day-to-day wranglings, but he is devoted to the business and quietly manages various challenges from behind the scenes. Cooper's younger sister, Alice, is a [[Partnership#Silent partners|silent partner]] at Sterling Cooper and invested in the company when it was just getting started.\n\nCooper has a [[Mark Rothko#Late period|late period]] red painting by [[Mark Rothko]] and the erotic illustration ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'' hung in his office and is a devotee of [[Ayn Rand]]. He is an aficionado of [[Japanese art]] and [[Japanese culture|culture]]: his office is decorated in a [[Japan]]ese motif with [[sh\u014dji]] dividers among other things, such as a photograph of [[Calvin Coolidge|President Coolidge]], and he requires visitors to remove their shoes before entering his office. Roger attributes this to Cooper being a germaphobe. Cooper also walks around the rest of the Sterling Cooper offices in his socks.\n\nThough he is generally perceived as gracious and accepting, Cooper seems to harbor some racist feelings, as evidenced in the Season 7 episode \"A Day's Work\" when, after, Joan has reassigned Dawn Chambers to the reception desk, Cooper complains that visitors to the agency are greeted by someone who is black.\n\nHe is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and gets Sterling Cooper involved with the 1960 [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] campaign, providing advertising services to the campaign ''gratis''. Cooper is the second character at Sterling Cooper to learn that [[Don Draper]] is actually Dick Whitman, after Pete Campbell informs him of the truth, but he reacts with nonchalance, remarking, \"Mr. Campbell, ''who cares?''\" and urging him to forget about it. He keeps silent about Don's identity but uses this knowledge two years later in the Season 3 episode [[Mad Men (season 3)|\"Seven Twenty Three\"]] to pressure Don into signing a three-year contract with the agency.\n\nAfter selling a majority interest in the company to British firm PPL, he begins to feel increasingly insignificant as they start to exert control, but accepts this as part of the terms of the buyout, from which he, Alice, Roger, and Don profited handsomely. But when Bert discovers PPL will be selling Sterling Cooper to a rival agency and that he will be forced to retire as a result, Cooper goes on to co-found the new agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.\n\nDuring [[Mad Men (season 4)|Season 4]], Don Draper finds a taped recording of Roger's memoirs \"Sterling's Gold\" in a drawer by accident, from which it is revealed that a younger Cooper was given an unnecessary [[orchiectomy]] during the \"height of his sexual prime\". Don and Peggy also learn that when Roger was a young man, he was sexually involved with Cooper's much older, very eccentric, long-time secretary, [[List of Mad Men characters#Ida Blankenship|Ida Blankenship]].\n\nLater in the Season 4 episode \"[[Blowing Smoke (Mad Men)|Blowing Smoke]]\", when the agency is forced to radically downsize its staff following the loss of the [[Lucky Strike]] account, an angered Cooper tells the other partners he is quitting, partially in response to Don Draper's ad in ''[[The New York Times]]'', which he feels is a needlessly reckless career move, and he does not want to be associated with Draper's \"stunt\". However, as of the premiere of [[Mad Men (season 5)|Season 5]], he is back in the offices of SCDP, although without an office of his own.\n\nBy Season 6, Cooper has been given his own office on SCDP's new second floor. Though far less spacious than his office at Sterling Cooper, it is still decorated with Japanese art. Cooper starts going about his duties with more vigor and enjoyment than he has for the past two seasons, and more effectively than Roger and Don, the other major partners. Cooper works in secret with Pete and Joan to prepare SCDP for becoming a publicly traded company,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/maureen-ryan/mad-men-recap-for-immediate-release_b_3221013.html|title='Mad Men' Recap: A Classic Episode Brings Big Changes For Don And Peggy|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|date=6 May 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amc.com/shows/mad-men/talk/2013/06/qa-robert-morse-bertram-cooper|title=Q&A \u2013 Robert Morse (Bertram Cooper)|website=AMC}}</ref> but his plans are derailed when Don loses the Jaguar account. Cooper's initial opinion on the subsequent merger with CGC is unclear, though he goes about his duties at the new firm with his usual aplomb.  Cooper later volunteers to have his name removed from the company's along with those of the recently deceased partners, but gleefully accepts Cutler's proposal to name the firm \"Sterling Cooper & Partners.\" On Thanksgiving Day, 1968, Cooper leads Roger, Jim and Joan in confronting Don over his recent behavior and placing the errant creative director on an indefinite leave of absence.\n\nIn Season 7, after Roger's urging, Cooper is willing to let Don return to the agency under strict stipulations. He dies while watching the [[1969 Moon landing|1969 Apollo 11 moon landing]] on television with his maid. At the end of the first half of Season 7, Bert appears to Don as an apparition in the SC&P lobby, and goes into a song and dance of \"[[The Best Things in Life Are Free (1927 song)|The Best Things in Life Are Free]]\", surrounded by smiling, dancing secretaries instead of showgirls, before disappearing. Later, during Season 7's \"Lost Horizon\", Cooper's ghost appears to Don in his car, chatting and giving him a bit of insight during a late-night drive.\n\n=== Lane Pryce ===\n{{main|Lane Pryce}}\n'''[[Lane Pryce]]''' ([[Jared Harris]]), previously employed at Puttnam, Powell and Lowe, becomes a junior partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce at the end of Season 3. Despite being a junior partner, his name is on the company's masthead. In the fifth season, after embezzling funds from the company, he forges a check and gets caught by Don, who tells him to resign. After typing a resignation letter, Lane commits suicide by hanging himself in his office.\n\n=== Sally Draper ===\n'''Sally Beth Draper''' ([[Kiernan Shipka]]) is Don and Betty Draper's oldest child. The series' third episode, \"[[Marriage of Figaro (Mad Men)|Marriage of Figaro]],\" depicts a party for her 6th birthday in late March or early April 1960.  She becomes a more central character in the Seasons 3 and 4 (according to the time line of the series, she would turn nine years old in season 3 and 11 in season 4); from Season 4, she is promoted to a starring role. The death of her grandfather, [[List of Mad Men characters#Gene Hofstadt|Gene Hofstadt]], affected Sally significantly and deepened the rift between her and her mother. When her youngest brother is named after their dead grandfather and given his room, Sally becomes convinced that the baby is her grandfather's reincarnation and becomes terrified of him, but is eventually calmed down by her father. Sally is adventurous, and she has been seen throughout the series making cocktails for her father, smoking one of her mother's cigarettes, asking Don's co-workers about sex, sneaking sips of their alcoholic beverages, being taught how to drive by her grandfather, and masturbating while at a friend's house. Her behavioral problems lead Betty to have her see a child psychiatrist in Season 4. Sally appears to be closer to her father than her mother, and in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Beautiful Girls (Mad Men)|The Beautiful Girls]]\", she unexpectedly shows up at Don's office, because she wants to live with him instead of Betty and Henry Francis. Don sometimes affectionately calls Sally \"Salamander.\" She develops a friendship with slightly older neighbor boy Glen, who is about 12 or 13, in Season 4. This infuriates Betty because, in prior years, Betty and Glen reached out and comforted each other when they were both feeling sad, lonely, and neglected. Betty forbids Sally to see Glen, and proves to be very volatile whenever Sally sees him. Sally continues to surreptitiously communicate with Glen, calling him frequently at his boarding school.\n\nAs Sally progresses into young adulthood, she witnesses several disturbing events, such as in the Season 5 episode \"[[At the Codfish Ball]]\" when she sees Marie Calvet, her stepmother Megan's mother, [[fellatio|fellating]] Roger Sterling during a business dinner, and, most disturbingly, her own father having sex with his neighbor Sylvia in the Season 6 episode \"Favors\". Don's outright denial of the reality of the encounter alienates him from Sally, and, resentful of her parents, Sally decides to attend boarding school. While at school, Sally becomes a troublemaker, smoking constantly, sneaking alcohol onto campus, and dueling with golf clubs with her friends. By the end of the sixth season, Don decides to be more honest with his children, starting with showing them the now dilapidated [[whorehouse]] where he grew up. The choice to be truthful makes an impact on Sally and she begins to forgive her father for his transgressions by the beginning of Season 7. In the Season 7 episode, \"A Day's Work\" Sally goes to a dorm mate's mother's funeral, but ditches with her friends to go shopping. However, while at a caf\u00e9, she leaves her purse behind. Realizing this on the train back, she has no choice but to go to Don's work and ask him for a ride. She goes to his work to discover Lou Avery in what used to be his office. Now suspicious, Sally goes back to his apartment. Eventually, Don arrives and she he uses the excuse 'I wasn't feeling well.' He writes her a note and drives her back to the school. Mid-way, they confront each other about their lies. They stop for food and he drives her back to the school. Sally gets out of the car and while she shuts the door, she says, \"Happy Valentines Day. I love you.\" Which hasn't been said to each other since Season 4. However, she still objects to Don's decisions in life, telling her father that she does not want to be anything like her parents. \"You're a very beautiful girl,\" Don responds. \"It's up to you to be more than that.\"\n\nWhen the series begins to draw to a close, Sally faces further complications of growing up. Glen decides to join the army and fight in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], causing a frustrated Sally to yell at Glen and express disdain over the possibility of his killing of innocent children and bystanders. Sally later expresses regret over her outburst and, through tears, tells Glen's mother that she is sorry and wants to say goodbye to Glen before he leaves for basic training. Later, Sally learns from Henry that her mother Betty is dying from [[lung cancer]], something Betty had not wanted Sally to know at that stage of her illness. On a surprise visit to the Francis household, Betty gives Sally a letter that she tells Sally to read after her death. Shortly afterward, at her dorm room, Sally goes against orders and reads the letter anyway. In the letter, Betty gives Sally a picture of Betty to show the embalmers how to dress and style her for the viewing, and tells Sally that she loves her, and that while in the past she was worried because Sally always wanted to go her own way, now she admires her independent nature, resulting in Sally breaking down in tears. Later, upon learning Betty wants to send Bobby and Gene to stay with her uncle after her death, Sally decides to cancel her planned trip to Madrid and serve as a maternal figure to her brothers. It is also implied that she will press for Henry to raise the boys after Betty's death, since she tells Don they should not be uprooted. The final image of Sally is of her washing dishes while Betty smokes at the kitchen table.\n\n=== Megan Draper ===\n'''Megan Draper (n\u00e9e Calvet)''' ([[Jessica Par\u00e9]]) (born 1940/41) begins as a member of SCDP's typing pool, makes her first appearance at the beginning of Season 4, rises from receptionist to Don Draper's secretary, and ultimately marries Draper by the beginning of Season 5.  Following Miss Blankenship's sudden death, Megan is promoted from the main reception desk to take over as Draper's personal secretary.  \n\nIn the Season 4 episode \"[[Chinese Wall (Mad Men)|Chinese Wall]]\", she indicates to Don an interest in advertising, and one night, while discussing work, Megan initiates a sexual encounter with Don on his office couch.  She comments that she would not run out crying the next day if they slept together, presumably a reference to Don's previous secretary, Allison, who left SCDP in tears following Don's cold treatment of her after their one-night stand.  \n\nIn the [[Tomorrowland (Mad Men)|Season 4 finale]], Don hires Megan to babysit his children on a trip to California, when his planned childcare falls through at the last moment.  Although Don has been dating Faye Miller, SCDP's marketing research consultant, for months, he proposes marriage to Megan upon returning from the California trip, and she accepts.  Don promotes her to copywriter soon after their engagement announcement at SCDP.\n\nMegan, originally from [[Montreal]], is bilingual in English and French.  She is intelligent and capable, but moody and combative as well; as her own mother tells her, she has the \"artistic temperament\".  She originally wanted to be an actress, and in Season 5, she quits her copywriting job at SCDP to pursue acting again and quickly lands her first acting job, with Don's intervention, in a commercial for Butler Shoes in the [[The Phantom (Mad Men)|Season 5 finale]].  She is 26 at the time of her marriage to Don, who turns 40 seven months after the wedding.\n\nBetween seasons, Don appears to have fully disclosed his personal secrets to Megan, as she is aware of his former identity and Dick Whitman's birth date, and knows about Anna. By Season 6, Megan is a recognizable actress, having landed a regular role in a daytime soap opera on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] titled ''To Have and to Hold''. She admits to Sylvia Rosen that she had become pregnant while in Hawaii with Don and was relieved when she miscarried, as she had contemplated her options, as a pregnancy would have disrupted her emerging acting career. Megan later reveals to Don that she had been pregnant and miscarried.\n\nNear the end of Season 6, Don, who is obsessed with their neighbor Sylvia Rosen, unbeknownst to Megan and Sylvia's husband, Arnie Rosen, barely communicates with Megan. Marie suggests Megan dress less like a wife for a business dinner Don has invited Megan to, which attracts Don's amorous attention that night, but ultimately he practically ignores her, and she, believing he is simply working and drinking too much, tells him things must change. \n\nIn the Season 6 finale, Don tells Megan they are moving together to California, and she quits her soap opera job, eagerly anticipating pursuing acting opportunities on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].  However, later that same day, Don tells her they are not moving. Angered, Megan leaves the apartment.  \n\nMegan moves to Los Angeles anyway, and their marriage deteriorates rapidly in the first half of Season 7, particularly when Megan discovers Don has been put on leave from SC&P and hasn't actually been working, which suggests he'd rather stay at home and brood than be with her. It is also implied that Megan's own career is not going well; she is having difficulty securing roles, and at one point, she bombs an audition and then tracks down the director to tearfully demand a second chance. \n\nMegan ends her marriage with Don, who had finally decided to move to Los Angeles, over the phone midway through the Season 7 episode \"Waterloo\". Later, in the Season 7 episode \"New Business\", they have an unpleasant final meeting, where they sign divorce papers, and Don offers Megan a check for $1 million. Bitter and angry, Megan berates Don for \"ruining her life\" but accepts the money.  Megan is not seen again after this episode.\n\n=== Henry Francis ===\n'''Henry Francis''' ([[Christopher Stanley]]) is a Republican political advisor who serves as the Director of Public Relations and Research in the Governor's Office under New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and, later, is an advisor to New York City Mayor [[John Lindsay]]. He first sees Betty when she is six months pregnant at the Sterlings' [[Kentucky Derby]] party, and is instantly drawn to her.  Later, Betty uses a political pretext to call him to ask if he can use his influence to save a local reservoir, and they quickly develop a deeper connection.  Betty reciprocates Henry's attention because she increasingly feels no connection with Don due to his non-stop infidelities, lies over his true identity, and his sometimes verbally abusive attitude towards her. After Betty's beloved father dies, the much older Henry also serves as a father figure for her. Henry and Betty have only a few brief and furtive meetings before Henry proposes marriage in the wake of the [[Kennedy assassination]].  Season 3 ends with the two of them on a plane with baby Gene, flying to Reno so Betty can obtain a quick divorce from Don. At the start of Season 4, we see that Henry and Betty have married and Henry has rather uncomfortably taken up residence in the Drapers' house, living with Betty and her three children and initially paying no rent to Don.  He tries to soothe Betty as she continues to react angrily to Don and his irresponsibility towards the children, but he becomes more frustrated with her over time. Betty, on her part, feels unaccepted by Henry's family, especially when she is unable to control Sally during a family visit to the home of Henry's mother [[List of Mad Men characters#Pauline Francis|Pauline]], and in the face of Pauline's not-so-veiled scorn of Betty. During this time, Henry is concerned by Betty's continued anger towards Don, and he wonders aloud if they rushed into their marriage too quickly.  At the end of Season 4, Henry and Betty decide to move to [[Rye, NY]]. By Season 5, Betty has gained a large amount of weight, but Henry tells her she's beautiful. Her relationship with Henry seems affectionate and Henry seems to love her unconditionally. In the [[The Doorway|Season 6 premiere]], when Betty dyes her hair black, to her children's dismay, Henry says she looks like [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. Betty supports, and seems rejuvenated by, Henry's decision to run for office in Season 6, and after he admiringly tells the overweight, brunette Betty that during his campaign people will \"really see\" her, she rapidly regains her former svelte figure and blonde hairdo. Henry is a solid, mature, and responsible presence in her life, but he also has very traditional views of women, and they have an argument when Betty, at a political fundraiser, does not parrot Henry's political position.\n\nDuring the final season, Henry takes Betty's diagnosis of terminal lung cancer very hard, and in typical fashion is full of energy to fight it. But Betty refuses to do so, just as she refuses to quit smoking or to quit her plans of studying psychology at a university as long as she is physically able. Against her wishes, Henry drives up to see Sally at school to tell her about the diagnosis and to ask her to help him to convince her mother to do chemotherapy. As he talks to Sally, he breaks down crying. As her illness progresses, Betty makes it known that her wish is for Sally, Bobby and Gene to be raised by her brother (William) and his wife (Judy) after her death, rather than by Henry or Don, although Sally feels that Henry is the best person to parent her little brothers after their mother is gone.\n\n=== Stan Rizzo ===\n'''Stan Rizzo''' ([[Jay R. Ferguson]]) becomes the art director at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce after Salvatore is fired. Before coming to the company, he worked at [[DDB Worldwide|DDB]], making unaired work for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s 1964 presidential campaign. In the beginning of his tenure, he and Peggy are often at odds with each other due to his abrasive and sometimes macho attitude, but the two develop a strong working relationship after Stan tries to intimidate Peggy by suggesting they work in the nude; Peggy calls his bluff and strips down, prompting Stan to concede victory to her. Stan is one of the few members of the SCDP creative department who survives the staff cuts.\n\nBy Season 5 the two are working well together, until the firm hires Michael Ginsberg, whose bombastic and somewhat sexist attitude is more in line with Stan's than Peggy's.\n\nIn Season 6, after Peggy leaves to join CGC, she and Stan maintain their friendship through late-night phone calls. Peggy's boss Ted Chaough overhears one such conversation, and Peggy relates Stan's news that Heinz ketchup is considering meetings; Chaough takes advantage of this and pressures Peggy to pitch a CGC campaign.  Although neither firm ultimately wins the account, a betrayed Stan gives Peggy the finger at a bar. After SCDP and CGC merge into SC&P, Stan and Peggy easily rebuild their friendship, and he is happy to be working with her again. In \"[[The Crash (Mad Men)|The Crash]]\", Stan is one of several employees injected with a stimulant by Jim Cutler's \"Dr. Feelgood\"  to boost creativity and spends an entire weekend intoxicated. During this time, he comes on to Peggy, who gently rejects him, and to whom reveals that his first cousin recently died in Vietnam. Peggy counsels him that loss cannot be dealt with by getting high and having sex. While Stan initially takes her advice, he is later discovered [[in flagrante delicto]] with Wendy Gleason, the hippie daughter of a recently deceased partner.\n\nSeveral episodes later in \"Favors\", Peggy telephones Stan in the middle of the night, waking him up, to plead for his assistance with a rat in her apartment. When he refuses, she teasingly offers to \"make it worth his while,\" but he still refuses, as he is currently in bed with a nude sleeping woman. The camera also reveals a large poster of [[Moshe Dayan]] over Stan's bed.\n\nIn the Season 6 finale \"In Care Of\", SC&P have landed the California-based [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist]]. Stan approaches Don, requesting permission to go to California and start a fledgling branch of the firm. Don warns him that it would basically mean demotion and work on only one account, but Stan is adamant. Don is inspired by the idea, and instead of allowing Stan to go, proposes to the partners that he himself go to start the branch. Stan is infuriated by what he perceives as a betrayal on Don's part, although Don offers to let Stan come to California in a few months. Don later decides against going, and instead Pete Campbell and Ted Chaough go, without Stan.\n\nDuring the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|final episode]], after SCDP has been absorbed back into McCann, Stan and Peggy acknowledge their hitherto unspoken feelings for one-another, and Stan urges Peggy not to pursue Joan's offer to join her new agency, but rather remain at McCann with him. The final image of him is sharing an embrace with Peggy during a late evening working.\n\n=== Ted Chaough ===\n'''Ted Chaough''' ([[Kevin Rahm]]) (pronounced {{IPAc-en|t\u0283|\u0254\u02d0}}), is a self-proclaimed rival of Don Draper's in the advertising world. His agency, Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough (CGC), picks up Don's resigned accounts Clearasil and Belle Jolie, and is competing with Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (SCDP) for an account with Honda in Season 4. Don tricks Ted into making an expensive presentation to Honda executives, which backfires on Ted as he violates Honda's presentation rules of no finished work or commercials. Though the two agencies are comparable in size, Chaough seems obsessed with competing against Don, behaving in a magnanimous and jesting manner whenever Don crosses Ted's path.  Ted tries to woo Pete Campbell over to his agency, but Pete remains loyal to Don. After Don writes a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' ad proclaiming that SCDP will be dropping business with cigarette companies for moral reasons, Ted makes a prank call to Don pretending to be [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. In Season 5, Ted recruits Peggy to leave SCDP and join his advertising firm as chief copywriter for $1,000 a year more than she had asked for. This time, Ted remains confident but is much less obnoxious than in his previous appearances; he doesn't tell Peggy how jealous he is of Don, and he appreciates her talent more than Don ever had. She accepts his offer, which in the [[The Phantom (Mad Men)|season finale]] has him assigning her a huge amount of material involving an account for cigarettes aimed at female consumers.\n\nIn Season 6, Peggy shares Stan's SCDP insider information with Ted, noting that the Heinz Ketchup executive had met surreptitiously with SCDP but there was friction between him and Heinz Beans executive Raymond Geiger, an SCDP client.  Ted sees an opportunity and pressures Peggy to \"find out everything you know about Heinz Ketchup.\" In \"To Have and To Hold\", Chaough's team encounters Don's in the hallway in front of the room where firms are making their Heinz pitches, and Don is shocked to see Peggy there. In the end, Heinz chooses a third (larger) firm, and Raymond Geiger drops SCDP because he feels betrayed.\n\nIn \"For Immediate Release,\" Ted and Don commiserate at a bar over their very low chances of winning the Chevy account, primarily due to the small size of their respective firms.  Don spontaneously comes up with, and pitches to Ted, the idea that they should combine their firms so as to have a shot at competing with the major ad agencies.  Ted agrees, and the two firms merge, much to the surprise of everyone concerned.  In this same episode, Ted surprises Peggy by kissing her.\n\nIn \"Man with a Plan\", Ted's management style is shown to clash with Don's, as the personable Ted tries to involve everyone and get their input, while Don primarily values his own opinion.  Don decides to assert his authority by getting Ted drunk and letting him humiliate himself at a subsequent creatives meeting.  Ted, however, gets his revenge by flying the two of them in his small plane to a Mohawk Airlines meeting despite the rainy, turbulent weather; Don is a visibly terrified passenger. The two men also clash over Peggy, with Don trying to get his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to take his side, while Ted tries to woo Peggy to his.\n\nUnhappy in his marriage, Ted meets with Peggy after the merger and expresses his interest in having a romantic relationship with her, but they agree that the relationship would be impossible given the circumstances. He also insists that because of his attraction to her, he must remain reserved in her presence. However, they ultimately begin a relationship and are not very subtle about it; they're seen giggling and paying attention only to each other in the office, which annoys many of their colleagues.\n\nAfter Don embarrasses Ted and Peggy in front of a client, Ted decides that he cannot be around Peggy anymore. However, seeing her dressed provocatively to go on a date with another man, Ted camps out at her door until she returns. He professes his love for her, they sleep together, and he makes plans to leave his family for her. However, by the next morning he changes his mind and pleads with Don to send him to California to work the new Sunkist account for SC&P.  Don agrees, and Ted says goodbye to a devastated Peggy.\n\nTed spends the first part of Season 7 completely adrift in California, badly missing New York and mostly ignored as an impotent figurehead in an office where the work that's getting done is entirely due to Pete's efforts. He hits rock bottom when flying Sunkist executives to a meeting, briefly turning off the engine as he considers crashing the plane before changing his mind. He isn't bothered by Sunkist's dismay, telling Jim Cutler, his partner from CGC, that he wants to be bought out of his SC&P partnership share, and he plans to vote for Jim's plan to fire Don over the nebulous breach of Don's contract. However, the combination of the huge windfall from Roger's McCann buyout offer and Don's pledge that Ted can come back East and simply do the hands-on work leads him to approve the sale. Ted reveals to Don late in Season 7 that he has divorced his wife and begun dating his former college girlfriend.\n\nTed is last seen in the 12th episode of Season 7, \"Lost Horizon\". SC&P has been absorbed by McCann Erickson, and Ted and Don are attending a meeting for Miller Beer with at least a dozen other McCann Creative Directors. When Don wanders out in the middle of an important meeting, Ted smiles to himself.\n\n=== Michael Ginsberg ===\n'''Michael Ginsberg''' ([[Ben Feldman (actor)|Ben Feldman]]) first appears in the Season 5 episode \"[[Tea Leaves (Mad Men)|Tea Leaves]]\"  when he is hired as a part-time copywriter by Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. He is initially hired to service the [[Mohawk Airlines]] account, and proves himself to be both prolific and innovative. He quickly becomes an essential part of the creative team and surpasses [[Peggy Olson]] midway through the season as the firm's most productive writer, when Peggy becomes mired in the [[Heinz Baked Beans|Heinz]] story arc. Ginsberg is an idiosyncratic, socially awkward character who tends to speak his mind, which both helps and hinders him. His position at the firm is threatened at times, including at his interview, when Peggy decides not to employ him for fear of his being too extroverted and idiosyncratic for Don's tastes. However, this decision is reversed by Roger, who has already told Mohawk they have taken Ginsberg on.\n\nThe quality of Ginsberg's work is his main asset, and he tells Peggy immediately following his interview that although he can be tough to handle, he is a natural copywriter. His pitching style is theatrical, and he often captivates his clients with his over-the-top performances and youthful vigor. In this respect, he stands out from the rest of the SCDP team, particularly Don and Peggy, who are quieter and more understated both in their copy and their presentation. As the season goes on, Ginsberg's socially awkward, tone-deaf genius and refusal to follow orders begin to create resentment in both Don and Peggy, leading to a conflict between Ginsberg and Don in the Season 5 episode \"[[Dark Shadows (Mad Men)|Dark Shadows]]\", when Don decides to submit his own work for an account instead of Ginsberg's. The episode reveals Ginsberg's competitive side, which had been rarely evident until then.\n\nGinsberg is [[Jewish]], and he lives with his adoptive father Morris in [[Brooklyn]].<!--Not in Firger--> In \"[[Far Away Places (Mad Men)|Far Away Places]]\", he reveals to Peggy that he was told he was born in a [[concentration camp]] during [[World War II]],<ref name=Finger>{{cite web|author=Firger, Jessica|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mad-men-takes-on-mental-illness/ ||title=\"Mad Men\" takes on mental illness: How realistic?|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=2014-05-12|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref> and that his father found him in a Swedish orphanage at age 5. He also claims to be a Martian who is waiting for orders from above, but whether this is a genuine belief, a particularly straight-faced joke, or an expression of psychological estrangement from society resulting from his personal history, remains ambiguous. Ginsberg appears to have a difficult relationship with his father, who is overbearing and physically dominates him.\n\nRoger takes a liking to Ginsberg when he discovers they share a common desire to throw something out of their skyscraper windows, and Roger thereafter canvasses Ginsberg's support to help him with the [[Manischewitz]] account, which he is trying to bring to SCDP.  With Peggy's departure from SCDP in \"[[Lady Lazarus (Mad Men)|Lady Lazarus]]\", Ginsberg's position as copywriter is further elevated, and he becomes one of the two full-time copywriters at the firm, both of whom report to Don.  However, in the season finale \"[[The Phantom (Mad Men)|The Phantom]]\", Ginsberg and Stan struggle to make the same impression on clients that Peggy did, and Don does not back their ideas the way he did hers, frustrating them.\n\nIn Season 6, Ginsberg is shown to have embraced more of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], and grows a thick moustache while dressing less formally. With the merger of SCDP and CGC, Peggy once again becomes his superior. His politics come to a head when, during an argument with partner Jim Cutler, Ginsberg denounces [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]] for the use of its [[Napalm]] in Vietnam. Cutler angrily criticizes Ginsberg as a hypocrite for abhorring Dow's policies and yet accepting paychecks from them.\n\nGinsberg's father later sets him up on a blind date, but he immediately botches it through being socially awkward and admitting that he is still a virgin. His behavior and manners continue to be erratic and begin to deteriorate throughout the season, culminating in a psychotic breakdown brought on by the installation of an IBM computer in the old creative breakroom in \"The Runaways\". After the computer is installed at SC&P, Ginsberg becomes convinced that the computer has a plan to destroy the human race, and that it is doing so by turning those within its proximity into homosexuals thereby eradicating the possibility of female fertilization. Convinced that this is true, he arrives at Peggy's apartment to escape from it in order to do his work, but later wakes Peggy in order to 'reproduce' and therefore beat the machine. The next day he gives Peggy his severed nipple as an apology, explaining that since his nipple is a valve and he has now removed it, the computer's vibrations can now flow through him and he will not need to use Peggy as an outlet. Ginsberg is removed from the building tied to a stretcher, leaving Peggy in tears and Stan in shock. It is later mentioned that Ginsberg's father had him [[mental hospital|institutionalized]].\n\nJessica Firger of [[CBS News]] wrote that the \"centerpiece of his psychosis\" is being afraid of having computers take over for humans and that \"In retrospect, the clues to his unraveling had been accumulating for some time.\"<ref name=Finger/> Feldman expressed surprise upon learning of the final story arc, stating \"my jaw just dropped to the floor\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mad-men-ben-feldman-talks-ginsberg-breakdown/|title=\"Mad Men\" actor Ben Feldman talks Ginsberg's breakdown|work=[[CBS News]]|date=2014-05-13|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref> Psychiatrist Dr. Paul Puri analyzed the character and suggested that his repressed homosexuality may have contributed to his self-mutilation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Watkins, Gwynne|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/05/psychiatrist-analyzes-mad-mens-ginsberg.html|title=A Psychiatrist Analyzes ''Mad Men''<nowiki>\u2019</nowiki>s Michael Ginsberg|work=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=2013-05-13|accessdate=2020-04-24}}</ref> Holly Eagleson, in ''[[TakePart]]'', argued that the story made the mental illness too dramatic and out of line with what schizophrenia sufferers experience and that this could lead to unnecessary stigma.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eagleson, Holly|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/05/14/mad-men-mental-illness/|title=\u2018Mad Men\u2019 and the Trouble With Mental Illness as a Plotline|website=[[TakePart]]|publisher=[[Participant Media]]|accessdate=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Bobby Draper ===\n'''Robert \"Bobby\" Draper''' ([[Maxwell Huckabee]] in season 1; Aaron Hart in seasons 1 and 2; [[Jared S. Gilmore]] in seasons 3 and 4; and [[Mason Vale Cotton]] in seasons 5, 6 and 7) is Don and Betty Draper's middle child. His mother referred to him as a \"little liar.\" Bobby was mentioned as being 5 years old in the Season 2 episode \"[[The Mountain King (Mad Men)|The Mountain King]],\" and 7 years old in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (Mad Men)|The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]\", making his birthday between March and September 1957. Due to many of the Draper story lines focusing on Don, Betty and Sally, Bobby does not have much of a role in the early seasons. He is depicted as being clumsy and accident-prone, such as burning his lip on a hot stove. When Betty urges Don to spank Bobby for damaging the radio, he opts to scold the boy rather than resorting to physical punishment; he later reveals that he is reluctant to use corporal punishment on Bobby because his own father beat him badly very often, and the only thing it accomplished was Don spending time thinking of ways to murder his father.  After the Drapers divorce, Bobby gradually becomes close to his stepfather, Henry Francis, and he is treated kindly by Don's new wife, Megan. During Season 6, Bobby's character is expanded; he shown to be sympathetic towards blacks in the aftermath of [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr's assassination]], as well as expressing concern for Henry's safety. Don realizes that he has been missing out on his children's lives. By Season 7, Bobby is deeply troubled over Betty and Henry's arguments and fears they might divorce. He does not spend much time with his mother, but one day she agrees to help chaperone a field trip with his class. He is thrilled by his mother's involvement, but things sour when he trades his mother's sandwich for candy, which leads to her yelling at him and turning a cold shoulder to him for the rest of the day.\n\n== Recurring characters ==\n\n=== Allison ===\n'''Allison''' ([[Alexa Alemanni]]) was Don Draper's secretary, first at Sterling Cooper and later at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Allison was first seen as Sterling Cooper's receptionist. By Season 3, she had become Don Draper's secretary. Though her character was little developed during the first three seasons, she was depicted as being competent and friendly. In Season 2, after Don asked that Jane Siegel be removed as his secretary, Allison was installed as her replacement. In Season 3, she occasionally flirted with Ken, and during Joan's going-away party she was seen sitting on Ken's lap.  Although the sudden formation of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce was accomplished without Allison's knowledge (she declared that the agency had been robbed when she came into Don's office and discovered that it had been stripped over the weekend), SCDP hired her sometime during 1964, and she continued as Don's secretary. On the night of the office Christmas Party in 1964, Don asked Allison to bring him his apartment keys, which he had forgotten at work. Upon her entering his apartment, the drunken Don seduced Allison, and they had an impulsive sexual encounter. He attempted to forget about the affair but ended up hurting Allison when she realized he was going to pretend that nothing had happened. She continued to work for Don for several months, but in the fourth episode of Season 4, his continual avoidance of the topic finally led her to resign after she burst into tears at a focus group. When she asked Don for a recommendation letter and he suggested she write a glowing reference on his letterhead and he would sign it (which she perceived as insensitive), she snapped, throwing a brass cigarette dispenser at him that noisily shattered a glass picture frame and storming out of the office in tears. When Megan later made a pass at Don, she reassured him that she wouldn't behave like Allison the next morning. Allison's last name was never mentioned in the show and remains unknown.\n\n=== Lou Avery ===\n'''Lou Avery''' ([[Allan Havey]]) is first introduced in Season 6 as a creative executive at rival agency Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, competing with Don Draper and Roger Sterling for the Chevrolet account.  When Don is placed on indefinite leave of absence from Sterling Cooper & Partners at the end of Season 6, Lou is brought in as a replacement creative director-for-hire on a two-year contract.  As Don is exiting the SC&P offices after being told of his suspension, he runs into Lou and Duck Phillips; it is implied that Phillips coordinated the deal to bring Lou into SC&P in his role as a head hunter.  In Season 7, it is shown that Lou brings a very different working method to SC&P: he is more interested in getting a large amount of creative work done on rigid deadlines and tight budgets. He is also not very creative or daring and is very old-fashioned.  This causes tension with Peggy Olson, who is used to spending a lot of time on one pitch at a time until a creative breakthrough produces unique work, and Lou makes a point of ignoring Peggy's ideas,  shunting aside her efforts, and treating her condescendingly.  The members of the creative team under him do not respect him and he becomes an object of open ridicule when someone discovers that he writes and illustrates his own unpublished cartoon, Scout's Honor, full of hackneyed themes and unamusing punchlines. Lou later becomes upset when the partners allow Don to come back to work in the creative department and report to him, possibly recognizing how much better Don is at the job than he is.  Lou finds Don's presence a distraction, and assigns Peggy as Don's direct supervisor. When he and Jim Cutler seek out a major cigarette deal (knowing that winning it would allow them to get rid of Don, due to his previous anti-tobacco ad in the ''New York Times''), Lou is first angry when Don screws up the pitch meeting, then left ruined when they lose the cigarette deal anyway.  Jim (who has no particular loyalty to Lou) makes it clear he doesn't care that Lou's background is in tobacco, since it is now useless, and that Lou isn't that important to the company, and that he regards Lou as essentially hired help. Not getting to share in the McCann payout windfall, Lou later emerges as the powerless director of the California office, where he openly ignores his work to keep trying to sell his planned \"Scout's Honor\" cartoon. He does sell the idea to a Japanese company and plans a move to Tokyo, and calls Don to taunt him about how happy he is to be living his dream; Don is first panicked and disbelieving when he thinks a loser like Lou had the news about the McCann merger before him, but when he realizes the truth, he just blankly and insincerely wishes Lou well as the call ends.\n\n=== Joey Baird ===\n'''Joey Baird''' ([[Matt Long]]) is a freelance artist for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, first seen at the start of the fourth season. Joey and Peggy seem to enjoy working together, reenacting the \"[[Stan Freberg|John and Marsha]]\" comedy skit<ref>{{cite news|journal=The Boston Globe|title=Mad about \u2018John & Marsha\u2019|author=Don Aucoin, Globe Staff |date= July 31, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2010/07/31/mad_about_john__marsha/}}</ref> in a workroom and laughing. However, Joey is also rather crude, acts entitled, frequently makes insensitive remarks, and engages in actions that would be classified as [[sexual harassment]] later in the century. Additionally, Joey misinterprets Harry Crane's friendly offer to help him get acting jobs and to go out for coffee as homosexual advances.\n\nJoey is also anti-authoritarian and, while disrespectful behind Don and Lane's backs as some other SCDP employees are, is (unlike them) openly defiant of Joan. Things come to a head in \"[[The Summer Man]]\", when Joey reveals she reminds him of his mother, who he says is \"a Joan\" at her job: he speaks contemptuously about and to Joan, alleging she got her job by having sex with men in the office because she lacks any skills of her own, calls her a \"madame\" and a \"Shanghai whore,\" tells her she walks around the office like she \"want[s] to get raped\", and draws a pornographic picture of Joan and Lane Pryce engaged in [[oral sex]] and tapes it to the glass door of her office. Joan's efforts to control and admonish Joey herself fail to accomplish anything and Joey escalates his insulting and defiant behavior. She attempts to have Don and Lane handle him, emphasizing the problems with his work while indirectly referencing his transgressions toward her. However, her attempts to indirectly deal with the situation fail. At first, Peggy's repeated efforts to confront his sexist attitudes are as his peer, but Joey brushes her aside.\n\nPeggy ultimately shows Don the obscene drawing and, at his suggestion, empowers herself by ordering Joey as his superior to apologize to Joan and fires the shocked freelancer when he refuses to comply. However, in the aftermath, Joan is angry at Peggy about the firing because she perceives it as Peggy acting in order to \"look important\" and causing Joan to look like a \"glorified secretary\" lacking power, respect, or authority, and needing Peggy to fight her battles for her.\n\n=== Jimmy and Bobbie Barrett ===\n'''Bobbie Barrett''' ([[Melinda McGraw]]) is the wife and manager of comedian '''Jimmy Barrett''' (born Jimmy Bernstein) ([[Patrick Fischler]]), an [[insult comedy|insult comic]] (reminiscent of [[Don Rickles]]) whom the firm uses in their advertisements for [[Utz Quality Foods, Inc.|Utz]] Potato Chips. After Jimmy insults the wife of Utz's owner about her weight, Don has to intercede and ends up meeting Bobbie, who shrugs off her husband's behavior. After that meeting, Bobbie seduces Don, though he initially resists as he wants to remain faithful to his marriage vows, despite his previous infidelities. When Bobbie later (in a ladies' lounge at [[Lut\u00e8ce (restaurant)|Lut\u00e8ce]], where they and the Schillings are meeting for the apology) tries to get Don to pay more for the apology as her husband's pay-or-play contract does not require it, Don grabs her hair with one hand and puts the other up her skirt, then threatens to ruin Jimmy if he does not apologize, and with no financial bonus. Bobbie appears to enjoy the dominating treatment, and quickly signals her husband to apologize. Later, she comes to Don with a TV pitch called \"Grin and Barrett\", a ''[[Candid Camera]]''-type show, featuring her husband using his insult comic skills as the host. Don helps her arrange things, and they continue to see each other on the side, until the two are in a car accident that requires a cover story.\n\nThe two resume their affair after a brief hiatus following the accident, but Don breaks it off completely and abruptly, when Bobbie reveals to him that she and other women with whom Don has had affairs have been discussing his prowess as a lover. Upset to learn that he has a \"reputation\" and annoyed at his inability to control Bobbie, Don leaves her during the middle of a sexual encounter, while she is tied up. Later, during a party where Don, Jimmy, and their spouses are in attendance, Jimmy reveals to Betty that Don and Bobbie have had an affair, and Jimmy also confronts Don and gloats about the trouble he has just unleashed for Don. Betty is humiliated by the revelation; though Betty may have suspected affairs in the past, Don's affair with Bobbie appears to be the only one Betty has actually been confronted about, leading to a period of separation for her and Don. Don later encounters Jimmy in an underground casino and delivers a solid punch to Jimmy's face, knocking him off his feet, which Jimmy later disparages as \"nothing\".\n\n=== Bob Benson ===\n'''Bob Benson''' ([[James Wolk]]) is a recurring character in [[Mad Men (season 6)|season 6]]. A new hire in Accounts, he answers to Ken Cosgrove, although no one recalls having hired him. Bob's overly eager and helpful demeanor irritates many in the office and is interpreted as [[sycophant]]ic by Don, Pete, and Ken. Bob engages in practices such as always buying an extra coffee so he has one to give to others, sending a catered deli platter to [[The Doorway|Roger's mother's wake]], as well as hanging out on the lower floor of the office (Accounts is on the upper floor), looking for people to talk to, and in the reception area of Accounts, trying to be seen and (unsuccessfully) to appear busy. While at first these activities annoy people, eventually they bear fruit and gain Bob a stronger place in the firm. Bob is also shown listening to an LP audiobook of [[Frank Bettger]]'s ''How I Raised Myself From Failure to Success in Selling'' (1949) and using similar language to inspire his friend, Michael Ginsberg.\n\nIn \"Man with a Plan\",  Bob tactfully assists Joan when she is in pain due to an [[ovarian cyst]] and, displaying an ability to think quickly and a willingness to lie, tells the nurse that Joan has just ingested poison, resulting in Joan's receiving treatment immediately after her abdominal pain alone had failed to result in any treatment. A grateful Joan prevents his lay-off after SCDP merges with CGC, and Bob is later seen accompanying Joan and Kevin to the beach. \n\nBased on a comment made by Joan, Bob assists Pete Campbell in getting an experienced nurse for his now-ailing mother. Later, Benson intervenes in an argument between Michael Ginsberg and Jim Cutler, taking Cutler's side; his subsequent apology to Cutler leads Cutler to assign Bob to handle the Manischewitz account and give Bob a foot in the door with the Chevy business (although Bob doesn't seem to realize this is part of Cutler's efforts to stage a coup within the merged firm). \n\nWhen Pete voices concerns to Bob that the nurse Bob recommended, Manolo Colon, may be sexually abusing his mother and taking advantage of her dementia, Bob says Manolo doesn't date women and then hints heavily at his own romantic feelings for Pete, which Pete, repulsed, rejects.\n\nWhen Ken is injured and the senior partners assign Bob to take the lead on the Chevy account, where he would potentially be working closely with Pete, an angered Pete threatens Bob and is astonished when Bob threatens him in turn. Bob is later shown venting in fluent Castillian Spanish on the phone to Manolo about Pete's threatening Bob's future and saying it doesn't matter how nice Pete's mother is.\n\nPete proceeds to hire Duck Phillips to find Bob another job. Instead, Duck uncovers Bob's secret: much like Don Draper, Bob's adopted an assumed identity to compensate for an embarrassing and impoverished past. None of his college references check out, he's from a poor area of West Virginia, and he was the manservant of a leader of a blue blood firm&mdash;not an employee of the firm itself in the accounts department, as he had implied. Moreover, his name is likely a false one. Pete immediately thinks to expose Bob, but, having learned from his experience trying to expose Don years earlier, decides to call a truce with Bob and lays out some ground rules to control Bob instead.\n\nBob appears shocked when Pete tells him Manolo (aka Marcos Constantine) apparently eloped with Pete's mother, and she has \"fallen\" overboard and become lost at sea under mysterious circumstances. Pete flatly rejects the concept that Bob wasn't in on the situation and proceeds to try and strong-arm him out of Chevy's good graces. Bob, maintaining his innocence in the Manolo situation, manipulates Pete into making a fool of himself at Chevy's headquarters, thereby securing his own position. Around the same time, Roger Sterling sees that Bob is spending time with Joan and giving Kevin gifts. Roger confronts Bob and threatens him about his relationship with Joan, which Bob replies to by insisting that he and Joan are just \"buddies\". Bob is later seen carving the turkey at Joan's Thanksgiving dinner, to Roger's surprise.\n\nIn season 7, Bob Benson reappears. He is called by a GM executive ([[Matthew Glave]]) asking to be bailed out of jail, having been arrested for offering to fellate an undercover police officer. The executive warns Bob that Chevy's advertising is going to become an in-house project, and SC&P is going to lose the account, but assures him not to worry, as Buick will hire him to work for them in Detroit. This prompts Bob to propose marriage to Joan, who turns him down, stating that they both deserve to be with people they love, not spending their lives in \"an arrangement\". When Bob explains that he needs a wife to assuage the GM executives, Joan learns about the losing of the account but neglects to inform Roger, who is at first incensed, until he realizes it will be a blow for Jim Cutler and one he won't be able to avoid.\n\n=== Glen Bishop ===\n'''Glen Bishop''' ([[Marten Holden Weiner]], son of series creator [[Matthew Weiner]]) is the son of Betty's neighbor, Helen Bishop. Aged 9 in Season 1 (1960), he develops a crush on Betty. One evening, when she is babysitting him, he purposely walks in on her while she is using the bathroom and looks at her for several seconds.  He then later asks for a lock of her hair. She acquiesces, and when Helen discovers it, she angrily confronts Betty in a supermarket, telling her he is just a \"little boy\", causing an offended Betty to slap Helen across the face. Betty immediately leaves the market, and while her friend Francine offers her support, she also reveals that the incident has become a topic of neighborhood gossip. In Season 2, episode 10, \"The Inheritance\", Betty discovers that Glen has run away and has been living in the Draper's backyard playhouse for several days. Glen's father wants Glen to live with him and his new wife and baby, but Glen dislikes his stepmother and says she is mean. He also says his mother is only interested in her boyfriends, and that Glen brushes his little sister's teeth and puts her to bed. Glen and Betty comfort each other because they are both lonely and miserable. He tells Betty that he is there to rescue her. He proposes that Betty elope with him, but she instead calls his mother, which leads him to tell her he hates her.\n\nHe returns in Season 4, working for his father at a Christmas tree lot, where he encounters Sally Draper and fixates on her as a replacement for Betty, bonding with her over their now-shared experience as children in divorced families. After discovering that Sally hates living in her house with her mother, Glen breaks in with a friend and vandalizes it, but leaves Sally's room untouched and leaves a secret gift on her bed. Glen often mentions age-inappropriate things to Sally about divorce and tries to encourage her to be secretive.\n\nBetty finds out about Glen's friendship with Sally and forbids him to see her, even going so far as to fire her housekeeper Carla when Carla allows Glen to see Sally one last time before they move to Rye. Betty is partly jealous of her daughter, but also aware of Glen's propensity for unsettling behavior.\n\nHowever, in Season 5, it is revealed that Glen still speaks to Sally regularly on the telephone from his dorm at the [[Hotchkiss School]], even going so far as to meet clandestinely in New York. Glen is unpopular at school and is frequently picked on, with the entire lacrosse team urinating in his locker. Though he encourages the boys at school to believe Sally is his girlfriend, with whom he has snuck off campus to have sex, Sally and Glen agree their relationship is closer to that of siblings. In season 6, he and Rolo, a friend from Hotchkiss, bring alcohol when visiting Sally and her student hosts at Miss Porter's School. When Rolo makes an unwanted pass at Sally, she tells Glen, who attacks Rolo and they briefly fight before leaving. \n\nIn Season 7, an 18-year-old Glen visits the Francis residence to tell Sally he has a new job as a soldier. He recently graduated basic training and is awaiting assignment to advanced school. His revelation that he has enlisted angers Sally, who condemns him for reversing his earlier stance on the [[Kent State shootings]]. Sally asks if he is going to Vietnam, to which Glen says it looks likely, but he has not yet gotten any orders. Later, Glen returns to the house and talks to Betty, revealing he flunked out of school and joined the military to appease his stepfather. Unlike Sally, Betty considers Glen brave for enlisting.\n\n=== Helen Bishop ===\n'''Helen Bishop''' ([[Darby Stanchfield]]) is one of the Drapers' neighbors. She is a liberal divorc\u00e9e with two children and a [[Mount Holyoke College]] graduate. Helen works in a jewelry store and volunteers for [[John F. Kennedy]]'s presidential campaign. Her divorce and habit of taking long walks have made her the subject of gossip for women in the neighborhood. A further rift develops between Helen and Betty Draper when the former discovers that Betty has given Helen's son Glen a lock of hair while babysitting him one evening. When Helen confronts Betty at the grocery store, Betty slaps her across the face. It is later discovered that Glen ran away from his home to stay in the Drapers' playhouse in the hopes of eloping with Betty; however, Betty calls Helen to retrieve her son, much to Glen's dismay. Betty later confides in Helen about her brief separation from Don, and the two seem to reach some kind of understanding. Later, Helen remarries and sends Glen to a boarding school at her new husband's request.\n\n=== Ida Blankenship ===\n'''Ida Blankenship''' ([[Randee Heller]]) is Bert Cooper's long-serving secretary. She remains an unseen character until the fourth season, when Joan assigns her to be Don's secretary as punishment to him for having seduced and then ignored his previous secretary, Allison, causing her to have a breakdown at the office. An older woman, Miss Blankenship has a tendency to annoy Don and his co-workers with her salty attitude and eccentric work performance, though having been a secretary for over 40 years, she is quite experienced. Her blunt and cantankerous demeanor starkly contrasts with those of her predecessors and the firm's other secretaries. However, she is exactly the type of secretary Don needs, as she is not overawed by him and won't have an affair with him, which is the reason Joan assigned her to him. However, it is mentioned by Bert and Roger that she was rather attractive many years ago. In his tape recordings for his autobiography, Roger reveals he'd had an affair with Miss Blankenship when he was a very young man at the firm, which caused a rift between Cooper and himself. Roger implies she was sexually adventurous and aggressive, referring to her as the \"Queen of Perversions\". She is absent from the office for a brief time while she has cataract surgery.  She dies, suddenly and unexpectedly, at her desk at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce in the [[The Beautiful Girls (Mad Men)|ninth episode of Season 4]], at the age of 67. Heartbroken over her death, Bert goes out of his way to make sure she has a nicely written obituary, stating: \"She was born in 1898 in a barn. She died on the 37th floor of a skyscraper. She's an astronaut.\" .\n\nActress Randee Heller states she created Blankenship's New York Jewish accent from the memory of her Yiddish-speaking grandparents.\n\n=== Richard Burghoff ===\n'''Richard Burghoff''' ([[Bruce Greenwood]]) is a wealthy real estate mogul who becomes romantically involved with Joan in Season 7. After meeting Joan while she is in Los Angeles for business, he talks her into a date, which leads to a romantic encounter. A recently divorced, semi-retired millionaire with two grown children, Richard is exhilarated to be free to do as he pleases.  He flies to New York on a whim and continues pursuing Joan. Their second date ends badly when he learns of the existence of her young son and becomes angry at the thought of Joan having commitments that will not allow her to pursue the kind of freewheeling lifestyle he envisions for himself. The next day, he shows up at Joan's office and apologizes, and they begin a relationship.\n\nJoan continues seeing Richard and he comforts her when she begins to have problems transitioning to work at McCann Erickson, offering semi-jokingly to have a sexist co-worker beaten up. After she quits McCann, Joan spends an increasing amount of time with Richard, flying to [[Key West]] for a getaway and trying cocaine together. However, when she begins to plan a new business venture of her own, Richard becomes angry that she does not share his desire for a responsibility-free life. When Joan refuses to choose between her career and her relationship with him, he ends their relationship without saying goodbye.\n\n=== \u00c9mile Calvet ===\n'''\u00c9mile Calvet''' ([[Ronald Guttman]]) is Megan Calvet's blunt and arrogant father. \u00c9mile is an academic, an atheist, and a Marxist, and does not approve of Don. In \"[[At the Codfish Ball]]\", it is revealed that he has written a book and Marie believes he is having an affair with his graduate teaching assistant. He, in turn, seems bitter toward his wife, accusing her of infidelity; he is much closer to Megan than to Marie and urges Megan to pursue her dreams. Megan is frustrated with his politics, however, particularly with the attitudes he expresses following the assassinations of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy.\n\n===Marie Calvet===\n'''Marie Calvet''' ([[Julia Ormond]]) is Megan's mother; she has other children and 10 grandchildren. Attractive, yet vain and prickly, Marie has a strained relationship with her husband \u00c9mile, as well as both Megan and Don, and dismisses Megan's wishes to become an actress, telling her the acting school shouldn't exploit the hopeless and \"not every little girl gets to do what she wants; the world cannot support that many ballerinas.\" Marie has a short affair with Roger Sterling in Season 5; Sally discovers her fellating Roger at Don's award dinner in \"[[At the Codfish Ball]]\". Later, Roger wants Marie to watch out for him while he takes LSD, but Marie tells Roger he is \"too old\" to take LSD and she does not want to be his support; she then leaves him, causing Roger to take his second acid trip alone.\n\nIn season 6, Marie and Arnie Rosen flirt mildly and Roger suggests she accompany him and the Drapers to a business dinner with the coarse, crude Herb Rennet and his irritating wife, Peaches. Roger stands them up and an unhappy Marie makes insulting remarks in French about Peaches to Megan. When Roger phones the house later that night to talk business with Don, Marie answers the phone, insults Roger, and hangs up on him twice.\n\nIn season 7's \"New Business\", Marie meets Megan in New York to collect Megan's remaining possessions from Don's apartment as a result of their forthcoming divorce. After Megan leaves early for a lunch date and asks Marie to supervise the movers, Marie has them empty the apartment, removing Don's possessions as well as Megan's. Marie and Roger also resume their affair, which Megan learns of accidentally. She remains in New York after Megan returns to California, her marriage to \u00c9mile having apparently ended, as Roger notes in \"Time & Life\" that he is on his way to meet her for a date. By the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|final episode of season 7]], she and Roger have become a married couple and spend their honeymoon in France.\n\n=== Andrew and Dorothy Campbell ===\n'''Andrew Campbell''' ([[Christopher Allport]]) is Pete Campbell's father. He disapproves of Pete's profession and treats him with contempt. In [[Mad Men (season 2)|Season 2]], Andrew dies in the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 1]]; it is revealed that he has squandered his wife's fortune and family's inheritance on a lavish lifestyle and by donating large sums of money to [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] and the [[New York Botanical Garden|Botanical Garden]] to maintain the appearance that he is wealthy.\n\n'''Dorothy \"Dot\" Dyckman Campbell''' (Channing Chase) is Pete's somewhat detached mother who comes from a prominent New York City family. Pete hates his mother and jokes with his brother Bud about it, mentioning Hitchcock's [[Rope (film)|''Rope'']]. Dorothy greatly disapproves of Pete and Trudy's exploration into adoption, referring to orphans as \"someone else's discards\" and saying she will disinherit him if he adopts a child. Insulted, Pete reveals the truth about the family's fortunes to his mother, leaving her stunned. By Season 6 she suffers extensive memory lapses and is diagnosed with some form of dementia.  When Bud foists her upon Pete, he is upset and annoyed with the situation, and resorts to exploiting her illness to keep her under control. Pete eventually hires Manolo, a Spanish nurse recommended to him by Bob Benson. Manolo initially works out quite well, but Dorothy begins implying that they are involved in a satisfying sexual relationship. Pete fires Manolo for sexually assaulting his mother, much to Dorothy's fury. Bob tells Peter that Manolo is gay, leaving it ambiguous as to what is actually happening. In the season finale it is revealed Dorothy married Manolo on a cruise ship and later \"fell\" overboard, implying Manolo married her to receive her (non-existent) riches and pushed her from the ship. Pete and Bud accept that it would be too expensive to pursue justice against Manolo, telling each other that \"she's in the water, with Father,\" and \"she loved the sea.\"\n\n=== Bud and Judy Campbell ===\n'''Andrew \"Bud\" Campbell, Jr.''' (Rich Hutchman) and '''Judy''' (Miranda Lilley) are Pete's elder brother and sister-in-law. Bud is an accountant and is the strongly favored child of their parents &mdash;it is understood that he alone will inherit his father's fortune. It is further shown when following her husband's death, Dorothy Campbell refers to her sons as \"salt and pepper\". After the death of their father in \"[[Flight 1 (Mad Men)|Flight 1]]\", Bud reveals to Pete the precarious financial state their father created and arranges for the liquidation of their mother's assets so that she can live comfortably. Bud tells Pete that he and Judy have no plans to have children, and he lets slip to their mother Pete and Trudy's exploration of adoption. In Season 6, Bud is angry when Pete selects a third party investment bank to take SCDP public rather than involving his business. In the episode \"In Care Of\", Bud and Pete tacitly agree to not pursue a potentially costly investigation of Manolo Colon, after learning he had eloped with their mother, who disappeared off the cruise ship on which they were honeymooning.\n\n=== Tammy Campbell ===\n'''Tamsin \"Tammy\" Vogel Campbell''' is Pete and Trudy's only child. Tammy was born sometime between September 7 and 10, 1965, right after Labor Day weekend, after a long and difficult labor. The couple, who had difficulty conceiving, had consulted a fertility specialist and disagreed about whether or not to adopt, before Trudy's pregnancy was revealed in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Rejected (Mad Men)|The Rejected]]\" when Trudy's father accidentally spilled the beans by telling Pete that Trudy was pregnant; in the same conversation, Tom said he would give Pete $1,000 if the baby were a boy, and $500 if it were a girl. She is named a feminine variation of Thomas, after her maternal grandfather.\n\nUnbeknownst to Trudy, Tammy is not Pete's only child, as he fathered an unnamed baby boy in November 1960 with Peggy Olson, whom she placed up for adoption.\n\n=== Trudy Campbell ===\n'''Gertrude \"Trudy\" Campbell''' (n\u00e9e '''Vogel'''; [[Alison Brie]]) is Pete Campbell's wife. She met Pete when they were both in college (Pete was at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] while Trudy attended [[Mount Holyoke College]].),  Trudy and Pete marry early in Season 1 and purchase an apartment on [[Park Avenue]], with the help of Trudy's parents. Trudy is dutiful to her husband, even when he asks her to visit an old beau to get a short story published. In Season 2, she expresses her desire to have a child, a desire Pete resists as he does not want to have children yet, unaware he already conceived a child with Peggy Olson. After discovering she has [[infertility|fertility problems]], Trudy wants to adopt a baby, but Pete balks. In Season 3, Trudy and Pete have a closer relationship than they did before and seem to work together as a team, though Pete blackmails a neighbor's au pair into having sex with him when Trudy is away on her summer vacation with her parents. This leads to the distraught au pair confessing the situation to her host father, who then threatens Pete. In turn, Pete tells Trudy she should never leave him for a long time, implying that it was her absence that led to him forcing an unwilling teen to have sex with him. In Season 4, Trudy becomes pregnant, a fact that Pete uses to secure the [[Vicks|Vicks Chemical]] account for the firm from his father-in-law, Tom Vogel. Later in the season, Trudy gives birth to a daughter, whom they name Tammy. In season 5, the couple has relocated to [[Cos Cob, Connecticut]], against the wishes of Pete, who prefers living in Manhattan, and while Trudy settles in as a suburban housewife, Pete experiences angst and insecurity, eventually having a brief affair with Beth Dawes ([[Alexis Bledel]]), the wife of a fellow commuter. Following an encounter with Beth's husband, Pete desires a [[pied-\u00e0-terre]] in Manhattan that he can use for affairs, though he tells Trudy he needs it for late nights at work. Trudy is reluctant at first, but finally agrees to let him have a bachelor pad in Manhattan, ostensibly for safety purposes but aware of the real reason. In Season 6, Pete has a sexual liaison with their neighbor, Brenda. Trudy is infuriated; she knew Pete would cheat on her but she expected him to be discreet and keep his affairs in Manhattan. She orders Pete to leave the house, though she refuses to admit defeat by divorcing him. Over the next several months, Pete visits and she gradually begins to accept him back, but she ends it again after Pete tells her that both he and her father have been frequenting the same brothel in Midtown (Tom had previously withdrawn the Vicks accounts, banking on the fact that Trudy would believe him over Pete). While she is polite to Pete when he says goodbye to her and Tammy before his move to Los Angeles at the end of Season 6, she responds forcefully when Pete hypocritically snaps at her for staying out late on a date in Season 7, stating that Pete is \"no longer a part of this family.\" She reluctantly asks Pete for help when their daughter is denied admission at a prestigious preschool and opens up to him about how she is lonely and feels unattractive, leading Pete to compliment her and part on cordial terms. In the penultimate episode, Pete is offered a job in Wichita and asks Trudy for reconciliation and come with him. Trudy refuses at first, admitting she still loves him but cannot forget his adultery. However, Pete insists and Trudy agrees, and the two rekindle their marriage. They are last seen with Tammy as they board a flight to Wichita.\n\n=== Carla ===\n'''Carla''' ([[Deborah Lacey]]) is a black woman who has worked as housekeeper for the Draper household since Sally's birth. Carla is shown to be the true maternal influence in Sally and Bobby's lives and is seen watching the children for extended periods of time, such as when Betty dashes off to Nevada with Henry to seek a quick divorce from Don. Throughout the first three seasons, Carla tries to offer marital advice to Betty. She continues to work for Betty after the latter divorces Don and marries Henry Francis, until being fired for allowing Glen Bishop to visit Sally. Carla later telephones Henry for a reference because Betty would not give her a written one for her job search. Though her character is often on the show's periphery, Carla has far more insight into the issues surrounding Don and Betty's marriage than perhaps anyone else. A silent critic of the couple's behavior, it is apparent that Carla recognizes how Don and Betty's relationship is affecting the development of their children.\n\n===Caroline===\n'''Caroline''' ([[Beth Hall]]) is Roger Sterling's longtime secretary, first appearing in Season 4's \"[[Christmas Comes But Once a Year (Mad Men)|Christmas Comes But Once a Year]]\". She is very well liked by nearly everyone at SCDP and is extremely loyal to Roger, being apparently close enough to him that she is able to speak her mind to him when she feels he is out of line. She is also close to Roger's family, becoming very upset when she learns of [[The Doorway|Roger's mother's passing]]. Of the secretaries at SCDP, she seems to be the one closest to Joan.\n\n=== Dawn Chambers ===\n'''Dawn Chambers''' ([[Teyonah Parris]]) becomes Don Draper's new secretary in Season 5. She is the only black employee at SCDP, hired after [[A Little Kiss|the firm places an \"equal opportunity employer\" ad in a stunt]] against rival firm [[Young and Rubicam|Y&R]]. She is befriended by Peggy Olson in the fourth episode of Season 5, \"[[Mystery Date (Mad Men)|Mystery Date]]\", after Peggy lets Dawn stay with her when she discovers Dawn has been sleeping in Don's office due to concerns of racial tensions near Dawn's apartment in Harlem. Dawn proves herself competent at her job and develops a good working relationship with Don. In the Season 6 episode \"To Have and to Hold,\" Joan reprimands Dawn for covering for Harry Crane's secretary by punching her out five hours after the secretary had already left the building. Dawn becomes panicked by the accusation, as she feels she is perpetually at risk of being fired, and she proposes that Joan dock her pay. Quietly impressed and unable to fire Dawn without causing issues for the firm, Joan \"punishes\" Dawn by putting her in charge of the stockroom and time cards. Little is initially known about Dawn, but in \"To Have and to Hold\", it is revealed, through a conversation with her best friend, that she feels lonely and alienated as the only black employee at SCDP and, due to her long hours there, she has little opportunity to date. She also comments on SCDP's dysfunctional work environment, where many people are mean to each other and women cry in the bathroom. In season 6's \"The Flood,\" Don and Joan, largely untouched by the struggles of the Civil Rights Movement, connect with the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King by empathizing with Dawn over the tragedy. Dawn seems bewildered by Joan's sympathetic hug and insists on remaining at work when Joan and Don suggest she go home. In season 7's \"A Day's Work\", Dawn is shown paying secret visits to Don's home to keep him apprised of the office activities while Don is on mandatory leave. Don's replacement, Lou Avery, demands that Joan assign him a new secretary due to her loyalty to Don. In the same episode, Joan decides to surrender her personnel management duties, and chooses Dawn to take over from her, a decision which also neatly resolves Lou and Bert Cooper's concerns about Dawn. Later episodes show Dawn conducting her new duties with aplomb, straining her relationship with Don.\n\nShe is last seen during season 7 episode \"Time & Life\" as her future following the absorption of SCDP into McCann is not revealed.\n\n=== Toni Charles ===\n'''Toni Charles''' ([[Naturi Naughton]]) is a black [[Playboy Bunny]] with whom Lane Pryce has an extramarital affair in Season 4, after his wife Rebecca and their son return to England. Lane seems to genuinely be in love with her, but their relationship comes to an abrupt end when Lane's father forces him to return to England and reconcile with Rebecca.\n\n=== Clara ===\n'''Clara''' ([[Alexandra Ella]]) is Pete Campbell's secretary, first appearing during Season 3. She is well regarded and remains professional and unfazed by Pete's frequent angry outbursts and verbal abuse, which are often directed toward her.\n\n===Manolo Colon===\n'''Manolo Colon''' (aka '''Marcus Constantine''') ([[Andres Faucher]]) is a con-artist associate of Bob Benson's whom Bob convinces Pete Campbell to hire in Season 6 as a personal nurse to Campbell's mother, Dorothy, after she begins to show signs of dementia. He is fired by Campbell after being suspected of sexually abusing Dorothy but remains in contact with her. They eventually marry on a cruise ship before he murders her by throwing her overboard in hopes of inheriting her wealth, which, unbeknownst to him (and, presumably, Bob), had been depleted by her late husband.\n\n=== Cynthia Cosgrove ===\n'''Cynthia Cosgrove''' ([[Larisa Oleynik]]) (n\u00e9e Baxter) is Ken Cosgrove's wife and the daughter of '''Ed''' ([[Ray Wise]]), the CEO of Corning. Cynthia is a New York society girl, who appears to have moved in the same Manhattan social circles as the presumably older Trudy Campbell, with whom she gets along well.  Ken calls Cynthia \"his life\" and does not want to use her or his future father-in-law to get business, claiming in Season 4 that he does not want to be like Pete Campbell. In the [[A Little Kiss|Season 5 premiere]], her character is listed during the credits as Cynthia Cosgrove, implying she and Ken were married between the fourth and fifth seasons. Cynthia appears as a background character in several episodes of Season 5. She is very supportive of Ken's work and his side hobby as an author. She and Ken live in [[Jackson Heights, Queens]]. In the third episode of Season 7, it is revealed that Cynthia and Ken now have an infant son, Edward.\n\n=== Jennifer Crane ===\n'''Jennifer Crane''' ([[Laura Regan]]) is Harry Crane's wife. Blonde and charismatic, Jennifer has the peculiarity of being a \"working wife\", at least until Season 3, holding a position as a supervisor at AT&T. She's from a working-class environment, which has helped her keep her husband grounded. Solitary and generous, Jennifer has often tried to \"fit in\" with the more sophisticated circle of people surrounding Harry's workplace and has an unspoken rivalry of sorts with Trudy Campbell. She briefly threw Harry out of the house when he confessed to having a one-night stand with one of the secretaries, Hildy, but the two soon reconciled. She and Harry are parents to a daughter, Beatrice Grace, born in 1962. Sometime between the fifth and sixth seasons, they have twin sons, Nathan and Steven. They later split up.\n\n=== Jim Cutler ===\n'''Jim Cutler''' ([[Harry Hamlin]]) is a partner at the (once) rival firm, Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough and a senior partner at the merged Sterling Cooper & Partners. He first appears in the sixth episode of Season 5, \"[[Far Away Places (Mad Men)|Far Away Places]]\". He is the equivalent of [[Roger Sterling]] at CGC and Peggy describes him as \"just like Roger but with bad breath.\" Cutler is usually courteous and mild-mannered, which belies his impatience and tendency for childlike escapades.\n\nOn one account, he brought his doctor to the newly merged SCDP-CGC office to give everyone a shot of \"super vitamins\" to help with their working over the weekend for Chevy. Instead of making everyone productive, the booster shot only made Cutler and Stan Rizzo hyperactive, and causes Don to fade in and out of consciousness. He also brought Frank Gleason's daughter Wendy to the office that weekend, shortly after her father's funeral, and later peeked on Stan and Wendy having sex.\n\nHe was part of the CGC team that was supposed to present to Chevy and vocally opposed the merger of SCDP and CGC, unless it would win them the account. In the Season 6 episode \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" it appeared as if Cutler still opposed the merger, resentful of his loss of absolute control in the office and feeling disrespected by Michael Ginsberg and annoyed by Bob Benson's constant meddling. He then assigns Bob Benson to Chevy in open defiance of Don and Roger. Ted Chaough, having noticed this, chided Cutler for dividing the firm. As a sort of peace offering and tactical move, Ted and Jim proposed a new name for the merged firms: Sterling Cooper & Partners, removing any partner name from CGC as a sign of goodwill and cooperation.\n\nCutler supports Don's suspension at the end of Season 6 and is openly opposed to his reinstatement, desiring to morph SC&P into a more technologically-driven marketing agency. When Roger negotiates the acquisition of SC&P by McCann-Erickson, Cutler is initially opposed, but eventually concedes, realizing the amount of money his share in the agency will bring him. In Season 7, his status is clarified by Roger, who confirms that Cutler took the cash payoff and retired from the company.\n\nCutler is a veteran of the [[Army Air Force]] and mentions that he participated in the [[Bombing of Dresden]] in February, 1945.\n\n=== Dale ===\n'''Dale''' (Mark Kelly) is a copywriter. He first appears in Episode 2 of Season 1 (\"[[Ladies Room (Mad Men)|Ladies Room]]\"), and reappears in Episode 1 of Season Two (\"[[For Those Who Think Young (Mad Men)|For Those Who Think Young]]\"), Episode 6 of Season 3 (\"[[Guy Walks into an Advertising Agency]]\"), and Episode 11 of Season 5 (\"[[The Other Woman (Mad Men)|The Other Woman]]\").\n\n=== Midge Daniels ===\n'''Midge Daniels''' ([[Rosemarie DeWitt]]) is an art illustrator engaged in an affair with Don Draper in Season 1. She is involved with [[Beat generation|beatniks]] and several proto-[[hippie]]s, smokes [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and makes several references to [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]]. It appears Midge has other lovers besides Don. When Don realizes she's in love with Roy, one of her beatnik friends, through a Polaroid he takes of the two, he ends their affair in \"[[The Hobo Code]]\" and gives her the bonus he received at work. She reappears in the Season 4 episode \"[[Blowing Smoke (Mad Men)|Blowing Smoke]]\" where she runs into Don at his office building, claiming to be there for a business meeting for her paintings. After inviting him back to her apartment to meet her husband, it is revealed that Midge tracked Don down to try and coax him into giving them money to fuel their heroin addiction, as well as to buy one of her paintings. Initially writing them a check for $300 for one of her paintings out of pity, Don instead gives Midge $120 in cash he had in his wallet following advances made by Midge and leaves with one of her paintings.\n\n=== Anna Draper ===\n'''Anna M. Draper''' ([[Melinda Page Hamilton]]) is the widow of the real Don Draper, the man whose identity Dick Whitman stole after Don's death during the Korean War. She has a noticeable limp as a result of polio and a sister named Patty (Susan Leslie), in whom the real Don Draper was interested before he married Anna. Anna tracks down Dick/Don while he is working as a used car salesman and confronts him about her husband. Dick/Don tells her he died, and despite the circumstances of their meeting, Don and Anna become close friends: he buys her a house in California, Anna often serves as an understanding confidante to Don, and he stays with her whenever he is in [[Los Angeles]]. When Don meets Betty, he gets a \"divorce\" from Anna in order to marry Betty. Don pays Anna another visit during a trip to California during the Season 4 episode \"[[The Good News (Mad Men)|The Good News]]\", during which she has a broken leg. Anna's sister Patty and college-aged niece Stephanie ([[Caity Lotz]]) are also staying with Anna during Don's visit to help care for Anna. After dinner out with Anna and Stephanie, Don attempts to make a move on Stephanie, who turns him down and informs him that Anna has terminal bone cancer, which devastates Don, and that Anna does not know about her diagnosis. Don angrily confronts Patty about this, offering to pay for any possible cancer treatments, but Patty tells him that she has consulted several doctors and confirmed that Anna's cancer is terminal, and asks that Don leave before he can inadvertently tell Anna about her cancer. Don agrees to leave but stays long enough to paint over Anna's water-stained wall, which Anna decorates with a painting of a flower and is signed \"Dick + Anna '64\" by Don. Later, in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Suitcase]]\", Don repeatedly avoids returning calls from Stephanie, falling asleep and dreaming of an apparition of Anna smiling and holding a suitcase. When he awakens the next morning, he finally returns Stephanie's call and learns that Anna had died the night before, and breaks down in front of Peggy Olson. Don later brings his children to Anna's house in the [[Tomorrowland (Mad Men)|finale of Season 4]], showing them the wall they had painted and introducing them to Stephanie, who gives Don Anna's engagement ring from the real Don Draper. It is Anna's death that then inspires Don to start a new life.\n\n=== Gene Draper ===\n'''Eugene Scott \"Gene\" Draper''' (Evan Londo) is Don and Betty Draper's youngest child. He was born during Season 3, on June 21, 1963, and is named after Betty's late father, [[List of Mad Men characters#Gene Hofstadt|Gene Hofstadt]]. His sister, Sally, first thinks that Gene is a reincarnation of their grandfather, as he is born shortly after their grandfather dies and is given the same room their grandfather had lived in, and is terrified of him, but she eventually grows to love her brother after Don comforts Sally and tells her that Gene is a baby and nobody knows who he is going to be yet. He speaks his first line in the [[A Little Kiss|premiere of Season 5]] (\u201cGood night, Daddy\u201d) and his second and last line in the penultimate episode of the series (\u201cNo\u201d).\n\n=== Abe Drexler ===\n'''Abe Drexler''' ([[Charlie Hofheimer]]) is Peggy Olson's boyfriend, beginning in Season 4. Abe, who is Jewish, is a freelance journalist with strongly expressed liberal/leftist political views.  He and Peggy first meet at a loft party in a sweatshop.  Another meeting is engineered by their mutual friend Joyce Ramsay, where Abe's progressive views on race, combined with his mild sexist attitude, rub Peggy the wrong way. When he brings her a piece he wrote condemning the capitalist attitudes of Wall Street, which names some of the firms with which Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce is contracted, Peggy loses her temper with Abe. In spite of this, they later reconcile and become a couple. In Season 5, Abe asks Peggy to move in together which, after some contemplation and Joan's encouragement, Peggy accepts. Despite some problems (including criticism from Peggy's mother, who objects both to the fact that Abe is not Catholic, as well as the fact that Peggy has chosen to live with a man to whom she is not married), they settle into a life together, eventually purchasing a run-down building on the Upper West Side midway through Season 6, which they renovate and live in. However, Abe proves incompetent at home repair, has far too lax of an attitude towards the crime in the neighborhood, and never tells the tenants to behave or be quiet, much to the chagrin of Peggy. He also refuses to identify a group of teenagers who stabbed him at the train station and instead turns it into an issue about race, further angering Peggy. Peggy and Abe become increasingly frustrated with the different directions their lives are taking, and after a serious incident in which Peggy accidentally stabs him, Abe ends the relationship.\n\n=== Suzanne Farrell ===\n'''Suzanne Farrell''' ([[Abigail Spencer]]) is Sally Draper's third grade teacher at the beginning of Season 3. She engages in an extended period of flirtation with Don, and they eventually enter into a sexual relationship after Sally has moved on to the next grade. She lives in an apartment above the garage of a single-family, detached house. Her younger brother, '''Danny''' ([[Marshall Allman]]), suffers from epileptic seizures and as a result has become something of a drifter, unable to keep a job for very long. At the end of Season 3, Don signals a desire to strengthen his and Suzanne's relationship, but his plans are scuttled when Betty unexpectedly returns home from a vacation and confronts Don about his past. She is not seen again and is the last person with whom Don has an affair while married to Betty.\n\n=== Lee Garner, Jr. ===\n'''Lee Garner, Jr.''' (Darren Pettie), is an executive at [[Lucky Strike]], a cigarette company with a very long relationship with Sterling Cooper that began with Roger's father. Boorish, bossy, boozy, and sexually predatory to both women and (secretly) men, Lee's behavior is accepted because his father runs Lucky Strike, which represents the lion's share of Sterling Cooper's business.\n\nIn Season 3, Lee Garner, Jr., sexually propositions Sal Romano, only to be rebuffed by the still-closeted man. Not taking the rejection lightly, Garner, Jr., uses his clout to have Sal fired from Sterling Cooper. As Don explains to Sal after Roger fires him, \"Lucky Strike can shut off our lights\" and the agency could thus not risk losing the account by defending Sal.<ref name=\"Wee Small Hours\">[http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men/episodes/season-3/wee-small-hours#episode-details-149 Mad Men - Wee Small Hours \u2013 AMC]. Amctv.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-23.</ref>\n\nGarner, in Season 4, invites himself to the SCDP 1964 Christmas party, forcing the company to overstep its tight budget in order to make the party a grander affair for their most important client. At the party, Garner gropes female employees and further humiliates Roger by forcing him to dress up in a Santa suit. Several months later, Garner abruptly informs Roger Sterling that Lucky Strike will be ending their business with SCDP, by going to [[BBDO]], sending the agency into crisis.\n\n===Lee Garner, Sr. ===\n'''Lee Garner, Sr.''' ([[John Cullum]]) is an executive at [[Lucky Strike]], a cigarette company with a very long relationship with Sterling Cooper. A proud, no-nonsense man in his seventies, he and Bert Cooper go way back. He eventually turns executive power over to his son due to health issues.\n\n=== Father Gill ===\n'''Father John Gill''' ([[Colin Hanks]]) is a young [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] in a visiting ministry at the church Peggy's family attends in [[Brooklyn]]. He first appears in the Season 2 episode \"[[Mad Men (season 2)#Episodes|Three Sundays]]\". The fact that he is a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit priest]] is indicated by the \"S.J.\" after his name on church bulletins in the same episode. He asks Peggy for advice about public speaking and advertising church events such as a youth dance after learning about her employment in advertising, and changes the style of his Palm Sunday sermon to include more colloquialisms and be more accessible to his congregation after listening to Peggy's criticisms; he later gives her a copy of the sermon. He learns about Peggy's pregnancy during the confession of Peggy's sister, Anita, and he appears to take an interest in bringing Peggy more fully into the church community. His progressiveness manifests itself at the end of \"[[Mad Men (season 2)#Episodes)|A Night to Remember]]\", when he pulls out a guitar and begins to sing a [[American folk music revival|folk]]-[[gospel music|gospel]] song. He subtly indicates to Peggy that he would hear her confession if she wished, stating that \"no sin is too great for God.\" Additionally, he expresses a desire for her to receive the [[Eucharist]]. However, Peggy is uncertain how involved she wishes to become in the church community and in the Catholic faith, although she appreciates Father Gill's friendship. Their relationship is a bit strained by the fact that Anita's confession, including the particulars of Peggy's pregnancy, was based on a mistaken assumption about the identity of the child's father. Peggy later confides to Don that her whole family believes he was the father because Don was the only non-family member to visit her in the hospital.\n\n=== Francine Hanson ===\n'''Francine Hanson''' ([[Anne Dudek]]) is one of Betty Draper's closest friends and neighbors in the first four seasons, before Betty moves from Ossining. Francine spends many afternoons gossiping with Betty about the neighborhood's newest resident, divorc\u00e9e Helen Bishop. Francine, who is married to Carlton Hanson, has a son named Ernie and is pregnant in Season 1, giving birth to a baby girl named Jessica. Francine confides to Betty that she thinks Carlton is having an affair. The clues\u2014secret phone calls to Manhattan and the fact that Carlton sleeps at the [[Waldorf Astoria|Waldorf]] two nights a week\u2014make her wish she could just poison him. Even Don is uncomfortable with Carlton, who confides his attraction to Jessica's young babysitter. By Season 2 the couple has reconciled somewhat; Carlton appears to have gained weight, and the insinuation is that food has become a substitute for womanizing. After Betty and her family leave Ossining, Francine appears only once, meeting Betty for lunch in the Season 7 episode \"Field Trip\", by which time she is working as a travel agent in [[Dobbs Ferry]].\n\n=== Brooks Stanford Hargrove ===\n'''Brooks Hargrove''' (Derek Ray) is the dutiful husband of [[Roger Sterling]]'s daughter Margaret.  They were married on November 23, 1963, the day after [[John Kennedy]] was assassinated. In the [[The Doorway|Season 6 premiere]], following Roger's mother's memorial service, Margaret asks her father to invest in Brooks' [[refrigerator car]] technology venture. Later in the season, she withdraws her Thanksgiving invitation because Roger declines to invest. In Season 7, Margaret abandons Brooks and their son Ellery to live in a commune in upstate New York. He is last seen watching the TV broadcast of the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing alongside Ellery, Roger, and Mona.\n\n=== Greg Harris ===\n'''Dr. Greg Harris''' ([[Samuel Page]]) is Joan's ex-husband, as of Season 5. During his engagement to Joan in Season 2, she brings him with her to Sterling Cooper to close up, at which time, feeling threatened by Joan's rapport with Roger, he rapes her on the floor of Don's office. After failing to become chief surgical resident because his brown-nosing and entitlement do not make up for his sub par surgical skills, he whines at length to Joan and insults her, and she smashes a vase over his skull. Greg later decides to join the Army, which is desperate for surgeons, not believing he may be shipped to the front line in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. He does not consult Joan prior to enlisting, but before leaving for basic training he states his desire to start a family. After basic training, Greg is sent directly to Vietnam. While there, he learns that Joan is pregnant, but is unaware that Roger Sterling is the father.\n\nIn Season 5, Greg returns from his initial deployment and is overjoyed to meet his new \"son\" Kevin, but tells Joan that he has been ordered to return to Vietnam for another year. However, at a homecoming dinner with Joan's mother and Greg's parents, it becomes clear that Greg volunteered to return, contrary to what he told Joan, preferring the status and respect his rank confers to being with his family. Joan is furious that he lied to her and made such an important decision without her, and tells him to leave and not come back.  When he tells her the army makes him feel like a \"good man\", she tells him he was never a good man, implicitly referencing the rape.  He storms out, and a few months later serves Joan with divorce papers at the office, humiliating and infuriating her.\n\nIt is revealed in the series finale that, following his divorce from Joan, Greg remarried and had twins with a nurse. He also disowned Kevin and refused to be involved in his upbringing in any way, despite still having no idea that Kevin is not his biological son.\n\n=== Conrad Hilton ===\n'''[[Conrad Hilton|Conrad \"Connie\" Hilton]]''' ([[Chelcie Ross]]) is the fictional portrayal of the real founder of the [[Hilton Hotels]] chain, one of the only times the show has portrayed historical personages in person. He first meets Don Draper, who initially presumes Conrad is a bartender, at a country club where Don is a guest at Roger Sterling's [[Kentucky Derby]] party and Connie is a guest at a wedding reception. They share their hardscrabble beginnings and laugh about Don's urinating in the trunks of fancy clients' cars at the roadhouse where he had worked as a valet.<ref>{{cite news|title=Parking Vs. Pop Culture: \u2018Mad Men\u2019|authors= Isaiah Mouw and Ben Bronsink|date=May 2011|journal=Parking today|url=http://www.parkingtoday.com/articledetails.php?id=1041}}</ref> Connie later seeks out Don's help with an advertising campaign, and thus becomes a Sterling Cooper client. Hilton is depicted as a demanding client and difficult to please; he is known to call Don during the middle of the night and to show up in Don's office unannounced. After sending Don to numerous Hilton properties throughout the country, Connie flies Don to meet him at the Hilton property in Rome, with Betty joining at the last minute to help put the property through its paces. Connie is behind Sterling Cooper's forcing Don to sign an employment contract with the agency.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alan Sepinwall|journal=What's Alan Watching?|date=September 27, 2009|title=Mad Men, \"Seven Twenty Three\": Looking at the sun burned my eyes out, now I'm blind|url=http://sepinwall.blogspot.com/2009/09/mad-men-seven-twenty-three-looking-at.html}}</ref> Don begins to see Connie as something of a father figure whom Don seeks to impress, but Connie is ultimately unsatisfied with Don's work. At the end of Season 3 he gives Don the heads-up that Putnam, Powell & Lowe, Sterling Cooper's parent agency, will be bought by McCann-Erickson. The two part ways vowing to try working again in the future, but Hilton never returns to the show even after the founding of the SCDP.\n\n=== Gene Hofstadt ===\n'''Eugene \"Gene\" Hofstadt''' ([[Ryan Cutrona]]) is Betty's elderly father, who does not approve of Don. A businessman of some kind in the [[Philadelphia]] area, and a veteran of [[World War I]], he first appeared in Season 1 when, several months after his wife's death, he began dating another woman, Gloria Massey, upsetting Betty. He married Gloria sometime between November 1960 and April 1962. In 1962, Gene suffered a series of strokes that left him with slowed facilities and short-term memory loss. He becomes repeatedly \"confused\", believing himself to be back in the army or in the midst of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]; he once even fondled his daughter Betty, when he mistook her for his late wife.  He also becomes more openly critical of Don, berating him in front of others and accusing him of not appreciating Betty; Don later tells Betty that he and Gene have a kind of mutual hatred for each other. His declining health eventually leads to Gloria's leaving him in early 1963 and his coming to live with the Drapers, at Don's urging, in the Season 3 episode \"Love Among the Ruins\". He becomes especially close with his granddaughter, Sally Draper, before dying of a final stroke in June 1963 in the Season 3 episode \"The Arrangements\", shortly before his youngest grandchild is born. Betty names her new son \"Gene\" in honor of her late father.\n\n=== William and Judy Hofstadt ===\n'''William Hofstadt''' ([[Eric Ladin]]) is Betty Draper's younger brother. He and his wife '''Judy''' ([[Megan Henning]]) have three daughters. William and Betty disagree over the disposition of their father's house, since Betty does not want William to live there nor inherit the house, as well as arguing over how their father will be cared for as his health deteriorates. Although William is shown to be jealous of his father favoring Betty as a child, Judy seems to be a warm and kind caregiver for Gene. Don and Betty share a dislike of William and Judy for their selfishness and inability to control their unruly children.\n\nIn the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series finale]], despite Betty's strained relationship with William and Judy, she feels they should raise Bobby and Gene after she dies from lung cancer. While Don initially insists on retaking custody of his sons, and Sally believes that Henry is capable of raising the two boys alone, Betty opines that William and Judy look after them, as this will ensure the presence of a mother figure in their lives.\n\n=== Hollis ===\n'''Hollis''' (La Monde Byrd) is the black elevator operator in the Sterling Cooper building on Madison Avenue. He occasionally interacts with the Sterling Cooper staff. During the Season 1 episode \"[[Red in the Face]]\", Don pays Hollis to pretend the elevator is out of service in order to force Roger to climb the 23 flights of stairs to the office after an excessive lunch of oysters and martinis. Roger, having made the stairs, then meets the representatives of Richard Nixon's 1960 Presidential campaign in reception but vomits up his lunch on the floor due to the strain. He realizes that Don has exacted his revenge for making a pass at Betty, with Hollis's assistance.\n\nHis skin color becomes important on a number of occasions. In the Season 3 episode \"[[The Fog (Mad Men)|The Fog]]\", Pete tries to engage him in conversation about the product preferences of black people (for television brands), which Hollis is either uninterested in or sees as inappropriate. Pete however continues to push him by stopping the elevator and forcing Hollis to talk about the subject, knowing that Admiral television sets seem to sell well in \"Negro markets\". Hollis, while initially intimidated, is quick to respond to the issue of race, stating that, \"We have bigger things to think about than TV\". Pete is remorseful, but Hollis remains hardened.\n\nPaul, too, addresses Hollis in an uncharacteristically familiar fashion, ostentatiously introducing Hollis to Paul's black girlfriend, Sheila, and telling Hollis to call him \"Paul\" instead of \"Mr. Kinsey\" in the Season 2 episode \"The Inheritance\".  On the day that [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s death is announced in the Season 2 episode \"Six Month Leave\", Hollis expresses sympathy for her ex-husband [[Joe DiMaggio]], in contrast to many of Sterling Cooper's female characters who mourn Marilyn's loss, and male characters (such as Roger), who appear emotionally unaffected.\n\n===Gail Holloway===\n'''Gail Holloway''' ([[Christine Estabrook]]) is Joan's mother, who comes to stay with Joan after Joan's son Kevin is born. She first appears in the Season 5 premiere \"[[A Little Kiss]]\" and remains as a recurring character through much of the season; she again appears in numerous Season 6 episodes, beginning with \"To Have and to Hold\", as well as the Season 7 episode \"The Strategy\". Gail is supportive of Joan, but their relationship is somewhat tense. She does not understand why Joan would want to return to work, thinking she should instead be content to be a full-time wife and mother, and she makes several disparaging comments to that effect.  Joan, in turn, makes several references suggesting that Gail may have a drinking problem. Gail strikes up a flirtation with the apartment building's handyman, Apollo, of which Joan disapproves, until Apollo's wife forbids him to go to their apartment. Gail remains with Joan after Joan throws Greg out, but continues to be condescending about her daughter's job and failed marriage. She also frequently manipulates Joan's dependency on her to get her own way. In the Season 6 episode \"To Have and to Hold\", Gail surprises her daughter when she tells Joan's childhood friend Kate she is proud of her daughter having become a partner at a Madison Avenue firm. In \"Man with a Plan\", Gail advises Joan to accept Bob Benson's friendship (and possibly more), as not every act of kindness is a front.  Gail remained with Joan, though mostly off-camera during the second half of Season 7, continuing to look at after Kevin while Joan worked to establish her new company, Harris & Holloway; she appeared briefly in the series finale \"[[Person to Person (Mad Men)|Person to Person]]\", taking Kevin out to the park while Joan worked from home.\n\n=== John Hooker ===\n'''John Hooker''' ([[Ryan Cartwright]]), an Englishman, is Lane Pryce's assistant during Season 3. His title is \"secretary\", but he insists his status is higher than that of the other secretaries at Sterling Cooper, telling Joan, \"I'm Mr. Pryce's right arm; I'm not his typist.\" To this end, he asks that the switchboard operators address him as \"Mr. Hooker\" rather than just \"John\". He assumes Joan's position as office manager after her departure to become a housewife. A variety of Sterling Cooper employees refer to John as \"[[Miss Moneypenny|Moneypenny]]\", much to his chagrin.  His officious, self-important manner annoys nearly everyone in the office, particularly Joan and including Lane and Rebecca Pryce, who call him a \"toad\".  When the primary partners abandon the company to form Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, John is left to deal with the Putnam, Powell & Lowe executives, who are infuriated.\n\n===Mack Johnson===\n'''Mack Johnson''' (Morgan Rusler) is Dick and Adam Whitman's father figure following Archie's death, whom Don called \"Uncle Mack.\" In the aftermath of Archie's death, the Whitmans lost the family farm, and a pregnant Abigail Whitman took Dick to live with Mack and his wife, her sister. He first appears in the Season 1 episode \"[[Babylon (Mad Men)|Babylon]]\", in which Don flashes back to his brother's birth. In Season 6, it was revealed that Mack was the [[pimp]] of a brothel in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]]. In the Season 6 finale, Don attempts to be more honest about his life and shows his children where he grew up. While Abigail was cruel and spiteful to Dick, Mack was described as being nice to him. However, he is shown to not intervene on Dick's behalf in stopping Abigail's abusive treatment. According to Adam, Mack died shortly after Abigail's death from stomach cancer.\n\n=== Joy ===\n'''Joy''' ([[Laura Ramsey]]) is a young woman Don meets in California in the Season 2 episode, \"[[Mad Men (season 2)#ep24|The Jet Set]]\", for whom he impulsively abandons Pete and his business obligations.  She belongs to a group of wealthy, sexually liberal, bohemian tax exiles who live lavishly and travel from place to place but display no work ethic or means of support. Both Joy and her father seem attracted to Don. One of their entourage is a \"Doctor Feelgood\" type, whom Don fends off to avoid receiving an injection of an unknown substance, after Don collapses by the pool and comes to on Joy's couch. When Don asks Joy about a book she is reading, she explains she had enrolled in a literature class while staying in Rhode Island, but \"it was not for [her]\". During a late night skinny dip with Joy, Don meets her brother, who is estranged from his wife, and his children, who are roughly the same ages as Don's, and Don offers them his and Joy's bedroom. Though enticed to join the group in their travels, Don declines.\n\n=== Edna Keener ===\n'''Dr. Edna Keener''' (Patricia Bethune) is a child psychiatrist whom Betty takes Sally to see when her behavior at home becomes too much for Betty to handle. Betty also has short sessions with Dr. Edna, ostensibly to discuss Sally, though Betty uses them to discuss her own psychiatric issues. After making progress with Sally, Dr. Edna recommends reducing Sally's number of sessions per week, to which Betty objects. Dr. Edna suggests that Betty seek some psychiatric help with an adult psychiatrist, but Betty elliptically convinces Dr. Edna to continue reserving time for Betty to \"discuss Sally's progress\" with her in the Season 4 episode \"[[Blowing Smoke (Mad Men)|Blowing Smoke]]\".\n\n=== Gloria Massey ===\n'''Gloria Hofstadt''', n\u00e9e '''Massey''' (Darcy Shean), is Gene Hofstadt's second wife, whom her stepchildren Betty and William despise. Gloria tries to hide the extent of Gene's illness in Season 2. In Season 3, Gloria is not seen, but Betty's brother William discovers that Gloria, unable to deal with Gene's deteriorating condition and overall difficult demeanor, has left him and moved to [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]].\n\n=== John Mathis ===\n'''John \"Johnny\" Mathis''' ([[Trevor Einhorn]]) is a copywriter at Sterling, Cooper & Partners, appearing in Seasons 6 and 7. Defensive about his work, he endangers an account with [[Peter Pan (peanut butter)|Peter Pan]] by interrupting a meeting. Late in Season 7, he goes to Don for help in putting together a difficult pitch, but when he tries to copy Don's off-the-cuff style and it goes disastrously wrong, he furiously blames Don for his failure and snarls that Don only gets by on looks, and makes an ugly reference to Lee Garner Jr. being sexually attracted to Don. In response, Don tells Mathis to own his failures and garbage-mouth and then fires him, leading a defiant Mathis to sneer that he was right about not apologizing to Don.\n\n=== Guy MacKendrick ===\n\n'''Guy MacKendrick''' ([[Jamie Thomas King]]) is a confident, handsome, charismatic accounts executive of London-based advertising firm Putnam, Powell, and Lowe. A [[Cambridge University]] and [[London School of Economics]] graduate, he was brought in by PPL to take over the Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency. St. John Powell and Harold Ford expressed much enthusiasm for him. During the office party held in the Season 3 episode \"[[Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency]]\", Lois Sadler accidentally runs over MacKendrick's foot with a John Deere riding lawnmower. Joan Holloway saves his life by quickly placing a tourniquet on his leg; however he ultimately loses his foot. Because of this disfigurement, Powell and Ford decide that MacKendrick has no future with the firm and is fired. \n\n===Carol McCardy===\n'''Carol McCardy''' ([[Kate Norby]]) works at a literary agency and is Joan Holloway's roommate in Season 1. One night, she musters the courage to confess to Joan that she has loved her since they met the first week in college, but Joan pretends to ignore her romantic advances in favor of not spoiling their friendship.  She has moved out by the beginning of the Season 2 and is not referred to again.\n\n===Daisy McClusky===\n'''Daisy McClusky''' ([[Danielle Panabaker]]) is a stewardess for [[Northwest Airlines]]. She has recurring sexual relationship with Roger Sterling in Season 6 and notifies him when potential clients are on her flights, even detaining those clients until Roger arrives. Daisy's assistance has its limits, however, as she will not do anything that actually harms business, such as bump SCDP's rivals from her flights altogether. However, she does arrange for the luggage of rival admen to be temporarily \"lost\".\n\n=== Meredith ===\n'''Meredith''' ([[Stephanie Drake]]) is a secretary who first appears as SCDP's receptionist during Season 5. Her infantile mannerisms and scatterbrained demeanor annoy Joan, and the two eventually have an altercation in the Season 5 episode \"[[Christmas Waltz (Mad Men)|The Christmas Waltz]]\", after Meredith allows a process server into the office to serve Joan with divorce papers. She remains at SCDP, however, and briefly becomes Lou Avery's secretary after he complains about Dawn's continued loyalty to Don who was on involuntary leave from the agency. She becomes Don's secretary when he returns, and then when Don vanishes, she becomes one of two secretaries for Roger and moves with him to McCann-Erickson. She is let go by Roger in the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series finale]], as Don had not returned to work and two secretaries for Roger was unnecessary. She is optimistic even as she is let go as she claims \"there are better places than (McCann-Erickson).\"\n\n=== Faye Miller ===\n'''Dr. Faye Miller''' ([[Cara Buono]]) is a psychologist and freelance consultant who provides market research for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. She meets Don the day of the 1964 office Christmas party in the Season 4 episode \"[[Christmas Comes But Once a Year (Mad Men)|Christmas Comes But Once a Year]]\", and seems to immediately have multiple insights into Don's true character. She is a tough and independent \"modern woman\" whom Peggy admires.  Although she wears a wedding ring, she admits to Don this is merely a ruse to ward off unwanted advances. She later shares that her father, \"a handsome, two-bit gangster like [Don]\", owns a candy store and has friends and \"obligations\" connected to the mob. Don, after initially denigrating her approach to advertising and overhearing her lambaste an estranged lover on the phone, during which she reveals she does not cook and does not want to clean up after him, takes an interest in her. Eventually, the two embark on a secret romantic relationship, during which time Don expresses admiration for her work. When Sally stows away on a train and a stranger brings her to Don's office, Faye reveals her discomfort with children and, although Sally liked her, her fear that she'd failed some test, as a result. Don later confides to Faye about his past as Dick Whitman and his fears the security clearance investigation Pete's defense industry client has ordered will expose and ruin him, to which Faye advises him to face the problem and come clean. Faye severs ties with SCDP after Don submits a full-page ad to ''The New York Times'' saying SCDP will no longer work with tobacco companies, as her firm continues to do so.  He also convinces her to put her ethics aside and breach the \"Chinese wall\" to use her connections to try to get his struggling firm meetings with clients; her partner secures a meeting with a tobacco company, which falls through, and she secures a meeting with Heinz Beans, for whose advertising campaign Megan Calvet Draper and Peggy Olson ultimately win a Clio Award.  While in a relationship with Faye, he begins a relationship with Megan, then impulsively becomes engaged to her, leading to him breaking off his relationship with Faye, who is older, more worldly, and more accomplished professionally but lacks Megan's rapport with Don's children and whose insights into Don's character Don finds unsettling.  Faye is extremely upset by the news and tells Don he \"only like[s] the beginnings of things\".\n\n\n===Katherine Olson===\n'''Katherine Olson''' ([[Myra Turley]]) is Peggy and Anita's mother. Peggy's relationship with her mother is strained, as Katherine does not understand Peggy's focus on her career rather than on finding a husband and has not forgiven her daughter for having a child out of wedlock. Old-fashioned and harsh, she disapproves of Peggy's decisions to move to Manhattan and later, to live with Abe. Not so much because of their religious differences, rather her nihilistic view that Abe's relationship with Peggy is merely practice for the real family he will someday have with someone else. She harshly tells her daughter that loneliness is no excuse for shacking up and to simply buy a series of cats for companionship until she dies. A devout Catholic, Katherine is vocally critical of Father Gill's style of preaching and informal grace at dinner during the Season 2 episode \"Three Sundays\".\n\n=== Burt Peterson ===\n'''Burt Peterson''' ([[Michael Gaston]]) is Head of Accounts at Sterling Cooper until 1963, when Roger Sterling fires him in the Season 3 premier \"[[Mad Men (season 3)|Out of Town]]\" at Lane Pryce's instigation. Peterson reacts very negatively as he had recently been struggling with his wife's cancer treatments, which had caused PPL to delay firing him and lulling him into a false sense of security since he had survived the various waves of firings. He bursts out in an angry tantrum after his firing, sweeping the items on people's desks onto the floor, breaking them, and then throwing things around his own office, to the sounds of many crashes. At some point later, he becomes employed by CGC. When SCDP and CGC merge, he is again fired by Roger in the Season 6 episode \"[[Mad Men (season 6)|Man With a Plan]]\".  Roger takes great pleasure in firing Burt again, due to the bridge-burning way Burt behaved the last time he was fired. Duck Phillips later tells Pete Campbell that he used his new job as a headhunter to find Burt a Senior Vice President position at the high-powered McCann Erickson advertising agency.\n\n=== Duck Phillips ===\n'''Herman \"Duck\" Phillips''' ([[Mark Moses]]) was director of account services for a time at Sterling Cooper. In the Season 1 episode \"[[Indian Summer (Mad Men)|Indian Summer]]\", when Don Draper is made partner in the wake of Roger Sterling's heart attack, Bert Cooper gives Draper the authority to appoint a new head of account services. At the end of the Season 1, Draper brings in Phillips, who is looking for a job after alcoholism and an extramarital affair ended his career at [[Young & Rubicam|Y&R]]'s [[London]] office. Phillips appears to be a recovering alcoholic whose ex-wife and children are moving on with their lives. Phillips immediately challenges Sterling Cooper to broaden their clientele, seeking to attract airlines, automobile manufacturers, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nAt the beginning of Season 2, Phillips pushes the agency to hire younger creative talent, a move Draper resists. He also pushes Cooper to pursue [[American Airlines]] in the wake of that airline's very public [[American Airlines Flight 1|Flight 1 plane crash]], forcing Draper to break his word and cut loose a client, [[Mohawk Airlines]], in order to pursue the larger American Airlines. This event is emblematic of the subsequent relationship between the two: despite the fact that he risked Pete Campbell's revealing his true identity to get Duck hired, Don clashes with Duck throughout the season, as Don's belief in loyalty to both clients and employees is at odds with Duck's pragmatic and utilitarian approach to business. He also continues to struggle to stay sober, going so far as to abandon his family's dog, which his children have left with him after moving to a different state, to avoid painful memories. At the end of Season 2, frustrated with his failure to make partner, Phillips goes to some of his former London colleagues to arrange a merger of Sterling Cooper with the British firm Putnam, Powell & Lowe, which wants to establish a New York office. The merger is successful, but one of the PP&L executives, St. John Powell goads Duck into drinking alcohol to seal the deal, breaking his sobriety. Phillips is named president of Sterling Cooper, but he embarrasses himself in a drunken rant when Draper announces his intention to leave the firm, securing his own dismissal.\n\nDuring Season 3, it is revealed Duck, apparently sober once more, is now working at [[Grey Global Group|Grey]], another New York agency. He tries unsuccessfully to poach Pete and Peggy from Sterling Cooper, which leads to a sexual relationship with Peggy. They are in bed together when they learn of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination on November 22, 1963.\n\nHe later resurfaces in the Season 4 episode \"[[Waldorf Stories]]\" at the [[Clio Awards]] Show where he drunkenly heckles the man giving the introductory speech, prompting security to remove him. Upon witnessing this, Sterling jokes: \"I miss working with that guy\". During  the Season 4 episode \"[[The Suitcase]]\", Duck unsuccessfully tries to branch out on his own after being fired from Grey, attempting to create his own female consumer products-based ad agency. He goes so far as to try to hire Peggy as Creative Director, sending her business cards with her name and title on them. It becomes clear that he is desperate both personally and career-wise and needs Peggy for both reasons, and she refuses to go along with it. During a late night at SCDP, Peggy catches a drunk Duck spitefully trying to defecate on Roger Sterling's sofa chair, mistaking it for Don's. While Peggy is walking Duck out, a drunk Don catches him in the offices. Don confronts him, and he and Duck get into a brief and comical brawl, which Duck wins. Duck states he is a former [[United States Marine]] officer and served in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] during [[World War II]], claiming to have killed \"17 men\" during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. Peggy escorts Duck out, later telling Don she turned to Duck because she was having a \"confusing time.\"\n\nIn Season 6, a sober Duck reappears as an independent headhunter for various advertising agencies, with whom Harry Crane recommends to Pete that he meet. Duck explains to Pete that the merger between SCDP and CGC has left confusion in the management structure, which has left Pete's role unclear and therefore it is difficult for Duck to find prominent positions for Pete in New York. He tells Pete how he turned his life around by concentrating on his family life, so that he had something to give himself pride when he hit rock bottom. He advises Pete to concentrate on managing his own family life in order to help manage his professional career, and that if he does better for himself at the newly merged company, Duck can find better positions for him in New York.\n\nPete later asks for Duck's help in getting rid of Bob Benson, hiring Duck to find Bob a position at another agency. Duck asks Pete if the agency is in need of another account man, but Pete makes it clear that Duck's previous antagonism with Don will prevent the firm from hiring him. Duck eventually discovers that \"Bob Benson\" is an alias, and that the man's entire identity is fabricated, with the only prior job on record under Bob's name being that of a manservant to an executive at another agency. Pete had not realized this because no one at SCDP had ever bothered to check any of Bob's references.\n\nIn the Season 6 finale, Duck Phillips is seen entering SC&P with Lou Avery, Don's eventual replacement as Creative Director, just after Don is told to take a few months leave. Duck and Lou meet Don as Don is on his way out of the building. Despite their antagonistic history, Duck apologizes to Don for arriving before Don had left.\n\nDuck returns in the penultimate episode of Season 7 \"The Milk and Honey Route\" to successfully recruit Pete to Learjet. He is depicted as a determined, if slightly desperate, headhunter who is drinking excessively again, or has possibly used his drunken persona to extract empathy from Pete.\n\n=== Phoebe ===\n'''Phoebe''' ([[Nora Zehetner]]) is a nurse who lives down the hall from Don Draper's Greenwich Village apartment. She invites Don to her Christmas party and, later, when she finds him unsteadily trying to unlock his apartment door, she helps him to bed and fends off a pass from him. She confides that her father was also an alcoholic. Don hires her to watch Sally and Bobby one evening, when he is out with Bethany Van Nuys. Unfortunately, Sally cuts her own hair while on Phoebe's watch, angering Don, who has to deal with the aftermath from Betty.\n\n=== St. John Powell ===\n'''St. John Powell''' ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) is the managing director of London-based advertising firm Putnam, Powell, and Lowe (\"PPL\"). In Season 2, Duck Phillips meets with Powell and Alec Martin, first to ask for a job,  and then, when that is rejected, to propose that PPL buy out Sterling Cooper. At that meeting, Powell goads Duck into drinking alcohol, breaking Duck's sobriety. Powell eventually makes an offer that is accepted. At the end of Season 2, Powell and Martin witness Duck's drunken rant against Don, which results in Duck being pushed out of Sterling Cooper. Powell is the architect of PPL's sale to [[McCann Erickson]], keeping the information from Lane Pryce and the rest of the Sterling Cooper staff. After Pryce fires Roger, Bertram Cooper, and Don in order to void the non-compete clauses in their contracts and allow them to start their own agency and bring Pryce along as a fourth partner, a furious Powell fires Pryce for \"lack of character\" in the Season 3 finale \"[[Shut the Door. Have a Seat.]]\", playing right into Pryce's hands.\n\n=== Rebecca Pryce ===\n'''Rebecca Pryce''' ([[Embeth Davidtz]]) is Lane Pryce's wife of 18 years. Born to an upperclass British family, she's stylish and polite, though a bit snobbish and self-involved. She follows Lane to New York in Season 3 but suffers the strain of [[culture shock]], and by Season 4 she returns to London, with their son, Nigel, in tow. After a brief separation, and Lane's infidelity with a black [[Playboy Bunny]], they apparently smooth over their problems, and Rebecca moves back to New York to reconcile. She is stunned by his suicide and combines her genuine grief over losing him and the general contempt she viewed him with when she angrily tells an apologetic Don that SCDP is at fault because they filled \"a man like that with ambition\". She also astutely realizes the US$50,000 check Don gives her, reimbursing Lane's partnership fee, is worth less than Lane's contributions to the firm, although she's not aware that SCDP actually got over $200,000 from insurance that covered them in case any of the partners died, about which Don does not inform her.\n\n=== Robert Pryce ===\n'''Robert Pryce''' ([[W. Morgan Sheppard]]) is Lane Pryce's stern father. Originally from a middle class British background, he is a retired surgical equipment supplier. He has a complicated love/hate relationship with his son, whom he dominates, sometimes by physically violent means, in order to make him \"take action and sort his problems\" so as to \"put his house in order\". Lane once described him to Don as \"one of those alcoholics that thinks he's collecting.\"\n\n=== Joyce Ramsay ===\n'''Joyce Ramsay''' ([[Zosia Mamet]]) works as an assistant photo editor at ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in the [[Time-Life Building]], where Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce is located. Peggy meets her in the elevator in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Rejected (Mad Men)|The Rejected]]\" and the two quickly become friends; Joyce introduces Peggy to the counter-culture scene of the early 1960s. Joyce is a lesbian and hangs out with a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] crowd, introducing Peggy to her eventual boyfriend [[List of Mad Men characters#|Abe Drexler]] at a [[loft]] party in a [[sweatshop]].  She later engineers a meeting between Abe and Peggy; although the meeting ends badly, Peggy remains friends with Joyce. That summer, Joyce reunites Abe and Peggy by giving both a ride home from the beach in Joyce's crowded car.\n\n===Anita Olson Respola and Gerry Respola===\n'''Anita Olson Respola''' ([[Audrey Wasilewski]]) is Peggy's older sister. She is married to '''Gerry Respola''' (Jerry O'Donnell), who has a bad back, and has three young children. The youngest baby was born soon after Peggy's illegitimate child with Pete Campbell. Anita is sometimes judgmental and harsh, like her mother, and shares Katherine's anger about Peggy's pregnancy, although she is supportive of Peggy when Katherine reacts badly to news of Peggy's move to Manhattan. Anita reveals Peggy's secret to Father Gill while taking confession, out of anger at her sister's ability to move on.\n\n===Arnold Rosen===\nDr. '''Arnold \"Arnie\" Rosen''' ([[Brian Markinson]]) is Sylvia's husband and Mitchell's father. He is a cardiac surgeon who lives in Don and Megan's building. Affable and conscientious, he and Don establish a relatively close friendship. When Arnie is trapped in Washington, DC, during the riots following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a visibly distressed Don, who is having an affair with Arnie's wife Sylvia, tries to reach him several times. Arnold quits his job in New York when his hospital nixes plans for him to perform a revolutionary, life-saving cardiac transplant. He is also a staunch patriot, but acknowledges America's shaky status in the world during the late '60s. He references the [[Tet Offensive]] in Vietnam and the capture of the {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} by North Korea as the result of America not taking its enemies seriously, and cites Fidel Castro as the original example. He is a quietly heroic man, departing in the middle of the night on cross-country skis during a blizzard on New Year's Eve to get to his hospital to perform emergency surgery. At the same time, his wife Sylvia feels he takes her for granted.\n\n===Mitchell Rosen===\n'''Mitchell Rosen''' (Hudson Thames) is Arnold and Sylvia's son. He attends college in Michigan and is studying overseas in Paris during the 1968 student riots. When he [[Draft-card burning|rips up and sends back his draft card]], he seems certain to be drafted, but Don arranges with Ted to get Mitchell into the [[New York Air National Guard]] to avoid him being sent to Vietnam.\n\n===Sylvia Rosen===\n'''Sylvia Rosen''' ([[Linda Cardellini]]) is Arnie's wife, Mitchell's doting mother, and Don's mistress for much of Season 6. She is Italian, a plumber's daughter, and a housewife who, unlike Megan, affects visible displays of her Catholicism (wearing a Catholic crucifix and displaying Catholic icons in her bedroom), although her husband is implied to be Jewish. Sylvia is strong-willed, unhappy, and intelligent, and like Don, expresses interest in ending their liaison eventually. She is also friendly with Megan; this relationship significantly contributes to her ending her affair with Don, after she dreams that he died in a plane crash and she had to comfort Megan at the funeral. Don is heartbroken after Sylvia breaks it off, but she reminds him that he was happy with Megan once and can be so again. Nevertheless, Don becomes obsessed with Sylvia and of thinking of ways to get her back. In the Season 6 episode \"The Crash\", while all of SCDP has been injected with a stimulant so they can work through the night to come up with work for Chevy, Don works feverishly too, but it turns out he's focused only on thinking of an inspiration to get Sylvia back, not with inspiration for Chevy. Elements of Sylvia's physical appearance, such as her brunette hair and a facial mole, and her wearing a headwrap and kimono remind Don of his stepmother Abigail and of the maternal prostitute, Aim\u00e9e Swenson, who forcibly initiated his first sexual act when he was a young teen.\n\nWhen Don arranges with Ted to get Mitchell into the National Guard to avoid going to Vietnam, Sylvia is overcome by the favor and falls back into bed with Don, but Don's adolescent daughter Sally walks in on them. Sylvia reacts vehemently with guilt as Don runs after Sally. She is last seen with her husband in Season 7, having reconciled with Arnie and ended her relationship with Don.\n\n=== Freddy Rumsen ===\n'''Frederick \"Freddy\" C. Rumsen''' ([[Joel Murray]]) is a copywriter at Sterling Cooper. He is the first in the office to notice Peggy Olson's talent for copywriting while working on an ad campaign for Belle Jolie, and brings her to Don's attention, ultimately leading to her being offered a copywriting job herself. Older than the other copywriters (his eldest daughter turns 30 in Season 2, and he served in [[World War II]]), he is a well-loved, lighthearted, and friendly staple of the office who can often be found doing things like playing [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] pieces on his pants zipper. However, he is an alcoholic and drinks unusually heavily at work even by Sterling Cooper standards. This ends up costing him his job in the Season 2 episode \"Six Month Leave\" when, after having too much to drink, he wets his pants and falls asleep shortly before he is supposed to deliver a pitch to [[Samsonite]]. Peggy delivers the pitch instead, and Pete reports the episode to Duck Phillips, who proceeds to report this to Sterling. Rumsen is fired, to Peggy's anger as she felt some loyalty to Freddy because of his earlier assistance to her, despite the fact that his departure secured her a promotion to senior copywriter. Don and Roger take Freddy out for a night on the town to ease the sting of his departure from the agency. They also tell him he is being sent on \"six months' leave,\" though they really mean that he will be fired. This decision represents a major power play by Duck Phillips, as firing members of the Creative staff should have been Don's decision. It also teaches Peggy a valuable lesson: she needs to let Don know ahead of time about these things, so he won't be blindsided in meetings later.\n\nIn the Season 4 episode \"[[The Rejected (Mad Men)|The Rejected]]\", a 16-months sober Rumsen returns to work for SCDP on a freelance basis, having left [[J. Walter Thompson]] and bringing with him [[Pond's Creams|Pond's Cold Cream]], a $2 million account courtesy of another AA member at Ponds being in control of the account. His only condition for coming back is that Pete not be allowed near the account. He is now sober and a sponsor in [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], which puts him at odds with his coworkers' penchant for heavy drinking. When he returns, his old-fashioned ways are pronounced and Peggy very harshly confronts him about how he needs to adapt to the times. The confrontation is painful for Freddy but the two mend fences and become close again. In Season 5, Freddy, recognizing that Peggy cannot rise any further within the company, discreetly begins making job inquiries for her, as his freelance work allows him to interact with many of the advertising agencies on Madison Avenue. This leads Peggy to meet with [[List of Mad Men characters#Ted Chaough|Ted Chaough]], who hires her.\n\nAs of the Season 7 premiere, Freddy is still freelancing for the now-Sterling Cooper & Partners (SC&P), while also serving as a conduit for Don's ideas while Don is under suspension from the firm. Don eventually returns to SC&P and hits bottom at work, drinking more heavily than ever, ignoring assignments he thinks are beneath him and putting his job at risk. After an incident where he is forced to smuggle a drunk Don, who has been forbidden from drinking at work, out of SC&P offices, Freddy finally tells Don to pull himself together. Freddy points out that Don would be worse off without a job and that he'll have to earn his way back into SC&P's good graces, telling him \"Do the work, Don\". Don seems to take Freddy's words to heart, doing his assignments without complaint and behaving more professionally at work for the remainder of his time at SC&P.\n\n=== Lois Sadler ===\n'''Lois Sadler''' ([[Crista Flanagan]]) is a switchboard operator in Season 1 who has a crush on Sal Romano based on his phone conversations and voice. In Season 2, she has become Don's secretary but is depicted as being incompetent; Don eventually fires her for embarrassing him. By the end of Season 2, she is back on the switchboard and gives Harry, Paul, and Ken information about the upcoming merger that she has overheard in telephone conversations. In Season 3, she is Paul's secretary. In the episode \"[[Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency]]\", she accidentally runs over the foot of Guy MacKendrick, a British executive who was poised to replace Lane Pryce as head of Sterling Cooper, while drunkenly riding a lawn mower during an office party. Miraculously, she was not fired after this, as she was seen rousing a drunken Paul.\n\n=== Scarlet ===\n'''Scarlet''' ([[Sadie Alexandru]]) is Harry Crane's secretary, first appearing in Season 5.  In spite of her slightly ditsy personality she is nonetheless competent, and Harry values her loyalty to him, as well as her rather sycophantic demeanor toward him, enough that he intervenes when Joan attempts to fire her after she commits time card fraud, which causes a serious rift between Harry and Joan. A romantic relationship is hinted at between Scarlet and Harry, especially when Peggy later requests a new secretary and Joan replies that, \"Scarlet and Harry are practically married.\"\n\n=== Shirley ===\n'''Shirley''' (Sola Bamis) is the only other black employee at SC&P, aside from Dawn. Though they are quite different, she and Dawn are often mistaken for one another by the employees of SC&P, leading to their own inside joke of referring to the other by their own name. Shirley is originally on Peggy's desk at the beginning of Season 7, but after confusion with Peggy over Valentine's Day flowers sent to Shirley by her fianc\u00e9, Peggy demands that Joan move her. Shirley becomes Lou Avery's secretary for the remainder of his time at SCDP. She later becomes Roger's second secretary, when his workload becomes too much for Caroline to handle by herself. She is last seen in the Season 7 episode \"Lost Horizon\", telling Roger that she has found another job as a secretary at a [[publishing house]], and won't be moving with them to McCann, and that \"some people don't feel welcome in advertising\".\n\n=== Danny Siegel ===\n'''Danny Siegel''' ([[Danny Strong]]) is Jane Sterling's cousin, for whom Roger Sterling arranges an interview at SCDP in the Season 4 \"[[Waldorf Stories]]\". Don and Peggy find his book laughable and decide not to hire him. However, during a pitch meeting for [[Life (cereal)|Life]] cereal, Don inadvertently uses one of Danny's ideas, which ends up being a big hit. The clients had arrived unexpectedly while Don and a few other SCDP people were at the [[Clio Awards|Clios]], celebrating and drinking after receiving an award, so Don rushed back to the office to make a presentation, despite how drunk he was. When the clients don't like his original pitch, he starts pitching random ideas off the top of his head, and the one that the clients like is from Danny's book. Peggy later calls Don out on what he did and persuades him to make things right, so he brings Danny in to pay for his idea. Unfortunately, Danny is more interested in employment than being paid for one idea, so Don ends up hiring him. Danny ends up generally fitting in well with the rest of the younger staffers, though he remains somewhat clueless. Danny is one of the first people let go from SCDP after it loses the [[Lucky Strike]] account, and Don and Peggy are visibly upset when they have to fire him in the Season 4 episode \"[[Blowing Smoke (Mad Men)|Blowing Smoke]]\". However, he takes the news gracefully and thanks them for the opportunity they'd given him.  Danny reappears in the Season 6 episode \"A Tale of Two Cities\", by which time he has become a major movie producer with a hippie persona who prefers to be called \"Daniel J. Siegel\" whom Don and Roger run into at a party they'd been brought to by Harry. At first Danny seems genuinely friendly, but when Roger is gleefully rude and demeaning to him, tries to pick up Danny's much taller hippie date, Lotus, and implies that he would enjoy hurting Danny, Danny smiles a bit and then punches Roger in the testicles, leaving his former boss doubled over in pain as Danny walks away with Lotus in tow.\n\n=== \"Smitty\" Smith and Kurt Smith ===\n'''\"Smitty\" Smith''' ([[Patrick Cavanaugh]]) and '''Kurt Smith''' (Edin Gali) are a young copywriter/art director team hired by Don at the beginning of Season 2. \"Smitty\" is an American, and often has to explain the complexities of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] to the European Kurt. They always work together. Kurt is a fan of [[Bob Dylan]]'s and arranges to take Peggy to a concert. Kurt is also openly [[homosexuality|gay]], which causes quite a stir in the office when he casually reveals as much in the breakroom and quickly dispels the assumption that he is pursuing a romantic relationship with Peggy. Peggy, who had been romantically interested in him, is forced to give the impression that she knew all along and that she is more liberal than she really is. After complaining to Kurt that she always picks the wrong guys, he advises Peggy to adopt a trendier appearance and provides her with a new trademark hairstyle. Smitty is known to indulge in smoking [[marijuana]], as does Paul Kinsey. When SCDP is formed, the partners do not ask Smitty or Kurt to come with them. Later, Smitty is seen working for rival advertising company CGC in Season 4, implying that Kurt is working there as well; a few of the many Don Draper cast-offs that Ted Chaough hires. He speaks glowingly of Don Draper when asked to describe him, which makes Ted envious. In the Season 3 episode \"[[My Old Kentucky Home (Mad Men)|My Old Kentucky Home]]\", Smitty tells Peggy he is a graduate of the [[University of Michigan]]. He is last seen working at CGC in Season 5.\n\n=== Jane Sterling ===\n'''Jane Sterling''' (n\u00e9e '''Siegel''') ([[Peyton List (actress born 1986)|Peyton List]]) begins as a secretary at Sterling Cooper; she is assigned to Don in Season 2 and quickly becomes a magnet for her male colleagues. As she confided to Roger in the Season 2 episode \"The Gold Violin\", she previously shopped at [[S. Klein|Klein's]] and, to Roger's amusement, lived on Jane Street.\n\nJane clashes frequently with Joan and is about to be fired when she successfully seeks Roger's intervention on her behalf. Shortly afterward, she begins an affair with Roger and he leaves his family for her. He quickly proposes out of the blue one morning in the Season 2 episode \"[[Mad Men (season 2)#ep24|The Jet Set]]\"; she accepts, and by the start of Season 3, she and Roger are married. Their marriage in Season 3 is depicted as tense. Jane is shown to be a gold-digger and heavy drinker, and she is repeatedly rejected by Roger's daughter Margaret, who is two years younger than she. However, despite the perceived tension, Roger repeatedly says his new marriage makes him happy because of Jane's youth and carefree personality. As a favor to Jane, Roger forces Don to hire her cousin Danny Siegel, despite Danny's unimpressive portfolio and job interview.\n\nFor a long time after their wedding, Roger refuses to cheat on Jane, something he repeatedly did with his first wife Mona, and turns down the advances of an old flame. Roger does eventually cheat on Jane with his former mistress, [[Joan Harris]].\n\nIn Season 5, Roger and Jane take LSD together, mutually realize their marriage has failed, and agree to divorce. Roger later recruits Jane to pretend to still be his wife for a client dinner, as the clients are Jewish and he thinks her Jewish background will help win the account. She agrees on the condition that he buy her a new apartment, which he does.  After the client dinner, Roger asks to see the new apartment.  They sleep together there, and afterward Jane is heartbroken and miserable because their sexual encounter has ruined her fresh start in her new apartment away from Roger.\n\nIn the [[The Doorway|Season 6 premiere]], Jane attends Roger's mother's memorial service and offers to return the family heirloom ring he gave her. However, Roger tells her to keep it.\n\n=== Margaret Sterling Hargrove ===\n'''Margaret Sterling''' ([[Elizabeth Rice]]) is Roger and Mona Sterling's daughter.  Spoiled and immature, she reacts petulantly to her father's remarriage and refuses to speak to Jane. She is engaged to be married during Seasons 2 and 3 and frequently whines about Jane's attempts to befriend her, as well as dramatically complains to her father that Jane has ruined her life and will ruin her wedding by attending. When [[John F. Kennedy]] is assassinated the day before her wedding, Margaret is distraught over the fact that it will effectively ruin her wedding and although she does proceed with the wedding, very few guests attend. In the [[The Doorway|Season 6 premiere]], she is disappointed that her grandmother has not left her any money and asks her father to invest in her husband Brooks' [[refrigerator car]] technology venture. She has a son, Ellery, with Brooks. When Roger takes his young grandson to see ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', Ellery gets nightmares and Margaret furiously tells Roger that he can't spend time with him anymore without Mona present. In Season 7, Margaret abandons her son and husband to join a commune in upstate New York, taking the name Marigold. Roger and Mona try to persuade her to return to Ellery, but she insists her son cannot be happy if she is unhappy. Although Mona gives up and leaves, Roger stays for the night to understand Margaret's point of view, but he is disgusted by the hippies' free-love lifestyle once he realizes that Margaret is a participant, and says Ellery needs her. In response, Margaret berates him for being an absent father during her own childhood and declares that she is entitled to behave selfishly. In the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series finale]], more than a year later, Roger tells Joan that Margaret is \"lost\" and he has cut her out of his will.\n\n=== Mona Sterling Pike===\n'''Mona Sterling Pike''' ([[Talia Balsam]], the real-life wife of John Slattery) is Roger Sterling's first wife and the mother of his daughter, Margaret. Roger is frequently unfaithful to Mona, but after his heart attack in Season 1, he appears to briefly re-devote himself to his family and ends his affair with Joan. However, in Season 2 he leaves Mona for Don's secretary, Jane Siegel. In Season 5, Roger and Mona seem to be on good terms after Roger has left Jane; Mona even agrees to help Roger drum up business, noting that he still supports Mona and their daughter. In the [[The Doorway|Season 6 premiere]], Roger explodes in an angry outburst at Mona's new husband, Bruce Pike, whom she has brought to Roger's mother's memorial service. However, both of them work together to try to bring Margaret home after she abandons her family to become a hippie. Although they are unsuccessful in getting her to return, Roger and Mona are shown to be spending time with their grandson Ellery while watching the [[1969 Moon landing|1969 moon landing]].\n\n=== Bethany Van Nuys ===\n'''Bethany Van Nuys''' ([[Anna Camp]]) is a young aspiring actress and former member of the [[Mount Holyoke College]] gymnastics team with whom [[List of Mad Men characters#Jane Siegel|Jane Sterling]] set Don up to go on a date following his divorce from [[Betty Draper|Betty]]. Blonde Bethany bears a superficial resemblance to Betty. On their first date in the [[Mad Men (season 4)|Season 4 premiere]], when Don is dropping her off at the [[Barbizon Hotel for Women]], she explains that she is in between acting roles and is working as a [[Supernumerary actor|supernumerary]] at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. Don dates her periodically throughout the Season 4 before becoming involved with [[#Faye Miller|Faye Miller]]. On one of their dates, Betty runs into them at a restaurant and reacts jealously. At the end of Season 4, Bethany is mentioned again when Don tells Betty he is getting remarried; Betty assumes his new fianc\u00e9e is Bethany.\n\n=== Tom and Jeannie Vogel ===\n'''Thomas and Jeannie Vogel''' (Joe O'Connor and Sheila Shaw) are Trudy Campbell's parents. Tom is an executive at [[Vicks|Vicks Chemical]], who uses his status as an important client with Sterling Cooper to wield influence over Trudy's marriage to Pete Campbell. In Season 1, he offers to help Pete and Trudy buy an apartment. Tom also offers to give Sterling Cooper the [[Clearasil]] account if Pete agrees to have a baby soon. In Season 2, after Trudy discovers she is unable to conceive, Tom pressures Pete to agree to adopt a child. When Pete refuses, Tom cancels the Clearasil account. At the end of Season 3, Pete gets the account back with Trudy's help. In Season 4, the agency drops Clearasil because of a conflict with a larger account ([[Pond's Creams|Pond's Cold Cream]]), but Pete is able to manipulate Tom into giving him several larger accounts from Tom's company. In Season 6, after Tom and Pete unexpectedly meet in a brothel, Tom pulls his company's accounts in hypocritical disgust at Pete's infidelity to Trudy. In season 7, it is revealed that Tom has suffered a heart attack.\n\n=== Arnold Wayne ===\n'''Dr. Arnold Wayne''' ([[Andy Umberger]]) was Betty's psychiatrist during the first season, whom she saw because of her problem with her hands going numb unexpectedly. While she was seeing him, Dr. Wayne was secretly in contact with Don to discuss her sessions, which Betty found out about during the Season 1 finale. She used that to her advantage by confiding her suspicions about Don's infidelity.\n\n===Abigail Whitman===\n'''Abigail Whitman''' is Dick Whitman's stepmother and Adam Whitman's mother. She is deceased and appears in Don/Dick's flashbacks. Abigail was married to Archibald Whitman and had recently miscarried, when the prostitute Archibald had impregnated died after delivering baby Dick. The midwife gave the newborn to Abigail, who had prayed for another child, and Archibald to raise, but Abigail resented Dick and regularly referred to him as a \"whore's son.\"\n\nWhen Archibald died and Abigail lost the farm, she, pregnant with Adam at the time, brought Dick with her to stay with her sister and \"Uncle Mack\" in Pennsylvania, where both were to earn their keep helping out at Mack's whorehouse, and Abigail was to make herself available to Mack sexually. One of the prostitutes, Aim\u00e9e Swenson, caught Don peeping through the keyhole when Mack was mounting the child-heavy Abigail. When Dick was ill and Abigail claimed he had symptoms of tuberculosis and ordered him to confine himself to the basement, Aim\u00e9e checked his breathing and told him he only had a common cold, commenting that \"Your mother don't know how to care for anybody.\" Young Dick responded, \"She ain't my mother.\" Aim\u00e9e hid him in her room and nursed him back to health. When Aim\u00e9e was evicted, she revealed that she had taken Dick's virginity, and Abigail beat Dick severely with a wooden spoon while berating him.\n\nWhen Adam finds Don/Dick in New York City and tells him Abigail had died, Don's response is \"Good.\"\n\n=== Adam Whitman ===\n'''Adam Whitman''' ([[Jay Paulson]]) is Dick Whitman's half-brother. In the Season 1 episode \"[[5G (Mad Men)|5G]]\", Adam is seen working as a janitor when he tries to re-establish a relationship with Don after seeing his picture in a thrown-away newspaper. Initially unwilling to associate with Adam, Don agrees to meet him for lunch and later visits him at the cheap rooming house where Adam is staying. Don gives Adam $5,000 and asks him not to contact him again. Eventually, Adam mails a package to Don that contains old family photos and soon afterward, hangs himself. Some time later, Don finds out about his brother's suicide when he attempts to reach Adam. The box of photos would later cause Don trouble when it is found by Pete Campbell, who attempts to use the photos to blackmail Don about his true identity.\n\nAs a boy, Adam saw Dick on the train that brought home \"Dick's\" body, which was actually that of the real Don Draper whose identity Dick stole, from the Korean War and tried to tell his mother and \"Uncle Mack\",  but they did not listen to him. Adam reappears in the final two episodes of Season 5, as Don/Dick hallucinates mildly while suffering from a \"hot tooth\" that turns out to be [[abscess]]ed. In one such scene, as Don is placed under anesthesia, he hallucinates Adam's standing over him, his neck bruised from his hanging, stating, \"It's not your tooth that's rotten.\"\n\n=== Archie Whitman ===\n'''Archibald \"Archie\" Whitman''' ([[Joseph Culp]]) is Dick Whitman's late father. Archie impregnated Evangeline, a prostitute, who died while giving birth to Dick. The midwife, who knew that Archie's wife, Abigail, had recently miscarried and prayed for a child, brought Dick to their home for Archie and Abigail to raise. However, Abigail always resented Dick and called him a \"whore child\".  Archie and Abigail are birth parents of Dick's younger half-brother, Adam. Don tells Betty his father would \"beat the hell out of him\".  There are other indications that Archie was a terrible father and a mean drunk, as seen in the Season 1 episode \"[[The Hobo Code]]\" when Don remembers that as a child, a friendly drifter stayed with the Whitmans and told Dick that drifters leave [[Hobo code|signs]] carved on the front of a property to notify others of the resident's character, and drew some of the signs for him.  When the drifter left after Archie reneged on a promise to pay for the drifter's labor, Dick found the sign for a dishonest person carved into the fence. While drunk, Archie was kicked in the face by his horse during a storm and was killed as a stunned Dick looked on.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mad Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Mad Men Characters}}\n[[Category:Mad Men|Characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of American drama television series characters|Mad Men]]\n[[Category:Mad Men characters| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{in-universe|date=October 2015}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Mad Men'' characters}}\nThis is a list of fictional characters in the television series ''[[Mad Men]]'', all of whom have appeared in multiple episodes.\n\n==Overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Actor\n! style=\"width:10%;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! colspan=\"8\"|Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|[[Mad Men (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|[[Mad Men (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|[[Mad Men (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|[[Mad Men (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|[[Mad Men (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|[[Mad Men (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|[[Mad Men (season 7)|7a]]\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|[[Mad Men (season 7)|7b]]\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" |\n=== Main characters ===\n|-\n|[[Jon Hamm]]\n| [[Don Draper]]\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n|[[Elisabeth Moss]]\n| [[Peggy Olson]]\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain|Main}}\n|-\n|[[Vincent Kartheiser]]\n| [[Pete Campbell]]\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain|Main}}\n|-\n|[[January Jones]]\n| [[Betty Draper]]\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain|Main}}\n|-\n|[[Christina Hendricks]]\n| [[Joan Holloway]]\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain|Main}}\n|-\n|[[Bryan Batt]]\n| [[Salvatore Romano]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain|Main}}\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ececec; color:gray; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" class=\"table-na\"|\n|-\n|[[Michael Gladis]]\n| [[Paul Kinsey]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain|Main}}\n| style=\"background:#ececec; color:gray; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" class=\"table-na\"|\n| {{CGuest}}\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#ececec; color:gray; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" class=\"table-na\"|\n|-\n|[[Aaron Staton]]\n| [[Ken Cosgrove]]\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain|Main}}\n|-\n|[[Rich Sommer]]\n| [[List of Mad Men characters#Harry Crane|Harry Crane]]\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain|Main}}\n|-\n|[[Maggie Siff]]\n| [[List of Mad Men characters#Rachel Menken|Rachel Menken]]\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CMain|Main}}\n| {{CGuest|Guest}}\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#ececec; color:gray; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" class=\"table-na\"|\n| {{CGuest|Guest}}\n|-\n|[[John Slattery]]\n| [[Roger Sterling]]\n| {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=\"7\" {{CMain|Main}}\n|-\n|[[Robert Morse]]\n| [[List of Mad Men characters#Bert Cooper|Bert Cooper]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CRecurring|Recurring}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{CMain|Main}}\n| {{CGuest|Guest}}\n|-\n|[[Jared Harris]]\n| [[Lane Pryce]]\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ececec; color:gray; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" class=\"table-na\"|\n| {{CRecurring|Recurring}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CMain|Main}}\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#ececec; color:gray; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" class=\"table-na\"|\n|-\n|[[Kiernan Shipka]]\n| [[Sally Draper]]\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CRecurring|Recurring}}\n| colspan=\"5\" {{CMain|Main}}\n|-\n|[[Jessica Par\u00e9]]\n| [[Megan Draper]]\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#ececec; color:gray; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" class=\"table-na\"|\n| {{CRecurring|Recurring}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{CMain|Main}}\n|-\n|[[Christopher Stanley]]\n|[[List of Mad Men characters#Henry Francis|Henry Francis]]\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ececec; color:gray; vertical-align:middle; text-align:center;\" class=\"table-na\" |\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CRecurring|Recurring}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{CMain|Main}}\n|-\n|[[Jay R.

Huckabee]] and Aaron Hart have split the role of Bobby Draper in the first season, while Hart takes over for the second season. [[Jared Gilmore]] plays Bobby throughout the third and fourth season.</small>\n\n==Primary characters==\n\n===Don Draper===\n{{main|Don Draper}}\n'''Donald \"Don\" Draper''' (n\u00e9 '''Dick Whitman'''; [[Jon Hamm]]) born 1926, is the [[creative director]] at Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency; he eventually rises to become a partner. He later becomes a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Draper is the series' [[protagonist]], and more storylines focus on him than on other characters.\n\n===Peggy Olson===\n{{main|Peggy Olson}}\n'''Margaret \"Peggy\" Olson''' ([[Elisabeth Moss]]), upon introduction, is the ostensibly na\u00efve \"new girl\" at Sterling Cooper. She was originally Draper's secretary, but showed surprising talent and initiative, including a knack&mdash;similar to Draper's&mdash;for understanding the consumer's mind. Don promotes her to copywriter, and she eventually accepts a copy chief position with Ted Chaough's firm, CGC, only to find herself once again working for Don following a merger.\n\n===Pete Campbell===\n{{main|Pete Campbell}}\n'''Peter \"Pete\" Campbell''' ([[Vincent Kartheiser]]) is an ambitious young account executive whose father-in-law controls the advertising for [[Clearasil]], a Sterling Cooper account. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, he becomes more competitive with Don as the series progresses, and ultimately becomes a partner of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.\n\n===Betty (Draper) Francis===\n{{main|Betty Draper}}\n'''Elizabeth \"Betty\" Francis''' (n\u00e9e '''Hofstadt''', formerly '''Draper'''; [[January Jones]]) is the ex-wife of Don Draper (who affectionately called her \"Betts,\" or on occasion \"Birdy\") and mother of their three children, Sally, Bobby, and Gene. Her family home was in Elkins Park, Pa., and she graduated from [[Bryn Mawr College]].  She speaks fluent Italian. She is the archetypal dissatisfied 1960s housewife, who dutifully turned her back on her education and professional career (as a model) to become a homemaker. After obtaining a divorce from Don, she marries Henry Francis and moves to [[Rye, New York|Rye]] in late 1965. Despite no longer being married to Don, Betty is shown to harbor feelings for him.\n\n===Joan Harris===\n{{main|Joan Holloway}}\n'''Joan P. Harris''' (n\u00e9e '''Holloway'''; [[Christina Hendricks]]) is first depicted as an office manager at Sterling Cooper, who acts as a professional and social mentor, as well as an occasional rival, to Peggy Olson, much as Don Draper is to Pete Campbell. Throughout the course of the series, Joan has a long-standing affair with Roger Sterling, which results in their conceiving a son. She ascribes the boy's fatherhood to her husband, a physician serving as a military officer in Vietnam, whom she later divorces. Joan eventually rises up to the level of partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce and the following SC&P, and chooses to create her own firm after SC&P is absorbed by McCann Erickson.\n\n===Roger Sterling===\n{{main|Roger Sterling}}\n'''Roger H. Sterling, Jr.''' ([[John Slattery]]), was one of the two managing partners of Sterling Cooper, and later a founding partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Roger's relationship with Lucky Strike, one of Sterling Coopers most lucrative accounts, is key to the story from the outset.\n\n== Supporting characters ==\n\n=== Sal Romano ===\n'''Salvatore \"Sal\" Romano''' ([[Bryan Batt]]) is the Italian-American [[art director]] at Sterling Cooper, originally from [[Baltimore]]. Sal turned down a proposition from a male employee of Belle Jolie Cosmetics midway through the first season, admitting that though he has thought about having relationships with men, he has never acted on this impulse. He joins the other men of Sterling Cooper in flirting with the women in the workplace. He speaks to his mother in Italian. Sal is shown to have a sarcastic side to his personality, mocking Pete after he nearly loses his job and laughing at Freddy Rumsen urinating himself. Between Seasons 1 and 2, Sal marries a childhood friend, Kitty ([[Sarah Drew]]).<ref>[http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/episode201 Mad Men - For Those Who Think Young \u2013 AMC]. Amctv.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-23. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223011130/http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/episode201 |date=December 23, 2010 }}</ref> The two entertain Ken Cosgrove for dinner during the Season 2 episode \"The Gold Violin\", during which Sal seems taken with his guest. Kitty shows signs of frustration at being ignored, expressing that something is wrong in their marriage.\n\nIn the Season 3 premiere, Don Draper sees Sal alone with a partly-dressed, male hotel bellhop, but subtly assures Sal he will keep silent by drawing Sal's attention to the ad slogan they had been working on for raincoats: \"Limit your exposure\". Later in the third season, with Don's encouragement, Sal branches out into directing commercials for the company. Meanwhile, Sal and Kitty have not had sex in several months and Kitty tells Sal she needs \"tending to\". He assures her that he loves her, but his mind is elsewhere due to pressures at work. Illustrations popular in magazine advertisements in the 1950s and early 1960s are going out of style in favor of photographs, so he fears he will lose his job as an illustrator. Later in the scene, Kitty is in bed and Sal vividly demonstrates how the [[Ann-Margret]] look-alike will dance and sing \"[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]\" in his commercial, with lyrics changed for [[Pepsi]]'s new diet drink [[Patio (soda)|Patio]]. Kitty nods but appears uncomfortable with Sal's flamboyant performance.\n\nIn the Season 3 episode \"Wee Small Hours\", Sal rejects the advances of Lee Garner, Jr., a married [[Lucky Strike]] executive who, in retaliation, calls Harry Crane and demands Sal's removal from the account. When Harry fails to pass this on, Garner walks out of a subsequent meeting. Roger fires Sal on the spot. Don supports Roger's decision on the basis that the company can afford to lose him rather than Lucky Strike and regards Sal with disdain, implying that he should have just given Garner what he wanted. In Sal's last appearance, he calls his wife late at night from a payphone located in a park, a group of men nearby. He does not tell her he has been fired, only that he will be arriving home late.\n\n=== Paul Kinsey ===\n'''Paul Kinsey''' ([[Michael Gladis]]) is a copywriter at Sterling Cooper. He initially features as part of the group of unmarried or childless young ad men in the Sterling Cooper office, who spend a lot of their time drinking, flirting, and gossiping. Paul tries out a lot of identities for himself throughout the series, never seeming to feel comfortable where he belongs. In addition to his creative duties at Sterling Cooper, Paul is a writer, and in the Season 1 episode \"Nixon vs. Kennedy\", his drunken co-workers find a play he wrote and act it out, although it is not very good, and it seems to ridicule a lot of his co-workers. Paul dated Joan prior to the beginning of the series, but Joan ended the relationship because, according to Joan, Paul \"has a big mouth\". When a then-naive Peggy begins to work at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary, Paul hits on her, but Peggy rejects him, as she is secretly attracted to Pete. In Season 2, Paul dates a black woman who is involved in [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Joan makes fun of his relationship with his black girlfriend, as she believes he is seeing her only to appear interesting. She dumps Paul while they are [[Civil Rights Movement#Voter registration organizing|registering black voters in the South]]. He is \"slumming\" by living in a run-down neighborhood popular among beatniks in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], and espouses more [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] ideas and attitudes than his fellow young copywriters.  Joan, however, mocks him for this lifestyle, proclaiming that he is simply pretentious and wants to believe he is better than the people he works with. He steals an IBM Selectric typewriter from the Sterling Cooper offices because he says as a writer, he needs it. This leads to a secretary being blamed and almost fired. He is originally from New Jersey and attended [[Princeton University|Princeton]] on a scholarship, two facts he is eager to hide. A fan of science fiction and ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', he has a notably Kennedy-era fascination with space.\n\nAs opposed to other characters who smoke cigarettes, Paul smokes a [[tobacco pipe|pipe]]. He is a moderate drinker and says he likes to [[effects of cannabis|get high]] \"whenever [he] can\".\n\nIn Season 2, Paul grows an [[Orson Welles]] beard and later quotes passages from Welles' ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|War of the Worlds]]'' radio broadcast. He initially encourages Peggy to pursue copywriting, noting, \"There ''are'' female copywriters\", but it immediately becomes clear this is merely an attempt to seduce her. He later becomes jealous and pettily competitive when her skill becomes indisputable.  He realizes Peggy and Don have creative \"magic\" together when it comes to advertising ideas and slogans and is annoyed, especially as his own contributions become less favored by Don and, as a result, diminish his importance at the firm. Paul expresses considerable anger when he realizes Peggy was chosen by Don to join the new agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, while he was not.\n\nIn the Season 5 episode \"[[Christmas Waltz (Mad Men)|Christmas Waltz]]\", he reappears as a devotee of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] movement, which he has joined at least partly to win the affections of a girl.  (His advertising career has apparently stalled, since he bounced between a few other agencies before becoming a Hare Krishna.)  He contacts [[List of Mad Men characters#Harry Crane|Harry Crane]] to ask him to pass on his [[spec script]] for ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' to Harry's contacts at NBC. The script is terrible, but Harry, feeling guilty because he has had sex with Paul's Hare Krishna girlfriend, and not wanting to deal with Paul's problems, praises the script and gives Paul $500 and a ticket to Los Angeles so he can start afresh. He advises Paul not to submit the script to the ''Star Trek'' production team due to \"studio politics,\" and instead recommends that he write his own original stories. Paul expresses considerable gratitude toward Harry, telling him he is the first person to actually do something for him, completely unaware of Harry's lies.\n\n=== Ken Cosgrove ===\n'''Kenneth \"Ken\" Cosgrove''' ([[Aaron Staton]]) is an account executive at Sterling Cooper. Pete says Ken is the son of a salesman from [[Burlington, Vermont]], and Ken tells Fillmore Auto Parts he grew up in rural Vermont. Ken says his mother is heavyset and works as a nurse at a state hospital. He attended [[Columbia University]], and before getting married lived in [[Murray Hill, Manhattan|Murray Hill]]. He is easygoing, confident, and generally happy, with a genuine artist's skills. He writes as a hobby and took a job in advertising because he heard there was money in it. In the early seasons, he gives the impression of being very successful at his job while not caring much about it&mdash;certainly not caring about his success in the office the way Peter and Harry do.\n\nHe initially appears as a member of the younger set of junior account men and copywriters at Sterling Cooper, seeming to spend more office time drinking, flirting and gossiping than working. Ken has literary aspirations and has been published in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'',<ref>{{cite news|work=The Atlantic Monthly|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/05/tapping-a-maple-on-a-cold-vermont-morning/393344/|date=May 2015|title=Tapping a Maple on a Cold Vermont Morning |author=Cosgrove, Ken}}</ref> an accomplishment that elicits jealousy from both Pete Campbell and Paul Kinsey.\n\nIn Season 2, it is revealed that Ken makes considerably more money than his co-worker Harry Crane ($300/week vs. $200/week). In Season 3, Ken and Pete are promoted, sharing the role of Accounts Director, which infuriates Pete (who wanted the role all to himself) while Ken is completely unruffled. While not as outwardly ambitious as Pete, he has proven to be a competent executive and an exceptionally talented creative thinker, eclipsing Pete as a rising star at Sterling Cooper. Eventually, Ken is promoted above Pete, to the latter's fury, particularly when Ken is so blas\u00e9 about the promotion and about learning that Pete is sharing the position with him. When he gets married he becomes the only one of the central characters on the show to never be shown cheating on his wife. He maintains a healthy separation between his personal and professional lives, refusing to use family connections to succeed.\n\nBecause Pete Campbell was approached first and agreed to join SCDP, Ken is not asked to join the new firm and is not seen in the earlier episodes in Season 4. It turns out that he leaves Sterling Cooper and goes to McCann Erickson. However, Ken, unhappy at McCann, later joins SCDP, bringing [[Birds Eye]] and other clients with him, and agrees to serve under Pete. There are limits to what Ken will do, however: he refuses to try to bring his father-in-law's business over to SCDP because he does not want to mix his personal and professional lives, something Pete has no qualms doing.  Later in Season 4, Ken is having dinner with his fianc\u00e9e, Cynthia, and future in-laws when he learns that [[Lucky Strike]], SCDP's biggest client by far, is taking their business to another agency.\n\nIn the Season 5 premiere he is happily married, and he and his new wife attend Don's surprise birthday party. Ken is also shown to have continued writing in his off-hours and has published [[science fiction]] stories using the [[pseudonym]] of Ben Hargrove, which the prestigious publishing house of [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux|Farrar Straus]] wants to publish, a fact he tries to keep secret from his co-workers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mad-men-heres-that-awkward-look-on-everyones-face-when-they-hear-about-ken-cosgroves-story-about-robots-2012-4?op=1#ixzz3aVEeClM5|work=Business Insider|title=Mad Men: Here's That Awkward Look On Everyone's Face When They Hear About Ken Cosgrove's Story About Robots|author=Stampler, Laura| date= April 16, 2012}}</ref> At the end of \"[[Signal 30]]\", Ken tells Peggy Olson that Roger Sterling is forcing him to abandon writing fiction as he feels it takes away time from his work for the firm. He continues to do so under the new pen name Dave Algonquin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2012/04/mad_men_recap_signal_30.html|work=The Star-Ledger|title='Mad Men' recap, 'Signal 30': Red-faced and white-knuckled|author=Maurer, Mark|date= April 16, 2012}}</ref> In \"Commissions and Fees,\" Don and Roger manage to secure Ken's father-in-law as a client on their own. Ken doesn't mind working on the account since it was acquired without his help, but in exchange for feigning ignorance to Cynthia, Ken demands that Pete be excluded from the proceedings.\n\nIn Season 6, Ken has been given a spacious office on SCDP's second floor, and appears to be on somewhat friendlier terms with Pete, even giving him advice when the latter finds himself in a very awkward situation. He dislikes the new employee Bob Benson.  After the acquisition of the new Chevy account and the subsequent merger with CGC, Ken is assigned to deal with the account, necessitating that he be in Detroit more and more often.  Ken's happy-go-lucky attitude begins to fade, and the number of things he has to do for work that he does not like, increase. He is forced to spend time away from his family in Detroit, and he is injured by the Chevy car executives while engaging in leisure activities with them. In \"[[The Crash (Mad Men)|The Crash]]\", while under the influence of a \"mild stimulant\" that is intended to help SCDP employees to work the extra hours needed on the Chevy account, Ken demonstrates that he is a talented [[tap dance]]r, but can't remember clearly whether he learned the skill from his mother or his first girlfriend. Most seriously, in \"Quality of Mercy\", Ken is wounded in a hunting accident by a pair of Chevy executives, resulting in the loss of an eye. Deciding that Chevy is too much for him, he returns to New York full-time to support the newly pregnant Cynthia.\n\nDuring Season 7, Ken reveals he has a son, Edward. Cynthia is growing frustrated with Ken facing increased pressure at work, and she encourages him to leave the advertising business and write the [[Great American Novel]] he has dreamed of doing. After his father-in-law retires from [[Dow Chemical]], Ken presents him with a gift of golf clubs as a client. The same day, Roger, under pressure by McCann executives who are still angry at Ken leaving and taking the Birdseye account with him, fires him and gives his accounts to Pete. Ken, never really enamored of his job, was about to quit advertising and pursue Cynthia's suggestion to be a full-time writer, but being fired infuriates him so much that he takes a job as the head of advertising with Dow Chemical. In light of Ken's new position, Roger and Pete attempt to mend fences with him, especially when SC&P seeks to retain some autonomy from McCann-Erickson by proposing to move operations to Los Angeles. However, instead of becoming a writer, Ken sees an opportunity to get revenge for their dismissive treatment. Rather than drop SC&P as Dow's agency, he informs them he will retain them but make their life difficult. He is last seen in the final episode having lunch with Joan (proposing an opportunity for her to coordinate a promotional film for Dow), confident in his new position, and glad to be no longer with his former company.\n\n=== Harry Crane ===\n'''Harold \"Harry\" Crane''' ([[Rich Sommer]]) was a media buyer at Sterling Cooper. He initially is part of the group of young and unmarried or newly married members of the Creative and Accounts teams. Harry is originally from [[Wisconsin]] and is a [[University of Wisconsin]] alumnus, the only one of Pete's close friends who did not attend an [[Ivy League]] school (Ken went to Columbia, Pete to [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], and Paul to [[Princeton University|Princeton]]). He is married to Jennifer, who works at the phone company. In early seasons, they seem to have one of the happier and more egalitarian marriages on the show; Harry is honest with his wife and is shown asking her advice about his problems at work. He flirts with women but is faithful to his wife until he has too much to drink at an office party and has a [[one-night stand]] with Hildy, Pete's secretary. He confesses the infidelity to Jennifer, who kicks him out of their home for a time.  Harry and Jennifer appear to have resolved that issue by Season 2, and they have a daughter named Beatrice. In Season 6 it is mentioned that they also now have twin sons, Nathan and Steven.\n\nHarry is initially a bit of a pushover, accepting far less in pay in negotiations than he could have asked for, and his non-confrontational attitude causes him to mishandle a situation that leads to the firing of his friend and co-worker, Sal Romano. Despite these flaws, Harry is the only member of the firm to recognize the importance of television to the firm, and he subsequently creates and puts himself in charge of Sterling Cooper's television department. Later, when Sterling Cooper is in the process of being sold, Harry mistakenly thinks they are considering opening a West Coast office and believes he will be the person to move to California.\n\nIn Season 3, he is the only Sterling Cooper executive who is promoted by the firm's British owner as part of a short-lived company reorganization. Harry later accepts an offer to join Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce as \"Head of Media\". By Season 4, a more confident and slimmer, if smarmier, Harry shows great progress at work, as he is often seen making deals with television networks on the new agency's behalf.  We see him flirting with Peggy's friends as well, and it is implied that he cheats on his wife but has learned to keep it from her. In typical awkward Harry fashion, he sees prostitutes while in California for work, but pays them in [[Traveler's cheque|traveler's cheques]]. When he calls Joey Baird into his office and tells him that he has a particular look suited to television, Baird interprets it as a homosexual advance and becomes wary of him.\n\nDuring the season 5 premiere, Megan mentions to Peggy that Don really doesn't like Harry, and thus wouldn't want him to attend his birthday party. Nonetheless, Harry is invited and attends. Given his mild social awkwardness, he is seemingly unaware of Don's opinion of him. The next day at the office, Megan catches Harry making lewd comments about her performance of \"[[Zou Bisou Bisou]]\" and he is briefly concerned that he could lose his job. Also in Season 5, he is approached by former close friend Paul Kinsey, who is now a [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] and is floundering. He has sex with Paul's Hare Krishna girlfriend without Paul's knowledge. Immediately afterwards, she tells Harry that he disgusts her and she only had sex with him so that he would no longer try to rescue Paul from the Krishnas. Indeed, later, Paul, wanting to escape the Krishnas, approaches Harry for help&mdash;he has written a spec script for ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' and wants to know if it will be successful. Harry lies to Paul and assures him it's a great script (when in truth he and Peggy agree it is not only terrible but borderline racist), and urges him to leave immediately for California, giving him $500 (nearly $4000 in 2016 dollars) and a [[First class (aviation)|first class]] plane ticket on [[American Airlines]] for the trip. Paul expresses gratitude and feels Harry is a true friend, when in fact Harry's lies and desire to get Paul away from him are evidence of him simply not wanting to deal with Paul.\n\nIn Season 6, Harry's personality has changed considerably from his days at Sterling Cooper; he has become arrogant and full of prideful boasting about the Media Department. His jealousy manifests itself when Joan fires his secretary, Scarlett, for falsifying her time card. He orders Scarlett back to work and then bursts into a partners' meeting, displaying considerable anger over the fact that Joan was promoted to partner when he had been passed over several times, particularly as his accomplishments happened \"in broad daylight.\" Bert and Roger later give him a generous commission on \"Broadway Joe on Broadway\", a last-minute musical special he created to improve Dow Chemical's image, but flatly reject his demand to become a partner, Bert observing that Harry's outspoken criticism of their decision is the only genuinely impressive thing he's ever done.  Don and Roger both despise Harry. When Martin Luther King Jr. is assassinated, Pete is outraged by Harry's fretting over the ad time lost to news coverage, which leads to a brief but intense shouting match in which Pete accuses Harry of being a racist. Harry takes it as a given that he will soon be made partner. Bert, at the meeting of Harry's outburst, assures Joan that will never happen.\n\nDuring Season 7, Jim Cutler takes a dualistic view of Harry: on the one hand he says that Harry's TV work is hugely successful and will be a major part of SC&P in the future, but he also bluntly tells Harry \"you may be the most dishonest man I have ever worked with.\" Jim decides that Harry should finally be offered a partnership and the senior partners agree, though Joan and Roger are outspoken in their opposition. Harry is surprised to run into Don when they both end up at a Los Angeles party for one of Megan's actress friends. The two men are uncomfortable at the event and go to a bar, where Harry says he wishes Don was back (which Don barely notices) before stating that Jim and Lou Avery are planning a major cigarette-company account bid because that will allow them to get rid of Don (which Don very much notices, and uses when he crashes the meeting and ultimately ruins the account bid). In \"Waterloo\", Harry has not yet signed his approved partnership deal, wanting to hold out for more money, and Roger tells him that he \"missed the boat\" and that the idea of his becoming partner is now off the table. Harry has once again failed to read a situation properly, and his boastful posturing thus results in him losing an enormous amount of money when McCann Erickson buys Sterling Cooper, where even the 5% stake Joan had is worth at least $1,500,000. Later, Megan contacts Harry to see if he can help her with her acting career. Harry just assumes this means she will have sex with him in exchange.  When she refuses and leaves in disgust, he quickly goes to see Don, who is unaware of the proposition, to assure him that his soon-to-be-ex-wife Megan is \"crazy\" and Don shouldn't believe anything she says. By the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series finale]], Harry is last seen wearing a fur coat and eating cookies as he awaits a final lunch with Pete and Peggy.\n\n=== Rachel Menken ===\n'''Rachel Katz''' (n\u00e9e '''Menken'''; [[Maggie Siff]]) is the Jewish head of a department store who becomes romantically involved with Draper after she comes to Sterling Cooper in search of an advertising agency to revamp her business' image. Don's first encounter with Rachel, in the pilot, is at a meeting where he pitches the idea of using coupons to attract more customers to the store. Rachel disagrees with the tactic, asserting that she would like to attract wealthier customers. Draper is unhappy with hearing a woman talk to him assertively at the business table. He storms out of the meeting, but Roger Sterling later asks him to reconcile with Rachel, as she is worth $3 million. At his dinner with Rachel, Don questions her desire to work in business, confused that she would choose the \"stress\" of work over the comforts of married life. Rachel confidently replies that business is a thrill and adds that she's never been in love. Don mocks this addition, asserting that love doesn't exist; it was invented by ad men. He goes on to say that everyone is essentially alone \u2013 that people live alone and die alone. Rachel responds that she knows what it is like to be disconnected and feel out of place, and she sees that in Don. Something about the statement seems to intrigue Don, but Rachel ends the meeting, promising to come back to Sterling Cooper for another meeting on Monday morning.\n\nAt the second meeting, in the third episode, Rachel is irked that none of the admen on her team have been to her store. Don solves the problem by meeting her there that afternoon. While there she gives him a pair of medieval knight cuff links and takes him to her favorite place in the store, the roof - where the store keeps its patrol dogs. Rachel explains that she was always close to the dogs as a young girl because her father liked to work a lot. Other than her sister, the dogs were her only companions, as her mother died while giving birth to her. After her revelation, Don kisses her. He tells her he is married, which stuns her. She feels foolish and asks that he put someone else on her account at the firm.\n\nIn the tenth episode, when Roger has a heart attack, Don goes to Rachel's apartment and asks to come in; he has been highly affected by Roger's condition. She keeps her distance, while trying to console him. Don tries to kiss her, telling her she knows everything about him. She stops him and urges him to go to his wife. At this point Don kisses her again, saying, \"This is it. This is all there is\". She consents, and their affair begins. The episode ends with Don's confiding in Rachel the nature of his upbringing.\n\nWhen Pete Campbell blackmails Don, he comes to Rachel with the suggestion that they run away together to Los Angeles. She reminds him of his duty to his children and questions whether he would want to abandon his children after having grown up without a father. When Don persists, Rachel comes to the realization that he does not want to run away with her; he just wants to run away. She calls him a coward. Their relationship seems to collapse from that point on, and they break up sometime between the first and second seasons. Apparently, Rachel was so upset that her father complains to Bert Cooper, who in turn asks Don, \"Why is this man calling me?\" Cooper later reports she was sent on an extended \"ocean cruise\" to heal her psyche.\n\nDon encounters her again in Season 2, while he is dining out with Bobbie Barrett. Rachel introduces them to her husband, Tilden Katz. Though it appears that Don is only momentarily shaken by the news of Rachel's marriage, four episodes later, after drinking heavily with Roger and Freddie Rumsen, he gives his name as \"Tilden Katz\" to a bouncer outside an underground club Roger is trying to get them into.\n\nIn Season 7, Don has a vision of Rachel attending a [[casting call]] for aspiring models. When he tries to contact her, Don discovers that Rachel had died the previous week. During a [[shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] conducted in her memory, Don learns that Rachel suffered from [[leukemia]] and that she had two children. Her sister, with whom Rachel was close and in whom she confided about her relationship with Don, is not happy to see him. She pointedly says that Rachel \"had it all\", makes it clear her life was better for not having Don in it, and is curt until Don takes the hint and leaves.\n\n=== Bert Cooper ===\n'''Bertram \"Bert\" Cooper''' ([[Robert Morse]]) is the senior partner<ref>[http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/cast/bcooper AMC Cast and Crew] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209071428/http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/cast/bcooper |date=2008-12-09 }}</ref> of Sterling Cooper, a crafty old gentleman who is treated with considerable deference by Roger Sterling and Don Draper. He founded the agency in 1923 with Roger Sterling's father.  Cooper's late wife introduced Roger and his first wife, Mona, and Cooper keeps a picture of young Roger and Roger's father in his office. Cooper lectures Roger about being dependent on smoking and criticizes him for his love life. Cooper is not present in the office's day-to-day wranglings, but he is devoted to the business and quietly manages various challenges from behind the scenes. Cooper's younger sister, Alice, is a [[Partnership#Silent partners|silent partner]] at Sterling Cooper and invested in the company when it was just getting started.\n\nCooper has a [[Mark Rothko#Late period|late period]] red painting by [[Mark Rothko]] and the erotic illustration ''[[The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife]]'' hung in his office and is a devotee of [[Ayn Rand]]. He is an aficionado of [[Japanese art]] and [[Japanese culture|culture]]: his office is decorated in a [[Japan]]ese motif with [[sh\u014dji]] dividers among other things, such as a photograph of [[Calvin Coolidge|President Coolidge]], and he requires visitors to remove their shoes before entering his office. Roger attributes this to Cooper being a germaphobe. Cooper also walks around the rest of the Sterling Cooper offices in his socks.\n\nThough he is generally perceived as gracious and accepting, Cooper seems to harbor some racist feelings, as evidenced in the Season 7 episode \"A Day's Work\" when, after, Joan has reassigned Dawn Chambers to the reception desk, Cooper complains that visitors to the agency are greeted by someone who is black.\n\nHe is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and gets Sterling Cooper involved with the 1960 [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] campaign, providing advertising services to the campaign ''gratis''. Cooper is the second character at Sterling Cooper to learn that [[Don Draper]] is actually Dick Whitman, after Pete Campbell informs him of the truth, but he reacts with nonchalance, remarking, \"Mr. Campbell, ''who cares?''\" and urging him to forget about it. He keeps silent about Don's identity but uses this knowledge two years later in the Season 3 episode [[Mad Men (season 3)|\"Seven Twenty Three\"]] to pressure Don into signing a three-year contract with the agency.\n\nAfter selling a majority interest in the company to British firm PPL, he begins to feel increasingly insignificant as they start to exert control, but accepts this as part of the terms of the buyout, from which he, Alice, Roger, and Don profited handsomely. But when Bert discovers PPL will be selling Sterling Cooper to a rival agency and that he will be forced to retire as a result, Cooper goes on to co-found the new agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.\n\nDuring [[Mad Men (season 4)|Season 4]], Don Draper finds a taped recording of Roger's memoirs \"Sterling's Gold\" in a drawer by accident, from which it is revealed that a younger Cooper was given an unnecessary [[orchiectomy]] during the \"height of his sexual prime\". Don and Peggy also learn that when Roger was a young man, he was sexually involved with Cooper's much older, very eccentric, long-time secretary, [[List of Mad Men characters#Ida Blankenship|Ida Blankenship]].\n\nLater in the Season 4 episode \"[[Blowing Smoke (Mad Men)|Blowing Smoke]]\", when the agency is forced to radically downsize its staff following the loss of the [[Lucky Strike]] account, an angered Cooper tells the other partners he is quitting, partially in response to Don Draper's ad in ''[[The New York Times]]'', which he feels is a needlessly reckless career move, and he does not want to be associated with Draper's \"stunt\". However, as of the premiere of [[Mad Men (season 5)|Season 5]], he is back in the offices of SCDP, although without an office of his own.\n\nBy Season 6, Cooper has been given his own office on SCDP's new second floor. Though far less spacious than his office at Sterling Cooper, it is still decorated with Japanese art. Cooper starts going about his duties with more vigor and enjoyment than he has for the past two seasons, and more effectively than Roger and Don, the other major partners. Cooper works in secret with Pete and Joan to prepare SCDP for becoming a publicly traded company,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/maureen-ryan/mad-men-recap-for-immediate-release_b_3221013.html|title='Mad Men' Recap: A Classic Episode Brings Big Changes For Don And Peggy|first=Maureen|last=Ryan|date=6 May 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amc.com/shows/mad-men/talk/2013/06/qa-robert-morse-bertram-cooper|title=Q&A \u2013 Robert Morse (Bertram Cooper)|website=AMC}}</ref> but his plans are derailed when Don loses the Jaguar account. Cooper's initial opinion on the subsequent merger with CGC is unclear, though he goes about his duties at the new firm with his usual aplomb.  Cooper later volunteers to have his name removed from the company's along with those of the recently deceased partners, but gleefully accepts Cutler's proposal to name the firm \"Sterling Cooper & Partners.\" On Thanksgiving Day, 1968, Cooper leads Roger, Jim and Joan in confronting Don over his recent behavior and placing the errant creative director on an indefinite leave of absence.\n\nIn Season 7, after Roger's urging, Cooper is willing to let Don return to the agency under strict stipulations. He dies while watching the [[1969 Moon landing|1969 Apollo 11 moon landing]] on television with his maid. At the end of the first half of Season 7, Bert appears to Don as an apparition in the SC&P lobby, and goes into a song and dance of \"[[The Best Things in Life Are Free (1927 song)|The Best Things in Life Are Free]]\", surrounded by smiling, dancing secretaries instead of showgirls, before disappearing. Later, during Season 7's \"Lost Horizon\", Cooper's ghost appears to Don in his car, chatting and giving him a bit of insight during a late-night drive.\n\n=== Lane Pryce ===\n{{main|Lane Pryce}}\n'''[[Lane Pryce]]''' ([[Jared Harris]]), previously employed at Puttnam, Powell and Lowe, becomes a junior partner at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce at the end of Season 3. Despite being a junior partner, his name is on the company's masthead. In the fifth season, after embezzling funds from the company, he forges a check and gets caught by Don, who tells him to resign. After typing a resignation letter, Lane commits suicide by hanging himself in his office.\n\n=== Sally Draper ===\n'''Sally Beth Draper''' ([[Kiernan Shipka]]) is Don and Betty Draper's oldest child. The series' third episode, \"[[Marriage of Figaro (Mad Men)|Marriage of Figaro]],\" depicts a party for her 6th birthday in late March or early April 1960.  She becomes a more central character in the Seasons 3 and 4 (according to the time line of the series, she would turn nine years old in season 3 and 11 in season 4); from Season 4, she is promoted to a starring role. The death of her grandfather, [[List of Mad Men characters#Gene Hofstadt|Gene Hofstadt]], affected Sally significantly and deepened the rift between her and her mother. When her youngest brother is named after their dead grandfather and given his room, Sally becomes convinced that the baby is her grandfather's reincarnation and becomes terrified of him, but is eventually calmed down by her father. Sally is adventurous, and she has been seen throughout the series making cocktails for her father, smoking one of her mother's cigarettes, asking Don's co-workers about sex, sneaking sips of their alcoholic beverages, being taught how to drive by her grandfather, and masturbating while at a friend's house. Her behavioral problems lead Betty to have her see a child psychiatrist in Season 4. Sally appears to be closer to her father than her mother, and in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Beautiful Girls (Mad Men)|The Beautiful Girls]]\", she unexpectedly shows up at Don's office, because she wants to live with him instead of Betty and Henry Francis. Don sometimes affectionately calls Sally \"Salamander.\" She develops a friendship with slightly older neighbor boy Glen, who is about 12 or 13, in Season 4. This infuriates Betty because, in prior years, Betty and Glen reached out and comforted each other when they were both feeling sad, lonely, and neglected. Betty forbids Sally to see Glen, and proves to be very volatile whenever Sally sees him. Sally continues to surreptitiously communicate with Glen, calling him frequently at his boarding school.\n\nAs Sally progresses into young adulthood, she witnesses several disturbing events, such as in the Season 5 episode \"[[At the Codfish Ball]]\" when she sees Marie Calvet, her stepmother Megan's mother, [[fellatio|fellating]] Roger Sterling during a business dinner, and, most disturbingly, her own father having sex with his neighbor Sylvia in the Season 6 episode \"Favors\". Don's outright denial of the reality of the encounter alienates him from Sally, and, resentful of her parents, Sally decides to attend boarding school. While at school, Sally becomes a troublemaker, smoking constantly, sneaking alcohol onto campus, and dueling with golf clubs with her friends. By the end of the sixth season, Don decides to be more honest with his children, starting with showing them the now dilapidated [[whorehouse]] where he grew up. The choice to be truthful makes an impact on Sally and she begins to forgive her father for his transgressions by the beginning of Season 7. In the Season 7 episode, \"A Day's Work\" Sally goes to a dorm mate's mother's funeral, but ditches with her friends to go shopping. However, while at a caf\u00e9, she leaves her purse behind. Realizing this on the train back, she has no choice but to go to Don's work and ask him for a ride. She goes to his work to discover Lou Avery in what used to be his office. Now suspicious, Sally goes back to his apartment. Eventually, Don arrives and she he uses the excuse 'I wasn't feeling well.' He writes her a note and drives her back to the school. Mid-way, they confront each other about their lies. They stop for food and he drives her back to the school. Sally gets out of the car and while she shuts the door, she says, \"Happy Valentines Day. I love you.\" Which hasn't been said to each other since Season 4. However, she still objects to Don's decisions in life, telling her father that she does not want to be anything like her parents. \"You're a very beautiful girl,\" Don responds. \"It's up to you to be more than that.\"\n\nWhen the series begins to draw to a close, Sally faces further complications of growing up. Glen decides to join the army and fight in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], causing a frustrated Sally to yell at Glen and express disdain over the possibility of his killing of innocent children and bystanders. Sally later expresses regret over her outburst and, through tears, tells Glen's mother that she is sorry and wants to say goodbye to Glen before he leaves for basic training. Later, Sally learns from Henry that her mother Betty is dying from [[lung cancer]], something Betty had not wanted Sally to know at that stage of her illness. On a surprise visit to the Francis household, Betty gives Sally a letter that she tells Sally to read after her death. Shortly afterward, at her dorm room, Sally goes against orders and reads the letter anyway. In the letter, Betty gives Sally a picture of Betty to show the embalmers how to dress and style her for the viewing, and tells Sally that she loves her, and that while in the past she was worried because Sally always wanted to go her own way, now she admires her independent nature, resulting in Sally breaking down in tears. Later, upon learning Betty wants to send Bobby and Gene to stay with her uncle after her death, Sally decides to cancel her planned trip to Madrid and serve as a maternal figure to her brothers. It is also implied that she will press for Henry to raise the boys after Betty's death, since she tells Don they should not be uprooted. The final image of Sally is of her washing dishes while Betty smokes at the kitchen table.\n\n=== Megan Draper ===\n'''Megan Draper (n\u00e9e Calvet)''' ([[Jessica Par\u00e9]]) (born 1940/41) begins as a member of SCDP's typing pool, makes her first appearance at the beginning of Season 4, rises from receptionist to Don Draper's secretary, and ultimately marries Draper by the beginning of Season 5.  Following Miss Blankenship's sudden death, Megan is promoted from the main reception desk to take over as Draper's personal secretary.  \n\nIn the Season 4 episode \"[[Chinese Wall (Mad Men)|Chinese Wall]]\", she indicates to Don an interest in advertising, and one night, while discussing work, Megan initiates a sexual encounter with Don on his office couch.  She comments that she would not run out crying the next day if they slept together, presumably a reference to Don's previous secretary, Allison, who left SCDP in tears following Don's cold treatment of her after their one-night stand.  \n\nIn the [[Tomorrowland (Mad Men)|Season 4 finale]], Don hires Megan to babysit his children on a trip to California, when his planned childcare falls through at the last moment.  Although Don has been dating Faye Miller, SCDP's marketing research consultant, for months, he proposes marriage to Megan upon returning from the California trip, and she accepts.  Don promotes her to copywriter soon after their engagement announcement at SCDP.\n\nMegan, originally from [[Montreal]], is bilingual in English and French.  She is intelligent and capable, but moody and combative as well; as her own mother tells her, she has the \"artistic temperament\".  She originally wanted to be an actress, and in Season 5, she quits her copywriting job at SCDP to pursue acting again and quickly lands her first acting job, with Don's intervention, in a commercial for Butler Shoes in the [[The Phantom (Mad Men)|Season 5 finale]].  She is 26 at the time of her marriage to Don, who turns 40 seven months after the wedding.\n\nBetween seasons, Don appears to have fully disclosed his personal secrets to Megan, as she is aware of his former identity and Dick Whitman's birth date, and knows about Anna. By Season 6, Megan is a recognizable actress, having landed a regular role in a daytime soap opera on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] titled ''To Have and to Hold''. She admits to Sylvia Rosen that she had become pregnant while in Hawaii with Don and was relieved when she miscarried, as she had contemplated her options, as a pregnancy would have disrupted her emerging acting career. Megan later reveals to Don that she had been pregnant and miscarried.\n\nNear the end of Season 6, Don, who is obsessed with their neighbor Sylvia Rosen, unbeknownst to Megan and Sylvia's husband, Arnie Rosen, barely communicates with Megan. Marie suggests Megan dress less like a wife for a business dinner Don has invited Megan to, which attracts Don's amorous attention that night, but ultimately he practically ignores her, and she, believing he is simply working and drinking too much, tells him things must change. \n\nIn the Season 6 finale, Don tells Megan they are moving together to California, and she quits her soap opera job, eagerly anticipating pursuing acting opportunities on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].  However, later that same day, Don tells her they are not moving. Angered, Megan leaves the apartment.  \n\nMegan moves to Los Angeles anyway, and their marriage deteriorates rapidly in the first half of Season 7, particularly when Megan discovers Don has been put on leave from SC&P and hasn't actually been working, which suggests he'd rather stay at home and brood than be with her. It is also implied that Megan's own career is not going well; she is having difficulty securing roles, and at one point, she bombs an audition and then tracks down the director to tearfully demand a second chance. \n\nMegan ends her marriage with Don, who had finally decided to move to Los Angeles, over the phone midway through the Season 7 episode \"Waterloo\". Later, in the Season 7 episode \"New Business\", they have an unpleasant final meeting, where they sign divorce papers, and Don offers Megan a check for $1 million. Bitter and angry, Megan berates Don for \"ruining her life\" but accepts the money.  Megan is not seen again after this episode.\n\n=== Henry Francis ===\n'''Henry Francis''' ([[Christopher Stanley]]) is a Republican political advisor who serves as the Director of Public Relations and Research in the Governor's Office under New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and, later, is an advisor to New York City Mayor [[John Lindsay]]. He first sees Betty when she is six months pregnant at the Sterlings' [[Kentucky Derby]] party, and is instantly drawn to her.  Later, Betty uses a political pretext to call him to ask if he can use his influence to save a local reservoir, and they quickly develop a deeper connection.  Betty reciprocates Henry's attention because she increasingly feels no connection with Don due to his non-stop infidelities, lies over his true identity, and his sometimes verbally abusive attitude towards her. After Betty's beloved father dies, the much older Henry also serves as a father figure for her. Henry and Betty have only a few brief and furtive meetings before Henry proposes marriage in the wake of the [[Kennedy assassination]].  Season 3 ends with the two of them on a plane with baby Gene, flying to Reno so Betty can obtain a quick divorce from Don. At the start of Season 4, we see that Henry and Betty have married and Henry has rather uncomfortably taken up residence in the Drapers' house, living with Betty and her three children and initially paying no rent to Don.  He tries to soothe Betty as she continues to react angrily to Don and his irresponsibility towards the children, but he becomes more frustrated with her over time. Betty, on her part, feels unaccepted by Henry's family, especially when she is unable to control Sally during a family visit to the home of Henry's mother [[List of Mad Men characters#Pauline Francis|Pauline]], and in the face of Pauline's not-so-veiled scorn of Betty. During this time, Henry is concerned by Betty's continued anger towards Don, and he wonders aloud if they rushed into their marriage too quickly.  At the end of Season 4, Henry and Betty decide to move to [[Rye, NY]]. By Season 5, Betty has gained a large amount of weight, but Henry tells her she's beautiful. Her relationship with Henry seems affectionate and Henry seems to love her unconditionally. In the [[The Doorway|Season 6 premiere]], when Betty dyes her hair black, to her children's dismay, Henry says she looks like [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. Betty supports, and seems rejuvenated by, Henry's decision to run for office in Season 6, and after he admiringly tells the overweight, brunette Betty that during his campaign people will \"really see\" her, she rapidly regains her former svelte figure and blonde hairdo. Henry is a solid, mature, and responsible presence in her life, but he also has very traditional views of women, and they have an argument when Betty, at a political fundraiser, does not parrot Henry's political position.\n\nDuring the final season, Henry takes Betty's diagnosis of terminal lung cancer very hard, and in typical fashion is full of energy to fight it. But Betty refuses to do so, just as she refuses to quit smoking or to quit her plans of studying psychology at a university as long as she is physically able. Against her wishes, Henry drives up to see Sally at school to tell her about the diagnosis and to ask her to help him to convince her mother to do chemotherapy. As he talks to Sally, he breaks down crying. As her illness progresses, Betty makes it known that her wish is for Sally, Bobby and Gene to be raised by her brother (William) and his wife (Judy) after her death, rather than by Henry or Don, although Sally feels that Henry is the best person to parent her little brothers after their mother is gone.\n\n=== Stan Rizzo ===\n'''Stan Rizzo''' ([[Jay R. Ferguson]]) becomes the art director at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce after Salvatore is fired. Before coming to the company, he worked at [[DDB Worldwide|DDB]], making unaired work for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s 1964 presidential campaign. In the beginning of his tenure, he and Peggy are often at odds with each other due to his abrasive and sometimes macho attitude, but the two develop a strong working relationship after Stan tries to intimidate Peggy by suggesting they work in the nude; Peggy calls his bluff and strips down, prompting Stan to concede victory to her. Stan is one of the few members of the SCDP creative department who survives the staff cuts.\n\nBy Season 5 the two are working well together, until the firm hires Michael Ginsberg, whose bombastic and somewhat sexist attitude is more in line with Stan's than Peggy's.\n\nIn Season 6, after Peggy leaves to join CGC, she and Stan maintain their friendship through late-night phone calls. Peggy's boss Ted Chaough overhears one such conversation, and Peggy relates Stan's news that Heinz ketchup is considering meetings; Chaough takes advantage of this and pressures Peggy to pitch a CGC campaign.  Although neither firm ultimately wins the account, a betrayed Stan gives Peggy the finger at a bar. After SCDP and CGC merge into SC&P, Stan and Peggy easily rebuild their friendship, and he is happy to be working with her again. In \"[[The Crash (Mad Men)|The Crash]]\", Stan is one of several employees injected with a stimulant by Jim Cutler's \"Dr. Feelgood\"  to boost creativity and spends an entire weekend intoxicated. During this time, he comes on to Peggy, who gently rejects him, and to whom reveals that his first cousin recently died in Vietnam. Peggy counsels him that loss cannot be dealt with by getting high and having sex. While Stan initially takes her advice, he is later discovered [[in flagrante delicto]] with Wendy Gleason, the hippie daughter of a recently deceased partner.\n\nSeveral episodes later in \"Favors\", Peggy telephones Stan in the middle of the night, waking him up, to plead for his assistance with a rat in her apartment. When he refuses, she teasingly offers to \"make it worth his while,\" but he still refuses, as he is currently in bed with a nude sleeping woman. The camera also reveals a large poster of [[Moshe Dayan]] over Stan's bed.\n\nIn the Season 6 finale \"In Care Of\", SC&P have landed the California-based [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist]]. Stan approaches Don, requesting permission to go to California and start a fledgling branch of the firm. Don warns him that it would basically mean demotion and work on only one account, but Stan is adamant. Don is inspired by the idea, and instead of allowing Stan to go, proposes to the partners that he himself go to start the branch. Stan is infuriated by what he perceives as a betrayal on Don's part, although Don offers to let Stan come to California in a few months. Don later decides against going, and instead Pete Campbell and Ted Chaough go, without Stan.\n\nDuring the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|final episode]], after SCDP has been absorbed back into McCann, Stan and Peggy acknowledge their hitherto unspoken feelings for one-another, and Stan urges Peggy not to pursue Joan's offer to join her new agency, but rather remain at McCann with him. The final image of him is sharing an embrace with Peggy during a late evening working.\n\n=== Ted Chaough ===\n'''Ted Chaough''' ([[Kevin Rahm]]) (pronounced {{IPAc-en|t\u0283|\u0254\u02d0}}), is a self-proclaimed rival of Don Draper's in the advertising world. His agency, Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough (CGC), picks up Don's resigned accounts Clearasil and Belle Jolie, and is competing with Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce (SCDP) for an account with Honda in Season 4. Don tricks Ted into making an expensive presentation to Honda executives, which backfires on Ted as he violates Honda's presentation rules of no finished work or commercials. Though the two agencies are comparable in size, Chaough seems obsessed with competing against Don, behaving in a magnanimous and jesting manner whenever Don crosses Ted's path.  Ted tries to woo Pete Campbell over to his agency, but Pete remains loyal to Don. After Don writes a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' ad proclaiming that SCDP will be dropping business with cigarette companies for moral reasons, Ted makes a prank call to Don pretending to be [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. In Season 5, Ted recruits Peggy to leave SCDP and join his advertising firm as chief copywriter for $1,000 a year more than she had asked for. This time, Ted remains confident but is much less obnoxious than in his previous appearances; he doesn't tell Peggy how jealous he is of Don, and he appreciates her talent more than Don ever had. She accepts his offer, which in the [[The Phantom (Mad Men)|season finale]] has him assigning her a huge amount of material involving an account for cigarettes aimed at female consumers.\n\nIn Season 6, Peggy shares Stan's SCDP insider information with Ted, noting that the Heinz Ketchup executive had met surreptitiously with SCDP but there was friction between him and Heinz Beans executive Raymond Geiger, an SCDP client.  Ted sees an opportunity and pressures Peggy to \"find out everything you know about Heinz Ketchup.\" In \"To Have and To Hold\", Chaough's team encounters Don's in the hallway in front of the room where firms are making their Heinz pitches, and Don is shocked to see Peggy there. In the end, Heinz chooses a third (larger) firm, and Raymond Geiger drops SCDP because he feels betrayed.\n\nIn \"For Immediate Release,\" Ted and Don commiserate at a bar over their very low chances of winning the Chevy account, primarily due to the small size of their respective firms.  Don spontaneously comes up with, and pitches to Ted, the idea that they should combine their firms so as to have a shot at competing with the major ad agencies.  Ted agrees, and the two firms merge, much to the surprise of everyone concerned.  In this same episode, Ted surprises Peggy by kissing her.\n\nIn \"Man with a Plan\", Ted's management style is shown to clash with Don's, as the personable Ted tries to involve everyone and get their input, while Don primarily values his own opinion.  Don decides to assert his authority by getting Ted drunk and letting him humiliate himself at a subsequent creatives meeting.  Ted, however, gets his revenge by flying the two of them in his small plane to a Mohawk Airlines meeting despite the rainy, turbulent weather; Don is a visibly terrified passenger. The two men also clash over Peggy, with Don trying to get his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to take his side, while Ted tries to woo Peggy to his.\n\nUnhappy in his marriage, Ted meets with Peggy after the merger and expresses his interest in having a romantic relationship with her, but they agree that the relationship would be impossible given the circumstances. He also insists that because of his attraction to her, he must remain reserved in her presence. However, they ultimately begin a relationship and are not very subtle about it; they're seen giggling and paying attention only to each other in the office, which annoys many of their colleagues.\n\nAfter Don embarrasses Ted and Peggy in front of a client, Ted decides that he cannot be around Peggy anymore. However, seeing her dressed provocatively to go on a date with another man, Ted camps out at her door until she returns. He professes his love for her, they sleep together, and he makes plans to leave his family for her. However, by the next morning he changes his mind and pleads with Don to send him to California to work the new Sunkist account for SC&P.  Don agrees, and Ted says goodbye to a devastated Peggy.\n\nTed spends the first part of Season 7 completely adrift in California, badly missing New York and mostly ignored as an impotent figurehead in an office where the work that's getting done is entirely due to Pete's efforts. He hits rock bottom when flying Sunkist executives to a meeting, briefly turning off the engine as he considers crashing the plane before changing his mind. He isn't bothered by Sunkist's dismay, telling Jim Cutler, his partner from CGC, that he wants to be bought out of his SC&P partnership share, and he plans to vote for Jim's plan to fire Don over the nebulous breach of Don's contract. However, the combination of the huge windfall from Roger's McCann buyout offer and Don's pledge that Ted can come back East and simply do the hands-on work leads him to approve the sale. Ted reveals to Don late in Season 7 that he has divorced his wife and begun dating his former college girlfriend.\n\nTed is last seen in the 12th episode of Season 7, \"Lost Horizon\". SC&P has been absorbed by McCann Erickson, and Ted and Don are attending a meeting for Miller Beer with at least a dozen other McCann Creative Directors. When Don wanders out in the middle of an important meeting, Ted smiles to himself.\n\n=== Michael Ginsberg ===\n'''Michael Ginsberg''' ([[Ben Feldman (actor)|Ben Feldman]]) first appears in the Season 5 episode \"[[Tea Leaves (Mad Men)|Tea Leaves]]\"  when he is hired as a part-time copywriter by Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. He is initially hired to service the [[Mohawk Airlines]] account, and proves himself to be both prolific and innovative. He quickly becomes an essential part of the creative team and surpasses [[Peggy Olson]] midway through the season as the firm's most productive writer, when Peggy becomes mired in the [[Heinz Baked Beans|Heinz]] story arc. Ginsberg is an idiosyncratic, socially awkward character who tends to speak his mind, which both helps and hinders him. His position at the firm is threatened at times, including at his interview, when Peggy decides not to employ him for fear of his being too extroverted and idiosyncratic for Don's tastes. However, this decision is reversed by Roger, who has already told Mohawk they have taken Ginsberg on.\n\nThe quality of Ginsberg's work is his main asset, and he tells Peggy immediately following his interview that although he can be tough to handle, he is a natural copywriter. His pitching style is theatrical, and he often captivates his clients with his over-the-top performances and youthful vigor. In this respect, he stands out from the rest of the SCDP team, particularly Don and Peggy, who are quieter and more understated both in their copy and their presentation. As the season goes on, Ginsberg's socially awkward, tone-deaf genius and refusal to follow orders begin to create resentment in both Don and Peggy, leading to a conflict between Ginsberg and Don in the Season 5 episode \"[[Dark Shadows (Mad Men)|Dark Shadows]]\", when Don decides to submit his own work for an account instead of Ginsberg's. The episode reveals Ginsberg's competitive side, which had been rarely evident until then.\n\nGinsberg is [[Jewish]], and he lives with his adoptive father Morris in [[Brooklyn]].<!--Not in Firger--> In \"[[Far Away Places (Mad Men)|Far Away Places]]\", he reveals to Peggy that he was told he was born in a [[concentration camp]] during [[World War II]],<ref name=Finger>{{cite web|author=Firger, Jessica|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mad-men-takes-on-mental-illness/ ||title=\"Mad Men\" takes on mental illness: How realistic?|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=2014-05-12|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref> and that his father found him in a Swedish orphanage at age 5. He also claims to be a Martian who is waiting for orders from above, but whether this is a genuine belief, a particularly straight-faced joke, or an expression of psychological estrangement from society resulting from his personal history, remains ambiguous. Ginsberg appears to have a difficult relationship with his father, who is overbearing and physically dominates him.\n\nRoger takes a liking to Ginsberg when he discovers they share a common desire to throw something out of their skyscraper windows, and Roger thereafter canvasses Ginsberg's support to help him with the [[Manischewitz]] account, which he is trying to bring to SCDP.  With Peggy's departure from SCDP in \"[[Lady Lazarus (Mad Men)|Lady Lazarus]]\", Ginsberg's position as copywriter is further elevated, and he becomes one of the two full-time copywriters at the firm, both of whom report to Don.  However, in the season finale \"[[The Phantom (Mad Men)|The Phantom]]\", Ginsberg and Stan struggle to make the same impression on clients that Peggy did, and Don does not back their ideas the way he did hers, frustrating them.\n\nIn Season 6, Ginsberg is shown to have embraced more of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]], and grows a thick moustache while dressing less formally. With the merger of SCDP and CGC, Peggy once again becomes his superior. His politics come to a head when, during an argument with partner Jim Cutler, Ginsberg denounces [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]] for the use of its [[Napalm]] in Vietnam. Cutler angrily criticizes Ginsberg as a hypocrite for abhorring Dow's policies and yet accepting paychecks from them.\n\nGinsberg's father later sets him up on a blind date, but he immediately botches it through being socially awkward and admitting that he is still a virgin. His behavior and manners continue to be erratic and begin to deteriorate throughout the season, culminating in a psychotic breakdown brought on by the installation of an IBM computer in the old creative breakroom in \"The Runaways\". After the computer is installed at SC&P, Ginsberg becomes convinced that the computer has a plan to destroy the human race, and that it is doing so by turning those within its proximity into homosexuals thereby eradicating the possibility of female fertilization. Convinced that this is true, he arrives at Peggy's apartment to escape from it in order to do his work, but later wakes Peggy in order to 'reproduce' and therefore beat the machine. The next day he gives Peggy his severed nipple as an apology, explaining that since his nipple is a valve and he has now removed it, the computer's vibrations can now flow through him and he will not need to use Peggy as an outlet. Ginsberg is removed from the building tied to a stretcher, leaving Peggy in tears and Stan in shock. It is later mentioned that Ginsberg's father had him [[mental hospital|institutionalized]].\n\nJessica Firger of [[CBS News]] wrote that the \"centerpiece of his psychosis\" is being afraid of having computers take over for humans and that \"In retrospect, the clues to his unraveling had been accumulating for some time.\"<ref name=Finger/> Feldman expressed surprise upon learning of the final story arc, stating \"my jaw just dropped to the floor\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mad-men-ben-feldman-talks-ginsberg-breakdown/|title=\"Mad Men\" actor Ben Feldman talks Ginsberg's breakdown|work=[[CBS News]]|date=2014-05-13|accessdate=2020-04-09}}</ref> Psychiatrist Dr. Paul Puri analyzed the character and suggested that his repressed homosexuality may have contributed to his self-mutilation.<ref>{{cite web|author=Watkins, Gwynne|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/05/psychiatrist-analyzes-mad-mens-ginsberg.html|title=A Psychiatrist Analyzes ''Mad Men''\u2019s Michael Ginsberg|work=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=2013-05-13|accessdate=2020-04-24}}</ref> Holly Eagleson, in ''[[TakePart]]'', argued that the story made the mental illness too dramatic and out of line with what schizophrenia sufferers experience and that this could lead to unnecessary stigma.<ref>{{cite web|author=Eagleson, Holly|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/05/14/mad-men-mental-illness/|title=\u2018Mad Men\u2019 and the Trouble With Mental Illness as a Plotline|website=[[TakePart]]|publisher=[[Participant Media]]|accessdate=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Bobby Draper ===\n'''Robert \"Bobby\" Draper''' ([[Maxwell Huckabee]] in season 1; Aaron Hart in seasons 1 and 2; [[Jared S. Gilmore]] in seasons 3 and 4; and [[Mason Vale Cotton]] in seasons 5, 6 and 7) is Don and Betty Draper's middle child. His mother referred to him as a \"little liar.\" Bobby was mentioned as being 5 years old in the Season 2 episode \"[[The Mountain King (Mad Men)|The Mountain King]],\" and 7 years old in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (Mad Men)|The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]\", making his birthday between March and September 1957. Due to many of the Draper story lines focusing on Don, Betty and Sally, Bobby does not have much of a role in the early seasons. He is depicted as being clumsy and accident-prone, such as burning his lip on a hot stove. When Betty urges Don to spank Bobby for damaging the radio, he opts to scold the boy rather than resorting to physical punishment; he later reveals that he is reluctant to use corporal punishment on Bobby because his own father beat him badly very often, and the only thing it accomplished was Don spending time thinking of ways to murder his father.  After the Drapers divorce, Bobby gradually becomes close to his stepfather, Henry Francis, and he is treated kindly by Don's new wife, Megan. During Season 6, Bobby's character is expanded; he shown to be sympathetic towards blacks in the aftermath of [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr's assassination]], as well as expressing concern for Henry's safety. Don realizes that he has been missing out on his children's lives. By Season 7, Bobby is deeply troubled over Betty and Henry's arguments and fears they might divorce. He does not spend much time with his mother, but one day she agrees to help chaperone a field trip with his class. He is thrilled by his mother's involvement, but things sour when he trades his mother's sandwich for candy, which leads to her yelling at him and turning a cold shoulder to him for the rest of the day.\n\n== Recurring characters ==\n\n=== Allison ===\n'''Allison''' ([[Alexa Alemanni]]) was Don Draper's secretary, first at Sterling Cooper and later at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Allison was first seen as Sterling Cooper's receptionist. By Season 3, she had become Don Draper's secretary. Though her character was little developed during the first three seasons, she was depicted as being competent and friendly. In Season 2, after Don asked that Jane Siegel be removed as his secretary, Allison was installed as her replacement. In Season 3, she occasionally flirted with Ken, and during Joan's going-away party she was seen sitting on Ken's lap.  Although the sudden formation of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce was accomplished without Allison's knowledge (she declared that the agency had been robbed when she came into Don's office and discovered that it had been stripped over the weekend), SCDP hired her sometime during 1964, and she continued as Don's secretary. On the night of the office Christmas Party in 1964, Don asked Allison to bring him his apartment keys, which he had forgotten at work. Upon her entering his apartment, the drunken Don seduced Allison, and they had an impulsive sexual encounter. He attempted to forget about the affair but ended up hurting Allison when she realized he was going to pretend that nothing had happened. She continued to work for Don for several months, but in the fourth episode of Season 4, his continual avoidance of the topic finally led her to resign after she burst into tears at a focus group. When she asked Don for a recommendation letter and he suggested she write a glowing reference on his letterhead and he would sign it (which she perceived as insensitive), she snapped, throwing a brass cigarette dispenser at him that noisily shattered a glass picture frame and storming out of the office in tears. When Megan later made a pass at Don, she reassured him that she wouldn't behave like Allison the next morning. Allison's last name was never mentioned in the show and remains unknown.\n\n=== Lou Avery ===\n'''Lou Avery''' ([[Allan Havey]]) is first introduced in Season 6 as a creative executive at rival agency Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, competing with Don Draper and Roger Sterling for the Chevrolet account.  When Don is placed on indefinite leave of absence from Sterling Cooper & Partners at the end of Season 6, Lou is brought in as a replacement creative director-for-hire on a two-year contract.  As Don is exiting the SC&P offices after being told of his suspension, he runs into Lou and Duck Phillips; it is implied that Phillips coordinated the deal to bring Lou into SC&P in his role as a head hunter.  In Season 7, it is shown that Lou brings a very different working method to SC&P: he is more interested in getting a large amount of creative work done on rigid deadlines and tight budgets. He is also not very creative or daring and is very old-fashioned.  This causes tension with Peggy Olson, who is used to spending a lot of time on one pitch at a time until a creative breakthrough produces unique work, and Lou makes a point of ignoring Peggy's ideas,  shunting aside her efforts, and treating her condescendingly.  The members of the creative team under him do not respect him and he becomes an object of open ridicule when someone discovers that he writes and illustrates his own unpublished cartoon, Scout's Honor, full of hackneyed themes and unamusing punchlines. Lou later becomes upset when the partners allow Don to come back to work in the creative department and report to him, possibly recognizing how much better Don is at the job than he is.  Lou finds Don's presence a distraction, and assigns Peggy as Don's direct supervisor. When he and Jim Cutler seek out a major cigarette deal (knowing that winning it would allow them to get rid of Don, due to his previous anti-tobacco ad in the ''New York Times''), Lou is first angry when Don screws up the pitch meeting, then left ruined when they lose the cigarette deal anyway.  Jim (who has no particular loyalty to Lou) makes it clear he doesn't care that Lou's background is in tobacco, since it is now useless, and that Lou isn't that important to the company, and that he regards Lou as essentially hired help. Not getting to share in the McCann payout windfall, Lou later emerges as the powerless director of the California office, where he openly ignores his work to keep trying to sell his planned \"Scout's Honor\" cartoon. He does sell the idea to a Japanese company and plans a move to Tokyo, and calls Don to taunt him about how happy he is to be living his dream; Don is first panicked and disbelieving when he thinks a loser like Lou had the news about the McCann merger before him, but when he realizes the truth, he just blankly and insincerely wishes Lou well as the call ends.\n\n=== Joey Baird ===\n'''Joey Baird''' ([[Matt Long]]) is a freelance artist for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, first seen at the start of the fourth season. Joey and Peggy seem to enjoy working together, reenacting the \"[[Stan Freberg|John and Marsha]]\" comedy skit<ref>{{cite news|journal=The Boston Globe|title=Mad about \u2018John & Marsha\u2019|author=Don Aucoin, Globe Staff |date= July 31, 2010|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2010/07/31/mad_about_john__marsha/}}</ref> in a workroom and laughing. However, Joey is also rather crude, acts entitled, frequently makes insensitive remarks, and engages in actions that would be classified as [[sexual harassment]] later in the century. Additionally, Joey misinterprets Harry Crane's friendly offer to help him get acting jobs and to go out for coffee as homosexual advances.\n\nJoey is also anti-authoritarian and, while disrespectful behind Don and Lane's backs as some other SCDP employees are, is (unlike them) openly defiant of Joan. Things come to a head in \"[[The Summer Man]]\", when Joey reveals she reminds him of his mother, who he says is \"a Joan\" at her job: he speaks contemptuously about and to Joan, alleging she got her job by having sex with men in the office because she lacks any skills of her own, calls her a \"madame\" and a \"Shanghai whore,\" tells her she walks around the office like she \"want[s] to get raped\", and draws a pornographic picture of Joan and Lane Pryce engaged in [[oral sex]] and tapes it to the glass door of her office. Joan's efforts to control and admonish Joey herself fail to accomplish anything and Joey escalates his insulting and defiant behavior. She attempts to have Don and Lane handle him, emphasizing the problems with his work while indirectly referencing his transgressions toward her. However, her attempts to indirectly deal with the situation fail. At first, Peggy's repeated efforts to confront his sexist attitudes are as his peer, but Joey brushes her aside.\n\nPeggy ultimately shows Don the obscene drawing and, at his suggestion, empowers herself by ordering Joey as his superior to apologize to Joan and fires the shocked freelancer when he refuses to comply. However, in the aftermath, Joan is angry at Peggy about the firing because she perceives it as Peggy acting in order to \"look important\" and causing Joan to look like a \"glorified secretary\" lacking power, respect, or authority, and needing Peggy to fight her battles for her.\n\n=== Jimmy and Bobbie Barrett ===\n'''Bobbie Barrett''' ([[Melinda McGraw]]) is the wife and manager of comedian '''Jimmy Barrett''' (born Jimmy Bernstein) ([[Patrick Fischler]]), an [[insult comedy|insult comic]] (reminiscent of [[Don Rickles]]) whom the firm uses in their advertisements for [[Utz Quality Foods, Inc.|Utz]] Potato Chips. After Jimmy insults the wife of Utz's owner about her weight, Don has to intercede and ends up meeting Bobbie, who shrugs off her husband's behavior. After that meeting, Bobbie seduces Don, though he initially resists as he wants to remain faithful to his marriage vows, despite his previous infidelities. When Bobbie later (in a ladies' lounge at [[Lut\u00e8ce (restaurant)|Lut\u00e8ce]], where they and the Schillings are meeting for the apology) tries to get Don to pay more for the apology as her husband's pay-or-play contract does not require it, Don grabs her hair with one hand and puts the other up her skirt, then threatens to ruin Jimmy if he does not apologize, and with no financial bonus. Bobbie appears to enjoy the dominating treatment, and quickly signals her husband to apologize. Later, she comes to Don with a TV pitch called \"Grin and Barrett\", a ''[[Candid Camera]]''-type show, featuring her husband using his insult comic skills as the host. Don helps her arrange things, and they continue to see each other on the side, until the two are in a car accident that requires a cover story.\n\nThe two resume their affair after a brief hiatus following the accident, but Don breaks it off completely and abruptly, when Bobbie reveals to him that she and other women with whom Don has had affairs have been discussing his prowess as a lover. Upset to learn that he has a \"reputation\" and annoyed at his inability to control Bobbie, Don leaves her during the middle of a sexual encounter, while she is tied up. Later, during a party where Don, Jimmy, and their spouses are in attendance, Jimmy reveals to Betty that Don and Bobbie have had an affair, and Jimmy also confronts Don and gloats about the trouble he has just unleashed for Don. Betty is humiliated by the revelation; though Betty may have suspected affairs in the past, Don's affair with Bobbie appears to be the only one Betty has actually been confronted about, leading to a period of separation for her and Don. Don later encounters Jimmy in an underground casino and delivers a solid punch to Jimmy's face, knocking him off his feet, which Jimmy later disparages as \"nothing\".\n\n=== Bob Benson ===\n'''Bob Benson''' ([[James Wolk]]) is a recurring character in [[Mad Men (season 6)|season 6]]. A new hire in Accounts, he answers to Ken Cosgrove, although no one recalls having hired him. Bob's overly eager and helpful demeanor irritates many in the office and is interpreted as [[sycophant]]ic by Don, Pete, and Ken. Bob engages in practices such as always buying an extra coffee so he has one to give to others, sending a catered deli platter to [[The Doorway|Roger's mother's wake]], as well as hanging out on the lower floor of the office (Accounts is on the upper floor), looking for people to talk to, and in the reception area of Accounts, trying to be seen and (unsuccessfully) to appear busy. While at first these activities annoy people, eventually they bear fruit and gain Bob a stronger place in the firm. Bob is also shown listening to an LP audiobook of [[Frank Bettger]]'s ''How I Raised Myself From Failure to Success in Selling'' (1949) and using similar language to inspire his friend, Michael Ginsberg.\n\nIn \"Man with a Plan\",  Bob tactfully assists Joan when she is in pain due to an [[ovarian cyst]] and, displaying an ability to think quickly and a willingness to lie, tells the nurse that Joan has just ingested poison, resulting in Joan's receiving treatment immediately after her abdominal pain alone had failed to result in any treatment. A grateful Joan prevents his lay-off after SCDP merges with CGC, and Bob is later seen accompanying Joan and Kevin to the beach. \n\nBased on a comment made by Joan, Bob assists Pete Campbell in getting an experienced nurse for his now-ailing mother. Later, Benson intervenes in an argument between Michael Ginsberg and Jim Cutler, taking Cutler's side; his subsequent apology to Cutler leads Cutler to assign Bob to handle the Manischewitz account and give Bob a foot in the door with the Chevy business (although Bob doesn't seem to realize this is part of Cutler's efforts to stage a coup within the merged firm). \n\nWhen Pete voices concerns to Bob that the nurse Bob recommended, Manolo Colon, may be sexually abusing his mother and taking advantage of her dementia, Bob says Manolo doesn't date women and then hints heavily at his own romantic feelings for Pete, which Pete, repulsed, rejects.\n\nWhen Ken is injured and the senior partners assign Bob to take the lead on the Chevy account, where he would potentially be working closely with Pete, an angered Pete threatens Bob and is astonished when Bob threatens him in turn. Bob is later shown venting in fluent Castillian Spanish on the phone to Manolo about Pete's threatening Bob's future and saying it doesn't matter how nice Pete's mother is.\n\nPete proceeds to hire Duck Phillips to find Bob another job. Instead, Duck uncovers Bob's secret: much like Don Draper, Bob's adopted an assumed identity to compensate for an embarrassing and impoverished past. None of his college references check out, he's from a poor area of West Virginia, and he was the manservant of a leader of a blue blood firm&mdash;not an employee of the firm itself in the accounts department, as he had implied. Moreover, his name is likely a false one. Pete immediately thinks to expose Bob, but, having learned from his experience trying to expose Don years earlier, decides to call a truce with Bob and lays out some ground rules to control Bob instead.\n\nBob appears shocked when Pete tells him Manolo (aka Marcos Constantine) apparently eloped with Pete's mother, and she has \"fallen\" overboard and become lost at sea under mysterious circumstances. Pete flatly rejects the concept that Bob wasn't in on the situation and proceeds to try and strong-arm him out of Chevy's good graces. Bob, maintaining his innocence in the Manolo situation, manipulates Pete into making a fool of himself at Chevy's headquarters, thereby securing his own position. Around the same time, Roger Sterling sees that Bob is spending time with Joan and giving Kevin gifts. Roger confronts Bob and threatens him about his relationship with Joan, which Bob replies to by insisting that he and Joan are just \"buddies\". Bob is later seen carving the turkey at Joan's Thanksgiving dinner, to Roger's surprise.\n\nIn season 7, Bob Benson reappears. He is called by a GM executive ([[Matthew Glave]]) asking to be bailed out of jail, having been arrested for offering to fellate an undercover police officer. The executive warns Bob that Chevy's advertising is going to become an in-house project, and SC&P is going to lose the account, but assures him not to worry, as Buick will hire him to work for them in Detroit. This prompts Bob to propose marriage to Joan, who turns him down, stating that they both deserve to be with people they love, not spending their lives in \"an arrangement\". When Bob explains that he needs a wife to assuage the GM executives, Joan learns about the losing of the account but neglects to inform Roger, who is at first incensed, until he realizes it will be a blow for Jim Cutler and one he won't be able to avoid.\n\n=== Glen Bishop ===\n'''Glen Bishop''' ([[Marten Holden Weiner]], son of series creator [[Matthew Weiner]]) is the son of Betty's neighbor, Helen Bishop. Aged 9 in Season 1 (1960), he develops a crush on Betty. One evening, when she is babysitting him, he purposely walks in on her while she is using the bathroom and looks at her for several seconds.  He then later asks for a lock of her hair. She acquiesces, and when Helen discovers it, she angrily confronts Betty in a supermarket, telling her he is just a \"little boy\", causing an offended Betty to slap Helen across the face. Betty immediately leaves the market, and while her friend Francine offers her support, she also reveals that the incident has become a topic of neighborhood gossip. In Season 2, episode 10, \"The Inheritance\", Betty discovers that Glen has run away and has been living in the Draper's backyard playhouse for several days. Glen's father wants Glen to live with him and his new wife and baby, but Glen dislikes his stepmother and says she is mean. He also says his mother is only interested in her boyfriends, and that Glen brushes his little sister's teeth and puts her to bed. Glen and Betty comfort each other because they are both lonely and miserable. He tells Betty that he is there to rescue her. He proposes that Betty elope with him, but she instead calls his mother, which leads him to tell her he hates her.\n\nHe returns in Season 4, working for his father at a Christmas tree lot, where he encounters Sally Draper and fixates on her as a replacement for Betty, bonding with her over their now-shared experience as children in divorced families. After discovering that Sally hates living in her house with her mother, Glen breaks in with a friend and vandalizes it, but leaves Sally's room untouched and leaves a secret gift on her bed. Glen often mentions age-inappropriate things to Sally about divorce and tries to encourage her to be secretive.\n\nBetty finds out about Glen's friendship with Sally and forbids him to see her, even going so far as to fire her housekeeper Carla when Carla allows Glen to see Sally one last time before they move to Rye. Betty is partly jealous of her daughter, but also aware of Glen's propensity for unsettling behavior.\n\nHowever, in Season 5, it is revealed that Glen still speaks to Sally regularly on the telephone from his dorm at the [[Hotchkiss School]], even going so far as to meet clandestinely in New York. Glen is unpopular at school and is frequently picked on, with the entire lacrosse team urinating in his locker. Though he encourages the boys at school to believe Sally is his girlfriend, with whom he has snuck off campus to have sex, Sally and Glen agree their relationship is closer to that of siblings. In season 6, he and Rolo, a friend from Hotchkiss, bring alcohol when visiting Sally and her student hosts at Miss Porter's School. When Rolo makes an unwanted pass at Sally, she tells Glen, who attacks Rolo and they briefly fight before leaving. \n\nIn Season 7, an 18-year-old Glen visits the Francis residence to tell Sally he has a new job as a soldier. He recently graduated basic training and is awaiting assignment to advanced school. His revelation that he has enlisted angers Sally, who condemns him for reversing his earlier stance on the [[Kent State shootings]]. Sally asks if he is going to Vietnam, to which Glen says it looks likely, but he has not yet gotten any orders. Later, Glen returns to the house and talks to Betty, revealing he flunked out of school and joined the military to appease his stepfather. Unlike Sally, Betty considers Glen brave for enlisting.\n\n=== Helen Bishop ===\n'''Helen Bishop''' ([[Darby Stanchfield]]) is one of the Drapers' neighbors. She is a liberal divorc\u00e9e with two children and a [[Mount Holyoke College]] graduate. Helen works in a jewelry store and volunteers for [[John F. Kennedy]]'s presidential campaign. Her divorce and habit of taking long walks have made her the subject of gossip for women in the neighborhood. A further rift develops between Helen and Betty Draper when the former discovers that Betty has given Helen's son Glen a lock of hair while babysitting him one evening. When Helen confronts Betty at the grocery store, Betty slaps her across the face. It is later discovered that Glen ran away from his home to stay in the Drapers' playhouse in the hopes of eloping with Betty; however, Betty calls Helen to retrieve her son, much to Glen's dismay. Betty later confides in Helen about her brief separation from Don, and the two seem to reach some kind of understanding. Later, Helen remarries and sends Glen to a boarding school at her new husband's request.\n\n=== Ida Blankenship ===\n'''Ida Blankenship''' ([[Randee Heller]]) is Bert Cooper's long-serving secretary. She remains an unseen character until the fourth season, when Joan assigns her to be Don's secretary as punishment to him for having seduced and then ignored his previous secretary, Allison, causing her to have a breakdown at the office. An older woman, Miss Blankenship has a tendency to annoy Don and his co-workers with her salty attitude and eccentric work performance, though having been a secretary for over 40 years, she is quite experienced. Her blunt and cantankerous demeanor starkly contrasts with those of her predecessors and the firm's other secretaries. However, she is exactly the type of secretary Don needs, as she is not overawed by him and won't have an affair with him, which is the reason Joan assigned her to him. However, it is mentioned by Bert and Roger that she was rather attractive many years ago. In his tape recordings for his autobiography, Roger reveals he'd had an affair with Miss Blankenship when he was a very young man at the firm, which caused a rift between Cooper and himself. Roger implies she was sexually adventurous and aggressive, referring to her as the \"Queen of Perversions\". She is absent from the office for a brief time while she has cataract surgery.  She dies, suddenly and unexpectedly, at her desk at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce in the [[The Beautiful Girls (Mad Men)|ninth episode of Season 4]], at the age of 67. Heartbroken over her death, Bert goes out of his way to make sure she has a nicely written obituary, stating: \"She was born in 1898 in a barn. She died on the 37th floor of a skyscraper. She's an astronaut.\" .\n\nActress Randee Heller states she created Blankenship's New York Jewish accent from the memory of her Yiddish-speaking grandparents.\n\n=== Richard Burghoff ===\n'''Richard Burghoff''' ([[Bruce Greenwood]]) is a wealthy real estate mogul who becomes romantically involved with Joan in Season 7. After meeting Joan while she is in Los Angeles for business, he talks her into a date, which leads to a romantic encounter. A recently divorced, semi-retired millionaire with two grown children, Richard is exhilarated to be free to do as he pleases.  He flies to New York on a whim and continues pursuing Joan. Their second date ends badly when he learns of the existence of her young son and becomes angry at the thought of Joan having commitments that will not allow her to pursue the kind of freewheeling lifestyle he envisions for himself. The next day, he shows up at Joan's office and apologizes, and they begin a relationship.\n\nJoan continues seeing Richard and he comforts her when she begins to have problems transitioning to work at McCann Erickson, offering semi-jokingly to have a sexist co-worker beaten up. After she quits McCann, Joan spends an increasing amount of time with Richard, flying to [[Key West]] for a getaway and trying cocaine together. However, when she begins to plan a new business venture of her own, Richard becomes angry that she does not share his desire for a responsibility-free life. When Joan refuses to choose between her career and her relationship with him, he ends their relationship without saying goodbye.\n\n=== \u00c9mile Calvet ===\n'''\u00c9mile Calvet''' ([[Ronald Guttman]]) is Megan Calvet's blunt and arrogant father. \u00c9mile is an academic, an atheist, and a Marxist, and does not approve of Don. In \"[[At the Codfish Ball]]\", it is revealed that he has written a book and Marie believes he is having an affair with his graduate teaching assistant. He, in turn, seems bitter toward his wife, accusing her of infidelity; he is much closer to Megan than to Marie and urges Megan to pursue her dreams. Megan is frustrated with his politics, however, particularly with the attitudes he expresses following the assassinations of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy.\n\n===Marie Calvet===\n'''Marie Calvet''' ([[Julia Ormond]]) is Megan's mother; she has other children and 10 grandchildren. Attractive, yet vain and prickly, Marie has a strained relationship with her husband \u00c9mile, as well as both Megan and Don, and dismisses Megan's wishes to become an actress, telling her the acting school shouldn't exploit the hopeless and \"not every little girl gets to do what she wants; the world cannot support that many ballerinas.\" Marie has a short affair with Roger Sterling in Season 5; Sally discovers her fellating Roger at Don's award dinner in \"[[At the Codfish Ball]]\". Later, Roger wants Marie to watch out for him while he takes LSD, but Marie tells Roger he is \"too old\" to take LSD and she does not want to be his support; she then leaves him, causing Roger to take his second acid trip alone.\n\nIn season 6, Marie and Arnie Rosen flirt mildly and Roger suggests she accompany him and the Drapers to a business dinner with the coarse, crude Herb Rennet and his irritating wife, Peaches. Roger stands them up and an unhappy Marie makes insulting remarks in French about Peaches to Megan. When Roger phones the house later that night to talk business with Don, Marie answers the phone, insults Roger, and hangs up on him twice.\n\nIn season 7's \"New Business\", Marie meets Megan in New York to collect Megan's remaining possessions from Don's apartment as a result of their forthcoming divorce. After Megan leaves early for a lunch date and asks Marie to supervise the movers, Marie has them empty the apartment, removing Don's possessions as well as Megan's. Marie and Roger also resume their affair, which Megan learns of accidentally. She remains in New York after Megan returns to California, her marriage to \u00c9mile having apparently ended, as Roger notes in \"Time & Life\" that he is on his way to meet her for a date. By the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|final episode of season 7]], she and Roger have become a married couple and spend their honeymoon in France.\n\n=== Andrew and Dorothy Campbell ===\n'''Andrew Campbell''' ([[Christopher Allport]]) is Pete Campbell's father. He disapproves of Pete's profession and treats him with contempt. In [[Mad Men (season 2)|Season 2]], Andrew dies in the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 1]]; it is revealed that he has squandered his wife's fortune and family's inheritance on a lavish lifestyle and by donating large sums of money to [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] and the [[New York Botanical Garden|Botanical Garden]] to maintain the appearance that he is wealthy.\n\n'''Dorothy \"Dot\" Dyckman Campbell''' (Channing Chase) is Pete's somewhat detached mother who comes from a prominent New York City family. Pete hates his mother and jokes with his brother Bud about it, mentioning Hitchcock's [[Rope (film)|''Rope'']]. Dorothy greatly disapproves of Pete and Trudy's exploration into adoption, referring to orphans as \"someone else's discards\" and saying she will disinherit him if he adopts a child. Insulted, Pete reveals the truth about the family's fortunes to his mother, leaving her stunned. By Season 6 she suffers extensive memory lapses and is diagnosed with some form of dementia.  When Bud foists her upon Pete, he is upset and annoyed with the situation, and resorts to exploiting her illness to keep her under control. Pete eventually hires Manolo, a Spanish nurse recommended to him by Bob Benson. Manolo initially works out quite well, but Dorothy begins implying that they are involved in a satisfying sexual relationship. Pete fires Manolo for sexually assaulting his mother, much to Dorothy's fury. Bob tells Peter that Manolo is gay, leaving it ambiguous as to what is actually happening. In the season finale it is revealed Dorothy married Manolo on a cruise ship and later \"fell\" overboard, implying Manolo married her to receive her (non-existent) riches and pushed her from the ship. Pete and Bud accept that it would be too expensive to pursue justice against Manolo, telling each other that \"she's in the water, with Father,\" and \"she loved the sea.\"\n\n=== Bud and Judy Campbell ===\n'''Andrew \"Bud\" Campbell, Jr.''' (Rich Hutchman) and '''Judy''' (Miranda Lilley) are Pete's elder brother and sister-in-law. Bud is an accountant and is the strongly favored child of their parents &mdash;it is understood that he alone will inherit his father's fortune. It is further shown when following her husband's death, Dorothy Campbell refers to her sons as \"salt and pepper\". After the death of their father in \"[[Flight 1 (Mad Men)|Flight 1]]\", Bud reveals to Pete the precarious financial state their father created and arranges for the liquidation of their mother's assets so that she can live comfortably. Bud tells Pete that he and Judy have no plans to have children, and he lets slip to their mother Pete and Trudy's exploration of adoption. In Season 6, Bud is angry when Pete selects a third party investment bank to take SCDP public rather than involving his business. In the episode \"In Care Of\", Bud and Pete tacitly agree to not pursue a potentially costly investigation of Manolo Colon, after learning he had eloped with their mother, who disappeared off the cruise ship on which they were honeymooning.\n\n=== Tammy Campbell ===\n'''Tamsin \"Tammy\" Vogel Campbell''' is Pete and Trudy's only child. Tammy was born sometime between September 7 and 10, 1965, right after Labor Day weekend, after a long and difficult labor. The couple, who had difficulty conceiving, had consulted a fertility specialist and disagreed about whether or not to adopt, before Trudy's pregnancy was revealed in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Rejected (Mad Men)|The Rejected]]\" when Trudy's father accidentally spilled the beans by telling Pete that Trudy was pregnant; in the same conversation, Tom said he would give Pete $1,000 if the baby were a boy, and $500 if it were a girl. She is named a feminine variation of Thomas, after her maternal grandfather.\n\nUnbeknownst to Trudy, Tammy is not Pete's only child, as he fathered an unnamed baby boy in November 1960 with Peggy Olson, whom she placed up for adoption.\n\n=== Trudy Campbell ===\n'''Gertrude \"Trudy\" Campbell''' (n\u00e9e '''Vogel'''; [[Alison Brie]]) is Pete Campbell's wife. She met Pete when they were both in college (Pete was at [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] while Trudy attended [[Mount Holyoke College]].),  Trudy and Pete marry early in Season 1 and purchase an apartment on [[Park Avenue]], with the help of Trudy's parents. Trudy is dutiful to her husband, even when he asks her to visit an old beau to get a short story published. In Season 2, she expresses her desire to have a child, a desire Pete resists as he does not want to have children yet, unaware he already conceived a child with Peggy Olson. After discovering she has [[infertility|fertility problems]], Trudy wants to adopt a baby, but Pete balks. In Season 3, Trudy and Pete have a closer relationship than they did before and seem to work together as a team, though Pete blackmails a neighbor's au pair into having sex with him when Trudy is away on her summer vacation with her parents. This leads to the distraught au pair confessing the situation to her host father, who then threatens Pete. In turn, Pete tells Trudy she should never leave him for a long time, implying that it was her absence that led to him forcing an unwilling teen to have sex with him. In Season 4, Trudy becomes pregnant, a fact that Pete uses to secure the [[Vicks|Vicks Chemical]] account for the firm from his father-in-law, Tom Vogel. Later in the season, Trudy gives birth to a daughter, whom they name Tammy. In season 5, the couple has relocated to [[Cos Cob, Connecticut]], against the wishes of Pete, who prefers living in Manhattan, and while Trudy settles in as a suburban housewife, Pete experiences angst and insecurity, eventually having a brief affair with Beth Dawes ([[Alexis Bledel]]), the wife of a fellow commuter. Following an encounter with Beth's husband, Pete desires a [[pied-\u00e0-terre]] in Manhattan that he can use for affairs, though he tells Trudy he needs it for late nights at work. Trudy is reluctant at first, but finally agrees to let him have a bachelor pad in Manhattan, ostensibly for safety purposes but aware of the real reason. In Season 6, Pete has a sexual liaison with their neighbor, Brenda. Trudy is infuriated; she knew Pete would cheat on her but she expected him to be discreet and keep his affairs in Manhattan. She orders Pete to leave the house, though she refuses to admit defeat by divorcing him. Over the next several months, Pete visits and she gradually begins to accept him back, but she ends it again after Pete tells her that both he and her father have been frequenting the same brothel in Midtown (Tom had previously withdrawn the Vicks accounts, banking on the fact that Trudy would believe him over Pete). While she is polite to Pete when he says goodbye to her and Tammy before his move to Los Angeles at the end of Season 6, she responds forcefully when Pete hypocritically snaps at her for staying out late on a date in Season 7, stating that Pete is \"no longer a part of this family.\" She reluctantly asks Pete for help when their daughter is denied admission at a prestigious preschool and opens up to him about how she is lonely and feels unattractive, leading Pete to compliment her and part on cordial terms. In the penultimate episode, Pete is offered a job in Wichita and asks Trudy for reconciliation and come with him. Trudy refuses at first, admitting she still loves him but cannot forget his adultery. However, Pete insists and Trudy agrees, and the two rekindle their marriage. They are last seen with Tammy as they board a flight to Wichita.\n\n=== Carla ===\n'''Carla''' ([[Deborah Lacey]]) is a black woman who has worked as housekeeper for the Draper household since Sally's birth. Carla is shown to be the true maternal influence in Sally and Bobby's lives and is seen watching the children for extended periods of time, such as when Betty dashes off to Nevada with Henry to seek a quick divorce from Don. Throughout the first three seasons, Carla tries to offer marital advice to Betty. She continues to work for Betty after the latter divorces Don and marries Henry Francis, until being fired for allowing Glen Bishop to visit Sally. Carla later telephones Henry for a reference because Betty would not give her a written one for her job search. Though her character is often on the show's periphery, Carla has far more insight into the issues surrounding Don and Betty's marriage than perhaps anyone else. A silent critic of the couple's behavior, it is apparent that Carla recognizes how Don and Betty's relationship is affecting the development of their children.\n\n===Caroline===\n'''Caroline''' ([[Beth Hall]]) is Roger Sterling's longtime secretary, first appearing in Season 4's \"[[Christmas Comes But Once a Year (Mad Men)|Christmas Comes But Once a Year]]\". She is very well liked by nearly everyone at SCDP and is extremely loyal to Roger, being apparently close enough to him that she is able to speak her mind to him when she feels he is out of line. She is also close to Roger's family, becoming very upset when she learns of [[The Doorway|Roger's mother's passing]]. Of the secretaries at SCDP, she seems to be the one closest to Joan.\n\n=== Dawn Chambers ===\n'''Dawn Chambers''' ([[Teyonah Parris]]) becomes Don Draper's new secretary in Season 5. She is the only black employee at SCDP, hired after [[A Little Kiss|the firm places an \"equal opportunity employer\" ad in a stunt]] against rival firm [[Young and Rubicam|Y&R]]. She is befriended by Peggy Olson in the fourth episode of Season 5, \"[[Mystery Date (Mad Men)|Mystery Date]]\", after Peggy lets Dawn stay with her when she discovers Dawn has been sleeping in Don's office due to concerns of racial tensions near Dawn's apartment in Harlem. Dawn proves herself competent at her job and develops a good working relationship with Don. In the Season 6 episode \"To Have and to Hold,\" Joan reprimands Dawn for covering for Harry Crane's secretary by punching her out five hours after the secretary had already left the building. Dawn becomes panicked by the accusation, as she feels she is perpetually at risk of being fired, and she proposes that Joan dock her pay. Quietly impressed and unable to fire Dawn without causing issues for the firm, Joan \"punishes\" Dawn by putting her in charge of the stockroom and time cards. Little is initially known about Dawn, but in \"To Have and to Hold\", it is revealed, through a conversation with her best friend, that she feels lonely and alienated as the only black employee at SCDP and, due to her long hours there, she has little opportunity to date. She also comments on SCDP's dysfunctional work environment, where many people are mean to each other and women cry in the bathroom. In season 6's \"The Flood,\" Don and Joan, largely untouched by the struggles of the Civil Rights Movement, connect with the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King by empathizing with Dawn over the tragedy. Dawn seems bewildered by Joan's sympathetic hug and insists on remaining at work when Joan and Don suggest she go home. In season 7's \"A Day's Work\", Dawn is shown paying secret visits to Don's home to keep him apprised of the office activities while Don is on mandatory leave. Don's replacement, Lou Avery, demands that Joan assign him a new secretary due to her loyalty to Don. In the same episode, Joan decides to surrender her personnel management duties, and chooses Dawn to take over from her, a decision which also neatly resolves Lou and Bert Cooper's concerns about Dawn. Later episodes show Dawn conducting her new duties with aplomb, straining her relationship with Don.\n\nShe is last seen during season 7 episode \"Time & Life\" as her future following the absorption of SCDP into McCann is not revealed.\n\n=== Toni Charles ===\n'''Toni Charles''' ([[Naturi Naughton]]) is a black [[Playboy Bunny]] with whom Lane Pryce has an extramarital affair in Season 4, after his wife Rebecca and their son return to England. Lane seems to genuinely be in love with her, but their relationship comes to an abrupt end when Lane's father forces him to return to England and reconcile with Rebecca.\n\n=== Clara ===\n'''Clara''' ([[Alexandra Ella]]) is Pete Campbell's secretary, first appearing during Season 3. She is well regarded and remains professional and unfazed by Pete's frequent angry outbursts and verbal abuse, which are often directed toward her.\n\n===Manolo Colon===\n'''Manolo Colon''' (aka '''Marcus Constantine''') ([[Andres Faucher]]) is a con-artist associate of Bob Benson's whom Bob convinces Pete Campbell to hire in Season 6 as a personal nurse to Campbell's mother, Dorothy, after she begins to show signs of dementia. He is fired by Campbell after being suspected of sexually abusing Dorothy but remains in contact with her. They eventually marry on a cruise ship before he murders her by throwing her overboard in hopes of inheriting her wealth, which, unbeknownst to him (and, presumably, Bob), had been depleted by her late husband.\n\n=== Cynthia Cosgrove ===\n'''Cynthia Cosgrove''' ([[Larisa Oleynik]]) (n\u00e9e Baxter) is Ken Cosgrove's wife and the daughter of '''Ed''' ([[Ray Wise]]), the CEO of Corning. Cynthia is a New York society girl, who appears to have moved in the same Manhattan social circles as the presumably older Trudy Campbell, with whom she gets along well.  Ken calls Cynthia \"his life\" and does not want to use her or his future father-in-law to get business, claiming in Season 4 that he does not want to be like Pete Campbell. In the [[A Little Kiss|Season 5 premiere]], her character is listed during the credits as Cynthia Cosgrove, implying she and Ken were married between the fourth and fifth seasons. Cynthia appears as a background character in several episodes of Season 5. She is very supportive of Ken's work and his side hobby as an author. She and Ken live in [[Jackson Heights, Queens]]. In the third episode of Season 7, it is revealed that Cynthia and Ken now have an infant son, Edward.\n\n=== Jennifer Crane ===\n'''Jennifer Crane''' ([[Laura Regan]]) is Harry Crane's wife. Blonde and charismatic, Jennifer has the peculiarity of being a \"working wife\", at least until Season 3, holding a position as a supervisor at AT&T. She's from a working-class environment, which has helped her keep her husband grounded. Solitary and generous, Jennifer has often tried to \"fit in\" with the more sophisticated circle of people surrounding Harry's workplace and has an unspoken rivalry of sorts with Trudy Campbell. She briefly threw Harry out of the house when he confessed to having a one-night stand with one of the secretaries, Hildy, but the two soon reconciled. She and Harry are parents to a daughter, Beatrice Grace, born in 1962. Sometime between the fifth and sixth seasons, they have twin sons, Nathan and Steven. They later split up.\n\n=== Jim Cutler ===\n'''Jim Cutler''' ([[Harry Hamlin]]) is a partner at the (once) rival firm, Cutler, Gleason, and Chaough and a senior partner at the merged Sterling Cooper & Partners. He first appears in the sixth episode of Season 5, \"[[Far Away Places (Mad Men)|Far Away Places]]\". He is the equivalent of [[Roger Sterling]] at CGC and Peggy describes him as \"just like Roger but with bad breath.\" Cutler is usually courteous and mild-mannered, which belies his impatience and tendency for childlike escapades.\n\nOn one account, he brought his doctor to the newly merged SCDP-CGC office to give everyone a shot of \"super vitamins\" to help with their working over the weekend for Chevy. Instead of making everyone productive, the booster shot only made Cutler and Stan Rizzo hyperactive, and causes Don to fade in and out of consciousness. He also brought Frank Gleason's daughter Wendy to the office that weekend, shortly after her father's funeral, and later peeked on Stan and Wendy having sex.\n\nHe was part of the CGC team that was supposed to present to Chevy and vocally opposed the merger of SCDP and CGC, unless it would win them the account. In the Season 6 episode \"A Tale of Two Cities,\" it appeared as if Cutler still opposed the merger, resentful of his loss of absolute control in the office and feeling disrespected by Michael Ginsberg and annoyed by Bob Benson's constant meddling. He then assigns Bob Benson to Chevy in open defiance of Don and Roger. Ted Chaough, having noticed this, chided Cutler for dividing the firm. As a sort of peace offering and tactical move, Ted and Jim proposed a new name for the merged firms: Sterling Cooper & Partners, removing any partner name from CGC as a sign of goodwill and cooperation.\n\nCutler supports Don's suspension at the end of Season 6 and is openly opposed to his reinstatement, desiring to morph SC&P into a more technologically-driven marketing agency. When Roger negotiates the acquisition of SC&P by McCann-Erickson, Cutler is initially opposed, but eventually concedes, realizing the amount of money his share in the agency will bring him. In Season 7, his status is clarified by Roger, who confirms that Cutler took the cash payoff and retired from the company.\n\nCutler is a veteran of the [[Army Air Force]] and mentions that he participated in the [[Bombing of Dresden]] in February, 1945.\n\n=== Dale ===\n'''Dale''' (Mark Kelly) is a copywriter. He first appears in Episode 2 of Season 1 (\"[[Ladies Room (Mad Men)|Ladies Room]]\"), and reappears in Episode 1 of Season Two (\"[[For Those Who Think Young (Mad Men)|For Those Who Think Young]]\"), Episode 6 of Season 3 (\"[[Guy Walks into an Advertising Agency]]\"), and Episode 11 of Season 5 (\"[[The Other Woman (Mad Men)|The Other Woman]]\").\n\n=== Midge Daniels ===\n'''Midge Daniels''' ([[Rosemarie DeWitt]]) is an art illustrator engaged in an affair with Don Draper in Season 1. She is involved with [[Beat generation|beatniks]] and several proto-[[hippie]]s, smokes [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and makes several references to [[Jack Kerouac]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]]. It appears Midge has other lovers besides Don. When Don realizes she's in love with Roy, one of her beatnik friends, through a Polaroid he takes of the two, he ends their affair in \"[[The Hobo Code]]\" and gives her the bonus he received at work. She reappears in the Season 4 episode \"[[Blowing Smoke (Mad Men)|Blowing Smoke]]\" where she runs into Don at his office building, claiming to be there for a business meeting for her paintings. After inviting him back to her apartment to meet her husband, it is revealed that Midge tracked Don down to try and coax him into giving them money to fuel their heroin addiction, as well as to buy one of her paintings. Initially writing them a check for $300 for one of her paintings out of pity, Don instead gives Midge $120 in cash he had in his wallet following advances made by Midge and leaves with one of her paintings.\n\n=== Anna Draper ===\n'''Anna M. Draper''' ([[Melinda Page Hamilton]]) is the widow of the real Don Draper, the man whose identity Dick Whitman stole after Don's death during the Korean War. She has a noticeable limp as a result of polio and a sister named Patty (Susan Leslie), in whom the real Don Draper was interested before he married Anna. Anna tracks down Dick/Don while he is working as a used car salesman and confronts him about her husband. Dick/Don tells her he died, and despite the circumstances of their meeting, Don and Anna become close friends: he buys her a house in California, Anna often serves as an understanding confidante to Don, and he stays with her whenever he is in [[Los Angeles]]. When Don meets Betty, he gets a \"divorce\" from Anna in order to marry Betty. Don pays Anna another visit during a trip to California during the Season 4 episode \"[[The Good News (Mad Men)|The Good News]]\", during which she has a broken leg. Anna's sister Patty and college-aged niece Stephanie ([[Caity Lotz]]) are also staying with Anna during Don's visit to help care for Anna. After dinner out with Anna and Stephanie, Don attempts to make a move on Stephanie, who turns him down and informs him that Anna has terminal bone cancer, which devastates Don, and that Anna does not know about her diagnosis. Don angrily confronts Patty about this, offering to pay for any possible cancer treatments, but Patty tells him that she has consulted several doctors and confirmed that Anna's cancer is terminal, and asks that Don leave before he can inadvertently tell Anna about her cancer. Don agrees to leave but stays long enough to paint over Anna's water-stained wall, which Anna decorates with a painting of a flower and is signed \"Dick + Anna '64\" by Don. Later, in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Suitcase]]\", Don repeatedly avoids returning calls from Stephanie, falling asleep and dreaming of an apparition of Anna smiling and holding a suitcase. When he awakens the next morning, he finally returns Stephanie's call and learns that Anna had died the night before, and breaks down in front of Peggy Olson. Don later brings his children to Anna's house in the [[Tomorrowland (Mad Men)|finale of Season 4]], showing them the wall they had painted and introducing them to Stephanie, who gives Don Anna's engagement ring from the real Don Draper. It is Anna's death that then inspires Don to start a new life.\n\n=== Gene Draper ===\n'''Eugene Scott \"Gene\" Draper''' (Evan Londo) is Don and Betty Draper's youngest child. He was born during Season 3, on June 21, 1963, and is named after Betty's late father, [[List of Mad Men characters#Gene Hofstadt|Gene Hofstadt]]. His sister, Sally, first thinks that Gene is a reincarnation of their grandfather, as he is born shortly after their grandfather dies and is given the same room their grandfather had lived in, and is terrified of him, but she eventually grows to love her brother after Don comforts Sally and tells her that Gene is a baby and nobody knows who he is going to be yet. He speaks his first line in the [[A Little Kiss|premiere of Season 5]] (\u201cGood night, Daddy\u201d) and his second and last line in the penultimate episode of the series (\u201cNo\u201d).\n\n=== Abe Drexler ===\n'''Abe Drexler''' ([[Charlie Hofheimer]]) is Peggy Olson's boyfriend, beginning in Season 4. Abe, who is Jewish, is a freelance journalist with strongly expressed liberal/leftist political views.  He and Peggy first meet at a loft party in a sweatshop.  Another meeting is engineered by their mutual friend Joyce Ramsay, where Abe's progressive views on race, combined with his mild sexist attitude, rub Peggy the wrong way. When he brings her a piece he wrote condemning the capitalist attitudes of Wall Street, which names some of the firms with which Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce is contracted, Peggy loses her temper with Abe. In spite of this, they later reconcile and become a couple. In Season 5, Abe asks Peggy to move in together which, after some contemplation and Joan's encouragement, Peggy accepts. Despite some problems (including criticism from Peggy's mother, who objects both to the fact that Abe is not Catholic, as well as the fact that Peggy has chosen to live with a man to whom she is not married), they settle into a life together, eventually purchasing a run-down building on the Upper West Side midway through Season 6, which they renovate and live in. However, Abe proves incompetent at home repair, has far too lax of an attitude towards the crime in the neighborhood, and never tells the tenants to behave or be quiet, much to the chagrin of Peggy. He also refuses to identify a group of teenagers who stabbed him at the train station and instead turns it into an issue about race, further angering Peggy. Peggy and Abe become increasingly frustrated with the different directions their lives are taking, and after a serious incident in which Peggy accidentally stabs him, Abe ends the relationship.\n\n=== Suzanne Farrell ===\n'''Suzanne Farrell''' ([[Abigail Spencer]]) is Sally Draper's third grade teacher at the beginning of Season 3. She engages in an extended period of flirtation with Don, and they eventually enter into a sexual relationship after Sally has moved on to the next grade. She lives in an apartment above the garage of a single-family, detached house. Her younger brother, '''Danny''' ([[Marshall Allman]]), suffers from epileptic seizures and as a result has become something of a drifter, unable to keep a job for very long. At the end of Season 3, Don signals a desire to strengthen his and Suzanne's relationship, but his plans are scuttled when Betty unexpectedly returns home from a vacation and confronts Don about his past. She is not seen again and is the last person with whom Don has an affair while married to Betty.\n\n=== Lee Garner, Jr. ===\n'''Lee Garner, Jr.''' (Darren Pettie), is an executive at [[Lucky Strike]], a cigarette company with a very long relationship with Sterling Cooper that began with Roger's father. Boorish, bossy, boozy, and sexually predatory to both women and (secretly) men, Lee's behavior is accepted because his father runs Lucky Strike, which represents the lion's share of Sterling Cooper's business.\n\nIn Season 3, Lee Garner, Jr., sexually propositions Sal Romano, only to be rebuffed by the still-closeted man. Not taking the rejection lightly, Garner, Jr., uses his clout to have Sal fired from Sterling Cooper. As Don explains to Sal after Roger fires him, \"Lucky Strike can shut off our lights\" and the agency could thus not risk losing the account by defending Sal.<ref name=\"Wee Small Hours\">[http://www.amctv.com/shows/mad-men/episodes/season-3/wee-small-hours#episode-details-149 Mad Men - Wee Small Hours \u2013 AMC]. Amctv.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-23.</ref>\n\nGarner, in Season 4, invites himself to the SCDP 1964 Christmas party, forcing the company to overstep its tight budget in order to make the party a grander affair for their most important client. At the party, Garner gropes female employees and further humiliates Roger by forcing him to dress up in a Santa suit. Several months later, Garner abruptly informs Roger Sterling that Lucky Strike will be ending their business with SCDP, by going to [[BBDO]], sending the agency into crisis.\n\n===Lee Garner, Sr. ===\n'''Lee Garner, Sr.''' ([[John Cullum]]) is an executive at [[Lucky Strike]], a cigarette company with a very long relationship with Sterling Cooper. A proud, no-nonsense man in his seventies, he and Bert Cooper go way back. He eventually turns executive power over to his son due to health issues.\n\n=== Father Gill ===\n'''Father John Gill''' ([[Colin Hanks]]) is a young [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] in a visiting ministry at the church Peggy's family attends in [[Brooklyn]]. He first appears in the Season 2 episode \"[[Mad Men (season 2)#Episodes|Three Sundays]]\". The fact that he is a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit priest]] is indicated by the \"S.J.\" after his name on church bulletins in the same episode. He asks Peggy for advice about public speaking and advertising church events such as a youth dance after learning about her employment in advertising, and changes the style of his Palm Sunday sermon to include more colloquialisms and be more accessible to his congregation after listening to Peggy's criticisms; he later gives her a copy of the sermon. He learns about Peggy's pregnancy during the confession of Peggy's sister, Anita, and he appears to take an interest in bringing Peggy more fully into the church community. His progressiveness manifests itself at the end of \"[[Mad Men (season 2)#Episodes)|A Night to Remember]]\", when he pulls out a guitar and begins to sing a [[American folk music revival|folk]]-[[gospel music|gospel]] song. He subtly indicates to Peggy that he would hear her confession if she wished, stating that \"no sin is too great for God.\" Additionally, he expresses a desire for her to receive the [[Eucharist]]. However, Peggy is uncertain how involved she wishes to become in the church community and in the Catholic faith, although she appreciates Father Gill's friendship. Their relationship is a bit strained by the fact that Anita's confession, including the particulars of Peggy's pregnancy, was based on a mistaken assumption about the identity of the child's father. Peggy later confides to Don that her whole family believes he was the father because Don was the only non-family member to visit her in the hospital.\n\n=== Francine Hanson ===\n'''Francine Hanson''' ([[Anne Dudek]]) is one of Betty Draper's closest friends and neighbors in the first four seasons, before Betty moves from Ossining. Francine spends many afternoons gossiping with Betty about the neighborhood's newest resident, divorc\u00e9e Helen Bishop. Francine, who is married to Carlton Hanson, has a son named Ernie and is pregnant in Season 1, giving birth to a baby girl named Jessica. Francine confides to Betty that she thinks Carlton is having an affair. The clues\u2014secret phone calls to Manhattan and the fact that Carlton sleeps at the [[Waldorf Astoria|Waldorf]] two nights a week\u2014make her wish she could just poison him. Even Don is uncomfortable with Carlton, who confides his attraction to Jessica's young babysitter. By Season 2 the couple has reconciled somewhat; Carlton appears to have gained weight, and the insinuation is that food has become a substitute for womanizing. After Betty and her family leave Ossining, Francine appears only once, meeting Betty for lunch in the Season 7 episode \"Field Trip\", by which time she is working as a travel agent in [[Dobbs Ferry]].\n\n=== Brooks Stanford Hargrove ===\n'''Brooks Hargrove''' (Derek Ray) is the dutiful husband of [[Roger Sterling]]'s daughter Margaret.  They were married on November 23, 1963, the day after [[John Kennedy]] was assassinated. In the [[The Doorway|Season 6 premiere]], following Roger's mother's memorial service, Margaret asks her father to invest in Brooks' [[refrigerator car]] technology venture. Later in the season, she withdraws her Thanksgiving invitation because Roger declines to invest. In Season 7, Margaret abandons Brooks and their son Ellery to live in a commune in upstate New York. He is last seen watching the TV broadcast of the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing alongside Ellery, Roger, and Mona.\n\n=== Greg Harris ===\n'''Dr. Greg Harris''' ([[Samuel Page]]) is Joan's ex-husband, as of Season 5. During his engagement to Joan in Season 2, she brings him with her to Sterling Cooper to close up, at which time, feeling threatened by Joan's rapport with Roger, he rapes her on the floor of Don's office. After failing to become chief surgical resident because his brown-nosing and entitlement do not make up for his sub par surgical skills, he whines at length to Joan and insults her, and she smashes a vase over his skull. Greg later decides to join the Army, which is desperate for surgeons, not believing he may be shipped to the front line in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. He does not consult Joan prior to enlisting, but before leaving for basic training he states his desire to start a family. After basic training, Greg is sent directly to Vietnam. While there, he learns that Joan is pregnant, but is unaware that Roger Sterling is the father.\n\nIn Season 5, Greg returns from his initial deployment and is overjoyed to meet his new \"son\" Kevin, but tells Joan that he has been ordered to return to Vietnam for another year. However, at a homecoming dinner with Joan's mother and Greg's parents, it becomes clear that Greg volunteered to return, contrary to what he told Joan, preferring the status and respect his rank confers to being with his family. Joan is furious that he lied to her and made such an important decision without her, and tells him to leave and not come back.  When he tells her the army makes him feel like a \"good man\", she tells him he was never a good man, implicitly referencing the rape.  He storms out, and a few months later serves Joan with divorce papers at the office, humiliating and infuriating her.\n\nIt is revealed in the series finale that, following his divorce from Joan, Greg remarried and had twins with a nurse. He also disowned Kevin and refused to be involved in his upbringing in any way, despite still having no idea that Kevin is not his biological son.\n\n=== Conrad Hilton ===\n'''[[Conrad Hilton|Conrad \"Connie\" Hilton]]''' ([[Chelcie Ross]]) is the fictional portrayal of the real founder of the [[Hilton Hotels]] chain, one of the only times the show has portrayed historical personages in person. He first meets Don Draper, who initially presumes Conrad is a bartender, at a country club where Don is a guest at Roger Sterling's [[Kentucky Derby]] party and Connie is a guest at a wedding reception. They share their hardscrabble beginnings and laugh about Don's urinating in the trunks of fancy clients' cars at the roadhouse where he had worked as a valet.<ref>{{cite news|title=Parking Vs. Pop Culture: \u2018Mad Men\u2019|authors= Isaiah Mouw and Ben Bronsink|date=May 2011|journal=Parking today|url=http://www.parkingtoday.com/articledetails.php?id=1041}}</ref> Connie later seeks out Don's help with an advertising campaign, and thus becomes a Sterling Cooper client. Hilton is depicted as a demanding client and difficult to please; he is known to call Don during the middle of the night and to show up in Don's office unannounced. After sending Don to numerous Hilton properties throughout the country, Connie flies Don to meet him at the Hilton property in Rome, with Betty joining at the last minute to help put the property through its paces. Connie is behind Sterling Cooper's forcing Don to sign an employment contract with the agency.<ref>{{cite news|author=Alan Sepinwall|journal=What's Alan Watching?|date=September 27, 2009|title=Mad Men, \"Seven Twenty Three\": Looking at the sun burned my eyes out, now I'm blind|url=http://sepinwall.blogspot.com/2009/09/mad-men-seven-twenty-three-looking-at.html}}</ref> Don begins to see Connie as something of a father figure whom Don seeks to impress, but Connie is ultimately unsatisfied with Don's work. At the end of Season 3 he gives Don the heads-up that Putnam, Powell & Lowe, Sterling Cooper's parent agency, will be bought by McCann-Erickson. The two part ways vowing to try working again in the future, but Hilton never returns to the show even after the founding of the SCDP.\n\n=== Gene Hofstadt ===\n'''Eugene \"Gene\" Hofstadt''' ([[Ryan Cutrona]]) is Betty's elderly father, who does not approve of Don. A businessman of some kind in the [[Philadelphia]] area, and a veteran of [[World War I]], he first appeared in Season 1 when, several months after his wife's death, he began dating another woman, Gloria Massey, upsetting Betty. He married Gloria sometime between November 1960 and April 1962. In 1962, Gene suffered a series of strokes that left him with slowed facilities and short-term memory loss. He becomes repeatedly \"confused\", believing himself to be back in the army or in the midst of [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]; he once even fondled his daughter Betty, when he mistook her for his late wife.  He also becomes more openly critical of Don, berating him in front of others and accusing him of not appreciating Betty; Don later tells Betty that he and Gene have a kind of mutual hatred for each other. His declining health eventually leads to Gloria's leaving him in early 1963 and his coming to live with the Drapers, at Don's urging, in the Season 3 episode \"Love Among the Ruins\". He becomes especially close with his granddaughter, Sally Draper, before dying of a final stroke in June 1963 in the Season 3 episode \"The Arrangements\", shortly before his youngest grandchild is born. Betty names her new son \"Gene\" in honor of her late father.\n\n=== William and Judy Hofstadt ===\n'''William Hofstadt''' ([[Eric Ladin]]) is Betty Draper's younger brother. He and his wife '''Judy''' ([[Megan Henning]]) have three daughters. William and Betty disagree over the disposition of their father's house, since Betty does not want William to live there nor inherit the house, as well as arguing over how their father will be cared for as his health deteriorates. Although William is shown to be jealous of his father favoring Betty as a child, Judy seems to be a warm and kind caregiver for Gene. Don and Betty share a dislike of William and Judy for their selfishness and inability to control their unruly children.\n\nIn the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series finale]], despite Betty's strained relationship with William and Judy, she feels they should raise Bobby and Gene after she dies from lung cancer. While Don initially insists on retaking custody of his sons, and Sally believes that Henry is capable of raising the two boys alone, Betty opines that William and Judy look after them, as this will ensure the presence of a mother figure in their lives.\n\n=== Hollis ===\n'''Hollis''' (La Monde Byrd) is the black elevator operator in the Sterling Cooper building on Madison Avenue. He occasionally interacts with the Sterling Cooper staff. During the Season 1 episode \"[[Red in the Face]]\", Don pays Hollis to pretend the elevator is out of service in order to force Roger to climb the 23 flights of stairs to the office after an excessive lunch of oysters and martinis. Roger, having made the stairs, then meets the representatives of Richard Nixon's 1960 Presidential campaign in reception but vomits up his lunch on the floor due to the strain. He realizes that Don has exacted his revenge for making a pass at Betty, with Hollis's assistance.\n\nHis skin color becomes important on a number of occasions. In the Season 3 episode \"[[The Fog (Mad Men)|The Fog]]\", Pete tries to engage him in conversation about the product preferences of black people (for television brands), which Hollis is either uninterested in or sees as inappropriate. Pete however continues to push him by stopping the elevator and forcing Hollis to talk about the subject, knowing that Admiral television sets seem to sell well in \"Negro markets\". Hollis, while initially intimidated, is quick to respond to the issue of race, stating that, \"We have bigger things to think about than TV\". Pete is remorseful, but Hollis remains hardened.\n\nPaul, too, addresses Hollis in an uncharacteristically familiar fashion, ostentatiously introducing Hollis to Paul's black girlfriend, Sheila, and telling Hollis to call him \"Paul\" instead of \"Mr. Kinsey\" in the Season 2 episode \"The Inheritance\".  On the day that [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s death is announced in the Season 2 episode \"Six Month Leave\", Hollis expresses sympathy for her ex-husband [[Joe DiMaggio]], in contrast to many of Sterling Cooper's female characters who mourn Marilyn's loss, and male characters (such as Roger), who appear emotionally unaffected.\n\n===Gail Holloway===\n'''Gail Holloway''' ([[Christine Estabrook]]) is Joan's mother, who comes to stay with Joan after Joan's son Kevin is born. She first appears in the Season 5 premiere \"[[A Little Kiss]]\" and remains as a recurring character through much of the season; she again appears in numerous Season 6 episodes, beginning with \"To Have and to Hold\", as well as the Season 7 episode \"The Strategy\". Gail is supportive of Joan, but their relationship is somewhat tense. She does not understand why Joan would want to return to work, thinking she should instead be content to be a full-time wife and mother, and she makes several disparaging comments to that effect.  Joan, in turn, makes several references suggesting that Gail may have a drinking problem. Gail strikes up a flirtation with the apartment building's handyman, Apollo, of which Joan disapproves, until Apollo's wife forbids him to go to their apartment. Gail remains with Joan after Joan throws Greg out, but continues to be condescending about her daughter's job and failed marriage. She also frequently manipulates Joan's dependency on her to get her own way. In the Season 6 episode \"To Have and to Hold\", Gail surprises her daughter when she tells Joan's childhood friend Kate she is proud of her daughter having become a partner at a Madison Avenue firm. In \"Man with a Plan\", Gail advises Joan to accept Bob Benson's friendship (and possibly more), as not every act of kindness is a front.  Gail remained with Joan, though mostly off-camera during the second half of Season 7, continuing to look at after Kevin while Joan worked to establish her new company, Harris & Holloway; she appeared briefly in the series finale \"[[Person to Person (Mad Men)|Person to Person]]\", taking Kevin out to the park while Joan worked from home.\n\n=== John Hooker ===\n'''John Hooker''' ([[Ryan Cartwright]]), an Englishman, is Lane Pryce's assistant during Season 3. His title is \"secretary\", but he insists his status is higher than that of the other secretaries at Sterling Cooper, telling Joan, \"I'm Mr. Pryce's right arm; I'm not his typist.\" To this end, he asks that the switchboard operators address him as \"Mr. Hooker\" rather than just \"John\". He assumes Joan's position as office manager after her departure to become a housewife. A variety of Sterling Cooper employees refer to John as \"[[Miss Moneypenny|Moneypenny]]\", much to his chagrin.  His officious, self-important manner annoys nearly everyone in the office, particularly Joan and including Lane and Rebecca Pryce, who call him a \"toad\".  When the primary partners abandon the company to form Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, John is left to deal with the Putnam, Powell & Lowe executives, who are infuriated.\n\n===Mack Johnson===\n'''Mack Johnson''' (Morgan Rusler) is Dick and Adam Whitman's father figure following Archie's death, whom Don called \"Uncle Mack.\" In the aftermath of Archie's death, the Whitmans lost the family farm, and a pregnant Abigail Whitman took Dick to live with Mack and his wife, her sister. He first appears in the Season 1 episode \"[[Babylon (Mad Men)|Babylon]]\", in which Don flashes back to his brother's birth. In Season 6, it was revealed that Mack was the [[pimp]] of a brothel in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]]. In the Season 6 finale, Don attempts to be more honest about his life and shows his children where he grew up. While Abigail was cruel and spiteful to Dick, Mack was described as being nice to him. However, he is shown to not intervene on Dick's behalf in stopping Abigail's abusive treatment. According to Adam, Mack died shortly after Abigail's death from stomach cancer.\n\n=== Joy ===\n'''Joy''' ([[Laura Ramsey]]) is a young woman Don meets in California in the Season 2 episode, \"[[Mad Men (season 2)#ep24|The Jet Set]]\", for whom he impulsively abandons Pete and his business obligations.  She belongs to a group of wealthy, sexually liberal, bohemian tax exiles who live lavishly and travel from place to place but display no work ethic or means of support. Both Joy and her father seem attracted to Don. One of their entourage is a \"Doctor Feelgood\" type, whom Don fends off to avoid receiving an injection of an unknown substance, after Don collapses by the pool and comes to on Joy's couch. When Don asks Joy about a book she is reading, she explains she had enrolled in a literature class while staying in Rhode Island, but \"it was not for [her]\". During a late night skinny dip with Joy, Don meets her brother, who is estranged from his wife, and his children, who are roughly the same ages as Don's, and Don offers them his and Joy's bedroom. Though enticed to join the group in their travels, Don declines.\n\n=== Edna Keener ===\n'''Dr. Edna Keener''' (Patricia Bethune) is a child psychiatrist whom Betty takes Sally to see when her behavior at home becomes too much for Betty to handle. Betty also has short sessions with Dr. Edna, ostensibly to discuss Sally, though Betty uses them to discuss her own psychiatric issues. After making progress with Sally, Dr. Edna recommends reducing Sally's number of sessions per week, to which Betty objects. Dr. Edna suggests that Betty seek some psychiatric help with an adult psychiatrist, but Betty elliptically convinces Dr. Edna to continue reserving time for Betty to \"discuss Sally's progress\" with her in the Season 4 episode \"[[Blowing Smoke (Mad Men)|Blowing Smoke]]\".\n\n=== Gloria Massey ===\n'''Gloria Hofstadt''', n\u00e9e '''Massey''' (Darcy Shean), is Gene Hofstadt's second wife, whom her stepchildren Betty and William despise. Gloria tries to hide the extent of Gene's illness in Season 2. In Season 3, Gloria is not seen, but Betty's brother William discovers that Gloria, unable to deal with Gene's deteriorating condition and overall difficult demeanor, has left him and moved to [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]].\n\n=== John Mathis ===\n'''John \"Johnny\" Mathis''' ([[Trevor Einhorn]]) is a copywriter at Sterling, Cooper & Partners, appearing in Seasons 6 and 7. Defensive about his work, he endangers an account with [[Peter Pan (peanut butter)|Peter Pan]] by interrupting a meeting. Late in Season 7, he goes to Don for help in putting together a difficult pitch, but when he tries to copy Don's off-the-cuff style and it goes disastrously wrong, he furiously blames Don for his failure and snarls that Don only gets by on looks, and makes an ugly reference to Lee Garner Jr. being sexually attracted to Don. In response, Don tells Mathis to own his failures and garbage-mouth and then fires him, leading a defiant Mathis to sneer that he was right about not apologizing to Don.\n\n=== Guy MacKendrick ===\n\n'''Guy MacKendrick''' ([[Jamie Thomas King]]) is a confident, handsome, charismatic accounts executive of London-based advertising firm Putnam, Powell, and Lowe. A [[Cambridge University]] and [[London School of Economics]] graduate, he was brought in by PPL to take over the Sterling Cooper Advertising Agency. St. John Powell and Harold Ford expressed much enthusiasm for him. During the office party held in the Season 3 episode \"[[Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency]]\", Lois Sadler accidentally runs over MacKendrick's foot with a John Deere riding lawnmower. Joan Holloway saves his life by quickly placing a tourniquet on his leg; however he ultimately loses his foot. Because of this disfigurement, Powell and Ford decide that MacKendrick has no future with the firm and is fired. \n\n===Carol McCardy===\n'''Carol McCardy''' ([[Kate Norby]]) works at a literary agency and is Joan Holloway's roommate in Season 1. One night, she musters the courage to confess to Joan that she has loved her since they met the first week in college, but Joan pretends to ignore her romantic advances in favor of not spoiling their friendship.  She has moved out by the beginning of the Season 2 and is not referred to again.\n\n===Daisy McClusky===\n'''Daisy McClusky''' ([[Danielle Panabaker]]) is a stewardess for [[Northwest Airlines]]. She has recurring sexual relationship with Roger Sterling in Season 6 and notifies him when potential clients are on her flights, even detaining those clients until Roger arrives. Daisy's assistance has its limits, however, as she will not do anything that actually harms business, such as bump SCDP's rivals from her flights altogether. However, she does arrange for the luggage of rival admen to be temporarily \"lost\".\n\n=== Meredith ===\n'''Meredith''' ([[Stephanie Drake]]) is a secretary who first appears as SCDP's receptionist during Season 5. Her infantile mannerisms and scatterbrained demeanor annoy Joan, and the two eventually have an altercation in the Season 5 episode \"[[Christmas Waltz (Mad Men)|The Christmas Waltz]]\", after Meredith allows a process server into the office to serve Joan with divorce papers. She remains at SCDP, however, and briefly becomes Lou Avery's secretary after he complains about Dawn's continued loyalty to Don who was on involuntary leave from the agency. She becomes Don's secretary when he returns, and then when Don vanishes, she becomes one of two secretaries for Roger and moves with him to McCann-Erickson. She is let go by Roger in the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series finale]], as Don had not returned to work and two secretaries for Roger was unnecessary. She is optimistic even as she is let go as she claims \"there are better places than (McCann-Erickson).\"\n\n=== Faye Miller ===\n'''Dr. Faye Miller''' ([[Cara Buono]]) is a psychologist and freelance consultant who provides market research for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. She meets Don the day of the 1964 office Christmas party in the Season 4 episode \"[[Christmas Comes But Once a Year (Mad Men)|Christmas Comes But Once a Year]]\", and seems to immediately have multiple insights into Don's true character. She is a tough and independent \"modern woman\" whom Peggy admires.  Although she wears a wedding ring, she admits to Don this is merely a ruse to ward off unwanted advances. She later shares that her father, \"a handsome, two-bit gangster like [Don]\", owns a candy store and has friends and \"obligations\" connected to the mob. Don, after initially denigrating her approach to advertising and overhearing her lambaste an estranged lover on the phone, during which she reveals she does not cook and does not want to clean up after him, takes an interest in her. Eventually, the two embark on a secret romantic relationship, during which time Don expresses admiration for her work. When Sally stows away on a train and a stranger brings her to Don's office, Faye reveals her discomfort with children and, although Sally liked her, her fear that she'd failed some test, as a result. Don later confides to Faye about his past as Dick Whitman and his fears the security clearance investigation Pete's defense industry client has ordered will expose and ruin him, to which Faye advises him to face the problem and come clean. Faye severs ties with SCDP after Don submits a full-page ad to ''The New York Times'' saying SCDP will no longer work with tobacco companies, as her firm continues to do so.  He also convinces her to put her ethics aside and breach the \"Chinese wall\" to use her connections to try to get his struggling firm meetings with clients; her partner secures a meeting with a tobacco company, which falls through, and she secures a meeting with Heinz Beans, for whose advertising campaign Megan Calvet Draper and Peggy Olson ultimately win a Clio Award.  While in a relationship with Faye, he begins a relationship with Megan, then impulsively becomes engaged to her, leading to him breaking off his relationship with Faye, who is older, more worldly, and more accomplished professionally but lacks Megan's rapport with Don's children and whose insights into Don's character Don finds unsettling.  Faye is extremely upset by the news and tells Don he \"only like[s] the beginnings of things\".\n\n\n===Katherine Olson===\n'''Katherine Olson''' ([[Myra Turley]]) is Peggy and Anita's mother. Peggy's relationship with her mother is strained, as Katherine does not understand Peggy's focus on her career rather than on finding a husband and has not forgiven her daughter for having a child out of wedlock. Old-fashioned and harsh, she disapproves of Peggy's decisions to move to Manhattan and later, to live with Abe. Not so much because of their religious differences, rather her nihilistic view that Abe's relationship with Peggy is merely practice for the real family he will someday have with someone else. She harshly tells her daughter that loneliness is no excuse for shacking up and to simply buy a series of cats for companionship until she dies. A devout Catholic, Katherine is vocally critical of Father Gill's style of preaching and informal grace at dinner during the Season 2 episode \"Three Sundays\".\n\n=== Burt Peterson ===\n'''Burt Peterson''' ([[Michael Gaston]]) is Head of Accounts at Sterling Cooper until 1963, when Roger Sterling fires him in the Season 3 premier \"[[Mad Men (season 3)|Out of Town]]\" at Lane Pryce's instigation. Peterson reacts very negatively as he had recently been struggling with his wife's cancer treatments, which had caused PPL to delay firing him and lulling him into a false sense of security since he had survived the various waves of firings. He bursts out in an angry tantrum after his firing, sweeping the items on people's desks onto the floor, breaking them, and then throwing things around his own office, to the sounds of many crashes. At some point later, he becomes employed by CGC. When SCDP and CGC merge, he is again fired by Roger in the Season 6 episode \"[[Mad Men (season 6)|Man With a Plan]]\".  Roger takes great pleasure in firing Burt again, due to the bridge-burning way Burt behaved the last time he was fired. Duck Phillips later tells Pete Campbell that he used his new job as a headhunter to find Burt a Senior Vice President position at the high-powered McCann Erickson advertising agency.\n\n=== Duck Phillips ===\n'''Herman \"Duck\" Phillips''' ([[Mark Moses]]) was director of account services for a time at Sterling Cooper. In the Season 1 episode \"[[Indian Summer (Mad Men)|Indian Summer]]\", when Don Draper is made partner in the wake of Roger Sterling's heart attack, Bert Cooper gives Draper the authority to appoint a new head of account services. At the end of the Season 1, Draper brings in Phillips, who is looking for a job after alcoholism and an extramarital affair ended his career at [[Young & Rubicam|Y&R]]'s [[London]] office. Phillips appears to be a recovering alcoholic whose ex-wife and children are moving on with their lives. Phillips immediately challenges Sterling Cooper to broaden their clientele, seeking to attract airlines, automobile manufacturers, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nAt the beginning of Season 2, Phillips pushes the agency to hire younger creative talent, a move Draper resists. He also pushes Cooper to pursue [[American Airlines]] in the wake of that airline's very public [[American Airlines Flight 1|Flight 1 plane crash]], forcing Draper to break his word and cut loose a client, [[Mohawk Airlines]], in order to pursue the larger American Airlines. This event is emblematic of the subsequent relationship between the two: despite the fact that he risked Pete Campbell's revealing his true identity to get Duck hired, Don clashes with Duck throughout the season, as Don's belief in loyalty to both clients and employees is at odds with Duck's pragmatic and utilitarian approach to business. He also continues to struggle to stay sober, going so far as to abandon his family's dog, which his children have left with him after moving to a different state, to avoid painful memories. At the end of Season 2, frustrated with his failure to make partner, Phillips goes to some of his former London colleagues to arrange a merger of Sterling Cooper with the British firm Putnam, Powell & Lowe, which wants to establish a New York office. The merger is successful, but one of the PP&L executives, St. John Powell goads Duck into drinking alcohol to seal the deal, breaking his sobriety. Phillips is named president of Sterling Cooper, but he embarrasses himself in a drunken rant when Draper announces his intention to leave the firm, securing his own dismissal.\n\nDuring Season 3, it is revealed Duck, apparently sober once more, is now working at [[Grey Global Group|Grey]], another New York agency. He tries unsuccessfully to poach Pete and Peggy from Sterling Cooper, which leads to a sexual relationship with Peggy. They are in bed together when they learn of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination on November 22, 1963.\n\nHe later resurfaces in the Season 4 episode \"[[Waldorf Stories]]\" at the [[Clio Awards]] Show where he drunkenly heckles the man giving the introductory speech, prompting security to remove him. Upon witnessing this, Sterling jokes: \"I miss working with that guy\". During  the Season 4 episode \"[[The Suitcase]]\", Duck unsuccessfully tries to branch out on his own after being fired from Grey, attempting to create his own female consumer products-based ad agency. He goes so far as to try to hire Peggy as Creative Director, sending her business cards with her name and title on them. It becomes clear that he is desperate both personally and career-wise and needs Peggy for both reasons, and she refuses to go along with it. During a late night at SCDP, Peggy catches a drunk Duck spitefully trying to defecate on Roger Sterling's sofa chair, mistaking it for Don's. While Peggy is walking Duck out, a drunk Don catches him in the offices. Don confronts him, and he and Duck get into a brief and comical brawl, which Duck wins. Duck states he is a former [[United States Marine]] officer and served in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] during [[World War II]], claiming to have killed \"17 men\" during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. Peggy escorts Duck out, later telling Don she turned to Duck because she was having a \"confusing time.\"\n\nIn Season 6, a sober Duck reappears as an independent headhunter for various advertising agencies, with whom Harry Crane recommends to Pete that he meet. Duck explains to Pete that the merger between SCDP and CGC has left confusion in the management structure, which has left Pete's role unclear and therefore it is difficult for Duck to find prominent positions for Pete in New York. He tells Pete how he turned his life around by concentrating on his family life, so that he had something to give himself pride when he hit rock bottom. He advises Pete to concentrate on managing his own family life in order to help manage his professional career, and that if he does better for himself at the newly merged company, Duck can find better positions for him in New York.\n\nPete later asks for Duck's help in getting rid of Bob Benson, hiring Duck to find Bob a position at another agency. Duck asks Pete if the agency is in need of another account man, but Pete makes it clear that Duck's previous antagonism with Don will prevent the firm from hiring him. Duck eventually discovers that \"Bob Benson\" is an alias, and that the man's entire identity is fabricated, with the only prior job on record under Bob's name being that of a manservant to an executive at another agency. Pete had not realized this because no one at SCDP had ever bothered to check any of Bob's references.\n\nIn the Season 6 finale, Duck Phillips is seen entering SC&P with Lou Avery, Don's eventual replacement as Creative Director, just after Don is told to take a few months leave. Duck and Lou meet Don as Don is on his way out of the building. Despite their antagonistic history, Duck apologizes to Don for arriving before Don had left.\n\nDuck returns in the penultimate episode of Season 7 \"The Milk and Honey Route\" to successfully recruit Pete to Learjet. He is depicted as a determined, if slightly desperate, headhunter who is drinking excessively again, or has possibly used his drunken persona to extract empathy from Pete.\n\n=== Phoebe ===\n'''Phoebe''' ([[Nora Zehetner]]) is a nurse who lives down the hall from Don Draper's Greenwich Village apartment. She invites Don to her Christmas party and, later, when she finds him unsteadily trying to unlock his apartment door, she helps him to bed and fends off a pass from him. She confides that her father was also an alcoholic. Don hires her to watch Sally and Bobby one evening, when he is out with Bethany Van Nuys. Unfortunately, Sally cuts her own hair while on Phoebe's watch, angering Don, who has to deal with the aftermath from Betty.\n\n=== St. John Powell ===\n'''St. John Powell''' ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]) is the managing director of London-based advertising firm Putnam, Powell, and Lowe (\"PPL\"). In Season 2, Duck Phillips meets with Powell and Alec Martin, first to ask for a job,  and then, when that is rejected, to propose that PPL buy out Sterling Cooper. At that meeting, Powell goads Duck into drinking alcohol, breaking Duck's sobriety. Powell eventually makes an offer that is accepted. At the end of Season 2, Powell and Martin witness Duck's drunken rant against Don, which results in Duck being pushed out of Sterling Cooper. Powell is the architect of PPL's sale to [[McCann Erickson]], keeping the information from Lane Pryce and the rest of the Sterling Cooper staff. After Pryce fires Roger, Bertram Cooper, and Don in order to void the non-compete clauses in their contracts and allow them to start their own agency and bring Pryce along as a fourth partner, a furious Powell fires Pryce for \"lack of character\" in the Season 3 finale \"[[Shut the Door. Have a Seat.]]\", playing right into Pryce's hands.\n\n=== Rebecca Pryce ===\n'''Rebecca Pryce''' ([[Embeth Davidtz]]) is Lane Pryce's wife of 18 years. Born to an upperclass British family, she's stylish and polite, though a bit snobbish and self-involved. She follows Lane to New York in Season 3 but suffers the strain of [[culture shock]], and by Season 4 she returns to London, with their son, Nigel, in tow. After a brief separation, and Lane's infidelity with a black [[Playboy Bunny]], they apparently smooth over their problems, and Rebecca moves back to New York to reconcile. She is stunned by his suicide and combines her genuine grief over losing him and the general contempt she viewed him with when she angrily tells an apologetic Don that SCDP is at fault because they filled \"a man like that with ambition\". She also astutely realizes the US$50,000 check Don gives her, reimbursing Lane's partnership fee, is worth less than Lane's contributions to the firm, although she's not aware that SCDP actually got over $200,000 from insurance that covered them in case any of the partners died, about which Don does not inform her.\n\n=== Robert Pryce ===\n'''Robert Pryce''' ([[W. Morgan Sheppard]]) is Lane Pryce's stern father. Originally from a middle class British background, he is a retired surgical equipment supplier. He has a complicated love/hate relationship with his son, whom he dominates, sometimes by physically violent means, in order to make him \"take action and sort his problems\" so as to \"put his house in order\". Lane once described him to Don as \"one of those alcoholics that thinks he's collecting.\"\n\n=== Joyce Ramsay ===\n'''Joyce Ramsay''' ([[Zosia Mamet]]) works as an assistant photo editor at ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in the [[Time-Life Building]], where Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce is located. Peggy meets her in the elevator in the Season 4 episode \"[[The Rejected (Mad Men)|The Rejected]]\" and the two quickly become friends; Joyce introduces Peggy to the counter-culture scene of the early 1960s. Joyce is a lesbian and hangs out with a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] crowd, introducing Peggy to her eventual boyfriend [[List of Mad Men characters#|Abe Drexler]] at a [[loft]] party in a [[sweatshop]].  She later engineers a meeting between Abe and Peggy; although the meeting ends badly, Peggy remains friends with Joyce. That summer, Joyce reunites Abe and Peggy by giving both a ride home from the beach in Joyce's crowded car.\n\n===Anita Olson Respola and Gerry Respola===\n'''Anita Olson Respola''' ([[Audrey Wasilewski]]) is Peggy's older sister. She is married to '''Gerry Respola''' (Jerry O'Donnell), who has a bad back, and has three young children. The youngest baby was born soon after Peggy's illegitimate child with Pete Campbell. Anita is sometimes judgmental and harsh, like her mother, and shares Katherine's anger about Peggy's pregnancy, although she is supportive of Peggy when Katherine reacts badly to news of Peggy's move to Manhattan. Anita reveals Peggy's secret to Father Gill while taking confession, out of anger at her sister's ability to move on.\n\n===Arnold Rosen===\nDr. '''Arnold \"Arnie\" Rosen''' ([[Brian Markinson]]) is Sylvia's husband and Mitchell's father. He is a cardiac surgeon who lives in Don and Megan's building. Affable and conscientious, he and Don establish a relatively close friendship. When Arnie is trapped in Washington, DC, during the riots following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a visibly distressed Don, who is having an affair with Arnie's wife Sylvia, tries to reach him several times. Arnold quits his job in New York when his hospital nixes plans for him to perform a revolutionary, life-saving cardiac transplant. He is also a staunch patriot, but acknowledges America's shaky status in the world during the late '60s. He references the [[Tet Offensive]] in Vietnam and the capture of the {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} by North Korea as the result of America not taking its enemies seriously, and cites Fidel Castro as the original example. He is a quietly heroic man, departing in the middle of the night on cross-country skis during a blizzard on New Year's Eve to get to his hospital to perform emergency surgery. At the same time, his wife Sylvia feels he takes her for granted.\n\n===Mitchell Rosen===\n'''Mitchell Rosen''' (Hudson Thames) is Arnold and Sylvia's son. He attends college in Michigan and is studying overseas in Paris during the 1968 student riots. When he [[Draft-card burning|rips up and sends back his draft card]], he seems certain to be drafted, but Don arranges with Ted to get Mitchell into the [[New York Air National Guard]] to avoid him being sent to Vietnam.\n\n===Sylvia Rosen===\n'''Sylvia Rosen''' ([[Linda Cardellini]]) is Arnie's wife, Mitchell's doting mother, and Don's mistress for much of Season 6. She is Italian, a plumber's daughter, and a housewife who, unlike Megan, affects visible displays of her Catholicism (wearing a Catholic crucifix and displaying Catholic icons in her bedroom), although her husband is implied to be Jewish. Sylvia is strong-willed, unhappy, and intelligent, and like Don, expresses interest in ending their liaison eventually. She is also friendly with Megan; this relationship significantly contributes to her ending her affair with Don, after she dreams that he died in a plane crash and she had to comfort Megan at the funeral. Don is heartbroken after Sylvia breaks it off, but she reminds him that he was happy with Megan once and can be so again. Nevertheless, Don becomes obsessed with Sylvia and of thinking of ways to get her back. In the Season 6 episode \"The Crash\", while all of SCDP has been injected with a stimulant so they can work through the night to come up with work for Chevy, Don works feverishly too, but it turns out he's focused only on thinking of an inspiration to get Sylvia back, not with inspiration for Chevy. Elements of Sylvia's physical appearance, such as her brunette hair and a facial mole, and her wearing a headwrap and kimono remind Don of his stepmother Abigail and of the maternal prostitute, Aim\u00e9e Swenson, who forcibly initiated his first sexual act when he was a young teen.\n\nWhen Don arranges with Ted to get Mitchell into the National Guard to avoid going to Vietnam, Sylvia is overcome by the favor and falls back into bed with Don, but Don's adolescent daughter Sally walks in on them. Sylvia reacts vehemently with guilt as Don runs after Sally. She is last seen with her husband in Season 7, having reconciled with Arnie and ended her relationship with Don.\n\n=== Freddy Rumsen ===\n'''Frederick \"Freddy\" C. Rumsen''' ([[Joel Murray]]) is a copywriter at Sterling Cooper. He is the first in the office to notice Peggy Olson's talent for copywriting while working on an ad campaign for Belle Jolie, and brings her to Don's attention, ultimately leading to her being offered a copywriting job herself. Older than the other copywriters (his eldest daughter turns 30 in Season 2, and he served in [[World War II]]), he is a well-loved, lighthearted, and friendly staple of the office who can often be found doing things like playing [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] pieces on his pants zipper. However, he is an alcoholic and drinks unusually heavily at work even by Sterling Cooper standards. This ends up costing him his job in the Season 2 episode \"Six Month Leave\" when, after having too much to drink, he wets his pants and falls asleep shortly before he is supposed to deliver a pitch to [[Samsonite]]. Peggy delivers the pitch instead, and Pete reports the episode to Duck Phillips, who proceeds to report this to Sterling. Rumsen is fired, to Peggy's anger as she felt some loyalty to Freddy because of his earlier assistance to her, despite the fact that his departure secured her a promotion to senior copywriter. Don and Roger take Freddy out for a night on the town to ease the sting of his departure from the agency. They also tell him he is being sent on \"six months' leave,\" though they really mean that he will be fired. This decision represents a major power play by Duck Phillips, as firing members of the Creative staff should have been Don's decision. It also teaches Peggy a valuable lesson: she needs to let Don know ahead of time about these things, so he won't be blindsided in meetings later.\n\nIn the Season 4 episode \"[[The Rejected (Mad Men)|The Rejected]]\", a 16-months sober Rumsen returns to work for SCDP on a freelance basis, having left [[J. Walter Thompson]] and bringing with him [[Pond's Creams|Pond's Cold Cream]], a $2 million account courtesy of another AA member at Ponds being in control of the account. His only condition for coming back is that Pete not be allowed near the account. He is now sober and a sponsor in [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], which puts him at odds with his coworkers' penchant for heavy drinking. When he returns, his old-fashioned ways are pronounced and Peggy very harshly confronts him about how he needs to adapt to the times. The confrontation is painful for Freddy but the two mend fences and become close again. In Season 5, Freddy, recognizing that Peggy cannot rise any further within the company, discreetly begins making job inquiries for her, as his freelance work allows him to interact with many of the advertising agencies on Madison Avenue. This leads Peggy to meet with [[List of Mad Men characters#Ted Chaough|Ted Chaough]], who hires her.\n\nAs of the Season 7 premiere, Freddy is still freelancing for the now-Sterling Cooper & Partners (SC&P), while also serving as a conduit for Don's ideas while Don is under suspension from the firm. Don eventually returns to SC&P and hits bottom at work, drinking more heavily than ever, ignoring assignments he thinks are beneath him and putting his job at risk. After an incident where he is forced to smuggle a drunk Don, who has been forbidden from drinking at work, out of SC&P offices, Freddy finally tells Don to pull himself together. Freddy points out that Don would be worse off without a job and that he'll have to earn his way back into SC&P's good graces, telling him \"Do the work, Don\". Don seems to take Freddy's words to heart, doing his assignments without complaint and behaving more professionally at work for the remainder of his time at SC&P.\n\n=== Lois Sadler ===\n'''Lois Sadler''' ([[Crista Flanagan]]) is a switchboard operator in Season 1 who has a crush on Sal Romano based on his phone conversations and voice. In Season 2, she has become Don's secretary but is depicted as being incompetent; Don eventually fires her for embarrassing him. By the end of Season 2, she is back on the switchboard and gives Harry, Paul, and Ken information about the upcoming merger that she has overheard in telephone conversations. In Season 3, she is Paul's secretary. In the episode \"[[Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency]]\", she accidentally runs over the foot of Guy MacKendrick, a British executive who was poised to replace Lane Pryce as head of Sterling Cooper, while drunkenly riding a lawn mower during an office party. Miraculously, she was not fired after this, as she was seen rousing a drunken Paul.\n\n=== Scarlet ===\n'''Scarlet''' ([[Sadie Alexandru]]) is Harry Crane's secretary, first appearing in Season 5.  In spite of her slightly ditsy personality she is nonetheless competent, and Harry values her loyalty to him, as well as her rather sycophantic demeanor toward him, enough that he intervenes when Joan attempts to fire her after she commits time card fraud, which causes a serious rift between Harry and Joan. A romantic relationship is hinted at between Scarlet and Harry, especially when Peggy later requests a new secretary and Joan replies that, \"Scarlet and Harry are practically married.\"\n\n=== Shirley ===\n'''Shirley''' (Sola Bamis) is the only other black employee at SC&P, aside from Dawn. Though they are quite different, she and Dawn are often mistaken for one another by the employees of SC&P, leading to their own inside joke of referring to the other by their own name. Shirley is originally on Peggy's desk at the beginning of Season 7, but after confusion with Peggy over Valentine's Day flowers sent to Shirley by her fianc\u00e9, Peggy demands that Joan move her. Shirley becomes Lou Avery's secretary for the remainder of his time at SCDP. She later becomes Roger's second secretary, when his workload becomes too much for Caroline to handle by herself. She is last seen in the Season 7 episode \"Lost Horizon\", telling Roger that she has found another job as a secretary at a [[publishing house]], and won't be moving with them to McCann, and that \"some people don't feel welcome in advertising\".\n\n=== Danny Siegel ===\n'''Danny Siegel''' ([[Danny Strong]]) is Jane Sterling's cousin, for whom Roger Sterling arranges an interview at SCDP in the Season 4 \"[[Waldorf Stories]]\". Don and Peggy find his book laughable and decide not to hire him. However, during a pitch meeting for [[Life (cereal)|Life]] cereal, Don inadvertently uses one of Danny's ideas, which ends up being a big hit. The clients had arrived unexpectedly while Don and a few other SCDP people were at the [[Clio Awards|Clios]], celebrating and drinking after receiving an award, so Don rushed back to the office to make a presentation, despite how drunk he was. When the clients don't like his original pitch, he starts pitching random ideas off the top of his head, and the one that the clients like is from Danny's book. Peggy later calls Don out on what he did and persuades him to make things right, so he brings Danny in to pay for his idea. Unfortunately, Danny is more interested in employment than being paid for one idea, so Don ends up hiring him. Danny ends up generally fitting in well with the rest of the younger staffers, though he remains somewhat clueless. Danny is one of the first people let go from SCDP after it loses the [[Lucky Strike]] account, and Don and Peggy are visibly upset when they have to fire him in the Season 4 episode \"[[Blowing Smoke (Mad Men)|Blowing Smoke]]\". However, he takes the news gracefully and thanks them for the opportunity they'd given him.  Danny reappears in the Season 6 episode \"A Tale of Two Cities\", by which time he has become a major movie producer with a hippie persona who prefers to be called \"Daniel J. Siegel\" whom Don and Roger run into at a party they'd been brought to by Harry. At first Danny seems genuinely friendly, but when Roger is gleefully rude and demeaning to him, tries to pick up Danny's much taller hippie date, Lotus, and implies that he would enjoy hurting Danny, Danny smiles a bit and then punches Roger in the testicles, leaving his former boss doubled over in pain as Danny walks away with Lotus in tow.\n\n=== \"Smitty\" Smith and Kurt Smith ===\n'''\"Smitty\" Smith''' ([[Patrick Cavanaugh]]) and '''Kurt Smith''' (Edin Gali) are a young copywriter/art director team hired by Don at the beginning of Season 2. \"Smitty\" is an American, and often has to explain the complexities of [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] to the European Kurt. They always work together. Kurt is a fan of [[Bob Dylan]]'s and arranges to take Peggy to a concert. Kurt is also openly [[homosexuality|gay]], which causes quite a stir in the office when he casually reveals as much in the breakroom and quickly dispels the assumption that he is pursuing a romantic relationship with Peggy. Peggy, who had been romantically interested in him, is forced to give the impression that she knew all along and that she is more liberal than she really is. After complaining to Kurt that she always picks the wrong guys, he advises Peggy to adopt a trendier appearance and provides her with a new trademark hairstyle. Smitty is known to indulge in smoking [[marijuana]], as does Paul Kinsey. When SCDP is formed, the partners do not ask Smitty or Kurt to come with them. Later, Smitty is seen working for rival advertising company CGC in Season 4, implying that Kurt is working there as well; a few of the many Don Draper cast-offs that Ted Chaough hires. He speaks glowingly of Don Draper when asked to describe him, which makes Ted envious. In the Season 3 episode \"[[My Old Kentucky Home (Mad Men)|My Old Kentucky Home]]\", Smitty tells Peggy he is a graduate of the [[University of Michigan]]. He is last seen working at CGC in Season 5.\n\n=== Jane Sterling ===\n'''Jane Sterling''' (n\u00e9e '''Siegel''') ([[Peyton List (actress born 1986)|Peyton List]]) begins as a secretary at Sterling Cooper; she is assigned to Don in Season 2 and quickly becomes a magnet for her male colleagues. As she confided to Roger in the Season 2 episode \"The Gold Violin\", she previously shopped at [[S. Klein|Klein's]] and, to Roger's amusement, lived on Jane Street.\n\nJane clashes frequently with Joan and is about to be fired when she successfully seeks Roger's intervention on her behalf. Shortly afterward, she begins an affair with Roger and he leaves his family for her. He quickly proposes out of the blue one morning in the Season 2 episode \"[[Mad Men (season 2)#ep24|The Jet Set]]\"; she accepts, and by the start of Season 3, she and Roger are married. Their marriage in Season 3 is depicted as tense. Jane is shown to be a gold-digger and heavy drinker, and she is repeatedly rejected by Roger's daughter Margaret, who is two years younger than she. However, despite the perceived tension, Roger repeatedly says his new marriage makes him happy because of Jane's youth and carefree personality. As a favor to Jane, Roger forces Don to hire her cousin Danny Siegel, despite Danny's unimpressive portfolio and job interview.\n\nFor a long time after their wedding, Roger refuses to cheat on Jane, something he repeatedly did with his first wife Mona, and turns down the advances of an old flame. Roger does eventually cheat on Jane with his former mistress, [[Joan Harris]].\n\nIn Season 5, Roger and Jane take LSD together, mutually realize their marriage has failed, and agree to divorce. Roger later recruits Jane to pretend to still be his wife for a client dinner, as the clients are Jewish and he thinks her Jewish background will help win the account. She agrees on the condition that he buy her a new apartment, which he does.  After the client dinner, Roger asks to see the new apartment.  They sleep together there, and afterward Jane is heartbroken and miserable because their sexual encounter has ruined her fresh start in her new apartment away from Roger.\n\nIn the [[The Doorway|Season 6 premiere]], Jane attends Roger's mother's memorial service and offers to return the family heirloom ring he gave her. However, Roger tells her to keep it.\n\n=== Margaret Sterling Hargrove ===\n'''Margaret Sterling''' ([[Elizabeth Rice]]) is Roger and Mona Sterling's daughter.  Spoiled and immature, she reacts petulantly to her father's remarriage and refuses to speak to Jane. She is engaged to be married during Seasons 2 and 3 and frequently whines about Jane's attempts to befriend her, as well as dramatically complains to her father that Jane has ruined her life and will ruin her wedding by attending. When [[John F. Kennedy]] is assassinated the day before her wedding, Margaret is distraught over the fact that it will effectively ruin her wedding and although she does proceed with the wedding, very few guests attend. In the [[The Doorway|Season 6 premiere]], she is disappointed that her grandmother has not left her any money and asks her father to invest in her husband Brooks' [[refrigerator car]] technology venture. She has a son, Ellery, with Brooks. When Roger takes his young grandson to see ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', Ellery gets nightmares and Margaret furiously tells Roger that he can't spend time with him anymore without Mona present. In Season 7, Margaret abandons her son and husband to join a commune in upstate New York, taking the name Marigold. Roger and Mona try to persuade her to return to Ellery, but she insists her son cannot be happy if she is unhappy. Although Mona gives up and leaves, Roger stays for the night to understand Margaret's point of view, but he is disgusted by the hippies' free-love lifestyle once he realizes that Margaret is a participant, and says Ellery needs her. In response, Margaret berates him for being an absent father during her own childhood and declares that she is entitled to behave selfishly. In the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series finale]], more than a year later, Roger tells Joan that Margaret is \"lost\" and he has cut her out of his will.\n\n=== Mona Sterling Pike===\n'''Mona Sterling Pike''' ([[Talia Balsam]], the real-life wife of John Slattery) is Roger Sterling's first wife and the mother of his daughter, Margaret. Roger is frequently unfaithful to Mona, but after his heart attack in Season 1, he appears to briefly re-devote himself to his family and ends his affair with Joan. However, in Season 2 he leaves Mona for Don's secretary, Jane Siegel. In Season 5, Roger and Mona seem to be on good terms after Roger has left Jane; Mona even agrees to help Roger drum up business, noting that he still supports Mona and their daughter. In the [[The Doorway|Season 6 premiere]], Roger explodes in an angry outburst at Mona's new husband, Bruce Pike, whom she has brought to Roger's mother's memorial service. However, both of them work together to try to bring Margaret home after she abandons her family to become a hippie. Although they are unsuccessful in getting her to return, Roger and Mona are shown to be spending time with their grandson Ellery while watching the [[1969 Moon landing|1969 moon landing]].\n\n=== Bethany Van Nuys ===\n'''Bethany Van Nuys''' ([[Anna Camp]]) is a young aspiring actress and former member of the [[Mount Holyoke College]] gymnastics team with whom [[List of Mad Men characters#Jane Siegel|Jane Sterling]] set Don up to go on a date following his divorce from [[Betty Draper|Betty]]. Blonde Bethany bears a superficial resemblance to Betty. On their first date in the [[Mad Men (season 4)|Season 4 premiere]], when Don is dropping her off at the [[Barbizon Hotel for Women]], she explains that she is in between acting roles and is working as a [[Supernumerary actor|supernumerary]] at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. Don dates her periodically throughout the Season 4 before becoming involved with [[#Faye Miller|Faye Miller]]. On one of their dates, Betty runs into them at a restaurant and reacts jealously. At the end of Season 4, Bethany is mentioned again when Don tells Betty he is getting remarried; Betty assumes his new fianc\u00e9e is Bethany.\n\n=== Tom and Jeannie Vogel ===\n'''Thomas and Jeannie Vogel''' (Joe O'Connor and Sheila Shaw) are Trudy Campbell's parents. Tom is an executive at [[Vicks|Vicks Chemical]], who uses his status as an important client with Sterling Cooper to wield influence over Trudy's marriage to Pete Campbell. In Season 1, he offers to help Pete and Trudy buy an apartment. Tom also offers to give Sterling Cooper the [[Clearasil]] account if Pete agrees to have a baby soon. In Season 2, after Trudy discovers she is unable to conceive, Tom pressures Pete to agree to adopt a child. When Pete refuses, Tom cancels the Clearasil account. At the end of Season 3, Pete gets the account back with Trudy's help. In Season 4, the agency drops Clearasil because of a conflict with a larger account ([[Pond's Creams|Pond's Cold Cream]]), but Pete is able to manipulate Tom into giving him several larger accounts from Tom's company. In Season 6, after Tom and Pete unexpectedly meet in a brothel, Tom pulls his company's accounts in hypocritical disgust at Pete's infidelity to Trudy. In season 7, it is revealed that Tom has suffered a heart attack.\n\n=== Arnold Wayne ===\n'''Dr. Arnold Wayne''' ([[Andy Umberger]]) was Betty's psychiatrist during the first season, whom she saw because of her problem with her hands going numb unexpectedly. While she was seeing him, Dr. Wayne was secretly in contact with Don to discuss her sessions, which Betty found out about during the Season 1 finale. She used that to her advantage by confiding her suspicions about Don's infidelity.\n\n===Abigail Whitman===\n'''Abigail Whitman''' is Dick Whitman's stepmother and Adam Whitman's mother. She is deceased and appears in Don/Dick's flashbacks. Abigail was married to Archibald Whitman and had recently miscarried, when the prostitute Archibald had impregnated died after delivering baby Dick. The midwife gave the newborn to Abigail, who had prayed for another child, and Archibald to raise, but Abigail resented Dick and regularly referred to him as a \"whore's son.\"\n\nWhen Archibald died and Abigail lost the farm, she, pregnant with Adam at the time, brought Dick with her to stay with her sister and \"Uncle Mack\" in Pennsylvania, where both were to earn their keep helping out at Mack's whorehouse, and Abigail was to make herself available to Mack sexually. One of the prostitutes, Aim\u00e9e Swenson, caught Don peeping through the keyhole when Mack was mounting the child-heavy Abigail. When Dick was ill and Abigail claimed he had symptoms of tuberculosis and ordered him to confine himself to the basement, Aim\u00e9e checked his breathing and told him he only had a common cold, commenting that \"Your mother don't know how to care for anybody.\" Young Dick responded, \"She ain't my mother.\" Aim\u00e9e hid him in her room and nursed him back to health. When Aim\u00e9e was evicted, she revealed that she had taken Dick's virginity, and Abigail beat Dick severely with a wooden spoon while berating him.\n\nWhen Adam finds Don/Dick in New York City and tells him Abigail had died, Don's response is \"Good.\"\n\n=== Adam Whitman ===\n'''Adam Whitman''' ([[Jay Paulson]]) is Dick Whitman's half-brother. In the Season 1 episode \"[[5G (Mad Men)|5G]]\", Adam is seen working as a janitor when he tries to re-establish a relationship with Don after seeing his picture in a thrown-away newspaper. Initially unwilling to associate with Adam, Don agrees to meet him for lunch and later visits him at the cheap rooming house where Adam is staying. Don gives Adam $5,000 and asks him not to contact him again. Eventually, Adam mails a package to Don that contains old family photos and soon afterward, hangs himself. Some time later, Don finds out about his brother's suicide when he attempts to reach Adam. The box of photos would later cause Don trouble when it is found by Pete Campbell, who attempts to use the photos to blackmail Don about his true identity.\n\nAs a boy, Adam saw Dick on the train that brought home \"Dick's\" body, which was actually that of the real Don Draper whose identity Dick stole, from the Korean War and tried to tell his mother and \"Uncle Mack\",  but they did not listen to him. Adam reappears in the final two episodes of Season 5, as Don/Dick hallucinates mildly while suffering from a \"hot tooth\" that turns out to be [[abscess]]ed. In one such scene, as Don is placed under anesthesia, he hallucinates Adam's standing over him, his neck bruised from his hanging, stating, \"It's not your tooth that's rotten.\"\n\n=== Archie Whitman ===\n'''Archibald \"Archie\" Whitman''' ([[Joseph Culp]]) is Dick Whitman's late father. Archie impregnated Evangeline, a prostitute, who died while giving birth to Dick. The midwife, who knew that Archie's wife, Abigail, had recently miscarried and prayed for a child, brought Dick to their home for Archie and Abigail to raise. However, Abigail always resented Dick and called him a \"whore child\".  Archie and Abigail are birth parents of Dick's younger half-brother, Adam. Don tells Betty his father would \"beat the hell out of him\".  There are other indications that Archie was a terrible father and a mean drunk, as seen in the Season 1 episode \"[[The Hobo Code]]\" when Don remembers that as a child, a friendly drifter stayed with the Whitmans and told Dick that drifters leave [[Hobo code|signs]] carved on the front of a property to notify others of the resident's character, and drew some of the signs for him.  When the drifter left after Archie reneged on a promise to pay for the drifter's labor, Dick found the sign for a dishonest person carved into the fence. While drunk, Archie was kicked in the face by his horse during a storm and was killed as a stunned Dick looked on.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mad Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Mad Men Characters}}\n[[Category:Mad Men|Characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of American drama television series characters|Mad Men]]\n[[Category:Mad Men characters| ]]\n", "name_user": "WhisperToMe", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMichael Ginsberg", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mad_Men_characters"}

It was designed by [[John Whitton]] in his capacity as Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and built from 1881 to 1889. It is also known as the '''Bredbo Rail Bridge''' and the '''Bredbo River Railway Viaduct'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1029>{{cite NSW SHR|5011954|Bredbo Rail Bridge Group|hr=01029|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe railway was extended from [[Queanbeyan]] to [[Cooma]] in 1887-89. At that time, the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways, [[John Whitton]], was under government pressure to reduce construction costs. One common method was to build timber bridges, mostly ballast top timber bream bridges. However, for two major waterways, Ingalara Creek ([[Michelago Rail Bridge over Ingalara Creek]] and the [[Bredbo River]], he chose to use Queen post deck trusses, a type of timber truss viaduct that he had already used on the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North line]] between [[Glen Innes, New South Wales|Glen Innes]] and [[Wallangarra, Queensland|Wallangarra]]. Nearer to Cooma, at [[Chakola]], he chose a different type of timber viaduct to cross Umaralla Creek. Several of Whitton's other Queen post deck truss bridges - the Breardy River, Severn River and Bluff River viaducts and the Tenterfield Creek bridge - are also listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register.<ref name=nswshr-1029/>\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Bredbo Rail Bridge is a ten-[[Span (architecture)|span]] timber [[truss]] viaduct.

The Bredbo viaduct is accessible from the [[Monaro Highway]] and is an impressive timber structure. The Cooma Railway made a significant contribution to the development of the [[Monaro (New South Wales)|Monaro Region]] from the time of its construction 1887-89, and all the timber viaducts were important items of the railway's infrastructure. The timber Queen post deck viaduct was a significant structure in place of the expensive iron lattice bridges preferred by John Whitton. The Bredbo viaduct was technically sound and durable, having been built from renowned ironbark hardwood.

Under these conditions, the listener focuses on the sounds being produced to heighten the sense of hearing. In 1955, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Peignot]] and [[Pierre Schaeffer]] were the first to use the term ''acousmatique'' to define the listening experience of musique concr\u00e8te.<ref>Peignot, J.

Paris: ''Esprit'': 111-123.</ref> It is said to be derived from ''akousmatikoi'', the outer circle of Pythagoras' disciples who only heard their teacher speaking from behind a veil.

We are as likely to hear the sounds of a bird, or of a factory as we are the sounds of a [[violin]]. The technology involved transcends the mere reproduction of sounds. Techniques of [[Sound synthesis|synthesis]] and sound processing are employed which may present us with sounds that are unfamiliar and that may defy clear source attribution. Acousmatic compositions may present us with familiar musical events: chords, melodies and rhythms which are easily reconcilable with other forms of music, but may equally present us with events which cannot be classified within such a traditional [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]].<ref>Windsor, W.L. (1995). \"A Perceptual Approach to the Description and Analysis of Acousmatic Music\", Ph. D Thesis, City University Department of Music, September 1995, Sheffield.</ref>\n\n==Performance practice==\nAcousmatic compositions are sometimes presented to audiences in concert settings that are often indistinguishable from acoustic recitals, albeit without performers. In an acousmatic concert the sound component is produced using pre-recorded media, or generated in [[Real-time computing|real-time]] using a [[computer]]. The sound material will then be distributed spatially, via multiple [[loudspeakers]], using a practice known as [[Sound diffusion]]. The work is often ''diffused'' by the composer (if present) but the role of interpreter can also be assumed by another practitioner of the art. To provide a guideline for ''spatialisation'' of the work by an interpreter, many composers provide a ''diffusion score''; in its simplest form this might be a graphic representation of the acousmatic work with indications for spatial manipulations, relative to a time-line.<ref>Emmerson, Simon (2007). \"Living Electronic Music\", Aldershot, Hants: Ashgate. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5546-6}}</ref>\n\n==The acousmatic experience==\nIn acousmatic music, listeners are challenged to distinguish sounds, not based on their source, but by their sonic quality. As Pierre Schaeffer writes in his ''Treatise on Musical Objects'' \"The concealment of the causes does not result from a technical imperfection, nor is it an occasional process of variation: it becomes a precondition, a deliberate placing-in-condition of the subject. It is ''toward it'', then, that the question turns around; \"what am I hearing?... What exactly are you hearing\" -in the sense that one asks the subject to describe not the external references of the sound it perceives but the perception itself.\" <ref>Cox, Christopher and Warner, Daniel. ''Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music'' Continuum Books (2002).</ref>\n\nThat music is acousmatic is determined more by ''how'' it is listened to, than by whether it is being played from a loudspeaker or not. In understanding the term 'acousmatic' appropriately, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between sound '''source''' and sound '''identity'''.<ref>Schaeffer, Pierre (1966), ''Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux'', Paris: \u00c9ditions du Seuil. {{OCLC|301664906}}</ref>\n\nIf for example a recording of a solo cello being played in a recognizable way is sounded through a loudspeaker, the source of the sound is the loudspeaker, but its identity is still 'cello' for a listener. Thus, acousmatic music can be said to be that which calls for the listener to perceive sound without (or with a reduced) sensibility to the sound's identity. The listening mode is oriented instead upon more abstract timbral than mimetic aspects of the sound. Pierre Schaeffer has referred to this as ''\u00e9coute r\u00e9duite''. It can be said that an ''\u00e9coute r\u00e9duite'' leads to the perception of music as acousmatic, in the sense that playing sounds from loudspeakers has the potential for obscuring their identity, as the visual reference is removed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Pierre |title=Trait\u00e9 des objets musicaux |date=1966 |location=Le Seuil}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Austin, Larry, and Denis Smalley. \"Sound Diffusion in Composition and Performance: An Interview with Denis Smalley\".

The team also won the [[1992 King Fahd Cup]] and the 1993 [[Artemio Franchi Trophy]].

It was a cup organized by both Argentine and Uruguayan Football Associations, with its last edition being contested in 1992. The first official title won by Argentina was the 1906 Copa Lipton, defeating Uruguay 2\u20130 in [[Montevideo]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/lipton.html Copa Lipton 1905-1992 at RSSSF]</ref> That same year, Argentina also played the [[Newton Cup]], another competition organized by both associations, earning the trophy after defeating Uruguay 2\u20131 in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nIn the following years, matches played by the Argentine side were against South American teams only. The reasons varied from the long time the trips took to another countries by then to [[World War I]].<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7857%3Aseleccion-nacional-los-comienzos&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"AFA: los comienzos (1901-1930)\", AFA official site]</ref>\n\nArgentina would win four consecutive Newton Cups from 1907 to 1911,<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/newton.html Copa Newton 1906-1976 at RSSSF]</ref> and four Lipton Cups from 1906 to 1909. After some Uruguayan victories, Argentina won the 1913, 1915 and 1916 Lipton and 1916 Newton Cup trophies.\n\n[[File:Argentina_equipo_1921.jpg|thumb|right|220px|In 1921 Argentina won its first [[Copa Am\u00e9rica|South American Championship]]]]\nIn 1916, Argentina contested the first tournament organized by [[CONMEBOL]], the South American Championship (the current [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]]) hosted in Buenos Aires and [[Avellaneda]] and won by [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. The host plus Brazil, Chile and Uruguay were the only teams contesting the inaugural competition. During that tournament Argentina played three matches, defeating Chile 6\u20130 and drawing Brazil and Uruguay, who became champions on goal difference. The line-up at the final was: Isola, D\u00edaz, Reyes, Mart\u00ednez, Olazar, Badaracco, Heissinger, [[Alberto Ohaco|Ohaco]], H. Hayes, E. Hayes and [[Natalio Perinetti|Perinetti]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/16safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\nArgentina won its first South American championship in 1921, also held in Buenos Aires. The squad won all the games disputed, defeating [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and Uruguay to earn six points with no goals received. Notable players of that team were goalkeeper [[Am\u00e9rico Tesoriere]] and striker [[Pedro Calomino]]. Julio Libonatti was also tournament's top scorer.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/21safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\n===The Olympic goal===\n[[File:Gololimpicodeonzari.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Onzari's olympic goal against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in 1924.]]\n\nIn 1924, Argentina played a friendly match against Uruguay at [[Sportivo Barracas]]' stadium. When only 15 minutes had been played, winger [[Ces\u00e1reo Onzari]] scored from a [[corner kick]], with no other player touching the ball before scoring. Due to the fact that Uruguay was the Olympic champion, this play was called \"Gol Ol\u00edmpico\". This denomination still remains.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2004/10/02/deportes/d-07101.htm \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 80\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 2 October 2004</ref>\n\nThe goal stood since [[FIFA]] had previously regulated goals scored directly from the corner kick, as Onzari did during that match. According to ''La Naci\u00f3n'' newspaper, 52,000 fans attended the game, an Argentina 2\u20131 win, where the Uruguayan team left the field with only four minutes to play. Argentine players later complained about the rough play of the Uruguayans during the match, while their rivals also complained about the aggressiveness of local spectators, who threw bottles at them at the end of the match.<ref>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1181561-el-gol-olimpico-cumple-85-anos \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 85 a\u00f1os\"], Canchallena.com, 2 October 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the South American championship was hosted by third time in Argentina, and the ''Albicelest'' won its second title. The team played four matches and remained unbeaten once more, defeating Paraguay and Brazil twice each. A highmark was the 4\u20131 victory against rivals Brazil.\n\nArgentina won another consecutive title in 1927 obtaining the [[1927 South American Championship|South American championship held in Peru]]. The team made a great campaign, finishing unbeaten with three wins over three games played. The national squad achieved a large victory over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (7\u20131), then beating Uruguay by 3\u20132 and the local team by 5\u20131 in the last match of the tournament. It was the third South American title for the Argentina national team.\n\n===1928 Summer Olympics===\n{{Main|Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|Argentina Olympic football team}}\n[[File:Argentina football team Olympics 1928.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The team that reached the final of the 1928 Summer Olympics.]]\n\nIn 1928, Argentina went to Amsterdam to play the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], which was the first international tournament played by the national team in its history. The football squad reached the final after trashing the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 11\u20132, Belgium 6\u20133 and Egypt 6\u20130. The final saw Argentina defeated by Uruguay 2\u20131, thus winning the silver medal.\n\n===1930 World Cup===\n[[File:Argentina 1930.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The Argentina squad that played the 1930 World Cup match vs. Mexico.]]\n\nIn 1929, Argentina hosted a new edition of the South American championship, winning its second consecutive title. Argentina finished unbeaten once more, defeating all its rivals in the group: [[Peru national football team|Peru]] (3\u20130), Paraguay (4\u20131) and Uruguay in the last match played in the [[Estadio Gas\u00f3metro]] of Buenos Aires. Most of players that took part of the team would play for Argentina in the first World Cup organized by FIFA one year later.\n\nArgentina was one of the 13 national teams attending to the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Uruguay.\n\nIn the inaugural match of the World Cup, Argentina defeated [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20130. The national team then beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 6\u20133 and finished its run in the first stage by defeating [[Chile national football team|Chile]] 3\u20131. Argentina qualified to the semi-finals where the squad widely beat the United States 6\u20131. On July 30, Argentina played its first World Cup final against Uruguay, but lost 4\u20132.\n\n===1934\u201354: A long absence===\nArgentina played only one game at the next [[1934 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in Italy in 1934. The tournament format was a knockout tournament, and Argentina lost its only match 3\u20132 to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Argentina would not participate in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] in France, the last before [[World War II]]. The first World Cup after the War was the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] held in Brazil, but Argentina did not enter the competition due to a conflict with the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]]. For the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] in Switzerland, Argentina refused to participate.\n\nIn 1951, Argentina played [[England national football team|England]] for the first time and were defeated 2\u20131 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. The second leg was played in Buenos Aires on 14 June 1953, where Argentina won 3\u20131, though the match caused great repercussions in Argentina.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/05/14/d-05301.htm \"Los 50 a\u00f1os del gol de Grillo a Inglaterra\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 14 May 2003</ref>\n\n===From ''Los Carasucias'' to the 1958 disaster===\n[[File:Carasucias.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''Los Carasucias'': Corbatta, Maschio, Angelillo, S\u00edvori and Cruz.]]\n\nAlthough Argentina did not contest any World Cups from 1934 to 1954, the team won the [[1937 South American Championship|1937]], [[1941 South American Championship|1941]], [[1945 South American Championship|1945]], [[1946 South American Championship|1946]], [[1947 South American Championship|1947]], [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] and [[1957 South American Championship|1957]] South American championships, all squads coached by Guillermo St\u00e1bile.\n\nThe 1957 squad is probably the most remembered team of those years because of its skilled players and exquisite style of playing showed on the field.

Argentina remained unbeaten, winning five of six matches played. The team was coached by a triumvirate composed by [[Victorio Spinetto]], [[Jos\u00e9 Della Torre]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Barreiro (footballer)|Jos\u00e9 Barreiro]], replacing Guillermo St\u00e1bile after his 19-year tenure in the national team. Argentina would not win a Copa Am\u00e9rica until [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], when the team coached by [[Alfio Basile]] obtained the trophy in Chile.\n\nIn 1959, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno]] became Argentina coach, although he did not spend much time with the team. Under his coaching Argentina disputed the [[1959 South American Championship (Ecuador)|Southamerican championship in Ecuador]], where the squad defeated Paraguay 4\u20132, drew the hosts 1\u20131 and suffered a large defeat by 5\u20130 at the hands of Uruguay, although the team achieved a great 4\u20131 victory against Brazil with three goals by [[Jos\u00e9 Sanfilippo]] in the last match. Once the extra tournament finished, Moreno left his place and Guillermo St\u00e1bile started his 2nd period as coach of Argentina national team.\n\nIn 1960, Argentina won its first and only [[Panamerican Championship 1960|Panamerican championship]] held in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica]]. That same year the team suffered three losses to Brazil: two of them in the Roca Cup and the next in the Atlantic Cup. That was the last match where Argentina was coached by St\u00e1bile in his second tenure. He would be replaced by [[Victorio Spinetto]].\n\nIn 1961, Argentina started a tour across Europe, playing several matches against local national teams. The squad only achieved one victory against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] with two losses and two draws. After a short period coached by Jos\u00e9 D'Amico, [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the team. Argentina made a poor performance at the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962 World Cup]], being defeated by England (3\u20131) to be eliminated from the tournament.\n\nIn the [[1963 South American Championship]], Argentina finished third in the tournament, although the team achieved important victories over Brazil (3\u20130), Ecuador and Colombia, but lost to Bolivia and Peru.

Minella left the team, being replaced by [[Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda]] after qualification was over. [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the squad, beginning his second tenure on the national side.\n\nThe national side played several friendly matches against [[Soviet Union national football team|the Soviet Union]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] before its flight to England. Argentina only drew the first two games and was defeated in the last in Torino.\n\n[[File:Argentina 1966 rattin.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] (#10) was sent off by referee Kreitlein in the match against England.]]\nArgentina made its debut in Group 2 of the World Cup, defeating [[Spain national football team|Spain]] by 2\u20131. The next matches were against West Germany, which ended 0\u20130 and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] also won by 2\u20131. Argentina qualified to the quarter-finals where the team was defeated by the host team 1\u20130. It was a controversial match where midfielder [[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] was sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein for \"violence of the tongue\", despite the referee speaking no Spanish. Ratt\u00edn was so incensed with the decision, believing the referee to be biased in favour of England, that he refused to leave. As a way to show his disgust, he sat on the red carpet exclusively meant for the Queen to walk on. He eventually had to be escorted from the field by two policemen and as a final sign of disgust, wrinkled at a British pennant before being escorted out. This incident, and others surrounding the same game, arguably started the long-lasting rivalry between both national teams, although on the other hand, allowed for the institution of yellow and red cards into football, a solution devised by FIFA after the spark that set off the incident.\n\nAlthough Argentina did not have a great performance in England, the players were well received by the crowd in Ezeiza, in part due to the incident with Ratt\u00edn and the Queen's carpet, where Ratt\u00edn himself later saying that he \"didn't know where he had sat on\".<ref name=transition>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7861%3Ala-transicion-hacia-la-organizacion&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"La transici\u00f3n hacia la organizaci\u00f3n\", AFA website: Historia de la Selecci\u00f3n Argentina]</ref>\n\nThe next step for the team was the [[1967 South American Championship|1967 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], hosted by Uruguay. Argentina made a good campaign, winning five over six matches disputed, being defeated only by the host team and finished second.\n\nDuring 1967 and 1969, the Football Association named four different coaches to the national team: Carmelo Faraone, who only coached two matches, [[Renato Cesarini]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Minella|Jos\u00e9 M. Minella]], [[Humberto Maschio]] and [[Adolfo Pedernera]]. In those years, Argentina played a series of friendly matches with most of them being South American teams and a few European teams. Argentina also played a new edition of the [[Copa Lipton|Lipton Cup]], obtaining it by goal average over Uruguay.\n\nIn 1969, Argentina began qualifying for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] under Pedernera. The national squad shared its group with Bolivia and Peru, losing the first two games played as the away team. Although Argentina won the next game (over Bolivia, 1\u20130), the 2\u20132 draw against Peru in the last fixture (played at [[La Bombonera Stadium|La Bombonera]]) allowed the Peruvian squad to be one of the South American representatives in the World Cup, eliminating Argentina.<ref name=transition/><ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicqualifiers/news/newsid=735385.html \"El d\u00eda que Per\u00fa enmudeci\u00f3 a La Bombonera\", FIFA official site]</ref> To date, this remains the only time that Argentina has failed to qualify for a World Cup in which it entered a team.  This poor performance that caused the absence of a national representative in the 1970 World Cup is still regarded as one of Argentina's biggest frustrations in its history.<ref>[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/deportes/8-40394-2004-08-31.html \"A 35 a\u00f1os de un fat\u00eddico empate contra los peruanos\", ''P\u00e1gina/12''], August 31, 2004</ref>\n\nAfter the frustration of 1969, the Association named [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Pizzuti]], who had won the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] with [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] three years before, as coach of the national team. Pizzuti was the manager during three years, in which Argentina played several friendly games against South American teams, which included the 1971 Roca Cup title (shared with Brazil). In 1972, Argentina was invited to play the Brazil Independence Cup, where the team did not achieve good results.\n\nAfter the Independence Cup, Pizzuti was replaced by [[Omar S\u00edvori]], the most notable player of the 1957 Copa Am\u00e9rica triumph and had previous experience as manager of [[Rosario Central]] and [[Estudiantes de La Plata]]. Argentina played some friendly matches as preparation for the qualifying, with some interesting results such as a 3\u20132 over West Germany in [[Munich]].\n\n===\"The Ghost Team\" and 1974 World Cup===\nQualifying for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] began in September 1973, where Argentina shared its group with Bolivia and Paraguay. Bolivia used to play its home venues at [[La Paz]], where Argentine players suffered the lack of oxygen and other effects caused by [[altitude sickness]]. To avoid complications, S\u00edvori decide to prepare a team to play in altitude. Following his instructions, Miguel Ignomiriello took many players to [[Tilcara]] so they could become acclimatized to altitude.<ref>[http://decelesteyblanco.blogspot.com.ar/2008/03/la-seleccin-fantasma.html \"Historias Albicelestes: La Selecci\u00f3n Fantasma\" by Eduardo C\u00e1ntaro]</ref><ref>[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 \"Ese equipo fantasma\", ''Diario Uno''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015173356/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 |date=2013-10-15 }}, 3 April 2009</ref>\n\nArgentina won the match played in La Paz 1\u20130.

With its new coach on the bench, Argentina played only four matches before the competition, facing European teams. Argentina defeated Romania and France and drew England before suffering a defeat to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] by 4\u20131.\n\nOnce more, Argentina made a poor performance in a World Cup. They were defeated by Poland in their opening game by 3\u20132, followed by a 1\u20131 draw with Italy. In the last game of the first round, Argentina defeated [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] 4\u20131, granting qualification to the second round of the tournament, where the team lost to the Netherlands, Brazil, ending with a 1\u20131 draw to [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]. Argentina finished last in the group table and eighth in the overall table.\n\n===The Menotti era: Beginning of greatness===\nThe demise of the team in the World Cup forced the Association to make changes in Argentine football. David Bracuto was named president of the Football Association in 1974. He offered [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]] the head coaching role of Argentina, which Menotti accepted under several conditions, one being that native players under 25 should not be sold to foreign clubs.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7862%3Aseleccion-prioridad-numero-1&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Selecci\u00f3n, prioridad n\u00famero uno\", AFA website]</ref>\n\nMenotti debuted on 12 October 1974 in a friendly match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Argentina began a long preparation for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] which would be hosted on home soil for the very first time, playing friendly matches and tournaments. During those years, Argentina played a total of 33 matches. The year 1977 was also the international debut of [[Diego Maradona]], who played for the first time at age 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. The match was held in Buenos Aires with a large victory for Argentina by 5\u20131.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/27/um/m-01371213.htm \"A 30 a\u00f1os del debut de Maradona en la Selecci\u00f3n\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 27 February 2007</ref>\n\nArgentina also played a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica, where for the first time there was no fixed venue. All matches were played throughout each country across the tournament. Argentina debuted thrashing Venezuela but lost to Brazil in the two games played (2\u20131 and 1\u20130). Brazil qualified to the next stage and the national team was eliminated.\n\n[[File:Argentina1978.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Argentina host the FIFA World Cup for the first time in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]]].\nIn 1978, the final preparations for the World Cup began, playing several matches against South American and European teams. Although Maradona was considered one of the best players in the world, Menotti did not include him in the definitive list for the tournament. Some sources state that the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentine military junta]] that ruled Argentina by then pushed Menotti to include River Plate's midfielder [[Norberto Alonso]] instead of Maradona, and that Menotti almost certainly knew that the prodigiously talented 17-year old would not be able to handle the immense pressure and attention in the biggest sporting event in Argentina's history.

In the second round Argentina was placed in Group 1 sharing it with Brazil, Poland and Peru. In the first game, Argentina beat Poland 2\u20130, with both goals from Mario Kempes. Next game was against South American powerhouse Brazil in which the game ended with a 0\u20130 draw. The last game was against Peru, a rival that Argentina easily defeated with a 6\u20130 win. Argentina was able to edge out Brazil in the group and went on to the final. Argentina had to beat Peru by four goals or more to progress.

On 25 June 1978, at River Plate's [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina played its second World Cup final. Mario Kempes gave Argentina the lead in the 38th minute, with the Dutch squad able to respond in the 82nd minute for the equalizer. The game went to extra time and Mario Kempes once again gave the Argentines the lead and [[Daniel Bertoni]] added another goal which sealed the win for Argentina, which became the second South American team to win the World Cup at its home soil. Kempes was not only the most notable player of the team but also the topscorer of the tournament with six goals.\n\nAfter the success of the World Cup, Menotti continued as coach and Argentina played some friendly match as preparation for the [[1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. Maradona scored his first goal for the Senior team against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]], where Argentina won 3\u20131.<ref>[http://blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html \"A 30 a\u00f1os del primer gol de Maradona\", DeporTEA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726023934/http://www.blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html |date=2011-07-26 }}, 2 June 2009</ref>\n\nThe highlight of 1979 was the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship]] obtained by the [[Argentina under-20 national football team|under-20 team]] in [[Tokyo]]. The team, also coached by Menotti, won the tournament with Maradona and [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]] as the leaders and most notable players of the squad. The tournament was also the first official championship played by Maradona in a national team.\n\nDue to Argentina needing no qualifiers to the next World Cup as holders, the national team played a series of matches as preparation for the competition. In 1980 there was no official tournaments so the team toured on Europe and also hosted friendly games in some of the most important cities of Argentina such as [[Mar del Plata]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Argentina played the [[1980 Mundialito]], a competition hosted by Uruguay in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first World Cup tournament, where the team defeated West Germany and drew with Brazil to be eliminated in the first stage.\n\n===1982: End of an era and beginning of Maradona era===\n[[File:Arg1982 v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Argentina players leaving the field after being eliminated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].]]\n\nIn 1982 the Argentine squad travelled to Spain to participate in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] while Argentina was fighting in the [[Falklands War]] (''Guerra de Malvinas'') with the United Kingdom after the invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]] had been ordered by president [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] on April 2.\n\nThe lineup was based on the 1978 team with the addition of Diego Maradona (who had won a domestic title playing at a high level) and Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz. The squad arrived in Spain as a big favourite to win the Cup.  Argentina debuted with a 1\u20130 loss to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]]. There were internal tensions within the camp between the older and younger players, and this caused problems. Nevertheless, the team recovered by defeating Hungary (4\u20131) and  [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (2\u20130) therefore qualifying for the next stage. In the second round, Argentina shared a group with Italy and Brazil, being defeated by both (3\u20131 and 2\u20131) and eliminated from the championship. Maradona could not show his skills during the tournament, suffering from the rough play of rivals (especially [[Claudio Gentile]] in the game against Italy). He would eventually be sent off by the referee after kicking Brazilian player [[Jo\u00e3o Batista da Silva|Batista]] in the groin.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7863%3Auna-alegria-y-un-golpe-inesperado&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Una alegr\u00eda y un golpe inesperado (1979/1982)\", AFA official website]</ref><ref>[http://www.marca.com/reportajes/2010/04/espana_1982/2010/04/19/seccion_01/1271693378.html \"Maradona fue mundialista por primera vez en Espa\u00f1a\" by Javier Estepa], ''Marca''</ref>\n\nOther players that formed the squad were [[Juan Barbas]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]] (from the 1979 youth championship-winning team), [[Patricio Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]], [[Enzo Trossero]] and [[Jorge Valdano]].\n\nThe failure at the World Cup caused Menotti to leave his post.

The squad was eliminated on first round with 3 draws (2 with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and a 0\u20130 with Brazil), winning its only match 1\u20130 to Brazil in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe team was formed by footballers playing in domestic [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] exclusively, being some of them goalkeepers [[Ubaldo Fillol]] and [[Nery Pumpido]], defenders [[N\u00e9stor Clausen]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]], [[Enzo Trossero]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]] and [[Roberto Mouzo]]; midfielders [[Claudio Marangoni]], [[Jorge Burruchaga]], [[Alejandro Sabella]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ponce]]; forwards [[Ricardo Gareca]], [[Alberto M\u00e1rcico]].\n\nAfter the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Argentina travelled to [[Calcuta]] to play the Nehru Cup, then playing a series of friendly matches before the qualifiers to [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico. The team made a successful tour on Europe where it won the three matches disputed, including a 3\u20131 against West Germany in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In May 1985, Argentina played its first qualifying match against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]], winning 3\u20132. Argentina won three consecutive games, to Colombia (3\u20131 home, 1\u20130 away) and Venezuela (3\u20130 home) but lost to Peru 1\u20130 in [[Lima]] in a match where Peru midfielder [[Claudio Reyna]] marked Maradona with excessive roughness, although he was not sent off by the referee.<ref>[http://tn.com.ar/deportes/hazanas/a-27-anos-de-la-marca-personal-a-maradona-reyna-sigue-siendo-idolo-en-peru_270462 \"A 27 a\u00f1os de la marca personal a Maradona\"], [[Todo Noticias|TN]], 10 September 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.terra.com/espdep/articulo/html/fox239751.htm \"Maradona no olvida a Luis Reyna\"], ''[[Terra Networks|Terra]]'', 4 May 2006</ref>\n\nArgentina played the last match of the qualifiers against Peru in Buenos Aires.

Some journalists also accused Bilardo to play defensively, leaving behind the historic Argentine landmark of short passes and dribblings according to their point of view. ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', the most popular newspaper of Argentina, was one of the hardest opponents of the coach, and Bilardo himself declared that Clar\u00edn called Association President [[Julio Grondona]] to ask him to fire the coach.<ref name=eltiempo>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1508493-bilardo-el-tiempo-me-dio-la-razon \"Bilardo: El tiempo me dio la raz\u00f3n\" - CanchaLlena.com], 19 September 2012</ref>\n\nBefore the World Cup, Argentina toured Europe losing to [[France national football team|France]] (one of the favorites to win the Cup) and [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and largely defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] by 7\u20132.<ref>[http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ \"Argentina campe\u00f3n del Mundo 1986, la angustia que precedi\u00f3 a la gloria\", Muy Futbol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025231603/http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ |date=2012-10-25 }}, 27 June 2012</ref>\n\n===1986: Return to glory===\n[[File:Argentina x corea 1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The team that debuted v. [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at the Estadio Olimpico Universitario in Mexico City.]]\nArgentina entered the 1986 World Cup with hope because of one player, Diego Maradona. Argentina was placed in Group A alongside Italy, [[Bulgarian national football team|Bulgaria]], and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In the first game, Argentina was able to beat South Korea 3\u20131. The second match was against Italy, a tougher opponent. Italy took the lead in the sixth minute but Diego Maradona responded with a goal in the 34th minute. The game later ended with a 1\u20131 draw. The last group game was against Bulgaria, which resulted in a 2\u20130 Argentina win; therefore Argentina passed to the next round being the first in the group.\n\n{{Quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=My daughter Daniela could not be called by her last name.

The hot-tempered game ended in a 1\u20130 win for Argentina. Next, Argentina moved on to the quarter-finals, playing England at the [[Estadio Azteca]] in [[Mexico City]]. The game started very evenly, with both teams getting chances to score but none were able to finish. The first half ended with Argentina having the majority of possession but unable to get past a tough defense. Six minutes following the second half, Maradona scored a [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)#The \"Hand of God\"|controversial goal]] in which he used his hand; once the match finished, Maradona called it \"''la mano de Dios''\" (\"the hand of God\"), explicitly admitting the infringement. The goal began with a defensive error from [[Steve Hodge]], who passed the ball incorrectly back to his goalkeeper, [[Peter Shilton]]. At that time, Maradona was still continuing his run and reached the ball first and netted it in with his left fist. After the goal, Maradona encouraged his teammates to embrace the goal so the referee would allow it. Four minutes after the \"hand of God\" goal, Maradona scored a goal which people{{Who|date=March 2015}} called \"The Goal of the Century\" because of the individual effort of Maradona, who starting his run from the half-way line, passed four English midfielders (he beat midfielder [[Terry Butcher]] twice) and dribbled around Shilton, finally scoring the goal which allowed Argentina to win the match, 2\u20131. That victory was very celebrated due to not only the rivalry between both teams but Argentina had lost the Falklands War at the hands of the [[British Army]] four years prior.<ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=392/index.html \"La magia de Maradona tumba a Inglaterra\" - FIFA.es]</ref>\n\n[[File:Maradona cup azteca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diego Maradona raising the FIFA World Cup trophy at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.]]\nIn the semi-finals, Argentina defeated Belgium 2\u20130 at the Estadio Azteca to advance to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] against West Germany. Argentina won a game played at the Azteca in which the squad won its second World Cup title. [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]] opened the scoring for Argentina, then the team increased the lead with a goal by [[Jorge Valdano]]. Germany started a comeback with goals from [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] and [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]], which evened the game at 2\u20132. [[Jorge Burruchaga]] scored the winning goal in the 83rd minute, giving Argentina a 3\u20132 victory over Germany.\n\nArgentina remained unbeaten in the World Cup, winning five over six matches disputed.

The line-up in the final was: [[Nery Pumpido]], Brown, [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuciuffo]], Ruggeri, [[Julio Olarticoechea]]; [[Ricardo Giusti]], [[Sergio Batista]], Enrique, Burruchaga; Maradona, Valdano.\n\n===1987\u20131990===\nAfter winning the World Cup, the players went on vacation and Argentina did not play a match until 1987, when a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica was contested. The tournament changed its format, returning to a unique host where Argentina was chosen. Argentine formed a team with a mix of players from European and local leagues. The squad debuted with a 1\u20131 draw against Per\u00fa, then beat Ecuador 3\u20130. In the second stage, Argentina lost to Uruguay (which would be the champion) 1\u20130 in Buenos Aires and was eliminated. At the end of 1987, Argentina played West Germany (the rival of the 1986 final) winning 1\u20130 at the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani]]. In 1988, the squad played the Four Nations Cup, losing to the Soviet Union (4\u20132) and West Germany (1\u20130).\n\nArgentina immediately went to Australia to contest the Australia Bicentennial Gold Cup, where the team did not have a good performance, with one win against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and a large defeat by [[Australia national soccer team|the local team]] (4\u20131).\n\nBack to Argentina, the team started its preparation for the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held in Brazil. Argentina qualified to the second round after beating Chile and Uruguay (both 1\u20130) and two draws with Ecuador and Bolivia (both 0\u20130). In the second stage, Argentina lost to Brazil and Uruguay (both 2\u20130) and only drew with Paraguay (0\u20130). Argentina was eliminated without winning a game and with no goals scored on this round. Some players of the team were Pumpido, Brown, Ruggeri, Clausen, Cuciuffo, Burruchaga, Maradona, Enrique, Giusti (all of them world champions in 1986), [[Claudio Caniggia]], [[Abel Balbo]], [[Luis Islas]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]], [[N\u00e9stor Gorosito]] and [[Pedro Troglio]].\n\n===1990: Finalist again===\nArgentina went to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] with no qualifiers needed as being the previous champion. Prior to the World Cup, the national team played some several matches with no good results: Argentina lost to Mexico (0\u20132) and Scotland (0\u20132), winning just one of the five games played (to Israel, chosen again to be the last rival before the tournament as it had been four years before). In addition, Jorge Valdano (one of the most important players during the 1986 World Cup) trained hard in order to be in good physical condition for the Cup, but Bilardo decided not to include him in the definitive list of players. To that, Valdano said, \"I swam through the ocean but I drowned at the shore.\" In addition to Valdano not playing, a number of other important players were injured, so Argentina resorted to cynical tactics on the field, as they knew they could not win easily in a straight fight.<ref>[http://www.elespectador.com/deportes/futbolinternacional/articulo-378474-dos-anos-seleccion-colombia-tendra-un-gran-equipo Interview to Valdano] at Colombian newspaper ''[[El Espectador]]'', 30 September 2012</ref>\n\nArgentina finally debuted at the inaugural match at the [[San Siro]] in [[Milan]], being defeated by [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] (1\u20130). This result caused a great surprise in Argentina<ref>[http://www.generaccion.com/usuarios/20284/sorpresa-mundial-italia-1990-camerun-vence-argentina-1-0 \"Sorpresa en Mundial Italia 1990: Camer\u00fan vence a Argentina\"  - Generacion.com], 8 June 2010</ref> so the national team line-up was based on the 1986 world champion.\n\n[[File:Caniggia scoring v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Claudio Caniggia]] scoring the only goal against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Turin]].]]\nArgentina won its second match against the Soviet Union 2\u20130 (where titular goalkeeper was [[Nery Pumpido]] seriously injured, being replaced by [[Sergio Goycochea]] for the rest of the tournament), and drew 1\u20131 with [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the last match of first round, both played in [[Naples]], where Maradona played for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in the [[Serie A]]. The team qualified to the second round, where they faced Brazil at the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] in [[Turin]]. In a match where Brazil played much better than Argentina, with forwards [[M\u00fcller (footballer)|M\u00fcller]] and [[Careca]] repeatedly shooting to the goal but missing the target (the ball clashed Argentina's posts a couple of times, while Goycoechea stopped other shots) Argentina (with Maradona in bad physical condition) resisted Brazilian offensive movements during the first half, which ended 0\u20130. In the second half, Brazil was not so persistent as it had been during the first 45 minutes, so Argentina took advantage of the situation. With nine minutes till full-time, Maradona took the ball in the centre of the field, dribbled past three opponents and made a precise pass to winger [[Claudio Caniggia]], who advanced with the ball to a goal after dribbling around goalkeeper [[Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel]]. Argentina won the match 1\u20130, eliminating its arch-rival in a World Cup for the first time. That match is still regarded by the media and fans as one of the most remarkable moments of an Argentina national team.<ref>[http://www.mundialsudafrica.com/partidos-memorables-argentina-1-brasil-0-italia-1990/ \"Partidos memorables: Argentina 1-Brasil 0\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/es-ar/slideshow/375/1/cinco-victorias-memorables-sobre-brasil \"Cinco victorias memorables sobre Brasil\" by Jonatan Fabbian at Goal.com]</ref>\n\nFor their quarter-final match in [[Florence]], Argentina narrowly eliminated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in an exciting [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/sports/world-cup-90-argentina-beats-yugoslavia.html \"Argentina beats Yugoslavia\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 July 1990</ref> with Goycoechea becoming a hero after stopping three penalty kicks, including the last two.<ref name=goyco>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/676284-Nacia-Sergio-Goycochea-el-gran-heroe-de-los-penales-en-Italia-1990.html \"Nac\u00eda Sergio Goycochea, el gran h\u00e9roe de los penales en Italia 1990\", Play Futbol], 17 October 2012</ref> Maradona also missed a penalty kick, a rare occurrence; at one point Argentina were behind the Yugoslavs, but Goycoechea's outstanding goalkeeping kept Argentina in the tournament.\n\n[[File:Argentina vs italy worldcup.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The squad that beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Napoli]], qualifying for the final.]]\nArgentina advanced to semi-finals where it to play against Italy in Naples. The local host was considered favourite to win the match because their striker [[Salvatore Schillaci]] was the tournament's top scorer (he would be awarded both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the end of the tournament) and  Argentina had many injured players, Maradona being one of them. Nevertheless, Argentina made its best performance in the World Cup and the match ended 1\u20131 after 90 minutes. With zero goals in extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout where Goycoechea was the hero again, stopping the shots from [[Aldo Serena]] and [[Roberto Donadoni]] to send Argentina to its second-straight World Cup final.\n\nFor the final in Rome, Argentina played West Germany, coached by former player [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. Caniggia was suspended for one game after receiving a yellow card in the match against Italy so he could not play the final. Germany arrived to the final as a wide favorite to take the Cup, as the squad had showed an effective and precise playing style, unlike Argentina which (with the exception of the game with Italy) had not had good previous performances. In addition, German footballers were in good condition while the Argentine players came to the final with several injuries, including Maradona. The game proved to be violent, brutal and bad tempered, particularly from the Argentines. Nevertheless, Germany only could score a goal at 83 minutes for a doubtful punishment by Mexican referee [[Edgardo Codesal]], who awarded Germany a penalty kick for what he thought was a foul by Roberto Sensini against Rudi V\u00f6ller. The call was controversial, and it was heavily debated by the Argentinian players. Andreas Brehme converted the penalty kick to give West Germany team its third World Cup title.<ref>[http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=260625&IdxSeccion=0 \"La pol\u00e9mica alemana sobre el penal en la final de Italia 90\"], ''Infobae'', 16 June 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.geofutbol.com/2008/10/26/final-italia-1990-alemania-1-0-argentina/ \"Final Italia 1990: Alemania 1-0 Argentina\" -GeoFutbol.com]</ref>\n\nThe 1986 champion side could not repeat the high performances made four years prior, most notably Maradona, who played all the tournament injured.

The team lost to Brazil 0\u20132 but beat [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] 3\u20131 at [[Salta]] and smashed Israel 3\u20130 in [[Ramat Gan]]. Argentina debuted in the championship thrashing [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 4\u20130 in [[Boston]], with a hat-trick by Batistuta. Maradona also scored the third goal for Argentina, which would be his last goal in a World Cup. The national team played its second match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] again in Boston, which defeated by 2\u20131 (2 goals by Caniggia). At the end of the match, Argentina became a favorite to win the tournament, due to the attacking playing style showed by the squad (playing with four forwards), the number of goals scored and the good performances of some of its players such as Redondo, Caniggia, Batistuta, and even the aging Maradona, who looked in great shape and scored a gem of a goal.\n\nAt the end of the match against Nigeria, Maradona was called for the drug test, which gave positive results for [[ephedrine]], a banned substance. The impact and repercussion of the news were immediate, and Maradona was expelled from the tournament and suspended for 15 months by [[FIFA]].<ref>[http://soccerlens.com/doping-in-football/19458/ \"Doping in football\" by Victor Li on SoccerLens.com], 6 January 2009</ref>\n\nWith the team still hurt after losing its leader, Argentina was defeated by Bulgaria in the sweltering heat of [[Dallas]] for their last match of the first round. The team qualified to the knockout phase, where they were beaten by Romania 3\u20132 in [[Los Angeles]]; Basile decided not to include Caniggia in this match after he was benched during the 27th minute of the Bulgaria match. After the successes of 1986 and 1990, Argentina was eliminated in the second round. Although eliminated in the second round; in an [[ESPN]] interview with [[Quique Wolff]], Maradona called the 1994 squad the greatest Argentina team of all time.\n\n===1998 World Cup===\nWith Maradona officially retired, Argentina went into the tournament with high expectations, still fielding players from their previous tournament, with Gabriel Batistuta still a constant goalscoring threat and Diego Simeone remaining as the leading figure from the anchorman position. Drawn into Group H of the competition, their opponents consisted of [[Japan national football team|Japan]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. They began their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over the Asian nation, following it up with a 5\u20130 demolition of the Caribbeans.  Their third group game was against the Croatians, who had also confirmed qualification to the next round and ended with victory for the ''Albiceleste'' by 1\u20130.\n\nArgentina went into the knockout phase with the impressive record of seven goals scored, keeping clean sheets in all three group games.  Their opponent was England]], fielding an equally strong team. Argentina took the lead with just six minutes played through Gabriel Batistuta from the penalty spot, only for [[Alan Shearer]] to equalize through the same means four minutes later. Six minutes after, youngster [[Michael Owen]] broke past [[Roberto Ayala]] to score a great individual effort, which was eventually cancelled out one minute into stoppage time after a free kick routine put [[Javier Zanetti]] through on goal to score, leaving the final result at 2\u20132 at the end of the first half.\n\nIn the second half, England playmaker [[David Beckham]] was sent off after a kick on Simeone, with the scores remaining unchanged until the end of normal time and extra time.  Argentina won 4\u20133 on penalties, after Ayala scored the decisive spot kick to book their quarter-final spot, where the Netherlands awaited them.\n\nThe game was an equally fought match, with both sides scoring early goals; [[Patrick Kluivert]] netting after just 12 minutes and [[Claudio L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Claudio L\u00f3pez]] equalizing five minutes later.  Argentina held an advantage as the Dutch went a man down with the dismissal of [[Arthur Numan]] after his second booking for a foul on Simeone, though they were unable to take the opportunity and break the deadlock before they too went a man down; with [[Ariel Ortega]] receiving two successive yellow cards, the first one for diving inside the penalty box, with the second coming after headbutting Dutch goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]]. Argentina's defence held tightly as extra-time beckoned, until a long aerial ball from Dutch captain [[Frank de Boer]] found [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who maneuvered around Ayala and beat the Argentine goalkeeper Roa to send the Dutch through, eliminating Argentina from the competition.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\nArgentina had been eliminated at the group stage at Korea/Japan [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], although they had been among the pre-tournament favorites. There was a high expectation of a better performance in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany. Argentina qualified for the knockout stages with wins over the Ivory Coast (2\u20131) and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] (6\u20130), and a 0\u20130 draw with the Netherlands.\n\nIn the round of 16, Argentina defeated Mexico 2\u20131 in extra-time, the winning goal scored by [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]]; this goal went on to win an online poll organized by FIFA as the best goal of the World Cup.<ref>http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/bgt.html</ref>  In the quarter-final, they lost 4\u20132 in penalties against hosts Germany after a 1\u20131 draw. A brawl erupted between the Argentines and Germans after the game ended; unused substitute [[Leandro Cufr\u00e9]] was sent off for kicking [[Per Mertesacker]], while Maxi Rodr\u00edguez hit [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] from behind. Following an investigation of video evidence, FIFA issued four-and two-game suspensions for Cufre and Rodr\u00edguez respectively. Germany's [[Torsten Frings]] was also suspended for the semi-final match for punching [[Julio Ricardo Cruz|Julio Cruz]].\n\nShortly after the elimination, coach [[Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman]] resigned from his position. The AFA appointed Alfio Basile, who had previously managed the national side during the 1994 World Cup, as his successor.\n\n===2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina won all three games in the group stage, beating the United States, Colombia and Paraguay. After convincing victories over Peru and Mexico in the quarter-final and semi-final, respectively, they were favorites to beat Brazil in the final, but were defeated 3\u20130.\n\n===2010 World Cup===\n[[File:Messi Podolski Di Maria 2010.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lionel Messi]] carries out the ball, followed by [[Lukas Podolski]] in the quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].]]\n\nPrior to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], [[Diego Maradona]] was appointed head coach. During the qualification process, he oversaw a 6\u20131 defeat to [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], and after a string of losses and draws, Argentina came dangerously close to failing to qualify, but victories in the last two matches secured qualification for the final tournament. In the final tournament itself, Argentina was placed in Group B, winning all their games. Their first game was against Nigeria, where Argentina netted a goal in the sixth minute to ensure a 1\u20130 victory. In the second match, against [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]], a [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] hat-trick and a Korean own goal finished the score at 4\u20131. Argentina's last group game was against Greece, a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nArgentina then advanced to the round of 16 to play Mexico. The game started with controversy when [[Carlos Tevez]] headed a ball from [[Lionel Messi]] for a goal; replay clearly showed that Tevez was in an offside position. Eventually, Argentina beat Mexico 3\u20131 to advance to the quarter-finals. In a much-hyped game, Argentina was shocked after Germany eliminated them with a 4\u20130 win. [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] opened the scoring in the third minute, with [[Miroslav Klose]] adding an additional two and [[Arne Friedrich]] one.\n\n===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\n[[File:Argentine - Portugal - Argentine.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Argentina line-up at a friendly match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[Geneva]], February 2011.]]\n\nThe [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was the first major tournament for new coach [[Sergio Batista]]. Argentina started the tournament with a shocking 1\u20131 tie against underdogs Bolivia. In their second game, they played a goalless draw against Colombia in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], but went on to win their third game 3\u20130 against underdogs [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Argentina was to play Uruguay in the quarter-finals. After going down after five minutes to a [[Diego P\u00e9rez (footballer)|Diego P\u00e9rez]] goal, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn equalized in the 17th minute. The score remained unchanged and after extra time, Argentina lost 5\u20134 in penalties with a miss from Carlos Tevez. After the elimination, Batista was sacked and replaced by former [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] coach [[Alejandro Sabella]].\n\n===2014 World Cup===\nArgentina qualified for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and were drawn into Group F alongside Nigeria, [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and debutants [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Argentina had beaten all three of those teams, easily making it through to the next round. In the next round, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 after a goalless 90 minutes. In the quarter-finals, they beat Belgium, also 1\u20130 through an early goal. They then beat the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 4\u20132 from a penalty shootout in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], but lost to eventual winners Germany in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], concluding the World Cup runners-up.\n\n===2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina entered the subsequent tournament, the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] as heavy favorites to take home the trophy. They began their group stage against Paraguay, where after leading 2\u20130 for most of the match ultimately settled for a 2\u20132 draw. Despite doubts in defence, they overcame the difficulties to beat fellow tournament favorites Uruguay and Jamaica. Their quarter-final opponent was Colombia, whose sturdy defense was impossible to break through and goalkeeper [[David Ospina]] making impressive saves to keep the game tied at 0\u20130. In penalties, Argentina missed several chances until Carlos Tevez, who was the sole player to miss his spot kick during the previous tournament, netted his attempt to send ''la Albiceleste'' through to the semi-finals to face Paraguay.  The game was evenly played until half-time, when the score was 2\u20131 to Argentina, but four more goals during the second half allowed Argentina to cruise to the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica Final|final]], where they met host nation Chile.\n\nThe final was a hotly contested match, with both sides having great chances to open the scoring, particularly with a powerful shot from [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] in the first half for Argentina, with [[Alexis S\u00e1nchez]] having a clear one for Chile in the second half. With the scores still tied at the end of regulation, the match went to penalties. Only captain Lionel Messi netted his penalty attempt, with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn sending his attempt well over the crossbar and [[\u00c9ver Banega]] having his shot saved by [[Claudio Bravo (footballer)|Claudio Bravo]] to leave the final scoreline at 4\u20131 in penalties.\n\n===Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario===\nOnce more, Argentina entered the tournament as heavy favorites to take home the trophy after 22 years of international drought. ''La Albiceleste'' cruised through their group, with their opening match being a replay of the Copa Am\u00e9rica final from the year before against trophy holders Chile, which Argentina would go on to win 2\u20131. Further victories against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and Bolivia allowed them to top the group with the maximum number of points. Their quarter-final match was against surprise side Venezuela, where the match remained even for both sides before the Argentines won 4\u20131. They then dispatched hosts United States 4\u20130 to earn yet another [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario Final|final]] clash against Chile.\n\nAs previously, it was an even match, with Chile initially having the upper hand and more possession before going a man down, with [[Marcelo D\u00edaz]] being dismissed after obstructing Messi on the ball. This, however, made it more difficult for Argentina to break through their defence, and they too would go a man down not long after with [[Marcos Rojo]] receiving a straight red card for a tackle on [[Arturo Vidal]]. Once again the match finished 0\u20130 and went to penalties. Although [[Sergio Romero]] saved Vidal's penalty kick, Messi shot his attempt over the crossbar, with the subsequent players netting their attempts until Bravo saved from [[Lucas Biglia]] and [[Francisco Silva]] netted the final penalty to once again hand Chile the trophy. The defeat caused frustration within the Argentine players, with Messi announcing his retirement from international football not long after, as well as many others suggesting their departure from the national team as well.\n\n===2018 World Cup===\nOn 20 May 2017, the [[Argentine Football Association]] announced that [[Jorge Sampaoli]] would take over as the new national team manager, officially on 1 June 2017. Sampaoli's first game in charge was a friendly match against [[Brazil]] on 9 June in Australia, with Argentina winning 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2017/04/21/internacional/1492798205_460690.html\n|title= Sampaoli ser\u00e1 presentado con Argentina el 22 de mayo|date= 4 April 2017|work=Diario AS|accessdate= 20 May 2017|language=es}}</ref> However, Argentina struggled during the qualifiers, and it took a [[Lionel Messi]] hat trick at Ecuador to confirm qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/lionel-messi-argentina-win-world-cup-qualify-ecuador-hat-trick-russia-2018-latest-a7993841.html|title=Lionel Messi burnishes legacy with hat-trick as Argentina come from behind to beat Ecuador and book World Cup place|date=11 October 2017|work=The Independent|publisher=ESI Media|author=Miguel Delaney}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 March 2018, in a warm-up preparation friendly match, Argentina, without its captain Messi, who was sidelined for the match due to an injury, was routed 6-1 by 2010 World Cup champion [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[Wanda Metropolitano]] stadium in [[Madrid]]. It was Spain's biggest win over another previous World Cup champion, and Argentina's biggest loss since their 6\u20131 loss to Bolivia in 2009, and also tied the record for Argentina's biggest loss overall, by a margin of five goals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Spain's mauling of Argentina equals record Albiceleste defeat |url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/28/football/1522233313_446145.html |newspaper=[[AS (newspaper)|AS]] |date=28 March 2018 |access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Sampaoli announced a 35-man preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup, and the final squad list was released on 21 May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/icardi-cut-from-argentinas-23-man-world-cup-squad/lo0f6fig55ih1jh7w9v4enau6 |title=Icardi cut from Argentina's 23-man World Cup squad |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Cup in Russia came around, the tournament was a disaster for the ''Albiceleste''.

It was a cup organized by both Argentine and Uruguayan Football Associations, with its last edition being contested in 1992. The first official title won by Argentina was the 1906 Copa Lipton, defeating Uruguay 2\u20130 in [[Montevideo]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/lipton.html Copa Lipton 1905-1992 at RSSSF]</ref> That same year, Argentina also played the [[Newton Cup]], another competition organized by both associations, earning the trophy after defeating Uruguay 2\u20131 in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nIn the following years, matches played by the Argentine side were against South American teams only. The reasons varied from the long time the trips took to another countries by then to [[World War I]].<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7857%3Aseleccion-nacional-los-comienzos&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"AFA: los comienzos (1901-1930)\", AFA official site]</ref>\n\nArgentina would win four consecutive Newton Cups from 1907 to 1911,<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesn/newton.html Copa Newton 1906-1976 at RSSSF]</ref> and four Lipton Cups from 1906 to 1909.

The host plus Brazil, Chile and Uruguay were the only teams contesting the inaugural competition. During that tournament Argentina played three matches, defeating Chile 6\u20130 and drawing Brazil and Uruguay, who became champions on goal difference. The line-up at the final was: Isola, D\u00edaz, Reyes, Mart\u00ednez, Olazar, Badaracco, Heissinger, [[Alberto Ohaco|Ohaco]], H. Hayes, E. Hayes and [[Natalio Perinetti|Perinetti]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/16safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\nArgentina won its first South American championship in 1921, also held in Buenos Aires. The squad won all the games disputed, defeating [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and Uruguay to earn six points with no goals received. Notable players of that team were goalkeeper [[Am\u00e9rico Tesoriere]] and striker [[Pedro Calomino]]. Julio Libonatti was also tournament's top scorer.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tables/21safull.html Southamerican Championship 1916 - RSSSF]</ref>\n\n===The Olympic goal===\n[[File:Gololimpicodeonzari.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Onzari's olympic goal against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in 1924.]]\n\nIn 1924, Argentina played a friendly match against Uruguay at [[Sportivo Barracas]]' stadium. When only 15 minutes had been played, winger [[Ces\u00e1reo Onzari]] scored from a [[corner kick]], with no other player touching the ball before scoring. Due to the fact that Uruguay was the Olympic champion, this play was called \"Gol Ol\u00edmpico\". This denomination still remains.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2004/10/02/deportes/d-07101.htm \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 80\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 2 October 2004</ref>\n\nThe goal stood since [[FIFA]] had previously regulated goals scored directly from the corner kick, as Onzari did during that match. According to ''La Naci\u00f3n'' newspaper, 52,000 fans attended the game, an Argentina 2\u20131 win, where the Uruguayan team left the field with only four minutes to play. Argentine players later complained about the rough play of the Uruguayans during the match, while their rivals also complained about the aggressiveness of local spectators, who threw bottles at them at the end of the match.<ref>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1181561-el-gol-olimpico-cumple-85-anos \"El gol ol\u00edmpico cumple 85 a\u00f1os\"], Canchallena.com, 2 October 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the South American championship was hosted by third time in Argentina, and the ''Albicelest'' won its second title. The team played four matches and remained unbeaten once more, defeating Paraguay and Brazil twice each. A highmark was the 4\u20131 victory against rivals Brazil.\n\nArgentina won another consecutive title in 1927 obtaining the [[1927 South American Championship|South American championship held in Peru]]. The team made a great campaign, finishing unbeaten with three wins over three games played. The national squad achieved a large victory over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (7\u20131), then beating Uruguay by 3\u20132 and the local team by 5\u20131 in the last match of the tournament. It was the third South American title for the Argentina national team.\n\n===1928 Summer Olympics===\n{{Main|Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|Argentina Olympic football team}}\n[[File:Argentina football team Olympics 1928.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The team that reached the final of the 1928 Summer Olympics.]]\n\nIn 1928, Argentina went to Amsterdam to play the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], which was the first international tournament played by the national team in its history. The football squad reached the final after trashing the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 11\u20132, Belgium 6\u20133 and Egypt 6\u20130.

Argentina finished unbeaten once more, defeating all its rivals in the group: [[Peru national football team|Peru]] (3\u20130), Paraguay (4\u20131) and Uruguay in the last match played in the [[Estadio Gas\u00f3metro]] of Buenos Aires. Most of players that took part of the team would play for Argentina in the first World Cup organized by FIFA one year later.\n\nArgentina was one of the 13 national teams attending to the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]] hosted by Uruguay.\n\nIn the inaugural match of the World Cup, Argentina defeated [[France national football team|France]] 1\u20130. The national team then beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 6\u20133 and finished its run in the first stage by defeating [[Chile national football team|Chile]] 3\u20131. Argentina qualified to the semi-finals where the squad widely beat the United States 6\u20131. On July 30, Argentina played its first World Cup final against Uruguay, but lost 4\u20132.\n\n===1934\u201354: A long absence===\nArgentina played only one game at the next [[1934 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in Italy in 1934. The tournament format was a knockout tournament, and Argentina lost its only match 3\u20132 to [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Argentina would not participate in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 World Cup]] in France, the last before [[World War II]]. The first World Cup after the War was the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] held in Brazil, but Argentina did not enter the competition due to a conflict with the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]]. For the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]] in Switzerland, Argentina refused to participate.\n\nIn 1951, Argentina played [[England national football team|England]] for the first time and were defeated 2\u20131 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. The second leg was played in Buenos Aires on 14 June 1953, where Argentina won 3\u20131, though the match caused great repercussions in Argentina.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/05/14/d-05301.htm \"Los 50 a\u00f1os del gol de Grillo a Inglaterra\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 14 May 2003</ref>\n\n===From ''Los Carasucias'' to the 1958 disaster===\n[[File:Carasucias.JPG|thumb|right|200px|''Los Carasucias'': Corbatta, Maschio, Angelillo, S\u00edvori and Cruz.]]\n\nAlthough Argentina did not contest any World Cups from 1934 to 1954, the team won the [[1937 South American Championship|1937]], [[1941 South American Championship|1941]], [[1945 South American Championship|1945]], [[1946 South American Championship|1946]], [[1947 South American Championship|1947]], [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] and [[1957 South American Championship|1957]] South American championships, all squads coached by Guillermo St\u00e1bile.\n\nThe 1957 squad is probably the most remembered team of those years because of its skilled players and exquisite style of playing showed on the field. Argentina was trashed [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] (8\u20132), [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] (3\u20130), Uruguay (4\u20130), Chile (6\u20132) and Brazil (3\u20130). The team was defeated by Peru in the last game but won the tournament due to finishing first in its group. The attacking line, formed by [[Oreste Corbatta]], [[Humberto Maschio]], [[Antonio Valent\u00edn Angelillo|Antonio Angelillo]], [[Omar S\u00edvori]] and [[Osvaldo H\u00e9ctor Cruz|Osvaldo Cruz]], was widely praised by then, being still remembered by the media and football fans.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/03/deportes/d-04901.htm \"Los Carasucias: la gloria cumple 50 a\u00f1os\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014055858/http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/03/deportes/d-04901.htm |date=2013-10-14 }}, ''Clar\u00edn'', 3 April 2007</ref> Maschio was also the topscorer with 9 goals.\n\nArgentina returned to a World Cup competition after 24 years, more precisely to the [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] held in Sweden. The team suffered the absence of Maschio, Angelillo and S\u00edvori (playing in the [[Serie A|Italian first division]] but not called by St\u00e1bile for the tournament<ref>[http://www.misionmundial.com.ar/historia/Bocha-Maschio-generacion-perdida_0_254974576.html \"El Bocha Maschio y la generaci\u00f3n perdida\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002451/http://www.misionmundial.com.ar/historia/Bocha-Maschio-generacion-perdida_0_254974576.html |date=2013-12-03 }}, ''Misi\u00f3n Mundial'', 4 May 2010</ref>), who had made outstanding performances in Lima one year before. Although the squad was formed with valued players, the lack of experience facing European squads was evidenced once the tournament finished. Argentina lost to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] 3\u20131 in the first game, though they came back to defeat [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] in the second match. Argentina was finally thrashed by [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] 6\u20131, one of the worst defeats of a national team in a World Cup and being eliminated from the competition. The poor performance was called \"''El desastre de Suecia''\" (\"The Sweden disaster\").

The team thrashed Chile 6\u20131 at the debut, then beat Bolivia 2\u20130, Peru and Paraguay 3\u20131, Uruguay 4\u20131 and finished with a 1\u20131 draw against Brazil. Argentina remained unbeaten, winning five of six matches played. The team was coached by a triumvirate composed by [[Victorio Spinetto]], [[Jos\u00e9 Della Torre]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Barreiro (footballer)|Jos\u00e9 Barreiro]], replacing Guillermo St\u00e1bile after his 19-year tenure in the national team. Argentina would not win a Copa Am\u00e9rica until [[1991 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], when the team coached by [[Alfio Basile]] obtained the trophy in Chile.\n\nIn 1959, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Moreno]] became Argentina coach, although he did not spend much time with the team. Under his coaching Argentina disputed the [[1959 South American Championship (Ecuador)|Southamerican championship in Ecuador]], where the squad defeated Paraguay 4\u20132, drew the hosts 1\u20131 and suffered a large defeat by 5\u20130 at the hands of Uruguay, although the team achieved a great 4\u20131 victory against Brazil with three goals by [[Jos\u00e9 Sanfilippo]] in the last match. Once the extra tournament finished, Moreno left his place and Guillermo St\u00e1bile started his 2nd period as coach of Argentina national team.\n\nIn 1960, Argentina won its first and only [[Panamerican Championship 1960|Panamerican championship]] held in [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica]]. That same year the team suffered three losses to Brazil: two of them in the Roca Cup and the next in the Atlantic Cup. That was the last match where Argentina was coached by St\u00e1bile in his second tenure. He would be replaced by [[Victorio Spinetto]].\n\nIn 1961, Argentina started a tour across Europe, playing several matches against local national teams. The squad only achieved one victory against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] with two losses and two draws. After a short period coached by Jos\u00e9 D'Amico, [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the team.

Minella left the team, being replaced by [[Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda]] after qualification was over. [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]] took over the squad, beginning his second tenure on the national side.\n\nThe national side played several friendly matches against [[Soviet Union national football team|the Soviet Union]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] before its flight to England.

Argentina qualified to the quarter-finals where the team was defeated by the host team 1\u20130. It was a controversial match where midfielder [[Antonio Ratt\u00edn]] was sent off by German referee Rudolf Kreitlein for \"violence of the tongue\", despite the referee speaking no Spanish. Ratt\u00edn was so incensed with the decision, believing the referee to be biased in favour of England, that he refused to leave.

The national squad shared its group with Bolivia and Peru, losing the first two games played as the away team. Although Argentina won the next game (over Bolivia, 1\u20130), the 2\u20132 draw against Peru in the last fixture (played at [[La Bombonera Stadium|La Bombonera]]) allowed the Peruvian squad to be one of the South American representatives in the World Cup, eliminating Argentina.<ref name=transition/><ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/stories/classicqualifiers/news/newsid=735385.html \"El d\u00eda que Per\u00fa enmudeci\u00f3 a La Bombonera\", FIFA official site]</ref> To date, this remains the only time that Argentina has failed to qualify for a World Cup in which it entered a team.

Pizzuti was the manager during three years, in which Argentina played several friendly games against South American teams, which included the 1971 Roca Cup title (shared with Brazil). In 1972, Argentina was invited to play the Brazil Independence Cup, where the team did not achieve good results.\n\nAfter the Independence Cup, Pizzuti was replaced by [[Omar S\u00edvori]], the most notable player of the 1957 Copa Am\u00e9rica triumph and had previous experience as manager of [[Rosario Central]] and [[Estudiantes de La Plata]]. Argentina played some friendly matches as preparation for the qualifying, with some interesting results such as a 3\u20132 over West Germany in [[Munich]].\n\n===\"The Ghost Team\" and 1974 World Cup===\nQualifying for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]] began in September 1973, where Argentina shared its group with Bolivia and Paraguay. Bolivia used to play its home venues at [[La Paz]], where Argentine players suffered the lack of oxygen and other effects caused by [[altitude sickness]]. To avoid complications, S\u00edvori decide to prepare a team to play in altitude. Following his instructions, Miguel Ignomiriello took many players to [[Tilcara]] so they could become acclimatized to altitude.<ref>[http://decelesteyblanco.blogspot.com.ar/2008/03/la-seleccin-fantasma.html \"Historias Albicelestes: La Selecci\u00f3n Fantasma\" by Eduardo C\u00e1ntaro]</ref><ref>[http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 \"Ese equipo fantasma\", ''Diario Uno''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015173356/http://www.diariouno.com.ar/edimpresa/nota.php?id=209363 |date=2013-10-15 }}, 3 April 2009</ref>\n\nArgentina won the match played in La Paz 1\u20130.

With its new coach on the bench, Argentina played only four matches before the competition, facing European teams. Argentina defeated Romania and France and drew England before suffering a defeat to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] by 4\u20131.\n\nOnce more, Argentina made a poor performance in a World Cup. They were defeated by Poland in their opening game by 3\u20132, followed by a 1\u20131 draw with Italy. In the last game of the first round, Argentina defeated [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]] 4\u20131, granting qualification to the second round of the tournament, where the team lost to the Netherlands, Brazil, ending with a 1\u20131 draw to [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]]. Argentina finished last in the group table and eighth in the overall table.\n\n===The Menotti era: Beginning of greatness===\nThe demise of the team in the World Cup forced the Association to make changes in Argentine football. David Bracuto was named president of the Football Association in 1974. He offered [[C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti]] the head coaching role of Argentina, which Menotti accepted under several conditions, one being that native players under 25 should not be sold to foreign clubs.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7862%3Aseleccion-prioridad-numero-1&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Selecci\u00f3n, prioridad n\u00famero uno\", AFA website]</ref>\n\nMenotti debuted on 12 October 1974 in a friendly match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. Argentina began a long preparation for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 World Cup]] which would be hosted on home soil for the very first time, playing friendly matches and tournaments. During those years, Argentina played a total of 33 matches. The year 1977 was also the international debut of [[Diego Maradona]], who played for the first time at age 16 against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. The match was held in Buenos Aires with a large victory for Argentina by 5\u20131.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/02/27/um/m-01371213.htm \"A 30 a\u00f1os del debut de Maradona en la Selecci\u00f3n\"], ''Clar\u00edn'', 27 February 2007</ref>\n\nArgentina also played a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica, where for the first time there was no fixed venue. All matches were played throughout each country across the tournament. Argentina debuted thrashing Venezuela but lost to Brazil in the two games played (2\u20131 and 1\u20130).

Although Maradona was considered one of the best players in the world, Menotti did not include him in the definitive list for the tournament. Some sources state that the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentine military junta]] that ruled Argentina by then pushed Menotti to include River Plate's midfielder [[Norberto Alonso]] instead of Maradona, and that Menotti almost certainly knew that the prodigiously talented 17-year old would not be able to handle the immense pressure and attention in the biggest sporting event in Argentina's history. Nevertheless, other journalists assert that there were too many offensive midfielders.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eblog.com.ar/4318/maradona-y-el-mundial-%C2%B478/ |title=\"Maradona y el Mundial 78\" |access-date=2012-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022131351/http://www.eblog.com.ar/4318/maradona-y-el-mundial-%c2%b478/ |archive-date=2013-10-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Passarella world cup.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Team captain [[Daniel Passarella]] holding the World Cup trophy.]]\nArgentina finally debuted on 2 June 1978 against Hungary, winning 2\u20131.

In the second round Argentina was placed in Group 1 sharing it with Brazil, Poland and Peru. In the first game, Argentina beat Poland 2\u20130, with both goals from Mario Kempes. Next game was against South American powerhouse Brazil in which the game ended with a 0\u20130 draw. The last game was against Peru, a rival that Argentina easily defeated with a 6\u20130 win. Argentina was able to edge out Brazil in the group and went on to the final. Argentina had to beat Peru by four goals or more to progress.

On 25 June 1978, at River Plate's [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|Estadio Monumental]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina played its second World Cup final. Mario Kempes gave Argentina the lead in the 38th minute, with the Dutch squad able to respond in the 82nd minute for the equalizer. The game went to extra time and Mario Kempes once again gave the Argentines the lead and [[Daniel Bertoni]] added another goal which sealed the win for Argentina, which became the second South American team to win the World Cup at its home soil. Kempes was not only the most notable player of the team but also the topscorer of the tournament with six goals.\n\nAfter the success of the World Cup, Menotti continued as coach and Argentina played some friendly match as preparation for the [[1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica]]. Maradona scored his first goal for the Senior team against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in [[Glasgow]], where Argentina won 3\u20131.<ref>[http://blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html \"A 30 a\u00f1os del primer gol de Maradona\", DeporTEA] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726023934/http://www.blogsdeteaydeportea.com/contenidos/940-a-30-anos-del-primer-gol-de-maradona.html |date=2011-07-26 }}, 2 June 2009</ref>\n\nThe highlight of 1979 was the [[1979 FIFA World Youth Championship]] obtained by the [[Argentina under-20 national football team|under-20 team]] in [[Tokyo]]. The team, also coached by Menotti, won the tournament with Maradona and [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]] as the leaders and most notable players of the squad. The tournament was also the first official championship played by Maradona in a national team.\n\nDue to Argentina needing no qualifiers to the next World Cup as holders, the national team played a series of matches as preparation for the competition. In 1980 there was no official tournaments so the team toured on Europe and also hosted friendly games in some of the most important cities of Argentina such as [[Mar del Plata]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Argentina played the [[1980 Mundialito]], a competition hosted by Uruguay in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first World Cup tournament, where the team defeated West Germany and drew with Brazil to be eliminated in the first stage.\n\n===1982: End of an era and beginning of Maradona era===\n[[File:Arg1982 v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Argentina players leaving the field after being eliminated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]].]]\n\nIn 1982 the Argentine squad travelled to Spain to participate in the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]] while Argentina was fighting in the [[Falklands War]] (''Guerra de Malvinas'') with the United Kingdom after the invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]] had been ordered by president [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] on April 2.\n\nThe lineup was based on the 1978 team with the addition of Diego Maradona (who had won a domestic title playing at a high level) and Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz. The squad arrived in Spain as a big favourite to win the Cup.  Argentina debuted with a 1\u20130 loss to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]]. There were internal tensions within the camp between the older and younger players, and this caused problems. Nevertheless, the team recovered by defeating Hungary (4\u20131) and  [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (2\u20130) therefore qualifying for the next stage. In the second round, Argentina shared a group with Italy and Brazil, being defeated by both (3\u20131 and 2\u20131) and eliminated from the championship. Maradona could not show his skills during the tournament, suffering from the rough play of rivals (especially [[Claudio Gentile]] in the game against Italy). He would eventually be sent off by the referee after kicking Brazilian player [[Jo\u00e3o Batista da Silva|Batista]] in the groin.<ref>[http://www.afa.org.ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7863%3Auna-alegria-y-un-golpe-inesperado&catid=181%3Aseleccion-nacional&Itemid=226 \"Una alegr\u00eda y un golpe inesperado (1979/1982)\", AFA official website]</ref><ref>[http://www.marca.com/reportajes/2010/04/espana_1982/2010/04/19/seccion_01/1271693378.html \"Maradona fue mundialista por primera vez en Espa\u00f1a\" by Javier Estepa], ''Marca''</ref>\n\nOther players that formed the squad were [[Juan Barbas]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]] (from the 1979 youth championship-winning team), [[Patricio Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]], [[Enzo Trossero]] and [[Jorge Valdano]].\n\nThe failure at the World Cup caused Menotti to leave his post. Despite the poor performances, the national team achieved two world titles (senior and youth) during the nine years with Menotti as coach.

Bilardo was famous for his perfectionism and obsession with tactic and strategy of the game, which called the attention as much as followers as critics. The Bilardo era began in May 1983 with a 2\u20132 draw with Chile in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Soon after Argentina played the [[1983 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], the first official tournament with Bilardo. The squad was eliminated on first round with 3 draws (2 with [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] and a 0\u20130 with Brazil), winning its only match 1\u20130 to Brazil in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe team was formed by footballers playing in domestic [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] exclusively, being some of them goalkeepers [[Ubaldo Fillol]] and [[Nery Pumpido]], defenders [[N\u00e9stor Clausen]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]], [[Enzo Trossero]], [[Julio Olarticoechea]] and [[Roberto Mouzo]]; midfielders [[Claudio Marangoni]], [[Jorge Burruchaga]], [[Alejandro Sabella]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Daniel Ponce]]; forwards [[Ricardo Gareca]], [[Alberto M\u00e1rcico]].\n\nAfter the Copa Am\u00e9rica, Argentina travelled to [[Calcuta]] to play the Nehru Cup, then playing a series of friendly matches before the qualifiers to [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in Mexico. The team made a successful tour on Europe where it won the three matches disputed, including a 3\u20131 against West Germany in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]. In May 1985, Argentina played its first qualifying match against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]], winning 3\u20132. Argentina won three consecutive games, to Colombia (3\u20131 home, 1\u20130 away) and Venezuela (3\u20130 home) but lost to Peru 1\u20130 in [[Lima]] in a match where Peru midfielder [[Claudio Reyna]] marked Maradona with excessive roughness, although he was not sent off by the referee.<ref>[http://tn.com.ar/deportes/hazanas/a-27-anos-de-la-marca-personal-a-maradona-reyna-sigue-siendo-idolo-en-peru_270462 \"A 27 a\u00f1os de la marca personal a Maradona\"], [[Todo Noticias|TN]], 10 September 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.terra.com/espdep/articulo/html/fox239751.htm \"Maradona no olvida a Luis Reyna\"], ''[[Terra Networks|Terra]]'', 4 May 2006</ref>\n\nArgentina played the last match of the qualifiers against Peru in Buenos Aires.

''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', the most popular newspaper of Argentina, was one of the hardest opponents of the coach, and Bilardo himself declared that Clar\u00edn called Association President [[Julio Grondona]] to ask him to fire the coach.<ref name=eltiempo>[http://canchallena.lanacion.com.ar/1508493-bilardo-el-tiempo-me-dio-la-razon \"Bilardo: El tiempo me dio la raz\u00f3n\" - CanchaLlena.com], 19 September 2012</ref>\n\nBefore the World Cup, Argentina toured Europe losing to [[France national football team|France]] (one of the favorites to win the Cup) and [[Norway national football team|Norway]] and largely defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] by 7\u20132.<ref>[http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ \"Argentina campe\u00f3n del Mundo 1986, la angustia que precedi\u00f3 a la gloria\", Muy Futbol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025231603/http://muyfutbol.com/35227/equipos-historicos-argentina-campeon-del-mundo-1986-la-angustia-que-precedio-a-la-gloria/ |date=2012-10-25 }}, 27 June 2012</ref>\n\n===1986: Return to glory===\n[[File:Argentina x corea 1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The team that debuted v.

Argentina was placed in Group A alongside Italy, [[Bulgarian national football team|Bulgaria]], and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In the first game, Argentina was able to beat South Korea 3\u20131. The second match was against Italy, a tougher opponent. Italy took the lead in the sixth minute but Diego Maradona responded with a goal in the 34th minute. The game later ended with a 1\u20131 draw.

The game started very evenly, with both teams getting chances to score but none were able to finish. The first half ended with Argentina having the majority of possession but unable to get past a tough defense. Six minutes following the second half, Maradona scored a [[Argentina v England (1986 FIFA World Cup)#The \"Hand of God\"|controversial goal]] in which he used his hand; once the match finished, Maradona called it \"''la mano de Dios''\" (\"the hand of God\"), explicitly admitting the infringement. The goal began with a defensive error from [[Steve Hodge]], who passed the ball incorrectly back to his goalkeeper, [[Peter Shilton]]. At that time, Maradona was still continuing his run and reached the ball first and netted it in with his left fist. After the goal, Maradona encouraged his teammates to embrace the goal so the referee would allow it. Four minutes after the \"hand of God\" goal, Maradona scored a goal which people{{Who|date=March 2015}} called \"The Goal of the Century\" because of the individual effort of Maradona, who starting his run from the half-way line, passed four English midfielders (he beat midfielder [[Terry Butcher]] twice) and dribbled around Shilton, finally scoring the goal which allowed Argentina to win the match, 2\u20131. That victory was very celebrated due to not only the rivalry between both teams but Argentina had lost the Falklands War at the hands of the [[British Army]] four years prior.<ref>[http://es.fifa.com/classicfootball/matches/match=392/index.html \"La magia de Maradona tumba a Inglaterra\" - FIFA.es]</ref>\n\n[[File:Maradona cup azteca.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Diego Maradona raising the FIFA World Cup trophy at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.]]\nIn the semi-finals, Argentina defeated Belgium 2\u20130 at the Estadio Azteca to advance to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] against West Germany. Argentina won a game played at the Azteca in which the squad won its second World Cup title. [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown]] opened the scoring for Argentina, then the team increased the lead with a goal by [[Jorge Valdano]]. Germany started a comeback with goals from [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] and [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]], which evened the game at 2\u20132. [[Jorge Burruchaga]] scored the winning goal in the 83rd minute, giving Argentina a 3\u20132 victory over Germany.\n\nArgentina remained unbeaten in the World Cup, winning five over six matches disputed.

The line-up in the final was: [[Nery Pumpido]], Brown, [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuciuffo]], Ruggeri, [[Julio Olarticoechea]]; [[Ricardo Giusti]], [[Sergio Batista]], Enrique, Burruchaga; Maradona, Valdano.\n\n===1987\u20131990===\nAfter winning the World Cup, the players went on vacation and Argentina did not play a match until 1987, when a new edition of Copa Am\u00e9rica was contested. The tournament changed its format, returning to a unique host where Argentina was chosen. Argentine formed a team with a mix of players from European and local leagues. The squad debuted with a 1\u20131 draw against Per\u00fa, then beat Ecuador 3\u20130. In the second stage, Argentina lost to Uruguay (which would be the champion) 1\u20130 in Buenos Aires and was eliminated. At the end of 1987, Argentina played West Germany (the rival of the 1986 final) winning 1\u20130 at the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani]]. In 1988, the squad played the Four Nations Cup, losing to the Soviet Union (4\u20132) and West Germany (1\u20130).\n\nArgentina immediately went to Australia to contest the Australia Bicentennial Gold Cup, where the team did not have a good performance, with one win against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and a large defeat by [[Australia national soccer team|the local team]] (4\u20131).\n\nBack to Argentina, the team started its preparation for the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held in Brazil. Argentina qualified to the second round after beating Chile and Uruguay (both 1\u20130) and two draws with Ecuador and Bolivia (both 0\u20130). In the second stage, Argentina lost to Brazil and Uruguay (both 2\u20130) and only drew with Paraguay (0\u20130). Argentina was eliminated without winning a game and with no goals scored on this round. Some players of the team were Pumpido, Brown, Ruggeri, Clausen, Cuciuffo, Burruchaga, Maradona, Enrique, Giusti (all of them world champions in 1986), [[Claudio Caniggia]], [[Abel Balbo]], [[Luis Islas]], [[Roberto Sensini]], [[Gabriel Calder\u00f3n]], [[N\u00e9stor Gorosito]] and [[Pedro Troglio]].\n\n===1990: Finalist again===\nArgentina went to the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] with no qualifiers needed as being the previous champion. Prior to the World Cup, the national team played some several matches with no good results: Argentina lost to Mexico (0\u20132) and Scotland (0\u20132), winning just one of the five games played (to Israel, chosen again to be the last rival before the tournament as it had been four years before). In addition, Jorge Valdano (one of the most important players during the 1986 World Cup) trained hard in order to be in good physical condition for the Cup, but Bilardo decided not to include him in the definitive list of players. To that, Valdano said, \"I swam through the ocean but I drowned at the shore.\" In addition to Valdano not playing, a number of other important players were injured, so Argentina resorted to cynical tactics on the field, as they knew they could not win easily in a straight fight.<ref>[http://www.elespectador.com/deportes/futbolinternacional/articulo-378474-dos-anos-seleccion-colombia-tendra-un-gran-equipo Interview to Valdano] at Colombian newspaper ''[[El Espectador]]'', 30 September 2012</ref>\n\nArgentina finally debuted at the inaugural match at the [[San Siro]] in [[Milan]], being defeated by [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] (1\u20130). This result caused a great surprise in Argentina<ref>[http://www.generaccion.com/usuarios/20284/sorpresa-mundial-italia-1990-camerun-vence-argentina-1-0 \"Sorpresa en Mundial Italia 1990: Camer\u00fan vence a Argentina\"  - Generacion.com], 8 June 2010</ref> so the national team line-up was based on the 1986 world champion.\n\n[[File:Caniggia scoring v Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Claudio Caniggia]] scoring the only goal against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in [[Turin]].]]\nArgentina won its second match against the Soviet Union 2\u20130 (where titular goalkeeper was [[Nery Pumpido]] seriously injured, being replaced by [[Sergio Goycochea]] for the rest of the tournament), and drew 1\u20131 with [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the last match of first round, both played in [[Naples]], where Maradona played for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in the [[Serie A]]. The team qualified to the second round, where they faced Brazil at the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] in [[Turin]]. In a match where Brazil played much better than Argentina, with forwards [[M\u00fcller (footballer)|M\u00fcller]] and [[Careca]] repeatedly shooting to the goal but missing the target (the ball clashed Argentina's posts a couple of times, while Goycoechea stopped other shots) Argentina (with Maradona in bad physical condition) resisted Brazilian offensive movements during the first half, which ended 0\u20130. In the second half, Brazil was not so persistent as it had been during the first 45 minutes, so Argentina took advantage of the situation. With nine minutes till full-time, Maradona took the ball in the centre of the field, dribbled past three opponents and made a precise pass to winger [[Claudio Caniggia]], who advanced with the ball to a goal after dribbling around goalkeeper [[Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel]]. Argentina won the match 1\u20130, eliminating its arch-rival in a World Cup for the first time. That match is still regarded by the media and fans as one of the most remarkable moments of an Argentina national team.<ref>[http://www.mundialsudafrica.com/partidos-memorables-argentina-1-brasil-0-italia-1990/ \"Partidos memorables: Argentina 1-Brasil 0\"]</ref><ref>[http://www.goal.com/es-ar/slideshow/375/1/cinco-victorias-memorables-sobre-brasil \"Cinco victorias memorables sobre Brasil\" by Jonatan Fabbian at Goal.com]</ref>\n\nFor their quarter-final match in [[Florence]], Argentina narrowly eliminated [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] in an exciting [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/01/sports/world-cup-90-argentina-beats-yugoslavia.html \"Argentina beats Yugoslavia\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1 July 1990</ref> with Goycoechea becoming a hero after stopping three penalty kicks, including the last two.<ref name=goyco>[http://playfutbol.infobae.com/notas/676284-Nacia-Sergio-Goycochea-el-gran-heroe-de-los-penales-en-Italia-1990.html \"Nac\u00eda Sergio Goycochea, el gran h\u00e9roe de los penales en Italia 1990\", Play Futbol], 17 October 2012</ref> Maradona also missed a penalty kick, a rare occurrence; at one point Argentina were behind the Yugoslavs, but Goycoechea's outstanding goalkeeping kept Argentina in the tournament.\n\n[[File:Argentina vs italy worldcup.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The squad that beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[Napoli]], qualifying for the final.]]\nArgentina advanced to semi-finals where it to play against Italy in Naples. The local host was considered favourite to win the match because their striker [[Salvatore Schillaci]] was the tournament's top scorer (he would be awarded both the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the end of the tournament) and  Argentina had many injured players, Maradona being one of them. Nevertheless, Argentina made its best performance in the World Cup and the match ended 1\u20131 after 90 minutes. With zero goals in extra time, the game went to a penalty shootout where Goycoechea was the hero again, stopping the shots from [[Aldo Serena]] and [[Roberto Donadoni]] to send Argentina to its second-straight World Cup final.\n\nFor the final in Rome, Argentina played West Germany, coached by former player [[Franz Beckenbauer]]. Caniggia was suspended for one game after receiving a yellow card in the match against Italy so he could not play the final. Germany arrived to the final as a wide favorite to take the Cup, as the squad had showed an effective and precise playing style, unlike Argentina which (with the exception of the game with Italy) had not had good previous performances. In addition, German footballers were in good condition while the Argentine players came to the final with several injuries, including Maradona. The game proved to be violent, brutal and bad tempered, particularly from the Argentines. Nevertheless, Germany only could score a goal at 83 minutes for a doubtful punishment by Mexican referee [[Edgardo Codesal]], who awarded Germany a penalty kick for what he thought was a foul by Roberto Sensini against Rudi V\u00f6ller. The call was controversial, and it was heavily debated by the Argentinian players. Andreas Brehme converted the penalty kick to give West Germany team its third World Cup title.<ref>[http://www.infobae.com/notas/nota.php?Idx=260625&IdxSeccion=0 \"La pol\u00e9mica alemana sobre el penal en la final de Italia 90\"], ''Infobae'', 16 June 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.geofutbol.com/2008/10/26/final-italia-1990-alemania-1-0-argentina/ \"Final Italia 1990: Alemania 1-0 Argentina\" -GeoFutbol.com]</ref>\n\nThe 1986 champion side could not repeat the high performances made four years prior, most notably Maradona, who played all the tournament injured.

The national team played some friendly matches and tournaments such as the Stanley Rous Cup, where Argentina drew 2\u20132 with England at Wembley Stadium (after losing 0\u20132 after the first half).

Argentina won the tournament unbeaten, winning six of seven matches. [[Gabriel Batistuta]] was also the leading scorer of the Copa with six goals. Apart from Batistuta, Sergio Goycochea, [[Leonardo Astrada]], Claudio Caniggia, [[Diego Simeone]] (who wore the number 10 kit shirt), [[Dario Franco]], [[Leonardo Rodr\u00edguez|Leo Rodr\u00edguez]] were some of the most notable Argentine players.<ref name=recambio/>\n\nIn 1992, Argentina won the friendly tournament [[Kirin Cup]] (defeating [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]]).

The team shared group with Colombia, Paraguay and Peru. Argentina won the first two as visitor to Peru (1\u20130 in Lima) and Paraguay (3\u20131 in [[Asunci\u00f3n]]) but lost to Colombia 2\u20131 in [[Barranquilla]]. In Buenos Aires, Argentina defeated Peru 2\u20131, drew with Paraguay 0\u20130 and suffered a catastrophic loss to Colombia 5\u20130 on 5 September 1993 in the Estadio Monumental. It became the largest defeat to a national team since a 1\u20136 result in the 1958 World Cup.

The team lost to Brazil 0\u20132 but beat [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] 3\u20131 at [[Salta]] and smashed Israel 3\u20130 in [[Ramat Gan]]. Argentina debuted in the championship thrashing [[Greece national football team|Greece]] 4\u20130 in [[Boston]], with a hat-trick by Batistuta. Maradona also scored the third goal for Argentina, which would be his last goal in a World Cup. The national team played its second match against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] again in Boston, which defeated by 2\u20131 (2 goals by Caniggia). At the end of the match, Argentina became a favorite to win the tournament, due to the attacking playing style showed by the squad (playing with four forwards), the number of goals scored and the good performances of some of its players such as Redondo, Caniggia, Batistuta, and even the aging Maradona, who looked in great shape and scored a gem of a goal.\n\nAt the end of the match against Nigeria, Maradona was called for the drug test, which gave positive results for [[ephedrine]], a banned substance. The impact and repercussion of the news were immediate, and Maradona was expelled from the tournament and suspended for 15 months by [[FIFA]].<ref>[http://soccerlens.com/doping-in-football/19458/ \"Doping in football\" by Victor Li on SoccerLens.com], 6 January 2009</ref>\n\nWith the team still hurt after losing its leader, Argentina was defeated by Bulgaria in the sweltering heat of [[Dallas]] for their last match of the first round. The team qualified to the knockout phase, where they were beaten by Romania 3\u20132 in [[Los Angeles]]; Basile decided not to include Caniggia in this match after he was benched during the 27th minute of the Bulgaria match. After the successes of 1986 and 1990, Argentina was eliminated in the second round. Although eliminated in the second round; in an [[ESPN]] interview with [[Quique Wolff]], Maradona called the 1994 squad the greatest Argentina team of all time.\n\n===1998 World Cup===\nWith Maradona officially retired, Argentina went into the tournament with high expectations, still fielding players from their previous tournament, with Gabriel Batistuta still a constant goalscoring threat and Diego Simeone remaining as the leading figure from the anchorman position. Drawn into Group H of the competition, their opponents consisted of [[Japan national football team|Japan]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. They began their campaign with a 1\u20130 victory over the Asian nation, following it up with a 5\u20130 demolition of the Caribbeans.  Their third group game was against the Croatians, who had also confirmed qualification to the next round and ended with victory for the ''Albiceleste'' by 1\u20130.\n\nArgentina went into the knockout phase with the impressive record of seven goals scored, keeping clean sheets in all three group games.  Their opponent was England]], fielding an equally strong team. Argentina took the lead with just six minutes played through Gabriel Batistuta from the penalty spot, only for [[Alan Shearer]] to equalize through the same means four minutes later. Six minutes after, youngster [[Michael Owen]] broke past [[Roberto Ayala]] to score a great individual effort, which was eventually cancelled out one minute into stoppage time after a free kick routine put [[Javier Zanetti]] through on goal to score, leaving the final result at 2\u20132 at the end of the first half.\n\nIn the second half, England playmaker [[David Beckham]] was sent off after a kick on Simeone, with the scores remaining unchanged until the end of normal time and extra time.  Argentina won 4\u20133 on penalties, after Ayala scored the decisive spot kick to book their quarter-final spot, where the Netherlands awaited them.\n\nThe game was an equally fought match, with both sides scoring early goals; [[Patrick Kluivert]] netting after just 12 minutes and [[Claudio L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Claudio L\u00f3pez]] equalizing five minutes later.  Argentina held an advantage as the Dutch went a man down with the dismissal of [[Arthur Numan]] after his second booking for a foul on Simeone, though they were unable to take the opportunity and break the deadlock before they too went a man down; with [[Ariel Ortega]] receiving two successive yellow cards, the first one for diving inside the penalty box, with the second coming after headbutting Dutch goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]]. Argentina's defence held tightly as extra-time beckoned, until a long aerial ball from Dutch captain [[Frank de Boer]] found [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who maneuvered around Ayala and beat the Argentine goalkeeper Roa to send the Dutch through, eliminating Argentina from the competition.\n\n===2006 World Cup===\nArgentina had been eliminated at the group stage at Korea/Japan [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], although they had been among the pre-tournament favorites. There was a high expectation of a better performance in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany. Argentina qualified for the knockout stages with wins over the Ivory Coast (2\u20131) and [[Serbia national football team|Serbia and Montenegro]] (6\u20130), and a 0\u20130 draw with the Netherlands.\n\nIn the round of 16, Argentina defeated Mexico 2\u20131 in extra-time, the winning goal scored by [[Maxi Rodr\u00edguez]]; this goal went on to win an online poll organized by FIFA as the best goal of the World Cup.<ref>http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/bgt.html</ref>  In the quarter-final, they lost 4\u20132 in penalties against hosts Germany after a 1\u20131 draw. A brawl erupted between the Argentines and Germans after the game ended; unused substitute [[Leandro Cufr\u00e9]] was sent off for kicking [[Per Mertesacker]], while Maxi Rodr\u00edguez hit [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] from behind. Following an investigation of video evidence, FIFA issued four-and two-game suspensions for Cufre and Rodr\u00edguez respectively. Germany's [[Torsten Frings]] was also suspended for the semi-final match for punching [[Julio Ricardo Cruz|Julio Cruz]].\n\nShortly after the elimination, coach [[Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9kerman]] resigned from his position. The AFA appointed Alfio Basile, who had previously managed the national side during the 1994 World Cup, as his successor.\n\n===2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina won all three games in the group stage, beating the United States, Colombia and Paraguay. After convincing victories over Peru and Mexico in the quarter-final and semi-final, respectively, they were favorites to beat Brazil in the final, but were defeated 3\u20130.\n\n===2010 World Cup===\n[[File:Messi Podolski Di Maria 2010.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lionel Messi]] carries out the ball, followed by [[Lukas Podolski]] in the quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].]]\n\nPrior to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], [[Diego Maradona]] was appointed head coach. During the qualification process, he oversaw a 6\u20131 defeat to [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], and after a string of losses and draws, Argentina came dangerously close to failing to qualify, but victories in the last two matches secured qualification for the final tournament. In the final tournament itself, Argentina was placed in Group B, winning all their games. Their first game was against Nigeria, where Argentina netted a goal in the sixth minute to ensure a 1\u20130 victory. In the second match, against [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]], a [[Gonzalo Higua\u00edn]] hat-trick and a Korean own goal finished the score at 4\u20131. Argentina's last group game was against Greece, a 2\u20130 victory.\n\nArgentina then advanced to the round of 16 to play Mexico. The game started with controversy when [[Carlos Tevez]] headed a ball from [[Lionel Messi]] for a goal; replay clearly showed that Tevez was in an offside position. Eventually, Argentina beat Mexico 3\u20131 to advance to the quarter-finals. In a much-hyped game, Argentina was shocked after Germany eliminated them with a 4\u20130 win. [[Thomas M\u00fcller]] opened the scoring in the third minute, with [[Miroslav Klose]] adding an additional two and [[Arne Friedrich]] one.\n\n===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\n[[File:Argentine - Portugal - Argentine.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Argentina line-up at a friendly match against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[Geneva]], February 2011.]]\n\nThe [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was the first major tournament for new coach [[Sergio Batista]]. Argentina started the tournament with a shocking 1\u20131 tie against underdogs Bolivia. In their second game, they played a goalless draw against Colombia in [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], but went on to win their third game 3\u20130 against underdogs [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]. Argentina was to play Uruguay in the quarter-finals. After going down after five minutes to a [[Diego P\u00e9rez (footballer)|Diego P\u00e9rez]] goal, Gonzalo Higua\u00edn equalized in the 17th minute. The score remained unchanged and after extra time, Argentina lost 5\u20134 in penalties with a miss from Carlos Tevez. After the elimination, Batista was sacked and replaced by former [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] coach [[Alejandro Sabella]].\n\n===2014 World Cup===\nArgentina qualified for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] and were drawn into Group F alongside Nigeria, [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and debutants [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Argentina had beaten all three of those teams, easily making it through to the next round. In the next round, they beat [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 1\u20130 after a goalless 90 minutes. In the quarter-finals, they beat Belgium, also 1\u20130 through an early goal. They then beat the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 4\u20132 from a penalty shootout in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], but lost to eventual winners Germany in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]] at the [[Maracan\u00e3 Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], concluding the World Cup runners-up.\n\n===2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nArgentina entered the subsequent tournament, the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] as heavy favorites to take home the trophy. They began their group stage against Paraguay, where after leading 2\u20130 for most of the match ultimately settled for a 2\u20132 draw. Despite doubts in defence, they overcame the difficulties to beat fellow tournament favorites Uruguay and Jamaica. Their quarter-final opponent was Colombia, whose sturdy defense was impossible to break through and goalkeeper [[David Ospina]] making impressive saves to keep the game tied at 0\u20130. In penalties, Argentina missed several chances until Carlos Tevez, who was the sole player to miss his spot kick during the previous tournament, netted his attempt to send ''la Albiceleste'' through to the semi-finals to face Paraguay.  The game was evenly played until half-time, when the score was 2\u20131 to Argentina, but four more goals during the second half allowed Argentina to cruise to the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica Final|final]], where they met host nation Chile.\n\nThe final was a hotly contested match, with both sides having great chances to open the scoring, particularly with a powerful shot from [[Sergio Ag\u00fcero]] in the first half for Argentina, with [[Alexis S\u00e1nchez]] having a clear one for Chile in the second half. With the scores still tied at the end of regulation, the match went to penalties. Only captain Lionel Messi netted his penalty attempt, with Gonzalo Higua\u00edn sending his attempt well over the crossbar and [[\u00c9ver Banega]] having his shot saved by [[Claudio Bravo (footballer)|Claudio Bravo]] to leave the final scoreline at 4\u20131 in penalties.\n\n===Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario===\nOnce more, Argentina entered the tournament as heavy favorites to take home the trophy after 22 years of international drought. ''La Albiceleste'' cruised through their group, with their opening match being a replay of the Copa Am\u00e9rica final from the year before against trophy holders Chile, which Argentina would go on to win 2\u20131. Further victories against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and Bolivia allowed them to top the group with the maximum number of points. Their quarter-final match was against surprise side Venezuela, where the match remained even for both sides before the Argentines won 4\u20131. They then dispatched hosts United States 4\u20130 to earn yet another [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario Final|final]] clash against Chile.\n\nAs previously, it was an even match, with Chile initially having the upper hand and more possession before going a man down, with [[Marcelo D\u00edaz]] being dismissed after obstructing Messi on the ball. This, however, made it more difficult for Argentina to break through their defence, and they too would go a man down not long after with [[Marcos Rojo]] receiving a straight red card for a tackle on [[Arturo Vidal]]. Once again the match finished 0\u20130 and went to penalties. Although [[Sergio Romero]] saved Vidal's penalty kick, Messi shot his attempt over the crossbar, with the subsequent players netting their attempts until Bravo saved from [[Lucas Biglia]] and [[Francisco Silva]] netted the final penalty to once again hand Chile the trophy. The defeat caused frustration within the Argentine players, with Messi announcing his retirement from international football not long after, as well as many others suggesting their departure from the national team as well.\n\n===2018 World Cup===\nOn 20 May 2017, the [[Argentine Football Association]] announced that [[Jorge Sampaoli]] would take over as the new national team manager, officially on 1 June 2017. Sampaoli's first game in charge was a friendly match against [[Brazil]] on 9 June in Australia, with Argentina winning 1\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://futbol.as.com/futbol/2017/04/21/internacional/1492798205_460690.html\n|title= Sampaoli ser\u00e1 presentado con Argentina el 22 de mayo|date= 4 April 2017|work=Diario AS|accessdate= 20 May 2017|language=es}}</ref> However, Argentina struggled during the qualifiers, and it took a [[Lionel Messi]] hat trick at Ecuador to confirm qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/lionel-messi-argentina-win-world-cup-qualify-ecuador-hat-trick-russia-2018-latest-a7993841.html|title=Lionel Messi burnishes legacy with hat-trick as Argentina come from behind to beat Ecuador and book World Cup place|date=11 October 2017|work=The Independent|publisher=ESI Media|author=Miguel Delaney}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 March 2018, in a warm-up preparation friendly match, Argentina, without its captain Messi, who was sidelined for the match due to an injury, was routed 6-1 by 2010 World Cup champion [[Spain national football team|Spain]] at the [[Wanda Metropolitano]] stadium in [[Madrid]]. It was Spain's biggest win over another previous World Cup champion, and Argentina's biggest loss since their 6\u20131 loss to Bolivia in 2009, and also tied the record for Argentina's biggest loss overall, by a margin of five goals.<ref>{{cite news |title=Spain's mauling of Argentina equals record Albiceleste defeat |url=https://en.as.com/en/2018/03/28/football/1522233313_446145.html |newspaper=[[AS (newspaper)|AS]] |date=28 March 2018 |access-date=3 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 May 2018, Sampaoli announced a 35-man preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup, and the final squad list was released on 21 May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/icardi-cut-from-argentinas-23-man-world-cup-squad/lo0f6fig55ih1jh7w9v4enau6 |title=Icardi cut from Argentina's 23-man World Cup squad |publisher=Goal.com |date=21 May 2018 |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Cup in Russia came around, the tournament was a disaster for the ''Albiceleste''.
