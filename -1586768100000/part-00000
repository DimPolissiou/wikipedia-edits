The team improved upon its 7\u20139 record in the previous season and returned to the NFL playoffs after a one-year absence, but lost in the AFC Divisional game to the [[1993 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]].\n\nThis was the Raiders\u2019 final playoff appearance in Los Angeles, and would not return to the playoffs until [[2000 Oakland Raiders season|2000]], when the franchise returned to Oakland.\n\n==Offseason==\n\nDuring the offseason the Raiders signed quarterback [[Jeff Hostetler]] from the New York Giants to lead the offense.  [[Joe Kelly (American football)|Joe Kelly]] a former first round pick of the Bengals was signed to fill the middle lineback slot.  Left tackle [[Gerald Perry (American football)|Gerald Perry]] was signed from the Rams to solidify the left tackle position which the Raiders had struggled to fill since the retirement of former Raider left tackles [[Bruce Davis (offensive tackle)|Bruce Davis]] and [[Art Shell]].  [[Marcus Allen]] the team's all-time leading rusher was allowed to leave as a free agent and later signed with the Kansas City Chiefs.  To fill his spot the Raiders signed running back [[Gaston Green]] formally of the Denver Broncos.  Green did not make the team and was cut prior to the 1993 season.  The Los Angeles Raiders also brought back [[James Lofton]] from the Buffalo Bills.  Lofton played for the Raiders during the 1987\u20131988 seasons.  Like Green he was cut prior to the 1993 season.<ref>The 1993 Los Angeles Raidersr Media Guide</ref>\n\n===NFL draft===\n\nThe 1993 draft for the Los Angeles Raiders eventually produced several starters.  With the 12th pick in the first round the Raiders drafted safety [[Patrick Bates]] from Texas A&M.  The Raiders did not have a second round pick.  In the third round with the 58th pick the team drafted quarterback [[Billy Joe Hobert]] from Washington.  Also in the third round with the 72nd pick the Raiders took defensive back [[James Trapp]] from Clemson.  In the fifth round the team drafted wide receiver [[Olanda Truitt]] from Mississippi State.

Cornerback Terry McDaniel intercepted a Jim McMahon pass and returned it 36 yards for a touchdown. Rookie running back Greg Robinson scored his only regular season touchdown as a Raider. Hostetler also rushed for 34 yards and defensive end Anthony Smith recorded 2 sacks.\n*Week 2 \u2013 September 12 W 17\u201313 at Seattle Seahawks\nDefensive End Anthony Smith sacked Seahawks quarterback Rick Mirer four times. Rookie Patrick Bates and Terry McDaniel each intercepted a pass and Jeff Hostetler rushed for a touchdown and tossed a touchdown pass to Tim Brown.  Wide receivers Alexander Wright and Tim Brown totalled 13 receptions combined to pace the win.\n* Week 3 \u2013 Sep 19 L 19\u201316 vs Cleveland Browns\nThe Raiders dominated the Browns early and led 13\u20130.  Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton intercepted a Bernie Kosar pass which set up one of the Raiders two field goals.  After that the Browns defense pressured Hostetler by sacking him six times and holding him to just 94 yards passing. The Raiders gained one first down in the second half and committed eight penalties. Browns running back Eric Metcalf scored the game-winning touchdown with just seconds remaining.\n*Week 4 \u2013 Bye week\n*Week 5 \u2013 Oct 3 L 24\u20139 at Kansas City Chiefs\nFormer Raider Marcus Allen scored his 100th career rushing touchdown against his former team.  Hostetler missed the game due to a knee injury and with veteran [[Vince Evans]] serving in his place the Raiders were unable to beat their chief rivals.  The Raiders aided the Kansas City cause by committing 16 penalties for 173 yards.\n*Week 6  Oct 10 W 24\u201320 vs New York Jets\nRaiders overcame a 17\u20130 Jet lead to win. Head coach Art Shell pulled a struggling Hostetler and Evans replaced him and the aging quarterback completed 14 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns.  During the third period and trailing 17\u20137 Evans hit Alexander Wright for a 68-yard touchdown pass.  The Jets scored on a field goal to retake the lead 20\u201317.  During a two-minute drill Evans drove the Raiders downfield.  A third down was converted into a first down on a pass to James Jett.  With four seconds remaining and with the ball inside the Jets one-yard line the Raiders ran a risky run play and running back Nick Bell scored a touchdown to defeat the New York Jets.\n*Week 7  Oct 18 W 23\u201320 at Denver Broncos\nOn Monday Night Football quarterback Jeff Hostetler went 15 of 24 for 2 touchdowns.  The Raiders dominated the first half and led 13\u20130 off two Jaeger field goals and a Hostetler touchdown pass to Alexander Wright.  Denver fought their way back and scored 17 unanswered points to take a 17\u201313 lead.  Raider James Jett scored on a 74-yard pass from Hostetler and the Raiders took the lead back from the Broncos.  John Elway drove Denver downfield and rookie kicker Jason Elam kicked a field goal to tie the game 20\u201320.  The Raiders responded with just seconds remaining with a Jeff Jaeger field goal from 53 yards away to beat the Broncos.\n*Week 8  Bye Week\n*Week 9  Oct 31 L 30\u201323 vs San Diego Chargers\nHalloween was all tricks for the Raiders and all treats for the Chargers as San Diego beat Los Angeles in a key game.  This didn't stop Jeff Hostetler from passing for a Raider record 424 yards.  The Raiders started the scoring on their first play from scrimmage with Tim Brown hauling in a Hostetler pass and racing 71 yards for a touchdown.  Later and with the score tied 10\u201310 both Hostetler and Brown hooked up again for a 38-yard touchdown.  San Diego retied the score 17\u201317 on a touchdown run by running back Marion Butts.  The Raiders drove down the field and with the ball inside the San Diego 10-yard line, defensive back Donald Frank intercepted a Hostetler pass and ran back the interception 102 yards for a touchdown and a 24\u201317 San Diego lead. The Raiders could not get back into the game and despite 156 receiving yards by Brown the Raiders were defeated by the Chargers.\n* Week 10 \u2013 November 7 W 16\u201314 at Chicago Bears\nFor the third time in five games the Raiders led early but saw their lead evaporate.  Greg Robinson rushed for 70 yards and Napoleon McCallum added 50 more and one touchdown to overcome 11 penalties and 3 sacks of Hostetler.  Los Angeles led 13\u20130 at halftime and just like the Cleveland game the Bears got themselves back in the game. The Raiders lead was cut to 13\u20137 on a Neal Anderson touchdown run but Jeff Jaeger saved the day by adding a field goal later in the fourth quarter. Bears quarterback [[Jim Harbaugh]] tossed a touchdown pass with just minutes remaining in the game to pull Chicago within two points.  The Bears recovered their onside kick and drove within field goal range.  Bears kicker Kevin Butler missed the field goal that would have won the game for Chicago.\n* Week 11 \u2013 November 14 L 31\u201320 vs Kansas City Chiefs\nOnce again the Raiders led early on a Hostetler touchdown pass to Ethan Horton and a touchdown run by Napoleon McCallum.  Leading 14\u20130, the Raiders allowed Kansas City to go on a 31\u20136 run to beat the Raiders for the second straight time.  Horton caught 6 passes for 69 yards and a touchdown against his old team.\n* Week 12 \u2013 November 21 W 12\u20137 at San Diego Chargers\nFor the second time in four games the Raiders faced the San Diego Chargers.  Jeff Jaeger kicked four field goals for the win but the Raiders had another nail biting game when San Diego scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter.  Rookies Greg Robinson and James Jett had stellar games.  Robinson accounted for 89 yards rushing and 13 yards receiving.  Jett caught 7 passes for 138 yards.  Also, future hall of famer Howie Long record two sacks.\n*Week 13 \u2013 November 28 L 16\u201310 at Cincinnati Bengals\nThe Bengals were 0\u201310 entering the game and led the Raiders 13\u20130 as the fourth quarter began.  The Raiders offense was unable to get anything going all day and two turnovers by Los Angeles granted them their fifth loss of the 1993 season. Chester McGlockton had three sacks.\n*Week 14 \u2013 Dec 5 W 25\u201324 at Buffalo Bills\nNeeding a win to keep their playoff hopes alive the Raiders overcame the three time AFC Champion Buffalo Bills.  Jeff Hostetler rushed for a touchdown and threw for another.  Jeff Jaeger added four field goals and Tim Brown caught 10 passes for 183 yards and a TD.  During the fourth quarter the Bills led the Raiders 24\u201319.  The Raiders defense forced Buffalo to punt.  The Raiders ran just three plays, the first coming on a short completion to running back Nick Bell and a second to wide receiver James Jett.  Then Hostetler knifed the football between three Buffalo defenders to receiver Tim Brown for a touchdown.  Buffalo was driving for a game-winning field goal when Nolan Harrison forced Buffalo running back Thurman Thomas to fumble and the Raiders defense recovered to seal a 25\u201324 win.\n*Week 15  Dec 12 W 27\u201323 vs Seattle Seahawks\nTying to maintain their playoff dreams the Raiders defeated Seattle with the help of Cornerback Terry McDaniel who had a key interception.  Hostetler, Jett and Brown all scored touchdowns after Seattle established a 9\u20133 lead.  Leading 27\u20139 the Raiders allowed Seattle to reenter the game and the Seahawks scored the final 14 points of the game to cut the Raider lead 27\u201323. After their second touchdown the Seahawks were unable to recover their onside kick which preserved a Raider win.\n*Week 16  Dec 19 W 27\u201320 vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nThe Raiders established a 14\u20130 lead before Tampa Bay forced their way back into the game.  Alexander Wright recorded his first 100+ yard game as a Raider and Jeff Hostetler rushed for his fifth touchdown of the season.  The Raiders defense recorded five sacks and forced 2 turnovers to preserve the victory.  Tampa Bay's final ditch effort to win ended on a botched onside kick attempt and the Raiders prevailed.\n*Week 17  Dec 26 L 28\u20130 at Green Bay Packers\nBrett Favre beat the Raiders for the first of what would be four wins versus the Silver and Black.  Sterling Sharpe torched the Raiders defense for 119 yards and a touchdown and the Packers running game burned the Raiders for 148 yards.  Trailing 14\u20130 quarterback Jeff Hostetler suffered a concussion during a sack and was forced to leave the game.  Vince Evans replaced him but fared no better than Hostetler as both men completed just 18 of 38 passes. This is the game that gave birth to the \"Lambeau Leap\" when LeRoy Butler received a lateral from Reggie White, whom recovered a fumble.  Tim Brown did add 80 yards receiving but a 25-yard fumble return and a long touchdown run gave the Packers an important 28\u20130 victory.\n*Week 18  Jan 2 W 33\u201330 vs Denver Broncos (OT)\nNeeding a win to make the playoffs the Los Angeles Raiders came back from a 17-point deficit twice in the game.  Late in the fourth quarter the Raiders trailed Denver 30\u201323 but Jeff Hostetler and his offense drove Los Angeles down the field.  On the final play of regulation Hostetler completed a third down pass to Alexander Wright for a 4-yard touchdown to force overtime.  Denver won the overtime coin toss and John Elway drove Denver to a field goal opportunity.  Rookie kicker Jason Elam missed his kick and the Raiders were granted new life.  Hostetler drove Los Angeles down field again and Jeff Jaeger kicked a 47-yard field goal to send the Raiders to the 1993 playoffs.  One week later the Raiders would host Denver again in the 1993 WildCard Playoffs.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>\n\n==Classic comebacks==\n\nThe 1993 season saw an enormous amount of Raider comebacks.

This made the passing attacks of both squads very important.  During the first half both John Elway and Jeff Hostetler dominated with each man throwing three touchdown passes.  After a 21\u201321 tie at halftime, Raiders running back [[Napoleon McCallum]] scored three rushing touchdowns in the second half to lead his team to the victory.  Quarterback Jeff Hostetler completed 13 of 19 passes for 294 yards and 3 touchdowns.  James Jett caught 3 passes for 111 yards and a touchdown.

Tim Brown caught 5 passes for 127 yards which included an 86-yard pass for his lone touchdown of the game.  The play is the Raiders longest postseason play ever.

Hostetler also rushed for 34 yards and defensive end Anthony Smith recorded 2 sacks.\n*Week 2 \u2013 September 12 W 17\u201313 at Seattle Seahawks\nDefensive End Anthony Smith sacked Seahawks quarterback Rick Mirer four times. Rookie Patrick Bates and Terry McDaniel each intercepted a pass and Jeff Hostetler rushed for a touchdown and tossed a touchdown pass to Tim Brown.  Wide receivers Alexander Wright and Tim Brown totalled 13 receptions combined to pace the win.\n* Week 3 \u2013 Sep 19 L 19\u201316 vs Cleveland Browns\nThe Raiders dominated the Browns early and led 13\u20130.  Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton intercepted a Bernie Kosar pass which set up one of the Raiders two field goals.  After that the Browns defense pressured Hostetler by sacking him six times and holding him to just 94 yards passing. The Raiders gained one first down in the second half and committed eight penalties. Browns running back Eric Metcalf scored the game-winning touchdown with just seconds remaining.\n*Week 4 \u2013 Bye week\n*Week 5 \u2013 Oct 3 L 24\u20139 at Kansas City Chiefs\nFormer Raider Marcus Allen scored his 100th career rushing touchdown against his former team.  Hostetler missed the game due to a knee injury and with veteran [[Vince Evans]] serving in his place the Raiders were unable to beat their chief rivals.  The Raiders aided the Kansas City cause by committing 16 penalties for 173 yards.\n*Week 6  Oct 10 W 24\u201320 vs New York Jets\nRaiders overcame a 17\u20130 Jet lead to win. Head coach Art Shell pulled a struggling Hostetler and Evans replaced him and the aging quarterback completed 14 passes for 247 yards and two touchdowns.  During the third period and trailing 17\u20137 Evans hit Alexander Wright for a 68-yard touchdown pass.  The Jets scored on a field goal to retake the lead 20\u201317.  During a two-minute drill Evans drove the Raiders downfield.  A third down was converted into a first down on a pass to James Jett.  With four seconds remaining and with the ball inside the Jets one-yard line the Raiders ran a risky run play and running back Nick Bell scored a touchdown to defeat the New York Jets.\n*Week 7  Oct 18 W 23\u201320 at Denver Broncos\nOn Monday Night Football quarterback Jeff Hostetler went 15 of 24 for 2 touchdowns.  The Raiders dominated the first half and led 13\u20130 off two Jaeger field goals and a Hostetler touchdown pass to Alexander Wright.  Denver fought their way back and scored 17 unanswered points to take a 17\u201313 lead.  Raider James Jett scored on a 74-yard pass from Hostetler and the Raiders took the lead back from the Broncos.  John Elway drove Denver downfield and rookie kicker Jason Elam kicked a field goal to tie the game 20\u201320.  The Raiders responded with just seconds remaining with a Jeff Jaeger field goal from 53 yards away to beat the Broncos.\n*Week 8  Bye Week\n*Week 9  Oct 31 L 30\u201323 vs San Diego Chargers\nHalloween was all tricks for the Raiders and all treats for the Chargers as San Diego beat Los Angeles in a key game.  This didn't stop Jeff Hostetler from passing for a Raider record 424 yards.  The Raiders started the scoring on their first play from scrimmage with Tim Brown hauling in a Hostetler pass and racing 71 yards for a touchdown.  Later and with the score tied 10\u201310 both Hostetler and Brown hooked up again for a 38-yard touchdown.  San Diego retied the score 17\u201317 on a touchdown run by running back Marion Butts.  The Raiders drove down the field and with the ball inside the San Diego 10-yard line, defensive back Donald Frank intercepted a Hostetler pass and ran back the interception 102 yards for a touchdown and a 24\u201317 San Diego lead. The Raiders could not get back into the game and despite 156 receiving yards by Brown the Raiders were defeated by the Chargers.\n* Week 10 \u2013 November 7 W 16\u201314 at Chicago Bears\nFor the third time in five games the Raiders led early but saw their lead evaporate.  Greg Robinson rushed for 70 yards and Napoleon McCallum added 50 more and one touchdown to overcome 11 penalties and 3 sacks of Hostetler.  Los Angeles led 13\u20130 at halftime and just like the Cleveland game the Bears got themselves back in the game. The Raiders lead was cut to 13\u20137 on a Neal Anderson touchdown run but Jeff Jaeger saved the day by adding a field goal later in the fourth quarter. Bears quarterback [[Jim Harbaugh]] tossed a touchdown pass with just minutes remaining in the game to pull Chicago within two points.  The Bears recovered their onside kick and drove within field goal range.  Bears kicker Kevin Butler missed the field goal that would have won the game for Chicago.\n* Week 11 \u2013 November 14 L 31\u201320 vs Kansas City Chiefs\nOnce again the Raiders led early on a Hostetler touchdown pass to Ethan Horton and a touchdown run by Napoleon McCallum.  Leading 14\u20130, the Raiders allowed Kansas City to go on a 31\u20136 run to beat the Raiders for the second straight time.  Horton caught 6 passes for 69 yards and a touchdown against his old team.\n* Week 12 \u2013 November 21 W 12\u20137 at San Diego Chargers\nFor the second time in four games the Raiders faced the San Diego Chargers.  Jeff Jaeger kicked four field goals for the win but the Raiders had another nail biting game when San Diego scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter.  Rookies Greg Robinson and James Jett had stellar games.  Robinson accounted for 89 yards rushing and 13 yards receiving.  Jett caught 7 passes for 138 yards.  Also, future hall of famer Howie Long record two sacks.\n*Week 13 \u2013 November 28 L 16\u201310 at Cincinnati Bengals\nThe Bengals were 0\u201310 entering the game and led the Raiders 13\u20130 as the fourth quarter began.  The Raiders offense was unable to get anything going all day and two turnovers by Los Angeles granted them their fifth loss of the 1993 season. Chester McGlockton had three sacks.\n*Week 14 \u2013 Dec 5 W 25\u201324 at Buffalo Bills\nNeeding a win to keep their playoff hopes alive the Raiders overcame the three time AFC Champion Buffalo Bills.  Jeff Hostetler rushed for a touchdown and threw for another.  Jeff Jaeger added four field goals and Tim Brown caught 10 passes for 183 yards and a TD.  During the fourth quarter the Bills led the Raiders 24\u201319.  The Raiders defense forced Buffalo to punt.  The Raiders ran just three plays, the first coming on a short completion to running back Nick Bell and a second to wide receiver James Jett.  Then Hostetler knifed the football between three Buffalo defenders to receiver Tim Brown for a touchdown.  Buffalo was driving for a game-winning field goal when Nolan Harrison forced Buffalo running back Thurman Thomas to fumble and the Raiders defense recovered to seal a 25\u201324 win.\n*Week 15  Dec 12 W 27\u201323 vs Seattle Seahawks\nTying to maintain their playoff dreams the Raiders defeated Seattle with the help of Cornerback Terry McDaniel who had a key interception.  Hostetler, Jett and Brown all scored touchdowns after Seattle established a 9\u20133 lead.  Leading 27\u20139 the Raiders allowed Seattle to reenter the game and the Seahawks scored the final 14 points of the game to cut the Raider lead 27\u201323. After their second touchdown the Seahawks were unable to recover their onside kick which preserved a Raider win.\n*Week 16  Dec 19 W 27\u201320 vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers\nThe Raiders established a 14\u20130 lead before Tampa Bay forced their way back into the game.  Alexander Wright recorded his first 100+ yard game as a Raider and Jeff Hostetler rushed for his fifth touchdown of the season.  The Raiders defense recorded five sacks and forced 2 turnovers to preserve the victory.  Tampa Bay's final ditch effort to win ended on a botched onside kick attempt and the Raiders prevailed.\n*Week 17  Dec 26 L 28\u20130 at Green Bay Packers\nBrett Favre beat the Raiders for the first of what would be four wins versus the Silver and Black.  Sterling Sharpe torched the Raiders defense for 119 yards and a touchdown and the Packers running game burned the Raiders for 148 yards.  Trailing 14\u20130 quarterback Jeff Hostetler suffered a concussion during a sack and was forced to leave the game.  Vince Evans replaced him but fared no better than Hostetler as both men completed just 18 of 38 passes. This is the game that gave birth to the \"Lambeau Leap\" when LeRoy Butler received a lateral from Reggie White, whom recovered a fumble.  Tim Brown did add 80 yards receiving but a 25-yard fumble return and a long touchdown run gave the Packers an important 28\u20130 victory.\n*Week 18  Jan 2 W 33\u201330 vs Denver Broncos (OT)\nNeeding a win to make the playoffs the Los Angeles Raiders came back from a 17-point deficit twice in the game.  Late in the fourth quarter the Raiders trailed Denver 30\u201323 but Jeff Hostetler and his offense drove Los Angeles down the field.  On the final play of regulation Hostetler completed a third down pass to Alexander Wright for a 4-yard touchdown to force overtime.  Denver won the overtime coin toss and John Elway drove Denver to a field goal opportunity.  Rookie kicker Jason Elam missed his kick and the Raiders were granted new life.  Hostetler drove Los Angeles down field again and Jeff Jaeger kicked a 47-yard field goal to send the Raiders to the 1993 playoffs.  One week later the Raiders would host Denver again in the 1993 WildCard Playoffs.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/>\n\n==Classic comebacks==\n\nThe 1993 season saw an enormous amount of Raider comebacks.

This made the passing attacks of both squads very important.  During the first half both John Elway and Jeff Hostetler dominated with each man throwing three touchdown passes.  After a 21\u201321 tie at halftime, Raiders running back [[Napoleon McCallum]] scored three rushing touchdowns in the second half to lead his team to the victory.  Quarterback Jeff Hostetler completed 13 of 19 passes for 294 yards and 3 touchdowns.  James Jett caught 3 passes for 111 yards and a touchdown.

{"title_page": "Geometrical properties of polynomial roots", "text_new": "{{short description|Geometry of the location of polynomial roots}}\n{{for|the computation of polynomial roots|Real-root isolation|Root-finding algorithm#Roots of polynomials}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a [[univariate polynomial]] of degree {{mvar|n}} with real or complex coefficients has {{mvar|n}} complex '''[[zero of a function|roots]]''', if counted with their [[multiplicities]]. They form a set of {{mvar|n}} points in the [[complex plane]]. This article concerns the '''geometry''' of these points, that is the information about their localization in the complex plane that can be deduced from the degree and the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nSome of these geometrical properties are related to a single polynomial, such as upper bounds on the absolute values of the roots, which define a disk containing all roots, or lower bounds on the distance between two roots. Such bounds are widely used for [[root-finding algorithm]]s for polynomials, either for tuning them, or for computing their [[computational complexity]]\n\nSome other properties are probabilistic, such as the expected number of real roots of a random polynomial of degree {{mvar|n}} with real coefficients, which is less than  <math> 1+\\frac 2\\pi \\ln (n) </math> for {{mvar|n}} sufficiently large.\n\nIn this article, a polynomial that is considered is always denoted \n:<math>\n  p(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n,\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0, \\dots, a_n</math> are real or complex numbers and <math>a_n \\neq 0</math>; thus {{mvar|n}} is the degree of the polynomial.\n\n==Continuous dependence on coefficients==\nThe {{math|''n''}} roots of a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} depend [[continuous function|continuously]] on the coefficients. For simple roots, this results immediately from the [[implicit function theorem]]. This is true also for multiple roots, but some care is needed for the proof.\n\nA small change of coefficients may induce a dramatic change of the roots, including the change of a real root into a complex root with a rather large imaginary part (see [[Wilkinson's polynomial]]). A consequence is that, for classical numeric [[root-finding algorithm]]s, the problem of approximating the roots given the coefficients is [[ill-conditioned]].\n\n==Conjugation==\n\nThe [[complex conjugate root theorem]] states that if the coefficients\nof a polynomial are real, then the non-real roots appear in pairs of the form  {{math|(''a'' + ''ib'', ''a'' \u2013 ''ib'')}}.\n\nIt follows that the roots of a polynomial with real coefficients are [[reflection symmetry|mirror-symmetric]] with respect to the real axis.\n\nThis can be extended to [[algebraic conjugate|algebraic conjugation]]: the roots of a polynomial with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients are ''conjugate'' (that is, invariant) under the action of the [[Galois group]] of the polynomial. However, this symmetry can rarely be interpreted geometrically.\n\n==Bounds on all roots==\nUpper bounds on the absolute values of polynomial roots are widely used for [[root-finding algorithm]]s, either for limiting the regions where roots should be searched, or for the computation of the [[computational complexity]] of these algorithms. \n\nMany such bounds have been given, and the sharper one depends generally of the specific sequence of coefficient that are considered. Most bounds are greater or equal to one, and are thus not sharp for a polynomial which have only roots of absolute values lower than one. However, such polynomials are very rare, as shown below.\n\nAny upper bound on the absolute values of roots provides a corresponding lower bound. In fact, if <math>a_n\\ne 0,</math> and {{mvar|U}} is an upper bound of the absolute values of the roots of \n:<math>\na_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n,\n</math>\nthen {{math|1/''U''}} is a lower bound of the absolute values of \n:<math>\na_n + a_{n-1} x + \\cdots + a_0 x^n,\n</math>\nsince the roots of either polynomial are the multiplicative inverses of the roots of the other.

This is relatively rare in practice, and explains why Cauchy's bound is more widely used than Lagrange's.\n\nBoth bounds result from the [[Gershgorin circle theorem]] applied to the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial and its [[transpose]]. They can also be proved by elementary methods.\n\n{{cot|Proof of Lagrange's and Cauchy's bounds}}\nIf {{mvar|z}} is a root of the polynomial, and {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}} \u2265 1}} one has \n:<math>|a_n||z^n| = \\left|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_iz^i\\right|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_iz^i|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_i||z|^{n-1}.\n</math>\n\nDividing by <math>|a_n||z|^{n-1},</math> one gets \n:<math>|z|\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\frac{|a_i|}{|a_n|},</math>\nwhich is Lagrange's bound when there is at least one root of absolute value larger than 1. Otherwise, 1 is a bound on the roots, and is not larger than Lagrange's bound.\n\nSimilarly, for Cauchy's bound, one has, if {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}} \u2265 1}},\n:<math>|a_n||z^n| = \\left|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_iz^i\\right|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_iz^i|\n\\le \\max |a_i|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|z|^i\n= \\frac{|z|^n-1}{|z|-1}\\max |a_i|\n\\le  \\frac{|z|^n}{|z|-1}\\max |a_i|.\n</math>\nThus \n:<math>\n|a_n|(|z|-1) \\le \\max |a_i|.\n</math>\nSolving in {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}}, one gets Cauchy's bound if there is a root of absolute value larger than 1. Otherwise the bound is also correct, as Cauchy's bound is larger than 1.\n{{cob}}\n\nThese bounds are not invariant by scaling. That is, the roots of the polynomial {{math|''p''(''sx'')}} are the quotient by {{mvar|s}} of the root of {{mvar|p}}, and the bounds given for the roots of {{math|''p''(''sx'')}} are not the quotient by {{mvar|s}} of the bounds of {{mvar|p}}.

'''Landau's inequality''' provides an upper bound for the absolute values of the product of the roots that have an absolute value greater than one. This inequality, discovered in 1905 by [[Edmund Landau]]<ref>E. Landeau, Sur quelques th&or&mes de M. Petrovic relatifs aux z\u00e9ros des fonctions analytiques, ''Bull. Sot. Math. France'' 33 (1905), 251-261.</ref> has been forgotten and rediscovered at least three times during the 20th century.<ref>M. Mignotte. An inequality about factors of polynomials, ''Math.

This bound is even exactly equal to one of the bounds that are obtained [[#Using H\u00f6lder's inequality|using H\u00f6lder's inequality]].\n\nThis bound is also useful to bound the coefficients of a divisor of a polynomial with integer coefficients:<ref>Mignotte, M.

More precisely, if there is a positive real number {{mvar|''R''}} and an integer {{math|0 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n''}} such that\n:<math>|a_k| R^k > |a_0|+\\cdots+|a_{k-1}| R^{k-1}+|a_{k+1}| R^{k+1}+\\cdots+|a_n| R^n,</math>\nthen there are exactly {{math|''k''}} roots, counted with multiplicity, of absolute value less than {{math|''R''}}. \n{{cot|Proof}}\nIf <math>|z|=R,</math> then\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n|a_0 &+\\cdots+a_{k-1}z^{k-1}+a_{k+1} z^{k+1}+\\cdots+a_n z^n|\\\\\n&\\le |a_0|+\\cdots+|a_{k-1}| R^{k-1}+|a_{k+1}| R^{k+1}+\\cdots+|a_n| R^n\\\\\n&\\le |a_k| R^k \\le |a_k z^k|.\n\\end{align}</math>\nBy Rouch\u00e9's theorem, this implies directly that <math>p(z)</math> and <math>z^k</math> have the same number of roots of absolute values less than {{mvar|R}}, counted with multiplicities. As this number is {{mvar|k}}, the result is proved.\n{{cob}}\n\nThe above result may be applied if the polynomial\n:<math>h_k(x)=|a_0| +\\cdots+|a_{k-1}| x^{k-1}-|a_k|x^k+|a_{k+1}| x^{k+1}+\\cdots+|a_n| x^n.</math>\ntakes a negative value for some positive real value of {{mvar|x}}.\n\nIn the remaining of the section, with suppose that {{math|''a''<sub>''0''</sub> \u2260 0}}. If it is not the case, zero is a root, and the localization of the other roots may be studied by dividing the polynomial by a power of the indeterminate, for getting a polynomial with a nonzero constant term.\n\nFor {{math|1=''k'' = 0}} and {{math|1=''k'' = ''n''}}, [[Descartes' rule of signs]] shows that the polynomial has exactly one positive real root. If <math>R_0</math> and <math>R_n</math> are these root, the above result shows that all the roots verifies \n:<math>R_0\\le |z| \\le R_1.</math>\nA these inequalities apply also to <math>h_0</math> and <math>h_n,</math> these bounds are optimal for polynomials with a given sequence of the absolute values of their coefficients. They are thus sharper than all bounds given in the preceding sections.\n\nFor {{math|0 < ''k'' < ''n''}}, Descartes' rule of signs implies that <math>h_k(x)</math> either has two positive real roots that are not multiple, or is nonnegative for every positive value of {{mvar|x}}. So, the above result may be applied only in the first case. If <math>R_{k,1}<R_{k,2}</math> are these two roots, the above result implies that\n:<math>|z| \\le R_{k,1}</math> \nfor {{mvar|k}} roots of {{mvar|p}}, and that \n:<math>|z| \\ge R_{k,2}</math> \nfor the {{math|''n'' \u2013 ''k''}} other roots.\n\nInstead of computing explicitly <math>R_{k,1}</math> and <math>R_{k,2},</math> it is generally sufficient to compute a value <math>R_k</math> such that <math>h_k(R_k)<0</math> (necessarily <math>R_{k,1}<R_k<R_{k,2}</math>). These  <math>R_k</math> have the property of separating roots in terms of their absolute values: if, for {{math|''h'' < ''k''}}, both <math>R_h</math> and <math>R_k</math> exist, there are exactly {{math|''k'' \u2013 ''h''}} roots {{mvar|z}} such that <math>R_h < |z| < R_k.</math>\n\nFor computing <math>R_k,</math> one can use that <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> is a [[convex function]] (its second derivative is positive). Thus <math>R_k</math> exists if and only if <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> is negative at its unique minimum. For computing this minimum, one can use any [[optimization]] method, or, alternatively, [[Newton's method]] for computing the unique positive zero of the derivative of <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> (it converges rapidly, as the derivative is a [[monotonic function]]).\n\nOne can increase the number of existing <math>R_k</math>'s by applying the root squaring operation of the [[Graeffe's method|Dandelin\u2013Graeffe iteration]]. If the roots have distinct absolute values, one can eventually separate completely the roots in terms of their absolute values, that is compute {{math|''n'' + 1}} positive numbers <math>R_0 < R_1 <\\dots <R_n</math> such there is exactly one root with an absolute value in the open interval <math>(R_{k-1},R_k),</math> for {{math|1=''k'' = 1, ..., ''n''}}.\n\n===From Gershgorin circle theorem ===\nThe [[Gershgorin circle theorem]] applied the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial on a basis related to [[Lagrange interpolation]] provides discs centered at the interpolation points and each containing a root of the polynomial; see {{slink|Durand\u2013Kerner method|Root inclusion via Gerschgorin's circles}} for details.\n\nIf the interpolation points are close to the roots of the roots of the polynomial, the radiuses of the discs are small, and this is a key ingredient of Durand\u2013Kerner method for computing polynomial roots.\n\n==Bounds of real roots==\n\nFor polynomials with real coefficients, it is often useful to bound only the real roots. It suffices to bound the positive roots, as the negative roots of {{math|''p''(''x'')}} are the positive roots of {{math|''p''(\u2013''x'')}}.\n\nClearly, every bound of all roots applies also for real roots. But in some contexts, tighter bounds of real roots are useful. For example, the efficiency of the [[Real-root isolation#Method of continued fractions|method of continued fractions]] for [[real-root isolation]] strongly depends on tightness of a bound of positive roots. This has led to establish new bounds that are tighter than the general bounds of all roots. These bounds are generally expressed not only in terms of the absolute values of the coefficients, but also in terms of their signs.\n\nOther bounds apply only to polynomials whose all roots are reals (see below).\n\n===Bounds of positive real roots===\n\nFor giving a bound of the positive roots, one can suppose <math>a_n >0</math> without loss of generality, as changing the signs of all coefficients does not change the roots.\n\nEvery upper bound of the positive roots of \n:<math>q(x)=a_nx^n + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\min(0,a_i)x^i</math>\nis also a bound  for the real zeros of \n:<math>p(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i</math>. \nIn fact, if {{mvar|B}} is such a bound, for all {{math|''x'' > ''B''}}, one has\n{{math|''p''(''x'') \u2265 ''q''(''x'') > 0}}.\n\nApplied to Cauchy's bound, this gives the upper bound \n:<math>1+{\\textstyle\\max_{i=0}^{n-1}} \\frac{-a_i}{a_n}</math>\nfor the real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients. If this bound is not greater than {{val|1}}, this means that all nonzero coefficients have the same sign, and that there is no positive root.\n\nSimilarly, another upper bound of the positive roots is \n:<math>2\\,{\\max_{a_ia_n<0}}\\left(\\frac{-a_i}{a_n}\\right)^{\\frac 1{n-i}}.</math>\nIf all nonzero coefficients have the same sign, there is no positive root, and the maximum must be defined as being zero.\n\nOther bounds have been recently developed, mainly for the need of the [[Real-root isolation#Method of continued fractions|method of continued fractions]] for [[real-root isolation]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Akritas |first=Alkiviadis G. |first2=A.

Then its roots are located in the interval with endpoints\n:<math>-\\frac{a_{n-1}}{na_n} \\pm \\frac{n-1}{na_n}\\sqrt{a^2_{n-1} - \\frac{2n}{n-1}a_n a_{n-2}}.</math>\n\nFor example, the roots of the polynomial <math>x^4+5x^3+5x^2-5x-6=(x+3)(x+2)(x+1)(x-1)</math> satisfy\n:<math>-3.8118<-\\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{3}{4}\\sqrt{\\frac{35}{3}}\\le x\\le -\\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}\\sqrt{\\frac{35}{3}}<1.3118.</math>\n\n==Root separation==\n\nThe '''root separation''' of a polynomial is the minimal distance between two roots, that is the minimum of the absolute values of the difference of two roots:\n:<math>\\operatorname{sep}(p) = \\min\\{|\\alpha-\\beta|\\;;\\; \\alpha \\neq \\beta \\text{ and } p(\\alpha)=p(\\beta)=0\\}</math>\n\nThe root separation is a fundamental parameter of the [[computational complexity]] of [[root-finding algorithm]]s for polynomials. In fact, the root separation determines the precision of number representation that is needed for being sure of distinguishing different roots. Also, for [[real-root isolation]], it allows bounding the number of interval divisions that are needed for isolating all roots.\n\nFor polynomials with real or complex coefficients is not possible to express a lower bound of the root separation in terms of the degree and the absolute values of the coefficients only, because a small change on a single coefficient transforms a polynomial with multiple roots in a [[square-free polynomial]] with a small root separation, and essentially the same absolute values of the coefficient. However, involving the [[discriminant]] of the polynomial allows a lower bound.\n\nFor square-free polynomials with integer coefficients, the discriminant is an integer, and has thus an absolute value  that is not lower than {{val|1}}. This allows lower bounds for root separation that are independent from the discriminant.\n\nMignotte's separation bound is<ref>{{harvnb|Yap|2000|loc=\u00a7 VI.7, Proposition 29}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=George E.|last=Collins|authorlink=George E.

They form a set of {{mvar|n}} points in the [[complex plane]]. This article concerns the '''geometry''' of these points, that is the information about their localization in the complex plane that can be deduced from the degree and the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nSome of these geometrical properties are related to a single polynomial, such as upper bounds on the absolute values of the roots, which define a disk containing all roots, or lower bounds on the distance between two roots. Such bounds are widely used for [[root-finding algorithm]]s for polynomials, either for tuning them, or for computing their [[computational complexity]]\n\nSome other properties are probabilistic, such as the expected number of real roots of a random polynomial of degree {{mvar|n}} with real coefficients, which is less than  <math> 1+\\frac 2\\pi \\ln (n) </math> for {{mvar|n}} sufficiently large.\n\nIn this article, a polynomial that is considered is always denoted \n:<math>\n  p(x)=a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n,\n</math>\nwhere <math>a_0, \\dots, a_n</math> are real or complex numbers and <math>a_n \\neq 0</math>; thus {{mvar|n}} is the degree of the polynomial.\n\n==Continuous dependence on coefficients==\nThe {{math|''n''}} roots of a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} depend [[continuous function|continuously]] on the coefficients. For simple roots, this results immediately from the [[implicit function theorem]]. This is true also for multiple roots, but some care is needed for the proof.\n\nA small change of coefficients may induce a dramatic change of the roots, including the change of a real root into a complex root with a rather large imaginary part (see [[Wilkinson's polynomial]]). A consequence is that, for classical numeric [[root-finding algorithm]]s, the problem of approximating the roots given the coefficients is [[ill-conditioned]].\n\n==Conjugation==\n\nThe [[complex conjugate root theorem]] states that if the coefficients\nof a polynomial are real, then the non-real roots appear in pairs of the form  {{math|(''a'' + ''ib'', ''a'' \u2013 ''ib'')}}.\n\nIt follows that the roots of a polynomial with real coefficients are [[reflection symmetry|mirror-symmetric]] with respect to the real axis.\n\nThis can be extended to [[algebraic conjugate|algebraic conjugation]]: the roots of a polynomial with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients are ''conjugate'' (that is, invariant) under the action of the [[Galois group]] of the polynomial. However, this symmetry can rarely be interpreted geometrically.\n\n==Bounds on all roots==\nUpper bounds on the absolute values of polynomial roots are widely used for [[root-finding algorithm]]s, either for limiting the regions where roots should be searched, or for the computation of the [[computational complexity]] of these algorithms. \n\nMany such bounds have been given, and the sharper one depends generally of the specific sequence of coefficient that are considered. Most bounds are greater or equal to one, and are thus not sharp for a polynomial which have only roots of absolute values lower than one. However, such polynomials are very rare, as shown below.\n\nAny upper bound on the absolute values of roots provides a corresponding lower bound. In fact, if <math>a_n\\ne 0,</math> and {{mvar|U}} is an upper bound of the absolute values of the roots of \n:<math>\na_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_n x^n,\n</math>\nthen {{math|1/''U''}} is a lower bound of the absolute values of \n:<math>\na_n + a_{n-1} x + \\cdots + a_0 x^n,\n</math>\nsince the roots of either polynomial are the multiplicative inverses of the roots of the other. ''Therefore, in the remainder of the article lower bounds will not be given explicitly''.\n\n===Lagrange's and Cauchy's bounds===\n[[Lagrange]] and [[Cauchy]] were the firsts to provide upper bounds on all complex roots.<ref name=Hirst1997>{{cite journal |first=Holly P. |last=Hirst |first2=Wade T. |last2=Macey |title=Bounding the Roots of Polynomials |journal=[[The College Mathematics Journal]] |volume=28 |issue=4 |year=1997 |pages=292\u2013295 |jstor=2687152 }}</ref> Lagrange's bound is<ref>Lagrange J\u2013L (1798) Trait\u00e9 de la r\u00e9solution des \u00e9quations num\u00e9riques.

This is relatively rare in practice, and explains why Cauchy's bound is more widely used than Lagrange's.\n\nBoth bounds result from the [[Gershgorin circle theorem]] applied to the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial and its [[transpose]]. They can also be proved by elementary methods.\n\n{{cot|Proof of Lagrange's and Cauchy's bounds}}\nIf {{mvar|z}} is a root of the polynomial, and {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}} \u2265 1}} one has \n:<math>|a_n||z^n| = \\left|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_iz^i\\right|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_iz^i|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_i||z|^{n-1}.\n</math>\n\nDividing by <math>|a_n||z|^{n-1},</math> one gets \n:<math>|z|\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\frac{|a_i|}{|a_n|},</math>\nwhich is Lagrange's bound when there is at least one root of absolute value larger than 1. Otherwise, 1 is a bound on the roots, and is not larger than Lagrange's bound.\n\nSimilarly, for Cauchy's bound, one has, if {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}} \u2265 1}},\n:<math>|a_n||z^n| = \\left|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_iz^i\\right|\n\\le \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_iz^i|\n\\le \\max |a_i|\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|z|^i\n= \\frac{|z|^n-1}{|z|-1}\\max |a_i|\n\\le  \\frac{|z|^n}{|z|-1}\\max |a_i|.\n</math>\nThus \n:<math>\n|a_n|(|z|-1) \\le \\max |a_i|.\n</math>\nSolving in {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}}, one gets Cauchy's bound if there is a root of absolute value larger than 1. Otherwise the bound is also correct, as Cauchy's bound is larger than 1.\n{{cob}}\n\nThese bounds are not invariant by scaling. That is, the roots of the polynomial {{math|''p''(''sx'')}} are the quotient by {{mvar|s}} of the root of {{mvar|p}}, and the bounds given for the roots of {{math|''p''(''sx'')}} are not the quotient by {{mvar|s}} of the bounds of {{mvar|p}}. Thus, one may get sharper bounds by minimizing over possible scalings.

'''Landau's inequality''' provides an upper bound for the absolute values of the product of the roots that have an absolute value greater than one. This inequality, discovered in 1905 by [[Edmund Landau]]<ref>E. Landeau, Sur quelques th&or&mes de M. Petrovic relatifs aux z\u00e9ros des fonctions analytiques, ''Bull. Sot. Math. France'' 33 (1905), 251-261.</ref> has been forgotten and rediscovered at least three times during the 20th century.<ref>M. Mignotte. An inequality about factors of polynomials, ''Math.

This bound is even exactly equal to one of the bounds that are obtained [[#Using H\u00f6lder's inequality|using H\u00f6lder's inequality]].\n\nThis bound is also useful to bound the coefficients of a divisor of a polynomial with integer coefficients:<ref>Mignotte, M. (1988). An inequality about irreducible factors of integer polynomials.

More precisely, if there is a positive real number {{mvar|''R''}} and an integer {{math|0 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n''}} such that\n:<math>|a_k| R^k > |a_0|+\\cdots+|a_{k-1}| R^{k-1}+|a_{k+1}| R^{k+1}+\\cdots+|a_n| R^n,</math>\nthen there are exactly {{math|''k''}} roots, counted with multiplicity, of absolute value less than {{math|''R''}}. \n{{cot|Proof}}\nIf <math>|z|=R,</math> then\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n|a_0 &+\\cdots+a_{k-1}z^{k-1}+a_{k+1} z^{k+1}+\\cdots+a_n z^n|\\\\\n&\\le |a_0|+\\cdots+|a_{k-1}| R^{k-1}+|a_{k+1}| R^{k+1}+\\cdots+|a_n| R^n\\\\\n&\\le |a_k| R^k \\le |a_k z^k|.\n\\end{align}</math>\nBy Rouch\u00e9's theorem, this implies directly that <math>p(z)</math> and <math>z^k</math> have the same number of roots of absolute values less than {{mvar|R}}, counted with multiplicities. As this number is {{mvar|k}}, the result is proved.\n{{cob}}\n\nThe above result may be applied if the polynomial\n:<math>h_k(x)=|a_0| +\\cdots+|a_{k-1}| x^{k-1}-|a_k|x^k+|a_{k+1}| x^{k+1}+\\cdots+|a_n| x^n.</math>\ntakes a negative value for some positive real value of {{mvar|x}}.\n\nIn the remaining of the section, with suppose that {{math|''a''<sub>''0''</sub> \u2260 0}}. If it is not the case, zero is a root, and the localization of the other roots may be studied by dividing the polynomial by a power of the indeterminate, for getting a polynomial with a nonzero constant term.\n\nFor {{math|1=''k'' = 0}} and {{math|1=''k'' = ''n''}}, [[Descartes' rule of signs]] shows that the polynomial has exactly one positive real root. If <math>R_0</math> and <math>R_n</math> are these root, the above result shows that all the roots verifies \n:<math>R_0\\le |z| \\le R_1.</math>\nA these inequalities apply also to <math>h_0</math> and <math>h_n,</math> these bounds are optimal for polynomials with a given sequence of the absolute values of their coefficients. They are thus sharper than all bounds given in the preceding sections.\n\nFor {{math|0 < ''k'' < ''n''}}, Descartes' rule of signs implies that <math>h_k(x)</math> either has two positive real roots that are not multiple, or is nonnegative for every positive value of {{mvar|x}}. So, the above result may be applied only in the first case. If <math>R_{k,1}<R_{k,2}</math> are these two roots, the above result implies that\n:<math>|z| \\le R_{k,1}</math> \nfor {{mvar|k}} roots of {{mvar|p}}, and that \n:<math>|z| \\ge R_{k,2}</math> \nfor the {{math|''n'' \u2013 ''k''}} other roots.\n\nInstead of computing explicitly <math>R_{k,1}</math> and <math>R_{k,2},</math> it is generally sufficient to compute a value <math>R_k</math> such that <math>h_k(R_k)<0</math> (necessarily <math>R_{k,1}<R_k<R_{k,2}</math>). These  <math>R_k</math> have the property of separating roots in terms of their absolute values: if, for {{math|''h'' < ''k''}}, both <math>R_h</math> and <math>R_k</math> exist, there are exactly {{math|''k'' \u2013 ''h''}} roots {{mvar|z}} such that <math>R_h < |z| < R_k.</math>\n\nFor computing <math>R_k,</math> one can use that <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> is a [[convex function]] (its second derivative is positive). Thus <math>R_k</math> exists if and only if <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> is negative at its unique minimum. For computing this minimum, one can use any [[optimization]] method, or, alternatively, [[Newton's method]] for computing the unique positive zero of the derivative of <math>\\frac{h(x)}{x^k}</math> (it converges rapidly, as the derivative is a [[monotonic function]]).\n\nOne can increase the number of existing <math>R_k</math>'s by applying the root squaring operation of the [[Graeffe's method|Dandelin\u2013Graeffe iteration]]. If the roots have distinct absolute values, one can eventually separate completely the roots in terms of their absolute values, that is compute {{math|''n'' + 1}} positive numbers <math>R_0 < R_1 <\\dots <R_n</math> such there is exactly one root with an absolute value in the open interval <math>(R_{k-1},R_k),</math> for {{math|1=''k'' = 1, ..., ''n''}}.\n\n===From Gershgorin circle theorem ===\nThe [[Gershgorin circle theorem]] applied the [[companion matrix]] of the polynomial on a basis related to [[Lagrange interpolation]] provides discs centered at the interpolation points and each containing a root of the polynomial; see {{slink|Durand\u2013Kerner method|Root inclusion via Gerschgorin's circles}} for details.\n\nIf the interpolation points are close to the roots of the roots of the polynomial, the radiuses of the discs are small, and this is a key ingredient of Durand\u2013Kerner method for computing polynomial roots.\n\n==Bounds of real roots==\n\nFor polynomials with real coefficients, it is often useful to bound only the real roots. It suffices to bound the positive roots, as the negative roots of {{math|''p''(''x'')}} are the positive roots of {{math|''p''(\u2013''x'')}}.\n\nClearly, every bound of all roots applies also for real roots. But in some contexts, tighter bounds of real roots are useful. For example, the efficiency of the [[Real-root isolation#Method of continued fractions|method of continued fractions]] for [[real-root isolation]] strongly depends on tightness of a bound of positive roots. This has led to establish new bounds that are tighter than the general bounds of all roots. These bounds are generally expressed not only in terms of the absolute values of the coefficients, but also in terms of their signs.\n\nOther bounds apply only to polynomials whose all roots are reals (see below).\n\n===Bounds of positive real roots===\n\nFor giving a bound of the positive roots, one can suppose <math>a_n >0</math> without loss of generality, as changing the signs of all coefficients does not change the roots.\n\nEvery upper bound of the positive roots of \n:<math>q(x)=a_nx^n + \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\min(0,a_i)x^i</math>\nis also a bound  for the real zeros of \n:<math>p(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i</math>. \nIn fact, if {{mvar|B}} is such a bound, for all {{math|''x'' > ''B''}}, one has\n{{math|''p''(''x'') \u2265 ''q''(''x'') > 0}}.\n\nApplied to Cauchy's bound, this gives the upper bound \n:<math>1+{\\textstyle\\max_{i=0}^{n-1}} \\frac{-a_i}{a_n}</math>\nfor the real roots of a polynomial with real coefficients. If this bound is not greater than {{val|1}}, this means that all nonzero coefficients have the same sign, and that there is no positive root.\n\nSimilarly, another upper bound of the positive roots is \n:<math>2\\,{\\max_{a_ia_n<0}}\\left(\\frac{-a_i}{a_n}\\right)^{\\frac 1{n-i}}.</math>\nIf all nonzero coefficients have the same sign, there is no positive root, and the maximum must be defined as being zero.\n\nOther bounds have been recently developed, mainly for the need of the [[Real-root isolation#Method of continued fractions|method of continued fractions]] for [[real-root isolation]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Akritas |first=Alkiviadis G. |first2=A.

In fact, the root separation determines the precision of number representation that is needed for being sure of distinguishing different roots. Also, for [[real-root isolation]], it allows bounding the number of interval divisions that are needed for isolating all roots.\n\nFor polynomials with real or complex coefficients is not possible to express a lower bound of the root separation in terms of the degree and the absolute values of the coefficients only, because a small change on a single coefficient transforms a polynomial with multiple roots in a [[square-free polynomial]] with a small root separation, and essentially the same absolute values of the coefficient. However, involving the [[discriminant]] of the polynomial allows a lower bound.\n\nFor square-free polynomials with integer coefficients, the discriminant is an integer, and has thus an absolute value  that is not lower than {{val|1}}. This allows lower bounds for root separation that are independent from the discriminant.\n\nMignotte's separation bound is<ref>{{harvnb|Yap|2000|loc=\u00a7 VI.7, Proposition 29}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=George E.|last=Collins|authorlink=George E.

She graduated from the private [[Maumee Valley Country Day School]] in 1988, and went on to [[Cornell University]] where she received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[government]] in 1992. She later earned a [[Master of Public Policy]] from [[Harvard University]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]].\n\n==Teaching==\nInspired by a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] special that she saw during her senior year in college, Rhee signed up with [[Teach For America]], went through their five-week summer training program, then worked for three years as a teacher in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref name=\"Washingtonian 2007\"/><ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> She was assigned to Harlem Park Elementary School, one of the lowest-performing schools.<ref name=\"tackles\"/> Rhee told ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'' magazine that she was demoralized by her first year of teaching, but said to herself, \"I\u2019m not going to let eight-year-old kids run me out of town.\" She said she took courses over the summer and received her [[Certified teacher|teacher's certification]], then returned to teach at Harlem Park.<ref name=\"Washingtonian 2007\"/>  Her \"Teach For America\" Training did not prepare her well to handle basic classroom management. She was so unprepared that in order to quiet down a class she taped children's mouths shut. One of the children's lips bled a little when the tape was removed.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/video/2010/08/13/VI2010081305444.html</ref>\n\nIn her second and third years of teaching, Rhee team taught a combined class of the same students with another teacher.<ref name=\"TeamTeaching\"/> She told ''The New York Times'' that those students had national [[standardized test]] scores that were initially at the 13th percentile but at the end of two years, the class was at grade level, with some students performing at the 90th percentile.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Earlier she had said on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that 90 percent of her students had attained scores at the 90th percentile.<ref name=\"early test\"/> In math, her scores went from 22 percentile to 52 percentile, an average increase of 15 percentile annually.<ref name=\"HarlemPark\">{{cite news|url=http://gfbrandenburg.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/cohort-effects-at-harlem-park-jpg.jpg|title=Proficiency Scores at Harlem Park Elementary|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}</ref> In reading, her scores went from 14 percentile to 48 percentile, an average increase of 17 percentile annually.<ref name=\"HarlemPark\"/> Rhee responded that the discrepancies between the official test scores and the ones listed on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 could be explained by the fact that her principal at the time informed her of the gains but those results may not have been the official state tests that were preserved.<ref name=\"early test\"/>\n\n==The New Teacher Project==\nIn 1997, Rhee founded and began serving as the CEO of [[The New Teacher Project]], a nonprofit that within ten years of its founding, trained and supplied urban school districts with 23,000 mid-career professionals wanting to become classroom teachers.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> The project primarily serves New York, Chicago, Miami, and Philadelphia.<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> Beginning in 2000, the project began redesigning the D.C. schools' recruitment and hiring processes.<ref name=\"DCExaminer2007\"/>\n\n==Chancellor of D.C. public schools==\nIn 2007 the D.C. Board of Education was stripped of its decision-making powers and turned into an advisory body, and the new office of chancellor was created\u2014so changes in the public school system could be made without waiting for the approval of the board.<ref name=\"Washingtonian 2007\"/><ref name=\"tackles\"/> Newly elected D.C. mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] quickly offered Rhee the job of chancellor;<ref name=\"Washingtonian 2007\"/> she accepted after being promised  mayoral backing for whatever changes she wanted to make.<ref name=\"fenty to oust\"/> Critics noted that Rhee had no experience running a school system,<ref name=\"Washingtonian 2007\"/> and had not even been a principal. She had been highly recommended to Fenty, however, by [[Joel Klein]], the [[New York City School Chancellor|chancellor]] of the [[New York City Department of Education|New York City public schools]].<ref name=\"was fired\"/>\n\nRhee inherited a troubled system; there had been six school chiefs in the previous 10 years,<ref name=\"Washingtonian 2007\"/> students historically had below-average scores on standardized tests,<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/michelle_rhee/index.html|title=Michelle A.

Teachers and the teachers union rejected the proposal, contesting that some form of tenure was necessary to protect against arbitrary, political, or wrongful termination of employment.<ref name=\"takes on tenure\"/>\n\nIn 2010 Rhee and the unions agreed on a new contract that offered 20 percent pay raises and bonuses of $20,000 to $30,000 for \"strong student achievement,\" in exchange for weakened teachers' seniority protections and the end of teacher tenure for one year. Under this new agreement, Rhee fired 241 teachers, the vast majority of whom received poor evaluations, and put 737 additional school employees on notice.<ref name=\"dismisses 241\"/>\n\n===Criticism===\nRhee's style of reform created a great deal of controversy. One common criticism disputes her assertion that, while a teacher, she dramatically increased students' average scores from the 13th percentile to the 90th. It was a statement that could not be verified during her confirmation process for D.C. Schools Chancellor.<ref name=\"challenge resume\"/>\n\nRhee contended that under her chancellorship, student achievement in the D.C. Public Schools greatly improved. Since 2007, secondary schools have improved their standardized test pass rates by 14 percent in reading and 17 percent in math, while elementary school pass rates have improved 6 percent in reading and 15 percent in math. Systemwide high school graduation rates also improved by 3 percent, up to 72 percent in 2009.<ref name=\"tied\"/> By 2010, D.C. Comprehensive Assessment System reading pass rates had increased by 14 percentage points, and math pass rates had increased by 17 percentage points. Enrollment decreased by 1 percent, a slower decline than prior years.<ref name=\"tied\"/> However, significant achievement gaps remained between students in high-performing and low-performing school districts, and between white and black students. Education historian [[Diane Ravitch]] questioned the legitimacy of Rhee's results, alleging that \"cheating, teaching to bad tests, institutionalized fraud, dumbing down of tests, and a narrowed curriculum\" were the true outcomes of Rhee's tenure in D.C. schools.<ref name=\"Ravitch\"/>\n\nSome D.C. parents and community leaders complained that despite these improvements, the speed with which Rhee enacted her reforms left them without input on the changes. The District Council also criticized Rhee for being unresponsive to council members' requests for information about school operations. From 2008 to 2010, Rhee's approval ratings decreased from 59 percent to 43 percent. In 2010, 28 percent of African Americans supported Rhee, down from 50 percent in 2008. Yet even \"as residents grow less supportive of Fenty's designated change agent for the schools,\" noted the Washington Post, \"they still approve of some of the changes. The proportion of parents in the city who see violence or crime as a 'big problem' has declined from 78 to 65 percent.... The quality and availability of books and other instructional materials is viewed as less of a major problem by all parents, dropping from 67 percent to 48 percent.\" Also, the Post indicated that \"Rhee's efforts to raise the quality of teaching through improved training, evaluation, and dismissals might be gaining traction as well.\"<ref name=\"slide\"/>\n\nRhee fired several administrators and school principals, including Marta Guzman, the principal of the high-performing Oyster\u2013Adams Bilingual Elementary School, which Rhee's own children attended.<ref name=\"tackles\"/><ref name=\"Turque2008\"/> Some parents alleged that the firing process was neither transparent nor fair. According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', \"the departure has stunned many Oyster\u2013Adams parents who wondered why, in a city filled with underperforming public schools, Rhee would sack a principal who has presided for the past five years over one of its few success stories. The move also heightened ethnic and class tensions within the school's diverse community. Eduardo Barada, co-chairman of the Oyster\u2013Adams Community Council, the school's PTA, said Guzman was toppled by a cadre of dissatisfied and largely affluent Anglo parents with the ear of a woman who was both a fellow parent and the chancellor.\"<ref name=\"Turque2008\"/> Rhee also fired a principal she had hired seven weeks before in Shepherd Elementary, another high-performing school in the upper [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest neighborhood]].<ref name=\"fires shepherd\"/>\n\nRhee was criticized for closing several D.C. schools without holding public hearings,<ref name=\"News8_2008\"/> for not reporting complete budget figures at D.C. council hearings,<ref name=\"News8_2008\"/> for not involving parents to a sufficient degree,<ref name=\"urges more\"/> hiring former supporters to conduct an evaluation of her performance,<ref name=\"watchdog\"/> and for spending considerable time before the national media (''Time'', PBS, lecture circuit) instead of visiting schools.<ref name=\"News8_2008\"/> When Rhee outlined a proposed new security plan in a talk at [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Washington, DC)|Woodrow Wilson High School]], many students protested and proposed an alternative plan, Rhee responded indicating that she found the student plan well thought out and that she would consider incorporating aspects into the final plan.<ref name=\"walk out\"/>\n\n[[File:Michelle Rhee at NOAA.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Rhee at a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] awards ceremony, June 2008]]\n\nReferring to the 266 teachers she laid off, Rhee told a national business magazine: \"I got rid of teachers who had hit children, who had had sex with children, who had missed 78 days of school. Why wouldn't we take those things into consideration?\" George Parker, president of the teachers union, called Rhee's statements \"reckless,\" said they had no factual basis, and demanded that Rhee apologize to the 266 teachers for making these remarks.<ref name=\"abused kids\" /> Rhee declined to apologize for her statement, claimed that one of the 266 dismissed employees had been accused of sexual misconduct, six had been suspended for using corporal punishment, and two had been absent without leave, while many others also had egregious time and attendance records.<ref name=\"Hedge\" />\n\n===2010 election and resignation===\n{{wikinews|District of Columbia Public Schools chancellor Michelle Rhee announces resignation}}\nThe [[2010 Washington, D.C. mayoral election|2010 mayoral election in Washington, D.C.,]]  was interpreted by some political observers as, in part, a referendum on Rhee's tenure as school chancellor.<ref name=\"Fenty's Loss\"/> Following the defeat of incumbent mayor Adrian Fenty in the 2010 Democratic primary election, Fenty announced on October 13, 2010, that Rhee had resigned.

Board of Education was stripped of its decision-making powers and turned into an advisory body, and the new office of chancellor was created\u2014so changes in the public school system could be made without waiting for the approval of the board.<ref name=\"Washingtonian 2007\"/><ref name=\"tackles\"/> Newly elected D.C. mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] quickly offered Rhee the job of chancellor;<ref name=\"Washingtonian 2007\"/> she accepted after being promised  mayoral backing for whatever changes she wanted to make.<ref name=\"fenty to oust\"/> Critics noted that Rhee had no experience running a school system,<ref name=\"Washingtonian 2007\"/> and had not even been a principal. She had been highly recommended to Fenty, however, by [[Joel Klein]], the [[New York City School Chancellor|chancellor]] of the [[New York City Department of Education|New York City public schools]].<ref name=\"was fired\"/>\n\nRhee inherited a troubled system; there had been six school chiefs in the previous 10 years,<ref name=\"Washingtonian 2007\"/> students historically had below-average scores on standardized tests,<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite web|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/michelle_rhee/index.html|title=Michelle A.

Teachers and the teachers union rejected the proposal, contesting that some form of tenure was necessary to protect against arbitrary, political, or wrongful termination of employment.<ref name=\"takes on tenure\"/>\n\nIn 2010 Rhee and the unions agreed on a new contract that offered 20 percent pay raises and bonuses of $20,000 to $30,000 for \"strong student achievement,\" in exchange for weakened teachers' seniority protections and the end of teacher tenure for one year. Under this new agreement, Rhee fired 241 teachers, the vast majority of whom received poor evaluations, and put 737 additional school employees on notice.<ref name=\"dismisses 241\"/>\n\n===Criticism===\nRhee's style of reform created a great deal of controversy. One common criticism disputes her assertion that, while a teacher, she dramatically increased students' average scores from the 13th percentile to the 90th. It was a statement that could not be verified during her confirmation process for D.C. Schools Chancellor.<ref name=\"challenge resume\"/>\n\nRhee contended that under her chancellorship, student achievement in the D.C. Public Schools greatly improved. Since 2007, secondary schools have improved their standardized test pass rates by 14 percent in reading and 17 percent in math, while elementary school pass rates have improved 6 percent in reading and 15 percent in math. Systemwide high school graduation rates also improved by 3 percent, up to 72 percent in 2009.<ref name=\"tied\"/> By 2010, D.C. Comprehensive Assessment System reading pass rates had increased by 14 percentage points, and math pass rates had increased by 17 percentage points. Enrollment decreased by 1 percent, a slower decline than prior years.<ref name=\"tied\"/> However, significant achievement gaps remained between students in high-performing and low-performing school districts, and between white and black students. Education historian [[Diane Ravitch]] questioned the legitimacy of Rhee's results, alleging that \"cheating, teaching to bad tests, institutionalized fraud, dumbing down of tests, and a narrowed curriculum\" were the true outcomes of Rhee's tenure in D.C. schools.<ref name=\"Ravitch\"/>\n\nSome D.C. parents and community leaders complained that despite these improvements, the speed with which Rhee enacted her reforms left them without input on the changes. The District Council also criticized Rhee for being unresponsive to council members' requests for information about school operations. From 2008 to 2010, Rhee's approval ratings decreased from 59 percent to 43 percent. In 2010, 28 percent of African Americans supported Rhee, down from 50 percent in 2008. Yet even \"as residents grow less supportive of Fenty's designated change agent for the schools,\" noted the Washington Post, \"they still approve of some of the changes. The proportion of parents in the city who see violence or crime as a 'big problem' has declined from 78 to 65 percent.... The quality and availability of books and other instructional materials is viewed as less of a major problem by all parents, dropping from 67 percent to 48 percent.\" Also, the Post indicated that \"Rhee's efforts to raise the quality of teaching through improved training, evaluation, and dismissals might be gaining traction as well.\"<ref name=\"slide\"/>\n\nRhee fired several administrators and school principals, including Marta Guzman, the principal of the high-performing Oyster\u2013Adams Bilingual Elementary School, which Rhee's own children attended.<ref name=\"tackles\"/><ref name=\"Turque2008\"/> Some parents alleged that the firing process was neither transparent nor fair. According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', \"the departure has stunned many Oyster\u2013Adams parents who wondered why, in a city filled with underperforming public schools, Rhee would sack a principal who has presided for the past five years over one of its few success stories. The move also heightened ethnic and class tensions within the school's diverse community. Eduardo Barada, co-chairman of the Oyster\u2013Adams Community Council, the school's PTA, said Guzman was toppled by a cadre of dissatisfied and largely affluent Anglo parents with the ear of a woman who was both a fellow parent and the chancellor.\"<ref name=\"Turque2008\"/> Rhee also fired a principal she had hired seven weeks before in Shepherd Elementary, another high-performing school in the upper [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|Northwest neighborhood]].<ref name=\"fires shepherd\"/>\n\nRhee was criticized for closing several D.C. schools without holding public hearings,<ref name=\"News8_2008\"/> for not reporting complete budget figures at D.C. council hearings,<ref name=\"News8_2008\"/> for not involving parents to a sufficient degree,<ref name=\"urges more\"/> hiring former supporters to conduct an evaluation of her performance,<ref name=\"watchdog\"/> and for spending considerable time before the national media (''Time'', PBS, lecture circuit) instead of visiting schools.<ref name=\"News8_2008\"/> When Rhee outlined a proposed new security plan in a talk at [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Washington, DC)|Woodrow Wilson High School]], many students protested and proposed an alternative plan, Rhee responded indicating that she found the student plan well thought out and that she would consider incorporating aspects into the final plan.<ref name=\"walk out\"/>\n\n[[File:Michelle Rhee at NOAA.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Rhee at a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] awards ceremony, June 2008]]\n\nReferring to the 266 teachers she laid off, Rhee told a national business magazine: \"I got rid of teachers who had hit children, who had had sex with children, who had missed 78 days of school. Why wouldn't we take those things into consideration?\" George Parker, president of the teachers union, called Rhee's statements \"reckless,\" said they had no factual basis, and demanded that Rhee apologize to the 266 teachers for making these remarks.<ref name=\"abused kids\" /> Rhee declined to apologize for her statement, claimed that one of the 266 dismissed employees had been accused of sexual misconduct, six had been suspended for using corporal punishment, and two had been absent without leave, while many others also had egregious time and attendance records.<ref name=\"Hedge\" />\n\n===2010 election and resignation===\n{{wikinews|District of Columbia Public Schools chancellor Michelle Rhee announces resignation}}\nThe [[2010 Washington, D.C. mayoral election|2010 mayoral election in Washington, D.C.,]]  was interpreted by some political observers as, in part, a referendum on Rhee's tenure as school chancellor.<ref name=\"Fenty's Loss\"/> Following the defeat of incumbent mayor Adrian Fenty in the 2010 Democratic primary election, Fenty announced on October 13, 2010, that Rhee had resigned.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''. The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''petros'' 'rock' and ''oikos'' 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.<ref>Boles, p. 66.</ref> Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as \"red robins\", as distinct from the \"yellow robins\" of the genus ''[[Eopsaltria]]''.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]].

He was picked up and adopted by Xiaobai when he was living on the street. When angry, the eyes will turn green, and the pupils will turn into thin yellow pupils like cats.\n* '''Luo Xiaobai''': Luo Xiaohei's owner, Agen's sister.\n* Mom: Luo Xiaobai's mother, who wears a mask all the year round, has appeared in the TV version.\n* Dad: Luo Xiaobai's dad, who covers his face with a newspaper in every episode.

Chamecavies have a large appetite, and they turn into the color of the food that they have just eaten. It can be restored in about 5 minutes. If you eat animals or metal, the mutation will be huge and aggressive, and you can stop the bruising pattern between the eyebrows, but the mutation is very burdensome.\n* Laojun: The prototype of Taishang Laojun , who lives in Lanxi Town. He has made a number of vows and wrote them as \"Oath Records\". Those who complete the vows can get prizes. For example, there is a prize for those who do something to force Laojun.
