Upon tissue damage and the consequent [[inflammation]], a number of inflammatory mediators, such as various [[prostaglandins]] and [[bradykinin]], are released. These agents increase the sensitivity of nociceptors  to noxious stimuli. This manifests as an increased sensitivity to painful stimuli ([[hyperalgesia]]) or pain sensation in response to non-painful stimuli ([[allodynia]]). Most sensitizing pro-inflammatory agents activate the [[phospholipase C]] pathway. Phosphorylation of TRPV1 by [[protein kinase C]] have been shown to play a role in sensitization of TRPV1.  The cleavage of PIP2 by PLC-beta can result in disinhibition of TRPV1 and, as a consequence, contribute to the sensitivity of TRPV1 to noxious stimuli.\n\n=== Desensitization ===\n\nUpon prolonged exposure to [[capsaicin]], TRPV1 activity decreases, a phenomenon called ''desensitization''. Extracellular [[calcium]] ions are required for this phenomenon, thus influx of calcium and the consequential increase of intracellular calcium mediate this effect. Various signaling pathways such as [[calmodulin]] and [[calcineurin]], and the decrease of [[PIP2|PIP<sub>2</sub>]], have been implicated in desensitization of TRPV1. Desensitization of TRPV1 is thought to underlie the paradoxical [[analgesic]] effect of capsaicin.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Peripheral nervous system ===\n\nTreatment of pain is an unmet medical need costing billions of dollars every year.

Upon tissue damage and the consequent [[inflammation]], a number of inflammatory mediators, such as various [[prostaglandins]] and [[bradykinin]], are released. These agents increase the sensitivity of nociceptors  to noxious stimuli. This manifests as an increased sensitivity to painful stimuli ([[hyperalgesia]]) or pain sensation in response to non-painful stimuli ([[allodynia]]). Most sensitizing pro-inflammatory agents activate the [[phospholipase C]] pathway. Phosphorylation of TRPV1 by [[protein kinase C]] have been shown to play a role in sensitization of TRPV1.  The cleavage of PIP2 by PLC-beta can result in disinhibition of TRPV1 and, as a consequence, contribute to the sensitivity of TRPV1 to noxious stimuli.\n\n=== Desensitization ===\n\nUpon prolonged exposure to [[capsaicin]], TRPV1 activity decreases, a phenomenon called ''desensitization''. Extracellular [[calcium]] ions are required for this phenomenon, thus influx of calcium and the consequential increase of intracellular calcium mediate this effect. Various signaling pathways such as [[calmodulin]] and [[calcineurin]], and the decrease of [[PIP2|PIP<sub>2</sub>]], have been implicated in desensitization of TRPV1. Desensitization of TRPV1 is thought to underlie the paradoxical [[analgesic]] effect of capsaicin.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Peripheral nervous system ===\n\nTreatment of pain is an unmet medical need costing billions of dollars every year.

[[CMKLR1]], [[GPR32]], [[FPR2]], and [[NMDA receptor]]s have been proposed to be the receptors through which these SPMs operate to [[down-regulate]] TRPV1 and thereby pain perception.<ref name=\"pmid25052386\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Qu Q, Xuan W, Fan GH | title = Roles of resolvins in the resolution of acute inflammation | journal = Cell Biology International | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 3\u201322 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25052386 | doi = 10.1002/cbin.10345 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid25359497\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N, Dalli J, Levy BD | title = Lipid mediators in the resolution of inflammation | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = a016311 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25359497 | pmc = 4315926 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a016311 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid26339646\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lim JY, Park CK, Hwang SW | title = Biological Roles of Resolvins and Related Substances in the Resolution of Pain | journal = BioMed Research International | volume = 2015 | issue = | pages = 1\u201314 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26339646 | pmc = 4538417 | doi = 10.1155/2015/830930 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid21963090\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ji RR, Xu ZZ, Strichartz G, Serhan CN | title = Emerging roles of resolvins in the resolution of inflammation and pain | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 34 | issue = 11 | pages = 599\u2013609 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21963090 | pmc = 3200462 | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2011.08.005 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid25857211\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Serhan CN, Chiang N, Dalli J | title = The resolution code of acute inflammation: Novel pro-resolving lipid mediators in resolution | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 200\u201315 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25857211 | pmc = 4515371 | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2015.03.004 | url = }}</ref>\n\n==== Fatty acid conjugates ====\n\n[[N-Arachidonoyl dopamine]], an endocannabinoid found in the human CNS, structurally similar to capsaicin, activates the TRPV1 channel with an [[EC50|EC<sub>50</sub>]] of approximately of 50 nM.<ref name=\"pmid12060783\" />\n\nN-Oleyl-dopamine, another endogenous agonist, binds to human VR1 with an Ki of 36 Nm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.caymanchem.com/app/template/Product.vm/catalog/10115|title=N-Oleoyl Dopamine (CAS 105955-11-1)|author=|date=|website=www.caymanchem.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother [[endocannabinoid]] [[anandamide]] has also been shown to act on TRPV1 receptors.<ref name=\"pmid14517174\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ross RA | title = Anandamide and vanilloid TRPV1 receptors | journal = Br.

{"title_page": "Dasein", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n'''''Dasein''''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8da\u02d0za\u026an}}) is a [[German language|German]] word that means \"being there\" or \"presence\" (German: ''[[wikt:da#German|da]]'' \"there\"; ''[[wikt:sein#German|sein]]'' \"being\"), and is often translated into English with the word \"existence\". It is a fundamental concept in the [[existential philosophy]] of [[Martin Heidegger]], particularly in his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' ''[[Being and Time]]''. Heidegger uses the expression ''Dasein'' to refer to the experience of [[being]] that is peculiar to human beings. Thus it is a form of being that is aware of and must confront such issues as [[person]]hood, [[Death|mortality]] and the dilemma or paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with oneself.\n\n==Heidegger's re-interpretation==\nIn German, ''Dasein'' is the vernacular term for \"existence\", as in \"I am pleased with my existence\" (''Ich bin mit meinem Dasein zufrieden''). The term has been used by several philosophers before Heidegger, most notably [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], with the meaning of human \"existence\" or \"presence\". It is derived from ''da-sein'', which literally means ''being-there/there-being''<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\">J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 70</ref>\u2014though Heidegger was adamant that this was an inappropriate translation of ''Dasein''.<ref>[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus, H. L.]], ''Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time'' ([[Cambridge, MA]]: [[MIT Press]], 1990).</ref>\nDasein for Heidegger can be a way of being involved with and caring for the immediate world in which one lives, while always remaining aware of the contingent element of that involvement, of the priority of the world to the self, and of the evolving nature of the self itself.<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\"/>\n\nThe opposite of this authentic self is everyday and inauthentic Dasein, the forfeiture of one's individual meaning, destiny and lifespan, in favour of an (escapist) immersion in the public everyday world\u2014the anonymous, identical world of [[das Man|the They]] and the Them.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 64-81</ref>\n\nIn harmony with [[Nietzsche]]'s critique of the [[subject (philosophy)#Nietzsche's critique of the subject|subject]], as something definable in terms of consciousness,  Heidegger distinguished Dasein from everyday consciousness in order to emphasize the critical importance \"Being\" has for our understanding and interpretation of the world, and so on.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"This entity which each of us is himself\u2026we shall denote by the term \u201cDasein\u201d\" (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.27).<ref name=\"Heidegger, M. 1962\">Heidegger, M.

Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 48</ref> that ''Dasein'' is always a being engaged in the world: neither a subject, nor the objective world alone, but the coherence of [[Being-in-the-world]]. This ontological basis of Heidegger's work thus opposes the Cartesian \"abstract agent\" in favour of practical engagement with one's environment.<ref>J. Collins/H.

Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 69-70</ref>  [[bad faith (existentialism)|Authentic choice]] means turning away from the collective world of Them, to face ''Dasein'', one's individuality, one's own limited life-span, one's own being.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 81-9</ref> Heidegger thus intended the concept of ''Dasein'' to provide a stepping stone in the questioning of what it means to ''be''\u2014to have one's own being, one's own death, one's own truth.<ref>E. Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 96</ref>\n\nHeidegger also saw the question of ''Dasein'' as extending beyond the realms disclosed by positive science or in the history of [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysics]].  \u201cScientific research is not the only manner of Being which this entity can have, nor is it the one which lies closest. Moreover, Dasein itself has a special distinctiveness as compared with other entities; [...] it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it.\u201d<ref>Heidegger, Martin. \"The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being.\" ''Being and Time'' / Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 32</ref> ''[[Being and Time]]'' stressed the ontological difference between entities and the being ''of'' entities: \u201cBeing is always the Being of an entity.\u201d<ref>Heidegger, Martin. \"The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being.\" ''Being and Time'' / Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 29.</ref> Establishing this difference is the general motif running through ''Being and Time''.\n\nSome scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, arguing that for Heidegger \"''Dasein''\" denoted a structured awareness or an institutional \"way of life\".<ref>See John Haugeland's article [http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/haugeland/Reading+Brandom+Reading+Heidegger.pdf \"Reading Brandom Reading Heidegger\"]</ref> Others suggest that Heidegger's early insistence on the ontological priority of Dasein was muted in his post-war writings.<ref>H.

Due to the drastically different use of the term \"''Dasein''\" between the two philosophers, there is often some confusion in students who begin with either Heidegger or Jaspers and subsequently study the other.\n\nIn ''Philosophy'' (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method can simply not transcend.

It is a fundamental concept in the [[existential philosophy]] of [[Martin Heidegger]], particularly in his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' ''[[Being and Time]]''. Heidegger uses the expression ''Dasein'' to refer to the experience of [[being]] that is peculiar to human beings. Thus it is a form of being that is aware of and must confront such issues as [[person]]hood, [[Death|mortality]] and the dilemma or paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with oneself.\n\n==Heidegger's re-interpretation==\nIn German, ''Dasein'' is the vernacular term for \"existence\", as in \"I am pleased with my existence\" (''Ich bin mit meinem Dasein zufrieden''). The term has been used by several philosophers before Heidegger, most notably [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], with the meaning of human \"existence\" or \"presence\". It is derived from ''da-sein'', which literally means ''being-there/there-being''<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\">J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 70</ref>\u2014though Heidegger was adamant that this was an inappropriate translation of ''Dasein''.<ref>[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus, H. L.]], ''Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time'' ([[Cambridge, MA]]: [[MIT Press]], 1990).</ref>\nDasein for Heidegger can be a way of being involved with and caring for the immediate world in which one lives, while always remaining aware of the contingent element of that involvement, of the priority of the world to the self, and of the evolving nature of the self itself.<ref name=\"Cultural Criticism 1995 p. 70\"/>\n\nThe opposite of this authentic self is everyday and inauthentic Dasein, the forfeiture of one's individual meaning, destiny and lifespan, in favour of an (escapist) immersion in the public everyday world\u2014the anonymous, identical world of [[das Man|the They]] and the Them.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 64-81</ref>\n\nIn harmony with [[Nietzsche]]'s critique of the [[subject (philosophy)#Nietzsche's critique of the subject|subject]], as something definable in terms of consciousness,  Heidegger distinguished Dasein from everyday consciousness in order to emphasize the critical importance \"Being\" has for our understanding and interpretation of the world, and so on.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"This entity which each of us is himself\u2026we shall denote by the term \u201cDasein\u201d\" (Heidegger, trans. 1927/1962, p.27).<ref name=\"Heidegger, M. 1962\">Heidegger, M.

Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 48</ref> that ''Dasein'' is always a being engaged in the world: neither a subject, nor the objective world alone, but the coherence of [[Being-in-the-world]]. This ontological basis of Heidegger's work thus opposes the Cartesian \"abstract agent\" in favour of practical engagement with one's environment.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 61</ref> Dasein is revealed by projection into, and engagement with, a personal world<ref>H.

Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 69-70</ref>  [[bad faith (existentialism)|Authentic choice]] means turning away from the collective world of Them, to face ''Dasein'', one's individuality, one's own limited life-span, one's own being.<ref>J. Collins/H. Selina, ''Heidegger for Beginners'' (1998) p. 81-9</ref> Heidegger thus intended the concept of ''Dasein'' to provide a stepping stone in the questioning of what it means to ''be''\u2014to have one's own being, one's own death, one's own truth.<ref>E. Roudinesco, ''Jacques Lacan'' (2005) p. 96</ref>\n\nHeidegger also saw the question of ''Dasein'' as extending beyond the realms disclosed by positive science or in the history of [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysics]].  \u201cScientific research is not the only manner of Being which this entity can have, nor is it the one which lies closest. Moreover, Dasein itself has a special distinctiveness as compared with other entities; [...] it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it.\u201d<ref>Heidegger, Martin. \"The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being.\" ''Being and Time'' / Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 32</ref> ''[[Being and Time]]'' stressed the ontological difference between entities and the being ''of'' entities: \u201cBeing is always the Being of an entity.\u201d<ref>Heidegger, Martin. \"The Ontological Priority of the Question of Being.\" ''Being and Time'' / Translated by John Macquarrie & Edward Robinson. London: S.C.M., 1962. 29.</ref> Establishing this difference is the general motif running through ''Being and Time''.\n\nSome scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, arguing that for Heidegger \"''Dasein''\" denoted a structured awareness or an institutional \"way of life\".<ref>See John Haugeland's article [http://philosophy.uchicago.edu/faculty/files/haugeland/Reading+Brandom+Reading+Heidegger.pdf \"Reading Brandom Reading Heidegger\"]</ref> Others suggest that Heidegger's early insistence on the ontological priority of Dasein was muted in his post-war writings.<ref>H.

Due to the drastically different use of the term \"''Dasein''\" between the two philosophers, there is often some confusion in students who begin with either Heidegger or Jaspers and subsequently study the other.\n\nIn ''Philosophy'' (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method can simply not transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a [[leap of faith]] toward what Jaspers calls \"Transcendence\". In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls ''Existenz'', and can finally experience authentic existence.\n\n== Other applications ==\n[[Eero Tarasti]] considered ''Dasein'' very important in ''Existential Semiotics''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Existential Semiotics |series=Advances in Semiotics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FySwDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |first=Eero |last=Tarasti |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=9780253337221 |page=218}}</ref>{{rp|218}}\n\n[[Jacques Lacan]] turned in the 1950s to Heidegger's Dasein for his characterisation of the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] as being-for-death:  (''\u00eatre-pour-la-mort'').<ref>E.

He also played for the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\n==Early years==\nCarriker was born in [[Hastings, Nebraska]].  He moved to [[Kennewick, Washington]], at the age of three,<ref name=huskersbio>[http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=4&SPID=22&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=966&Q_SEASON=2006 \"Adam Carriker\".]  [http://www.huskers.com/ Huskers.com.] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ghdVXN4P?url=http://www.huskers.com//pdf7/134543.pdf |date=2009-05-12 }}  Retrieved 2016-02-14.</ref> and attended [[Kennewick High School]], where he played quarterback and defensive end. He was a three-year starter at quarterback and team captain for three years. In his only season at defensive end (his senior season), he recorded 25 tackles, 15 sacks, and four forced fumbles in a winless season. Regardless, he was named to Second-team All-Big 9 Honors. Carriker visited Oregon, Oregon State and Washington State before finally deciding to commit to Nebraska. Additionally, Carriker was a three-time All-Conference selection in baseball and ran track.  He received all-state honors for his shot put prowess and long jump efforts as a senior.\n\n==College career==\nCarriker [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]]ed in 2002. In his 2003 freshman season he played extensively in passing situations before injuring his ankle against Utah State. Against the [[Colorado Buffaloes football|University of Colorado]] he had three quarterback hurries and ended a CU drive in the third quarter with a nine-yard sack of quarterback [[Joel Klatt]]. He finished the year with three tackles and three quarterback hurries. He played in his first bowl game, the 2003 Alamo Bowl after the regular season. In his 2004 sophomore year Carriker was hampered for the second straight season by an ankle injury. He played in 10 games with eight starts in the 2004 campaign, and finished with 36 tackles, including seven tackles for loss and three sacks for 18 yards. Carriker added seven quarterback hurries during his sophomore season.\n\nAs a junior in 2005 Carriker started all 12 games at the base end spot, and finished with 9.5 sacks for 84 yards and 17 tackles for loss for 96 yards. His 9\u00bd sacks tied for the Big 12 Conference lead and ranked 19th nationally. He also led Nebraska with 21 quarterback hurries, 10 more than any other Husker defender. Carriker's 43 total tackles ranked seventh on the team and tied for the most among defensive linemen. He began his junior season by notching two of the Huskers' school-record tying 11 sacks in the team's 25-7 win over Maine. Carriker capped 2005 with one tackle in the [[Alamo Bowl]] victory over the [[University of Michigan]]. Adam was voted 2005 Nebraska Defensive MVP.\n\nAs a senior in 2006 Adam Carriker completed a dominant career in the 2006 season [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] against [[Auburn University]]. In 2006, Carriker earned Nebraska's Defensive MVP honor for the second straight season, and was honored as the Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year by the league's coaches. Carriker finished the season with a team-leading seven sacks and ranked second on the team with 16 tackles behind the line of scrimmage. His 52 total tackles led all Nebraska defensive linemen, and he also paced the Blackshirt defense with 12 quarterback hurries, while registering his first career interception. In addition to his selection as Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year, Carriker was a First-team All-Big 12 pick by the [[Big 12]] Coaches and the [[Associated Press]].

The protocol can usually only be initiated by someone in a position of [[authority]]. Lockdowns can also be used to protect people inside a facility or, for example, a computing system, from a threat or other external event.

He was one of many murdered by Lieutenant [[Peter Handcock]] of the Bushveldt Carbineers, under the orders of [[Breaker Morant|Lieutenant Harry \"The Breaker\" Morant]].\n\n==Life==\n\nCarl August Daniel Heese was born on 24 February 1867 on the [[Amalienstein]] mission station near [[Ladismith]] in the then [[Cape Province|Cape Colony]], to Daniel Heese (1833&ndash;1905) and Emma Heese (1837&ndash;1910). Heese's parents were German missionaries ([[Lutheran Church]]) who came to [[South Africa]] in 1859. \n\nIn 1868 his father founded the Berlin Lutheran congregation in [[Riversdale]], Cape Colony. In 1880 Daniel Heese (senior) went on a visitation visit to [[Germany]] and took his sons Hans and Daniel with him; Daniel (junior) remained behind  in Germany where he completed his schooling and underwent training as a missionary in Berlin. On completion of his theological studies, reverend C.A.D. (Daniel) Heese  went to the [[Northern Transvaal]] where he was ordained as a missionary of the [[Berlin Missionary Society]].\n\n==Death==\nIn the week before his death, Rev. Heese escorted a sick friend, Mr. Craig, to the Swiss Mission Hospital at Elim, north of [[Fort Edward (South Africa)|Fort Edward]], for an operation.
