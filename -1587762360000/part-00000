In 1965, he received a Ph.D. in plasma physics from Columbia University, and spent 3 years as a post-doc fellow there. Eastlund became a staff member at the fusion office at the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (USAEC) in 1968. The USAEC recognized Eastlund's paper, \"The Fusion Torch\" co-authored with William C. Gough, with a Special Award in 1970. [[Scientific American]] magazine published a review of fusion programs by Eastland and Gough in 1971.<ref name=\"FPN\" />\n\nIn 1974, Eastlund left the USAEC and co-founded Fusion Systems Corporation, which focused on ultraviolet-based curing technology with applications in the packaging and manufacturing industry. Fusion Systems technology was used for fast-drying industrial requirements such as labels on Coors beer cans and furniture varnishes. The company sold in 1997 for $193 million.<ref name=\"FPN\" />\n\nIn 1979, Eastlund left Fusion Systems to become Vice President of Energy Research for BDM Corporation. Eastlund served as a member of the Board of Directors and also as treasurer at Fusion Power Associates. After leaving BDM, Eastlund worked for Atlantic Richfield Corporation. In 1987 he founded Production Technologies International Corporation and in 1996 he founded Eastlund Scientific Enterprises Corporation. In 2003, Eastlund was awarded a U.S. House of Representatives Certificate of Recognition for contributions to homeland security technology.<ref name=\"FPN\" />\n\nEastlund was in favor of funding research into [[weather modification]] and control that could reduce the impact of severe weather. He envisioned \"concepts for electromagnetic wave interactions with the atmosphere that, among a range of jobs, could be applied to weather modification research\" and that such research could mature to a new science in 10 or 20 years.<ref name=\"USA\">{{cite web|last1=David|first1=Leonard|title=Science and Space|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2005-10-31-military-weather_x.htm|website=USA Today|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nHe was active in [[astrophysics]], and later work included co-authoring papers regarding [[pulsar]]s and [[Gamma-ray burst|gamma bursters]] presented in the [[The Astrophysical Journal|Astrophysical Journal]] and at scientific symposiums.<ref>B\u00f6ttcher, M., Eastlund, B., & Miller, B. 1997, in Fourth Huntsville Gamma-Ray Burst Symp., ed.

Atomic Energy Commission]] for co-invention of the \"[[fusion torch]].\"<ref name=\"FPN\">{{cite web|title=In Memoriam: Bernard J. Eastlund|url=http://aries.pppl.gov/FPA/ARC07/fpn07-70.shtml|website=Fusion Power Associates|publisher=US Department of Energy Office of Fusion Energy Sciences|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nEastlund attended MIT, receiving a B.S Physics degree in 1960. In 1965, he received a Ph.D. in plasma physics from Columbia University, and spent 3 years as a post-doc fellow there. Eastlund became a staff member at the fusion office at the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (USAEC) in 1968. The USAEC recognized Eastlund's paper, \"The Fusion Torch\" co-authored with William C. Gough, with a Special Award in 1970. [[Scientific American]] magazine published a review of fusion programs by Eastland and Gough in 1971.<ref name=\"FPN\" />\n\nIn 1974, Eastlund left the USAEC and co-founded Fusion Systems Corporation, which focused on ultraviolet-based curing technology with applications in the packaging and manufacturing industry. Fusion Systems technology was used for fast-drying industrial requirements such as labels on Coors beer cans and furniture varnishes. The company sold in 1997 for $193 million.<ref name=\"FPN\" />\n\nIn 1979, Eastlund left Fusion Systems to become Vice President of Energy Research for BDM Corporation. Eastlund served as a member of the Board of Directors and also as treasurer at Fusion Power Associates. After leaving BDM, Eastlund worked for Atlantic Richfield Corporation. In 1987 he founded Production Technologies International Corporation and in 1996 he founded Eastlund Scientific Enterprises Corporation. In 2003, Eastlund was awarded a U.S. House of Representatives Certificate of Recognition for contributions to homeland security technology.<ref name=\"FPN\" />\n\nEastlund was in favor of funding research into [[weather modification]] and control that could reduce the impact of severe weather. He envisioned \"concepts for electromagnetic wave interactions with the atmosphere that, among a range of jobs, could be applied to weather modification research\" and that such research could mature to a new science in 10 or 20 years.<ref name=\"USA\">{{cite web|last1=David|first1=Leonard|title=Science and Space|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2005-10-31-military-weather_x.htm|website=USA Today|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=26 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nHe was active in [[astrophysics]], and later work included co-authoring papers regarding [[pulsar]]s and [[Gamma-ray burst|gamma bursters]] presented in the [[The Astrophysical Journal|Astrophysical Journal]] and at scientific symposiums.<ref>B\u00f6ttcher, M., Eastlund, B., & Miller, B. 1997, in Fourth Huntsville Gamma-Ray Burst Symp., ed.
