It also had great influence in [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]].\n\nThe family originated in [[Poitou]], near [[Lusignan (Vienne)|Lusignan]] in western France, in the early 10th century. By the end of the 11th century, the family had risen to become the most prominent petty lords in the region from their [[Ch\u00e2teau de Lusignan|castle at Lusignan]]. In the late 12th century, through marriages and inheritance, a cadet branch of the family came to control the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|kingdoms of Jerusalem]] and [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]].

''Saladin en Guy de Lusignan,'' 1625 painting by [[Jan Lievens]].]]\nIn the 1170s, [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric de Lusignan]] arrived in [[Jerusalem]], having been expelled by [[Richard I of England|Richard Lionheart]] (at that point, acting Duke of Aquitaine) from his realm, which then included the family lands of Lusignan near Poitiers. Amalric married Eschiva, the daughter of [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], and entered court circles.\n\nHe had also obtained the patronage of [[Agnes of Courtenay]], the divorced mother of King [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], who held the [[county of Jaffa and Ascalon]] and was married to [[Reginald of Sidon]]. He was appointed Agnes' constable in [[Jaffa]], and later as [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Constables|constable]] of the kingdom. Hostile rumours alleged he was Agnes' lover, but this is questionable. It is likely that his promotions were aimed at weaning him away from the political orbit of the [[Ibelin family]], who were associated with [[Raymond III of Tripoli]], [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]]'s cousin and the former [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Bailiffs|''bailli'' or regent]]. Amalric's younger brother, [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy de Lusignan]], arrived at some date before Easter 1180. When he arrived is quite unknown, although [[Ernoul]] said that he arrived at that time on Amalric's advice. Many modern historians believe that Guy was already well established in Jerusalem by 1180, but there is no supporting contemporary evidence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} But, Amalric of Lusignan's success certainly facilitated the social and political advancement of his brother Guy.\n\nOlder accounts (derived from [[William of Tyre]] and Ernoul) claim that Agnes was concerned that her political rivals, headed by Raymond of Tripoli, intended to exercise more control by forcing Agnes' daughter, the widowed princess [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], to marry someone of their choosing. Agnes was said to have foiled these plans by advising her son to have Sibylla married to Guy. But, the King, now believed to have been less malleable than earlier historians have portrayed, was considering the international implications: Sibylla had to marry someone who could rally external help to the kingdom, not a local noble. As the new King of France, [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], was still a minor, Baldwin's first cousin Henry II of England seemed the best prospect. He owed the Pope a penitential pilgrimage on account of the [[Thomas Becket]] affair. Guy was a vassal of Richard of Poitou and Henry II, and had been formerly rebellious, so they wanted to keep him overseas.\n\nGuy and Sibylla were hastily married at Eastertide 1180, apparently preventing a coup by Raymond's faction to marry her to Baldwin of Ibelin, the father-in-law of Almaric. By his marriage Guy became [[count of Jaffa and Ascalon]] and ''bailli'' of Jerusalem. He and Sibylla had two daughters, Alice and Maria. Sibylla already had a son from her first marriage to [[William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|William of Montferrat]].\n\n[[Image:Battle of Cresson.jpg|left|thumb|[[Battle of Hattin]] in which Guy de Lusignan was captured by Saladin, and Jerusalem was lost.]]\nAn ambitious man, Guy convinced Baldwin IV to name him regent in early 1182. But he and [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] provoked [[Saladin]] during a two-year period of truce. More important to Baldwin IV's disillusionment with him was Guy's military hesitation during the [[siege of Kerak]]. Throughout late 1183 and 1184 Baldwin IV tried to have his sister's marriage to Guy annulled, showing that Baldwin still held his sister with some favour. Baldwin IV had wanted a loyal brother-in-law, and was frustrated in Guy's hardheadedness and disobedience. Sibylla remained at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], though perhaps not against her will.\n\nUnsuccessful in prying his sister and close heir away from Guy, the king and the ''Haute Cour'' altered the succession. They placed [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]], Sibylla's son from her first marriage, in precedence over Sibylla. They also established a process to choose the monarch afterwards between Sibylla and Isabella (whom Baldwin and the Haute Cour thus recognized as at least equally entitled to succession as Sibylla), though Sibylla was not herself excluded from the succession. After the death of Baldwin V in 1186, Guy and Sibylla went to Jerusalem for the funeral, accompanied by an armed guard. Sibylla was crowned as Queen of Jerusalem, on the condition that she annul her marriage with Guy. In return she could marry whom she chose. Her decision to remarry Guy angered the barons.\n\n[[Image:Map Crusader states 1165-en.svg|thumb|Map of 12th-century Crusader States. The House of Lusignan at this time controlled the kingdom of Jerusalem, principality of Antioch, and the county of Tripoli.]]\nGuy's term as king is generally seen as a disaster; he was defeated by [[Saladin]] at the [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187, and was imprisoned in [[Damascus]] while Saladin reconquered almost the entire kingdom.\n\nUpon his release, Guy and Sibylla sought refuge in Tyre, but were denied entry by rival [[Conrad of Montferrat]], the husband of Isabella. During the [[Siege of Acre (1189)|Siege of Acre]] in 1191, Sibylla and their two daughters died. Isabella succeeded to the throne as the queen of Jerusalem. Guy left for Limassol and met with Richard, now [[king of England]]. He joined the latter's conquest of [[Cyprus]], which was retaliation for the lord of Cyprus having taken Richard's fianc\u00e9e as prisoner. Afterwards Richard and Guy returned to the siege of Acre. Richard gave up his claim to Jerusalem and supported Guy, while the King of France and Duke of Austria supported their kinsman Conrad. Guy still saved Conrad's life when he was surrounded by the enemy. Richard put the matter of the kingdom of Jerusalem to a vote, which Conrad won, leaving Guy powerless.\n\nRichard sold Cyprus to the [[Knight Templars]], who in turn sold it to Guy. Guy died in 1194, leaving Cyprus to his older brother Aimery. [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] crowned Aimery as the first king of Cyprus. In 1197 Aimery married Isabella, which brought the crown of Jerusalem back to the Lusignans. One of Aimery's first actions as king was to make a five-year truce with the Muslims.\n\n===In England===\n{{Main|Normandy campaigns of 1200\u20131204|Anglo-French War (1202\u20131214)|Second Barons' War}}\n\nMeanwhile, in France, Hugh le Brun (\"Hugh the Swarthy\"), like most of the lords of Poitou, backed [[Arthur of Brittany]] as the better heir to [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] when [[John of England|John Lackland]] acceded to the throne of England in 1199. [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] traded English claims for their support of John. To secure his position in La Marche, the widowed Hugh arranged a betrothal with the daughter of his next rival of Angoul\u00eame, [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]]. But John married her in August 1200, depriving Hugh of La Marche and his brother of [[Eu, Seine-Maritime|Eu]] in [[Normandy]].\n\nThe aggrieved Lusignans turned to their liege lord, [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]], King of France. Philip demanded John's presence\u2014a tactical impossibility\u2014and declared John a \"contumacious vassal.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} As the Lusignan allies managed to detain both Arthur and Eleanor, John surprised their unprepared forces at the castle of [[Mirebeau]] in July 1202, and took Hugh prisoner with 200 more of Poitou's fighting men. King John's savage treatment of the captives caused outrage among his supporters, and his French barons began to desert him in droves. The Lusignans' diplomatic rebellion resulted in the loss for England of half its territory in France. It was soon incorporated into France by Philip Augustus. (The other \"half\", Aquitaine, was the possession of the surviving Eleanor.) John died in 1216, leaving his son [[Henry III of England]] as king. Isabella married [[Hugh X of Lusignan]] in 1220, and they had five children together.\n\nIn 1247, Guilliame de Lusignan, a younger son of Hugh X and Isabella, moved from France to England along with two of his brothers at the request of their half-brother, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. Guillaume (known in English as [[William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William de Valence]]) and his brothers were quickly placed in positions of power by the king; William was married to Joan de Munchensi (d. 1307), a granddaughter and heiress to the great [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]]. Valence was granted custody of the lands and the title of [[Earl of Pembroke]], giving him great wealth and power in his new land. As a result, he was unpopular, and was heavily involved in the [[Second Barons' War]], supporting the King and [[Edward I of England|Prince Edward]] against the rebels led by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]. After the final defeat of the rebels at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265, William continued to serve Henry III, and then Edward I, until his death in 1296.\n\nWilliam's eldest surviving son, [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer]] (c. 1265\u20131324), succeeded to his father's estates, but he was not formally recognized as Earl of Pembroke until after the death of his mother Joan in 1307. He was appointed guardian of [[Scotland]] in 1306, but with the accession of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] to the throne and the consequent rise of [[Piers Gaveston]] to power, his influence declined. He became prominent among the discontented nobles. In 1312, after the [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] betrayed him by executing the captured Gaveston, Aymer de Valence left the allied lords and joined the King. Valence was present at [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] in 1314, and later helped King Edward defeat [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas of Lancaster]]. However, by the time of his death in 1324, he had again been marginalized at court, and also suffered financial trouble. His wife, [[Marie de St Pol|Mary de Ch\u00e2tillon]], a descendant of King Henry III, was the founder of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], reserved for male students.  She also founded Denny Abbey, between Cambridge and Ely, where she spent her last days surrounded by nuns.\n\n===Kings of Cyprus===\n{{Main|War of the Lombards}}\n{{History of Cyprus}}\n\nAfter another six-year truce with the Muslims, Aimery and most of the royal family died. His only surviving son, [[Hugh I of Cyprus|Hugh]], became King of Cyprus in 1205. The kingdom of Jerusalem passed to [[Maria of Montferrat]], eldest daughter of Isabella and Conrad. Hugh married his step-sister, [[Alice of Champagne]], daughter of Isabella and Henry of Champagne. They had three children. Henry, the youngest child and only son, became king in 1218 at eight months of age; Alice officially served as his [[regent]]. Her uncle Phillip of Ibelin exercised the real power behind the throne, followed by his brother [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut]].\n\nHenry was crowned at the age of 8 at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]], in 1225.<ref>Runciman, p. 180</ref> His uncle arranged the  early coronation in a political maneuver intended to outflank [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] expected attempt to seize power. Frederick succeeded in 1228 in forcing John of Ibelin to hand over the regency and the island of Cyprus. But, when Frederick left the island in April, John counter-attacked and regained control, which began the [[War of the Lombards]]. Henry assumed  control of the kingdom when he came of age at 15, in 1232. He became regent of Jerusalem, in 1246, for the infant [[Conrad IV of Germany]], serving as ruler until 1253. Henry was married three times and had only one child, a son Hugh. The boy succeeded him upon his death in 1253, although he was only two months of age. Hugh died in 1267 at age 14, bringing an end to the first House of Lusignan.\n\n==Second House of Lusignan==\n{{History of Armenia}}\n\n[[Image:Hugues de Lusignan bassin 14th century.jpg|left|thumb|Basin attributed to a commission by [[Hugh IV of Cyprus]].

He succeeded his deceased cousin as King of Cyprus. In 1268, following the execution of [[Conradin]], he was crowned King of Jerusalem. Hugh was frustrated by dealing with the different factions of Jerusalem nobles, and in 1276 he left for Cyprus. Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote ''On Kingship'' for Hugh.\n\nIn 1284 his son John succeeded him as king of Cyprus and Jerusalem, but died one year later. John is believed to have been poisoned by his brother, [[Henry II of Jerusalem|Henry]]. In 1291 the last remnants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem were captured by [[Al-Ashraf Khalil]], the Sultan of Egypt. Henry fled to Cyprus and under his rule, that kingdom prospered. He had the \"Haute Cour\" keep written records for the first time in their history, and developed them from a simple advisory council into a true court that tried criminals. His goal of reclaiming Jerusalem went unfulfilled, despite alliances with Persia and twice requesting [[Pope Clement V]] for assistance.\n\nKing Henry suffered from [[epilepsy]], which incapacitated him at times. Some of the nobles grew unhappy with his rule, and he had his brother, Guy, the Constable of Cyprus, executed for conspiring against him. Their brother [[Almaric, Prince of Tyre|Almaric]], the Prince of Tyre, overthrew him with help from the [[Knights Templar]]. The revolt was quick and non-violent. Almaric became regent of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and Henry was exiled to [[Armenia]]. There he was imprisoned by Almaric's brother-in-law King [[Oshin of Armenia|Oshin]]. Amalric repaired relationships with Venice, Genoa, and the Knights Hospitallers, and became popular among the people.\n\nIn 1300, the Lusignans, led by [[Amalric, Prince of Tyre]] entered into [[Franco-Mongol alliance|combined military operations with the Mongols]] under [[Ghazan]] to retake the [[Holy Land]], but without success. In 1307 Pope Clement, under pressure from king [[Philip IV of France]] ordered that all Templars be arrested and their properties seized, leaving Amalric no choice but to comply. This led to a small uprising and calls for Henry to retake the throne, but it quickly subsided. Among those arrested were several nobles, including two members of the Ibelin family. Amalric was murdered in 1310 by Simon of Montolif. After this King Oshin released Henry II. With the aid of the Hospitallers, Henry regained his throne. Those who had helped Amalric were arrested, including their brother Aimery, who was acting governor following Amalric's murder.\n\n===Kings of Armenia===\n[[Image:Constantin5Armenie.jpg|left|thumb|[[Constantin III of Armenia]] on his throne. \"Les chevaliers de Saint-Jean-de-Jerusalem r\u00e9tablissant la religion en Arm\u00e9nie\", 1844 painting by [[Henri Delaborde (painter)|Henri Delaborde]].]]\n1342, Amalric's son, [[Constantine II, King of Armenia|Guy de Lusignan]], was elected <!-- by whom? --> as King of Armenia and took the name Constantine II. He was initially reluctant as the regent, [[Oshin of Corycos]], was rumored to have poisoned the previous king, and killed Guy's mother and two brothers. Under his leadership, the Lusignans tried to impose Western Catholicism and the European way of life on the Armenian people, who had a state religion of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. The Armenian leadership largely accepted Catholicism,  but the peasantry opposed the changes. Eventually, this led civil strife.<ref name=\"Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume II\">{{cite book | last = Kurdoghlian | first = Mihran | title = Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume II | publisher = Hradaragoutioun Azkayin Oussoumnagan Khorhourti |year= 1996 | location = Athens, Greece | pages = 29\u201356|language=hy}}</ref> Constantine was killed in an uprising in 1344, and the throne passed out of the Lusignan family to his distant cousin [[Constantine III, King of Armenia|Gosdantin]]; he reigned as Constantine III. Constantine III attempted to kill his cousins, in an attempt to eliminate all potential claimants, but they fled to Cyprus.\n\n===Golden Age of Lusignan Cyprus===\n{{Main|Alexandrian Crusade}}\n\n[[Hugh IV of Cyprus|Hugh IV de Lusignan]] became king at age 29, and unlike previous Lusignan monarchs he was content being just King of Cyprus, refusing his son Peter's requests to lead a crusade for Jerusalem. He instead preferred to focus on issues in his realm and was strict on justice. When Peter and his third son John journeyed to Europe he had the man who helped them tortured and hanged, and sent ships to find and imprison his sons. He had a strong interest in art, literature and philosophy, hosting regular philosophical discussions at his summer villa in Lapithos and commissioned Genealogia deorum gentilium by the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio. In 1347 Prince [[Peter I of Cyprus|Peter de Lusignan]] founded the Chivalric Order of the Sword, whose motto was ''Pour Lealte Maintenir'' the motto of his house.\n\nIn 1358 Hugh abdicated the throne, passing it on to his military minded son Peter instead of his grandson Hugh, the heir apparent. Peter believed that since Cyprus was the last Christian stronghold in the mideast it was his duty to fight the Muslims, and raided the coastal ports of the Asia Minor. The people of Korikos asked for protection from the Muslims. Peter sent his kinsman, Sir Roberto de Lusignan to lead the siege of Korikos. The Lusignans succeeded, and the various Muslim leaders united against Peter, launching an assault on Cyprus. Peter united Knights of Saint John from Rhodes, Papal armies, and Mediterranean pirates to defeat the Muslim fleets before they could land. After another defeat at Antalya the remaining emirs in the region offered him tribute, and he accepted, sending the flags, coats of arms, and other symbols of his house to be raised in different cities. Peter personally visited many of the cities he conquered, where he was given trophies, gifts, and was even worshiped by some.\n\nWhen Peter returned to Cyprus he was in risk of losing his throne. Hugh, his nephew who had previously been the heir apparent, went to [[Pope Urban V]] in an attempt to be recognized as king. Peter journeyed to [[Avignon]] to present his case. Urban sided with Peter, but Hugh was given a high annual benefit as recompense. Peter also discussed another crusade with the pope, and then decided to visit the other kings and rulers of Europe to strengthen his army. He visited Germany, France, and England, where the famed \"[[Banquet of the Five Kings]]\" took place. In 1363 Peter attended the [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w]], hosted by King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir the Great]] of Poland. In attendance were [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], King [[Louis I of Hungary]], the [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]], and other lords and princes. Among the issues discussed were Peter's crusade, peace treaties between the kings, and the succession for the Polish throne. While there Peter won a royal tournament, adding to his prestige.\n\n[[Image:Assassinat Pierre de Lusignan, roi de Chypre.jpg|thumb|The assassination of [[Peter I of Cyprus|Peter]]. \"Assassinat Pierre de Lusignan, roi de Chypre\", 15th-century painting by Jean Froissart.]]\n\nWhile Peter was attempting to launch another crusade and gaining recognition, his brother Prince [[John of Lusignan|John]] ruled as vice-king in Cyprus and faced many challenges. There was an epidemic in 1363 which resulted in the death of many Cypriots, including their sister Eschiva. The Turks heard that the people of Cyprus were dying and took advantage by raiding and pillaging the villages. During this time there were also conflicts between the Genose navies docked at [[Famagusta]] and the native Cypriots. Peter was in Genoa at the time and negotiated peace. He failed to gain the support of the major rulers but set off on a [[Alexandrian Crusade|crusade]] with what men he had. He sacked the city of [[Alexandria]], but was prevented from moving on to [[Cairo]], and succeeded only in angering the Sultan. Peter moved on to [[Beirut]], [[Tripoli]], and in 1368 attempted once again to unite Europe in a crusade. Pope Urban V instead had Peter make peace with the Sultan of Egypt, who was attacking Christian ships in retaliation for Peter's crusade. The increased commerce under Peter's reign led to Famagusta becoming one of the wealthiest cities of its time. It became renowned as a place where the rich could live in lavish surroundings.\n\nWhile on one of his visits to Rome Peter received word that the barons of Armenia wanted him as king. He returned to Cyprus to find that his queen had been unfaithful while he was away, and he tyrannized all nobles she showed favor to, including his brothers. In 1369 Peter was assassinated while in bed by three of his own knights. During his reign he was known as the epitome of chivalry, and was the greatest king of the Lusignan dynasty. He was succeeded by his 12-year-old son, Peter II.\n\nPeter's brother John served as regent for 12-year-old Peter II. John's appointment was opposed by many, especially Peter's wife Eleanor of Aragon, who suspected John of arranging the assassination.  Vowing revenge, Eleanor asked for military aid from Europe in order to punish Peter I's murderers. The Genoese agreed, and invaded in 1373, which led to them capturing Famagusta, the most important port in the region. Peter II recalled forces from cities along the Asian Minor to defend Cyprus, resulting in their loss. He signed a treaty with the Genoese, one of the conditions being that his uncle, James, the youngest brother of his father Peter I, be exiled from Cyprus. This ended the war, but James was captured by the Genoese in Rhodes and held captive in Genoa. After the war Eleanor finally killed Prince John, still under the belief he had murdered her husband. Peter II signed a peace treaty with the Sultan of Egypt, and died in 1382 at Nicosia.\n\nThe Parliament of Cyprus decided that James I of Cyprus was to succeed as the new king. Unfortunately James was still a captive of the Genoese. While in captivity he had wed Helvis of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and had 12 children. After agreeing to give the Genoese more rights in Cyprus, he was released. While he was away Cyprus was governed by a council of 12 nobles. Some of the nobles opposed his return, led by the brothers Perotte and Vilmonde de Montolivve, who wished to be kings themselves. In 1385 James returned again, and succeeded, being crowned in Nicosia. In 1388 he was crowned king of Jerusalem, and in 1393, following the death of his cousin Leon of Armenia (Leon V of Lusignan, also called Leo V or Levon), he was crowned king of Armenia. James died in 1398, and was succeeded by his son Janus.\n\n===Fall of Armenia===\n[[Image:LeonVCouventDesCelestins.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Leon V of Armenia|Leo V]], last king of Armenia, in the [[Couvent des C\u00e9lestins]], [[Paris]].

The New Armenia 12 (11-12): 168\u20139.</ref>]]\nAfter the death of his kinsman, [[Constantine IV]] sought an alliance with the Sultan of Egypt, whom Peter had made an enemy. This angered the barons of Armenia, who feared annexation by the sultan, and in 1373 Constantine IV was murdered. In 1374, [[Leon V of Armenia|Leon V de Lusignan]] was crowned King of Armenia. He was raised in Cyprus after having fled Constantine III, and while there he became a knight in the Order of the Sword, which was founded by King Peter I. In 1375, Armenia was invaded by the [[Mameluks]] and Leon was forced to surrender, putting an end to the last fully independent Armenian entity of the Middle Ages after three centuries of sovereignty. The title was claimed by his cousin, [[James I of Cyprus]], uniting it with the titles of Cyprus and Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume II\"/> Leon and his family were held captive in Cairo for several years, until King [[John I of Castile]] ransomed him and made him Lord of Madrid. He died in Paris in 1393 after trying and failing to gather support for another crusade.\n\n===Kings of Jerusalem, Cyprus, and Armenia===\n\nJanus, [[James I of Cyprus|son of James I and Helvis]], married Charlotte de Bourbon and their marriage was described as a \"cornerstone in the revitalisation of French culture in the Lusignan court that characterised Janus's rule\".<ref>Andr\u00e9e Giselle Simard, ''The Manuscript Torino J.II.9: A Late Medieval Perspective on Musical Life and Culture at the Court of the Lusignan Kings at Nicosia'', pp.35-36, December 2005, retrieved on 15 June 2009</ref>\nCharlotte died on 15 January 1422 of the plague. She was buried in the Royal Monastery of Saint Dominic's in Nicosia. Her many descendants included Queen Charlotte of Cyprus, Queen Jeanne III of Navarre; French Kings Charles VIII, Francis I, Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX, Henry III, Henry IV and the subsequent Bourbon kings; Anne of France, and Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nAs king Janus tried to take back Famagusta, which was still held by the Genoese, but was thwarted by conspirators. In 1403, the governor of Genoa, de Mengre, had talks with Janus' representative Giorgio Billi which ended in an agreement by which the cities remained under Genoese hands. Later, he forced the Cypriot people to pay special taxes to assemble an army and siege machines, and he besieged Famagusta for three years but in vain, since there was access from the sea to the city. In 1406 the siege ended and the Genoese tried to occupy [[Limassol]], but were defeated.\n\nTwo years later, the island was affected by epidemics. Simultaneously, there were many raids of locusts on the island, which caused destruction to agriculture. A new epidemic arrived in 1419\u201320, which probably caused the death of Janus' second wife, Charlotte on 15 January 1422. Because the king was very distraught about her death, the body of the dead queen was moved out of the palace where her funeral was, in order to not be seen by Janus.\n\nMeanwhile, because Cyprus was still a permanent base of campaign for pirates and adventurers, after raids around the Cypriot coasts, Janus had repeated discussions with the Sultan of Egypt via the sultan's representatives. Janus was unable to stop the raids, which gave the Muslims a reason to attack Cyprus. Cypriot nobles and officials of the kingdom participated in the raids.\n\n[[Barsbay]], the [[Sultan of Egypt]], sent military forces to Cyprus several times. A small force, around 1424, attacked Limassol, and in 1425 the Egyptian army attacked Famagusta and then pillaged [[Larnaca]] together with the nearby area, including Kiti, [[Dromolaxia]], Kellia, [[Aradippou]] and Agrinou. After Larnaca, they went to Limassol, which was also sacked, including the [[Kolossi Castle|city's castle]].\n\nIn the summer of 1426, the [[Mamluk]]s launched a large-scale attack against the island. Led by Tangriver Mohamed and Inal el Kakimi, their army contained over 3,000 men and included Mamliks, [[Turkish people|Turks]] and Arabs and arrived at the island with 180 ships near Avdimou. Limassol was again occupied. Janus mustered his army and moved from Nicosia to Limassol. He asked in vain for help from the forces in Europe: the Genoese were his enemies, and the Venetians and others did not want to destroy commercial relations with the sultan.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Chirokitia]] (7 July 1426) against the Mamluks, King Janus was captured by the [[Egypt]]ian forces. He was ransomed after ten months of captivity in [[Cairo]]. During his captivity his brother [[Hugues Lancelot de Lusignan|Hugh of Lusignan]], [[Archbishop of Nicosia]], took charge of Cyprus.\n\nAfter their victory, the Mamluks pillaged Larnaca again and then Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus. The royal family retreated to fortified Kyrenia and were rescued. The invaders took a great deal of loot and captives before they left the island.\n\nThat disaster, together with the previous raids, the war operations of Janus against Genoese, the epidemics and the invasion of locusts, caused the Cypriot serfs to revolt, as they suffered from living in conditions of utter poverty. The leader of the Cypriot revolutionaries was Alexis, whom they declared as king in Lefkoniko. The revolution was widespread supported by much of the population, who elected their own leaders in many places of Cyprus.\n\nMeanwhile, Janus was humiliated in Cairo: they took him, tied up with chains and riding a donkey, in front of the sultan. He was forced to kneel and worship nine times the soil on which the sultan stepped. Europeans mediated in the case, obtaining the release of Janus after collecting sufficient monies for the required ransoms. Cyprus also had to offer the sultan an annual tax based on income from 5,000 duchies. This tax continued to be paid even after the end of Frankish rule in Cyprus. Together with Janus, some of the captives bought their freedom after their families collected money for ransoms. Those who remained as captives were sold as slaves.\n\nWhile Janus was captive in Cyprus, the nobles and the royal family members were trying to gain his release, while dealing with Alexis' rebellion. With help from Europe, the rebellion was repressed after 10 months. The rebels' leader was arrested and, after terrible tortures, was executed in Nicosia on 12 May 1427, the same day that King Janus arrived in [[Paphos]] from Cairo. He died in 1432 and was succeeded by his son [[John II of Cyprus|John]].\n\n[[Image:Eastern Mediterranean 1450.svg|thumb|After the fall of Armenian Cilicia, Lusignan-controlled Cyprus was the only Christian state in the Middle East.]]\nJohn married [[Amadea Palaiologina of Monferrato]]; she died in 1440. After this he married [[Helena Palaiologina]], the granddaughter of [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Manuel II Palaeologus]]. They had two daughters, the eldest of which, [[Charlotte, Queen of Cyprus|Charlotte]], would succeed him as ruler of Cyprus. He also had an illegitimate son, [[James II of Cyprus|James]], by his mistress [[Marietta de Patras]]. James was made Archbishop of Nicosia at age 16, but was stripped of his title after murdering the Royal [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]]. John eventually forgave him, and appeared to be ready to name James as his successor, but died in 1458 before doing so. He was succeeded by his daughter Charlotte.\n\nCharlotte's reign was troubled and brief. She succeeded in building an alliance with the Genoese, via her marriage to [[Louis of Savoy, Count of Geneva]], but it proved futile. Her half-brother James made an alliance with the sultanate of Egypt [[Sayf ad-Din Inal]]. Their combined forces recaptured Famagusta for the Lusignans, and their blockade forced Charlotte to stay in the castle of [[Kyrenia]] for three years. In 1463 she and Louis fled Cyprus for Rome, where they were welcomed by [[Pope Pius II]].\n\nJames was crowned king and married [[Catherine Cornaro]] in 1468 to establish an alliance with [[Venice]]. In 1472 Catherine arrived in Cyprus, and James died several months later under suspicious circumstances. Their son [[James III of Cyprus]] died at one year of age, bringing an end to the Lusignan kingdoms. However, the last member of the dynasty was Queen Charlotte, who died on 16 July, 1487, in Rome.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fileti|first=F.|title=I Lusignan di Cipro|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Florence|pages=79}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n{{Quote|text=...the Lusignans also accumulated an impressive array of titles that extended their influence almost as far and wide as the Roman emperors had done.|sign=Paul Sire|source=King Arthur's European Realm: New Evidence from Monmouth's Primary Sources<ref>Sire, Paul ''King Arthur's European Realm: New Evidence from Monmouth's Primary Sources''. 2014, McFarland p. 182 0786478012</ref>}}\n\nBesides the Cypriot branch, through the acts of the Count of Poitiers, Alphonse de Poitiers, by the 18th century the domains of Lusignans were divided among a number of other branches :\n* Lusignan-Lezay\n* Lusignan-Vouvant\n* Lusignan-Cognac\n* Lusignan-Jarnac (the Counts d'Eu)\n* Lusignan-Sidon\n* The principal branch retains Lusignan and the County of La Marche\nTwo of the Lusignan domains in France were erected into feudal Marquisates in 1618 and 1722 by Kings Louis XIII and Louis XV respectively.<ref>''\n''Dictionnaire des Titres et des terres titr\u00e9es en France sous l'ancien r\u00e9gime\u00bb, Eric Thiou, \u00c9ditions M\u00e9moire et Documents, Versailles, 2003</ref>\n\n===\"Prince\" de Lusignan ===\nIn 1880, a former [[Maronite]] priest Kafta declared that his wife Marie was a descendant of [[Guy de Lusignan]] and styled her Princess of Lusignan of Cyprus, of Jerusalem and of Armenia.

In the legend Melusine was exiled from Avalon and doomed to turn into a serpent from the waist down every Saturday. One day a prince, Raymondin of Poitou, came across her in the woods. He had just killed his uncle in a hunting accident and was distraught. Melusine helped him with this, and he later returned seeking her out. He proposed marriage, and she agreed on the condition that she be left alone every Saturday.\n\nRaymondin agreed, and together they had ten children, founding the dynasty. They built the Ch\u00e2teau de Lusignan in 15 days, naming it after Melusine. One day Raymondin's brothers asked why she disappeared every Saturday, and Raymondin said that it was a condition of their marriage. One brother spied through the door, and saw Melusine bathing. She was a serpent, or according to some sources, a mermaid, from waist down. He told Raymondin of this, and when Melusine was confronted she wept at the betrayal, turned into a dragon, and flew away. She would fly over the castle whenever a new Lusignan became lord. It is for this reason that a mermaid is the Lusignan crest and dragons were their supporters.<ref>* Richardson, Douglas (2011).

It also had great influence in [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]].\n\nThe family originated in [[Poitou]], near [[Lusignan (Vienne)|Lusignan]] in western France, in the early 10th century. By the end of the 11th century, the family had risen to become the most prominent petty lords in the region from their [[Ch\u00e2teau de Lusignan|castle at Lusignan]]. In the late 12th century, through marriages and inheritance, a cadet branch of the family came to control the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|kingdoms of Jerusalem]] and [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]].

''Saladin en Guy de Lusignan,'' 1625 painting by [[Jan Lievens]].]]\nIn the 1170s, [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Amalric de Lusignan]] arrived in [[Jerusalem]], having been expelled by [[Richard I of England|Richard Lionheart]] (at that point, acting Duke of Aquitaine) from his realm, which then included the family lands of Lusignan near Poitiers. Amalric married Eschiva, the daughter of [[Baldwin of Ibelin]], and entered court circles.\n\nHe had also obtained the patronage of [[Agnes of Courtenay]], the divorced mother of King [[Baldwin IV of Jerusalem|Baldwin IV]], who held the [[county of Jaffa and Ascalon]] and was married to [[Reginald of Sidon]]. He was appointed Agnes' constable in [[Jaffa]], and later as [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Constables|constable]] of the kingdom. Hostile rumours alleged he was Agnes' lover, but this is questionable. It is likely that his promotions were aimed at weaning him away from the political orbit of the [[Ibelin family]], who were associated with [[Raymond III of Tripoli]], [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric I]]'s cousin and the former [[Officers of the Kingdom of Jerusalem#Bailiffs|''bailli'' or regent]]. Amalric's younger brother, [[Guy of Lusignan|Guy de Lusignan]], arrived at some date before Easter 1180. When he arrived is quite unknown, although [[Ernoul]] said that he arrived at that time on Amalric's advice. Many modern historians believe that Guy was already well established in Jerusalem by 1180, but there is no supporting contemporary evidence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} But, Amalric of Lusignan's success certainly facilitated the social and political advancement of his brother Guy.\n\nOlder accounts (derived from [[William of Tyre]] and Ernoul) claim that Agnes was concerned that her political rivals, headed by Raymond of Tripoli, intended to exercise more control by forcing Agnes' daughter, the widowed princess [[Sibylla of Jerusalem|Sibylla]], to marry someone of their choosing. Agnes was said to have foiled these plans by advising her son to have Sibylla married to Guy. But, the King, now believed to have been less malleable than earlier historians have portrayed, was considering the international implications: Sibylla had to marry someone who could rally external help to the kingdom, not a local noble. As the new King of France, [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], was still a minor, Baldwin's first cousin Henry II of England seemed the best prospect. He owed the Pope a penitential pilgrimage on account of the [[Thomas Becket]] affair. Guy was a vassal of Richard of Poitou and Henry II, and had been formerly rebellious, so they wanted to keep him overseas.\n\nGuy and Sibylla were hastily married at Eastertide 1180, apparently preventing a coup by Raymond's faction to marry her to Baldwin of Ibelin, the father-in-law of Almaric. By his marriage Guy became [[count of Jaffa and Ascalon]] and ''bailli'' of Jerusalem. He and Sibylla had two daughters, Alice and Maria. Sibylla already had a son from her first marriage to [[William of Montferrat, Count of Jaffa and Ascalon|William of Montferrat]].\n\n[[Image:Battle of Cresson.jpg|left|thumb|[[Battle of Hattin]] in which Guy de Lusignan was captured by Saladin, and Jerusalem was lost.]]\nAn ambitious man, Guy convinced Baldwin IV to name him regent in early 1182. But he and [[Raynald of Ch\u00e2tillon]] provoked [[Saladin]] during a two-year period of truce. More important to Baldwin IV's disillusionment with him was Guy's military hesitation during the [[siege of Kerak]]. Throughout late 1183 and 1184 Baldwin IV tried to have his sister's marriage to Guy annulled, showing that Baldwin still held his sister with some favour. Baldwin IV had wanted a loyal brother-in-law, and was frustrated in Guy's hardheadedness and disobedience. Sibylla remained at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], though perhaps not against her will.\n\nUnsuccessful in prying his sister and close heir away from Guy, the king and the ''Haute Cour'' altered the succession. They placed [[Baldwin V of Jerusalem|Baldwin V]], Sibylla's son from her first marriage, in precedence over Sibylla. They also established a process to choose the monarch afterwards between Sibylla and Isabella (whom Baldwin and the Haute Cour thus recognized as at least equally entitled to succession as Sibylla), though Sibylla was not herself excluded from the succession. After the death of Baldwin V in 1186, Guy and Sibylla went to Jerusalem for the funeral, accompanied by an armed guard. Sibylla was crowned as Queen of Jerusalem, on the condition that she annul her marriage with Guy. In return she could marry whom she chose. Her decision to remarry Guy angered the barons.\n\n[[Image:Map Crusader states 1165-en.svg|thumb|Map of 12th-century Crusader States. The House of Lusignan at this time controlled the kingdom of Jerusalem, principality of Antioch, and the county of Tripoli.]]\nGuy's term as king is generally seen as a disaster; he was defeated by [[Saladin]] at the [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187, and was imprisoned in [[Damascus]] while Saladin reconquered almost the entire kingdom.\n\nUpon his release, Guy and Sibylla sought refuge in Tyre, but were denied entry by rival [[Conrad of Montferrat]], the husband of Isabella. During the [[Siege of Acre (1189)|Siege of Acre]] in 1191, Sibylla and their two daughters died. Isabella succeeded to the throne as the queen of Jerusalem. Guy left for Limassol and met with Richard, now [[king of England]]. He joined the latter's conquest of [[Cyprus]], which was retaliation for the lord of Cyprus having taken Richard's fianc\u00e9e as prisoner. Afterwards Richard and Guy returned to the siege of Acre. Richard gave up his claim to Jerusalem and supported Guy, while the King of France and Duke of Austria supported their kinsman Conrad. Guy still saved Conrad's life when he was surrounded by the enemy. Richard put the matter of the kingdom of Jerusalem to a vote, which Conrad won, leaving Guy powerless.\n\nRichard sold Cyprus to the [[Knight Templars]], who in turn sold it to Guy. Guy died in 1194, leaving Cyprus to his older brother Aimery. [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] crowned Aimery as the first king of Cyprus. In 1197 Aimery married Isabella, which brought the crown of Jerusalem back to the Lusignans. One of Aimery's first actions as king was to make a five-year truce with the Muslims.\n\n===In England===\n{{Main|Normandy campaigns of 1200\u20131204|Anglo-French War (1202\u20131214)|Second Barons' War}}\n\nMeanwhile, in France, Hugh le Brun (\"Hugh the Swarthy\"), like most of the lords of Poitou, backed [[Arthur of Brittany]] as the better heir to [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] when [[John of England|John Lackland]] acceded to the throne of England in 1199. [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] traded English claims for their support of John. To secure his position in La Marche, the widowed Hugh arranged a betrothal with the daughter of his next rival of Angoul\u00eame, [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame]]. But John married her in August 1200, depriving Hugh of La Marche and his brother of [[Eu, Seine-Maritime|Eu]] in [[Normandy]].\n\nThe aggrieved Lusignans turned to their liege lord, [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]], King of France. Philip demanded John's presence\u2014a tactical impossibility\u2014and declared John a \"contumacious vassal.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} As the Lusignan allies managed to detain both Arthur and Eleanor, John surprised their unprepared forces at the castle of [[Mirebeau]] in July 1202, and took Hugh prisoner with 200 more of Poitou's fighting men. King John's savage treatment of the captives caused outrage among his supporters, and his French barons began to desert him in droves. The Lusignans' diplomatic rebellion resulted in the loss for England of half its territory in France. It was soon incorporated into France by Philip Augustus. (The other \"half\", Aquitaine, was the possession of the surviving Eleanor.) John died in 1216, leaving his son [[Henry III of England]] as king. Isabella married [[Hugh X of Lusignan]] in 1220, and they had five children together.\n\nIn 1247, Guilliame de Lusignan, a younger son of Hugh X and Isabella, moved from France to England along with two of his brothers at the request of their half-brother, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]]. Guillaume (known in English as [[William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William de Valence]]) and his brothers were quickly placed in positions of power by the king; William was married to Joan de Munchensi (d. 1307), a granddaughter and heiress to the great [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke]]. Valence was granted custody of the lands and the title of [[Earl of Pembroke]], giving him great wealth and power in his new land. As a result, he was unpopular, and was heavily involved in the [[Second Barons' War]], supporting the King and [[Edward I of England|Prince Edward]] against the rebels led by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]. After the final defeat of the rebels at the [[Battle of Evesham]] in 1265, William continued to serve Henry III, and then Edward I, until his death in 1296.\n\nWilliam's eldest surviving son, [[Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Aymer]] (c. 1265\u20131324), succeeded to his father's estates, but he was not formally recognized as Earl of Pembroke until after the death of his mother Joan in 1307. He was appointed guardian of [[Scotland]] in 1306, but with the accession of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] to the throne and the consequent rise of [[Piers Gaveston]] to power, his influence declined. He became prominent among the discontented nobles. In 1312, after the [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]] betrayed him by executing the captured Gaveston, Aymer de Valence left the allied lords and joined the King. Valence was present at [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] in 1314, and later helped King Edward defeat [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas of Lancaster]]. However, by the time of his death in 1324, he had again been marginalized at court, and also suffered financial trouble. His wife, [[Marie de St Pol|Mary de Ch\u00e2tillon]], a descendant of King Henry III, was the founder of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], reserved for male students.  She also founded Denny Abbey, between Cambridge and Ely, where she spent her last days surrounded by nuns.\n\n===Kings of Cyprus===\n{{Main|War of the Lombards}}\n{{History of Cyprus}}\n\nAfter another six-year truce with the Muslims, Aimery and most of the royal family died. His only surviving son, [[Hugh I of Cyprus|Hugh]], became King of Cyprus in 1205. The kingdom of Jerusalem passed to [[Maria of Montferrat]], eldest daughter of Isabella and Conrad. Hugh married his step-sister, [[Alice of Champagne]], daughter of Isabella and Henry of Champagne. They had three children. Henry, the youngest child and only son, became king in 1218 at eight months of age; Alice officially served as his [[regent]]. Her uncle Phillip of Ibelin exercised the real power behind the throne, followed by his brother [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut]].\n\nHenry was crowned at the age of 8 at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]], in 1225.<ref>Runciman, p. 180</ref> His uncle arranged the  early coronation in a political maneuver intended to outflank [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] expected attempt to seize power. Frederick succeeded in 1228 in forcing John of Ibelin to hand over the regency and the island of Cyprus. But, when Frederick left the island in April, John counter-attacked and regained control, which began the [[War of the Lombards]]. Henry assumed  control of the kingdom when he came of age at 15, in 1232. He became regent of Jerusalem, in 1246, for the infant [[Conrad IV of Germany]], serving as ruler until 1253. Henry was married three times and had only one child, a son Hugh. The boy succeeded him upon his death in 1253, although he was only two months of age. Hugh died in 1267 at age 14, bringing an end to the first House of Lusignan.\n\n==Second House of Lusignan==\n{{History of Armenia}}\n\n[[Image:Hugues de Lusignan bassin 14th century.jpg|left|thumb|Basin attributed to a commission by [[Hugh IV of Cyprus]].

He succeeded his deceased cousin as King of Cyprus. In 1268, following the execution of [[Conradin]], he was crowned King of Jerusalem. Hugh was frustrated by dealing with the different factions of Jerusalem nobles, and in 1276 he left for Cyprus. Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote ''On Kingship'' for Hugh.\n\nIn 1284 his son John succeeded him as king of Cyprus and Jerusalem, but died one year later. John is believed to have been poisoned by his brother, [[Henry II of Jerusalem|Henry]]. In 1291 the last remnants of the Kingdom of Jerusalem were captured by [[Al-Ashraf Khalil]], the Sultan of Egypt. Henry fled to Cyprus and under his rule, that kingdom prospered. He had the \"Haute Cour\" keep written records for the first time in their history, and developed them from a simple advisory council into a true court that tried criminals. His goal of reclaiming Jerusalem went unfulfilled, despite alliances with Persia and twice requesting [[Pope Clement V]] for assistance.\n\nKing Henry suffered from [[epilepsy]], which incapacitated him at times. Some of the nobles grew unhappy with his rule, and he had his brother, Guy, the Constable of Cyprus, executed for conspiring against him. Their brother [[Almaric, Prince of Tyre|Almaric]], the Prince of Tyre, overthrew him with help from the [[Knights Templar]]. The revolt was quick and non-violent. Almaric became regent of Cyprus and Jerusalem, and Henry was exiled to [[Armenia]]. There he was imprisoned by Almaric's brother-in-law King [[Oshin of Armenia|Oshin]]. Amalric repaired relationships with Venice, Genoa, and the Knights Hospitallers, and became popular among the people.\n\nIn 1300, the Lusignans, led by [[Amalric, Prince of Tyre]] entered into [[Franco-Mongol alliance|combined military operations with the Mongols]] under [[Ghazan]] to retake the [[Holy Land]], but without success. In 1307 Pope Clement, under pressure from king [[Philip IV of France]] ordered that all Templars be arrested and their properties seized, leaving Amalric no choice but to comply. This led to a small uprising and calls for Henry to retake the throne, but it quickly subsided. Among those arrested were several nobles, including two members of the Ibelin family. Amalric was murdered in 1310 by Simon of Montolif. After this King Oshin released Henry II. With the aid of the Hospitallers, Henry regained his throne. Those who had helped Amalric were arrested, including their brother Aimery, who was acting governor following Amalric's murder.\n\n===Kings of Armenia===\n[[Image:Constantin5Armenie.jpg|left|thumb|[[Constantin III of Armenia]] on his throne. \"Les chevaliers de Saint-Jean-de-Jerusalem r\u00e9tablissant la religion en Arm\u00e9nie\", 1844 painting by [[Henri Delaborde (painter)|Henri Delaborde]].]]\n1342, Amalric's son, [[Constantine II, King of Armenia|Guy de Lusignan]], was elected <!-- by whom? --> as King of Armenia and took the name Constantine II. He was initially reluctant as the regent, [[Oshin of Corycos]], was rumored to have poisoned the previous king, and killed Guy's mother and two brothers. Under his leadership, the Lusignans tried to impose Western Catholicism and the European way of life on the Armenian people, who had a state religion of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. The Armenian leadership largely accepted Catholicism,  but the peasantry opposed the changes. Eventually, this led civil strife.<ref name=\"Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume II\">{{cite book | last = Kurdoghlian | first = Mihran | title = Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume II | publisher = Hradaragoutioun Azkayin Oussoumnagan Khorhourti |year= 1996 | location = Athens, Greece | pages = 29\u201356|language=hy}}</ref> Constantine was killed in an uprising in 1344, and the throne passed out of the Lusignan family to his distant cousin [[Constantine III, King of Armenia|Gosdantin]]; he reigned as Constantine III. Constantine III attempted to kill his cousins, in an attempt to eliminate all potential claimants, but they fled to Cyprus.\n\n===Golden Age of Lusignan Cyprus===\n{{Main|Alexandrian Crusade}}\n\n[[Hugh IV of Cyprus|Hugh IV de Lusignan]] became king at age 29, and unlike previous Lusignan monarchs he was content being just King of Cyprus, refusing his son Peter's requests to lead a crusade for Jerusalem. He instead preferred to focus on issues in his realm and was strict on justice. When Peter and his third son John journeyed to Europe he had the man who helped them tortured and hanged, and sent ships to find and imprison his sons. He had a strong interest in art, literature and philosophy, hosting regular philosophical discussions at his summer villa in Lapithos and commissioned Genealogia deorum gentilium by the Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio. In 1347 Prince [[Peter I of Cyprus|Peter de Lusignan]] founded the Chivalric Order of the Sword, whose motto was ''Pour Lealte Maintenir'' the motto of his house.\n\nIn 1358 Hugh abdicated the throne, passing it on to his military minded son Peter instead of his grandson Hugh, the heir apparent. Peter believed that since Cyprus was the last Christian stronghold in the mideast it was his duty to fight the Muslims, and raided the coastal ports of the Asia Minor. The people of Korikos asked for protection from the Muslims. Peter sent his kinsman, Sir Roberto de Lusignan to lead the siege of Korikos. The Lusignans succeeded, and the various Muslim leaders united against Peter, launching an assault on Cyprus. Peter united Knights of Saint John from Rhodes, Papal armies, and Mediterranean pirates to defeat the Muslim fleets before they could land. After another defeat at Antalya the remaining emirs in the region offered him tribute, and he accepted, sending the flags, coats of arms, and other symbols of his house to be raised in different cities. Peter personally visited many of the cities he conquered, where he was given trophies, gifts, and was even worshiped by some.\n\nWhen Peter returned to Cyprus he was in risk of losing his throne. Hugh, his nephew who had previously been the heir apparent, went to [[Pope Urban V]] in an attempt to be recognized as king. Peter journeyed to [[Avignon]] to present his case. Urban sided with Peter, but Hugh was given a high annual benefit as recompense. Peter also discussed another crusade with the pope, and then decided to visit the other kings and rulers of Europe to strengthen his army. He visited Germany, France, and England, where the famed \"[[Banquet of the Five Kings]]\" took place. In 1363 Peter attended the [[Congress of Krak\u00f3w]], hosted by King [[Casimir III of Poland|Casimir the Great]] of Poland. In attendance were [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], King [[Louis I of Hungary]], the [[Valdemar IV of Denmark]], and other lords and princes. Among the issues discussed were Peter's crusade, peace treaties between the kings, and the succession for the Polish throne. While there Peter won a royal tournament, adding to his prestige.\n\n[[Image:Assassinat Pierre de Lusignan, roi de Chypre.jpg|thumb|The assassination of [[Peter I of Cyprus|Peter]]. \"Assassinat Pierre de Lusignan, roi de Chypre\", 15th-century painting by Jean Froissart.]]\n\nWhile Peter was attempting to launch another crusade and gaining recognition, his brother Prince [[John of Lusignan|John]] ruled as vice-king in Cyprus and faced many challenges. There was an epidemic in 1363 which resulted in the death of many Cypriots, including their sister Eschiva. The Turks heard that the people of Cyprus were dying and took advantage by raiding and pillaging the villages. During this time there were also conflicts between the Genose navies docked at [[Famagusta]] and the native Cypriots. Peter was in Genoa at the time and negotiated peace. He failed to gain the support of the major rulers but set off on a [[Alexandrian Crusade|crusade]] with what men he had. He sacked the city of [[Alexandria]], but was prevented from moving on to [[Cairo]], and succeeded only in angering the Sultan. Peter moved on to [[Beirut]], [[Tripoli]], and in 1368 attempted once again to unite Europe in a crusade. Pope Urban V instead had Peter make peace with the Sultan of Egypt, who was attacking Christian ships in retaliation for Peter's crusade. The increased commerce under Peter's reign led to Famagusta becoming one of the wealthiest cities of its time. It became renowned as a place where the rich could live in lavish surroundings.\n\nWhile on one of his visits to Rome Peter received word that the barons of Armenia wanted him as king. He returned to Cyprus to find that his queen had been unfaithful while he was away, and he tyrannized all nobles she showed favor to, including his brothers. In 1369 Peter was assassinated while in bed by three of his own knights. During his reign he was known as the epitome of chivalry, and was the greatest king of the Lusignan dynasty. He was succeeded by his 12-year-old son, Peter II.\n\nPeter's brother John served as regent for 12-year-old Peter II. John's appointment was opposed by many, especially Peter's wife Eleanor of Aragon, who suspected John of arranging the assassination.  Vowing revenge, Eleanor asked for military aid from Europe in order to punish Peter I's murderers. The Genoese agreed, and invaded in 1373, which led to them capturing Famagusta, the most important port in the region. Peter II recalled forces from cities along the Asian Minor to defend Cyprus, resulting in their loss. He signed a treaty with the Genoese, one of the conditions being that his uncle, James, the youngest brother of his father Peter I, be exiled from Cyprus. This ended the war, but James was captured by the Genoese in Rhodes and held captive in Genoa. After the war Eleanor finally killed Prince John, still under the belief he had murdered her husband. Peter II signed a peace treaty with the Sultan of Egypt, and died in 1382 at Nicosia.\n\nThe Parliament of Cyprus decided that James I of Cyprus was to succeed as the new king. Unfortunately James was still a captive of the Genoese. While in captivity he had wed Helvis of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and had 12 children. After agreeing to give the Genoese more rights in Cyprus, he was released. While he was away Cyprus was governed by a council of 12 nobles. Some of the nobles opposed his return, led by the brothers Perotte and Vilmonde de Montolivve, who wished to be kings themselves. In 1385 James returned again, and succeeded, being crowned in Nicosia. In 1388 he was crowned king of Jerusalem, and in 1393, following the death of his cousin Leon of Armenia (Leon V of Lusignan, also called Leo V or Levon), he was crowned king of Armenia. James died in 1398, and was succeeded by his son Janus.\n\n===Fall of Armenia===\n[[Image:LeonVCouventDesCelestins.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Leon V of Armenia|Leo V]], last king of Armenia, in the [[Couvent des C\u00e9lestins]], [[Paris]].

The New Armenia 12 (11-12): 168\u20139.</ref>]]\nAfter the death of his kinsman, [[Constantine IV]] sought an alliance with the Sultan of Egypt, whom Peter had made an enemy. This angered the barons of Armenia, who feared annexation by the sultan, and in 1373 Constantine IV was murdered. In 1374, [[Leon V of Armenia|Leon V de Lusignan]] was crowned King of Armenia. He was raised in Cyprus after having fled Constantine III, and while there he became a knight in the Order of the Sword, which was founded by King Peter I. In 1375, Armenia was invaded by the [[Mameluks]] and Leon was forced to surrender, putting an end to the last fully independent Armenian entity of the Middle Ages after three centuries of sovereignty. The title was claimed by his cousin, [[James I of Cyprus]], uniting it with the titles of Cyprus and Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Badmoutioun Hayots, Volume II\"/> Leon and his family were held captive in Cairo for several years, until King [[John I of Castile]] ransomed him and made him Lord of Madrid. He died in Paris in 1393 after trying and failing to gather support for another crusade.\n\n===Kings of Jerusalem, Cyprus, and Armenia===\n\nJanus, [[James I of Cyprus|son of James I and Helvis]], married Charlotte de Bourbon and their marriage was described as a \"cornerstone in the revitalisation of French culture in the Lusignan court that characterised Janus's rule\".<ref>Andr\u00e9e Giselle Simard, ''The Manuscript Torino J.II.9: A Late Medieval Perspective on Musical Life and Culture at the Court of the Lusignan Kings at Nicosia'', pp.35-36, December 2005, retrieved on 15 June 2009</ref>\nCharlotte died on 15 January 1422 of the plague. She was buried in the Royal Monastery of Saint Dominic's in Nicosia. Her many descendants included Queen Charlotte of Cyprus, Queen Jeanne III of Navarre; French Kings Charles VIII, Francis I, Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX, Henry III, Henry IV and the subsequent Bourbon kings; Anne of France, and Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nAs king Janus tried to take back Famagusta, which was still held by the Genoese, but was thwarted by conspirators. In 1403, the governor of Genoa, de Mengre, had talks with Janus' representative Giorgio Billi which ended in an agreement by which the cities remained under Genoese hands. Later, he forced the Cypriot people to pay special taxes to assemble an army and siege machines, and he besieged Famagusta for three years but in vain, since there was access from the sea to the city. In 1406 the siege ended and the Genoese tried to occupy [[Limassol]], but were defeated.\n\nTwo years later, the island was affected by epidemics. Simultaneously, there were many raids of locusts on the island, which caused destruction to agriculture. A new epidemic arrived in 1419\u201320, which probably caused the death of Janus' second wife, Charlotte on 15 January 1422. Because the king was very distraught about her death, the body of the dead queen was moved out of the palace where her funeral was, in order to not be seen by Janus.\n\nMeanwhile, because Cyprus was still a permanent base of campaign for pirates and adventurers, after raids around the Cypriot coasts, Janus had repeated discussions with the Sultan of Egypt via the sultan's representatives. Janus was unable to stop the raids, which gave the Muslims a reason to attack Cyprus. Cypriot nobles and officials of the kingdom participated in the raids.\n\n[[Barsbay]], the [[Sultan of Egypt]], sent military forces to Cyprus several times. A small force, around 1424, attacked Limassol, and in 1425 the Egyptian army attacked Famagusta and then pillaged [[Larnaca]] together with the nearby area, including Kiti, [[Dromolaxia]], Kellia, [[Aradippou]] and Agrinou. After Larnaca, they went to Limassol, which was also sacked, including the [[Kolossi Castle|city's castle]].\n\nIn the summer of 1426, the [[Mamluk]]s launched a large-scale attack against the island. Led by Tangriver Mohamed and Inal el Kakimi, their army contained over 3,000 men and included Mamliks, [[Turkish people|Turks]] and Arabs and arrived at the island with 180 ships near Avdimou. Limassol was again occupied. Janus mustered his army and moved from Nicosia to Limassol. He asked in vain for help from the forces in Europe: the Genoese were his enemies, and the Venetians and others did not want to destroy commercial relations with the sultan.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Chirokitia]] (7 July 1426) against the Mamluks, King Janus was captured by the [[Egypt]]ian forces. He was ransomed after ten months of captivity in [[Cairo]]. During his captivity his brother [[Hugues Lancelot de Lusignan|Hugh of Lusignan]], [[Archbishop of Nicosia]], took charge of Cyprus.\n\nAfter their victory, the Mamluks pillaged Larnaca again and then Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus. The royal family retreated to fortified Kyrenia and were rescued. The invaders took a great deal of loot and captives before they left the island.\n\nThat disaster, together with the previous raids, the war operations of Janus against Genoese, the epidemics and the invasion of locusts, caused the Cypriot serfs to revolt, as they suffered from living in conditions of utter poverty. The leader of the Cypriot revolutionaries was Alexis, whom they declared as king in Lefkoniko. The revolution was widespread supported by much of the population, who elected their own leaders in many places of Cyprus.\n\nMeanwhile, Janus was humiliated in Cairo: they took him, tied up with chains and riding a donkey, in front of the sultan. He was forced to kneel and worship nine times the soil on which the sultan stepped. Europeans mediated in the case, obtaining the release of Janus after collecting sufficient monies for the required ransoms. Cyprus also had to offer the sultan an annual tax based on income from 5,000 duchies. This tax continued to be paid even after the end of Frankish rule in Cyprus. Together with Janus, some of the captives bought their freedom after their families collected money for ransoms. Those who remained as captives were sold as slaves.\n\nWhile Janus was captive in Cyprus, the nobles and the royal family members were trying to gain his release, while dealing with Alexis' rebellion. With help from Europe, the rebellion was repressed after 10 months. The rebels' leader was arrested and, after terrible tortures, was executed in Nicosia on 12 May 1427, the same day that King Janus arrived in [[Paphos]] from Cairo. He died in 1432 and was succeeded by his son [[John II of Cyprus|John]].\n\n[[Image:Eastern Mediterranean 1450.svg|thumb|After the fall of Armenian Cilicia, Lusignan-controlled Cyprus was the only Christian state in the Middle East.]]\nJohn married [[Amadea Palaiologina of Monferrato]]; she died in 1440. After this he married [[Helena Palaiologina]], the granddaughter of [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] [[Manuel II Palaeologus]]. They had two daughters, the eldest of which, [[Charlotte, Queen of Cyprus|Charlotte]], would succeed him as ruler of Cyprus. He also had an illegitimate son, [[James II of Cyprus|James]], by his mistress [[Marietta de Patras]]. James was made Archbishop of Nicosia at age 16, but was stripped of his title after murdering the Royal [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]]. John eventually forgave him, and appeared to be ready to name James as his successor, but died in 1458 before doing so. He was succeeded by his daughter Charlotte.\n\nCharlotte's reign was troubled and brief. She succeeded in building an alliance with the Genoese, via her marriage to [[Louis of Savoy, Count of Geneva]], but it proved futile. Her half-brother James made an alliance with the sultanate of Egypt [[Sayf ad-Din Inal]]. Their combined forces recaptured Famagusta for the Lusignans, and their blockade forced Charlotte to stay in the castle of [[Kyrenia]] for three years. In 1463 she and Louis fled Cyprus for Rome, where they were welcomed by [[Pope Pius II]].\n\nJames was crowned king and married [[Catherine Cornaro]] in 1468 to establish an alliance with [[Venice]]. In 1472 Catherine arrived in Cyprus, and James died several months later under suspicious circumstances. Their son [[James III of Cyprus]] died at one year of age, bringing an end to the Lusignan kingdoms. However, the last member of the dynasty, was Queen Charlotte, who died on 16 July, 1487, in Rome.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Fileti|first=F.|title=I Lusignan di Cipro|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Florence|pages=79}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n{{Quote|text=...the Lusignans also accumulated an impressive array of titles that extended their influence almost as far and wide as the Roman emperors had done.|sign=Paul Sire|source=King Arthur's European Realm: New Evidence from Monmouth's Primary Sources<ref>Sire, Paul ''King Arthur's European Realm: New Evidence from Monmouth's Primary Sources''. 2014, McFarland p. 182 0786478012</ref>}}\n\nBesides the Cypriot branch, through the acts of the Count of Poitiers, Alphonse de Poitiers, by the 18th century the domains of Lusignans were divided among a number of other branches :\n* Lusignan-Lezay\n* Lusignan-Vouvant\n* Lusignan-Cognac\n* Lusignan-Jarnac (the Counts d'Eu)\n* Lusignan-Sidon\n* The principal branch retains Lusignan and the County of La Marche\nTwo of the Lusignan domains in France were erected into feudal Marquisates in 1618 and 1722 by Kings Louis XIII and Louis XV respectively.<ref>''\n''Dictionnaire des Titres et des terres titr\u00e9es en France sous l'ancien r\u00e9gime\u00bb, Eric Thiou, \u00c9ditions M\u00e9moire et Documents, Versailles, 2003</ref>\n\n===\"Prince\" de Lusignan ===\nIn 1880, a former [[Maronite]] priest Kafta declared that his wife Marie was a descendant of [[Guy de Lusignan]] and styled her Princess of Lusignan of Cyprus, of Jerusalem and of Armenia.

In the legend Melusine was exiled from Avalon and doomed to turn into a serpent from the waist down every Saturday. One day a prince, Raymondin of Poitou, came across her in the woods. He had just killed his uncle in a hunting accident and was distraught. Melusine helped him with this, and he later returned seeking her out. He proposed marriage, and she agreed on the condition that she be left alone every Saturday.\n\nRaymondin agreed, and together they had ten children, founding the dynasty. They built the Ch\u00e2teau de Lusignan in 15 days, naming it after Melusine. One day Raymondin's brothers asked why she disappeared every Saturday, and Raymondin said that it was a condition of their marriage. One brother spied through the door, and saw Melusine bathing. She was a serpent, or according to some sources, a mermaid, from waist down. He told Raymondin of this, and when Melusine was confronted she wept at the betrayal, turned into a dragon, and flew away. She would fly over the castle whenever a new Lusignan became lord. It is for this reason that a mermaid is the Lusignan crest and dragons were their supporters.<ref>* Richardson, Douglas (2011).

Kr\u00fcger was born and grew up with his brother Gotthard de Beauclair in the artists' colony on [[Monte Verit\u00e0]]. In 1920, his mother moved with the two children to [[Darmstadt]] , where the family came from. From 1921 to 1930 he went to school in Darmstadt.\n\nIn 1930, de Beauclair began studying general mechanical engineering at the [[Darmstadt University of Technology]]. After completing his studies, he was initially taken on as a research assistant and then as an assistant at the Institute for Practical Mathematics (IPM), headed by [[Alwin Walther]]. There, he was involved in the construction of an automatic calculator with punched tape programming, which was destroyed during the bombing of Darmstadt like the entire IPM. He also worked on the development of devices for Fourier analysis. From 1939, he developed together with Hans-Joachim Dreyer, both from IPM to the company OTT in [[Kempten]], a new type of electromechanical cutting wheel integration system to solve differential equations, the DGM-IPM-Ott, of which there are still assemblies in the inventory of the German Museum Munich.\n\nIn 1942, he met [[Konrad Zuse]] in Berlin, who showed him the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3 computer system]]. As head of the precision engineering workshop at the IPM, de Beauclair subsequently supported Zuse with the work on the [[Z4 (computer)|Z4]] Among other things, the IPM supplied punching devices for punched tape that were used to control the program sequence and to save intermediate results. Zuse and de Beauclair became friends. In January 1945, de Beauclair became Dr.-Ing. With Alwin Walther at the TU Darmstadt with a thesis on multidimensional Fourier synthesis doctorate.\n\nIn April 1945, like many other men, he was interned by the French military for no reason, and brought to [[Alsace]] while traveling to the Allg\u00e4u. In December 1945, his civilian status was recognized and de Beauclair released from internment. However, he was seriously ill with tuberculosis, was unable to work and had to be hospitalized from 1946 to 1950.<ref name=\"HO\" /> In 1949, his doctoral thesis was published.\n\nAfter being released from the hospital, the family moved to [[Stuttgart]] in late 1950. Initially de Beauclair worked for the [[G\u00f6ttingen]] company PHYWE in sales, then from 1955 as a development engineer and laboratory manager at SEL, where Dr.-Ing. Dreyer was active. There, he was involved in the development of the ER 56 electronic computer and suitable peripheral devices. After the SEL Informatik plant was closed in 1960, he moved to the German Bundespost, where he worked as head of the computerization department at the Central Post Office in Darmstadtthe postal check and savings bank services worked and was there in particular responsible for programming the IT systems. He led the project for microfilming receipts in the course of automatic receipt reading. Due to the microfilming, the documents should also be available in the EDP after processing and should therefore remain legally valid. In addition, the banks tried to save storage space in the early 1960s. Microfilming was a key project for the success of bank automation.\n\nIn 1968 his book, Calculating with Machines, a visual history of computing technology from its origins to 1964, was published by the FAZ, then reviewed and reprinted in 2005 by Springer-Verlag.<ref name=\"HO\" /> In 1977 he retired at the age of 65 as Chief Post Office Director.<ref name=\"AUG\" />\n\n==Awards and honors==\nIn May 2002, he was awarded the Prochorov Order of the International Informatization Academy (Moscow) at the Deutsches Museum in Munich.

Peralta shows \"class clown\" traits, constantly pulling pranks and making immature jokes at the expense of his colleagues, particularly his partner, Amy Santiago. He is fun-loving and sarcastic but is often motivated by his emotions more than his colleagues. Despite his goofy traits, Peralta is extremely smart, perceptive and quick thinking, and as such has the best arrest rate in the precinct. In the pilot, Terry Jeffords explains to Captain Holt that Peralta is his best detective, that he likes putting away bad guys, and that he loves puzzles, although \"the only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.\" As of season seven, he is 38 years old and has been a detective with the 9-9 since 2005.<ref name=\"Unsolvable\">{{Cite episode|title=Unsolvable|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=March 18, 2014|season=1|number=21}}</ref>\n\nHis father left his family during his childhood and, as a result, he feels a strong tie to memories involving his father, such as his favorite Brooklyn pizza joint. He also initially refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving, since he associates the holiday with his father's absenteeism. He has a strong emotional tie to his muscle car, a 1967 Ford Mustang, which he bought outright on his first day as a cop and always carries a positive association for him (until he sold it to help pay for Terry's new child). He often quotes and makes references to his favorite movie trilogy, ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]''. In \"Boyle-Linetti Wedding\" it is revealed that Jake is Jewish, having lost his childhood sweetheart Jenny Gildenhorn to Eddie Fung at his [[Bar Mitzvah]].\n\nPeralta's best friend is Charles Boyle, who works along with him at the precinct and admires Peralta and encourages his eventual romance with Santiago. Peralta and Gina Linetti are childhood friends, which resulted in him helping Gina get a job at the precinct. Diaz and Peralta were classmates at the police academy.\n\nJake began his career as a patrol officer with the 74th Precinct and was partnered with Stevie Schillens and the two nicknamed themselves the \"Beatsie Boys\"; in 2016, Jake was forced to arrest Stevie, now a detective with the neighboring 98th Precinct for planting evidence.<ref name=\"The 9-8\">{{Cite episode|title=The 9-8|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 9, 2016|season=3|number=15}}</ref> \n\nWhile Jake doesn't initially approve of Captain Holt's strict management, he eventually matures under Holt's supervision and comes to see Holt as a father-figure; even calling him \"Dad\" on many occasions. In \"The Oolong Slayer\", Jake achieves his lifelong dream to catch a serial killer, the Oolong Slayer, but gives up the credit for the arrest to the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives in exchange for effecting Holt's transfer back to the 99th Precinct.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\">{{Cite episode|title=The Oolong Slayer|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=October 18, 2015|season=3|number=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of season four, Jake and Rosa Diaz are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Although he is eager to return to work, his time in prison left him with post-traumatic stress and newfound empathy that affects his job performance.\n\nPeralta continuously pranks and teases his partner Amy Santiago, masking his secret romantic feelings for her. Peralta confesses his feelings to her in \"[[Charges and Specs]]\" before going undercover for a mafia operation. His romantic feelings for her develop further throughout season two and they share their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]].<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\">{{Cite episode|title=Johnny and Dora|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=May 17, 2015|season=2|number=23}}</ref> Jake and Amy start dating in \"[[New Captain]]\" and decide to move in together in the \"[[Greg and Larry]]\", but don't make it official until season four's \"[[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]\". Jake proposes to Amy at the end of their annual Halloween heist in [[HalloVeen]] and the two are later married by Captain Holt in [[Jake & Amy]], the finale of season five.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tvline.com/2017/10/17/brooklyn-nine-nine-recap-jake-amy-engaged-halloween-proposal-season-5/|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine Recap: Jake Has a Halloween Surprise for Amy|last=Schwartz|first=Ryan|date=2017-10-18|work=TVLine|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}</ref> In \"[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine (season 7)|Ding Dong]]\", it is revealed Amy is pregnant with Jake's child.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://tvline.com/2020/03/12/brooklyn-nine-nine-recap-madeline-wuntch-dies-amy-pregnant-season-7-episode-7/|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine Ends With a Noice Surprise \u2014 Plus, R.I.P.

She attended [[parochial school]], later studied [[ballet]], and was a classmate of Jake's in the police academy.<ref name=\"castlist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/devwatch/brooklyn-nine-nine/|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine (FOX)|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> When she was younger, the pressure for her to succeed at ballet school eventually led her to commit several crimes before landing in juvenile detention. Her parents provided little support, leaving Rosa to turn her life around by herself. \n\nThough Diaz is a loyal and effective member of the squad, her anger management issues and lack of empathy terrify most of her coworkers. She is highly secretive about her personal life \u2013 should anyone discover a secret of hers, she normally threatens them with death should they disclose it. It is also made clear that she does not stay in her apartments for long periods of time, and her neighbors know her by both a different name and a completely different personality. As revealed in \"Cop-Con\", she and Amy are younger than most of the other precinct members as they are hurt by a device that emits a loud noise to those under 35, whereas Jake and Boyle only pretend to be affected by it. In \"White Whale\", she reveals to Amy that she's attended medical school, business school, and has a pilot's license. Rosa also briefly mentions in \"Greg and Larry\" that her name \"Rosa Diaz\" may be an alias to cover up her real name from the rest of the 9-9.\n\nIn season two, Rosa dates Captain Holt's nephew, Marcus, but breaks up with him in season three. Later in the season, she finds love with former undercover detective Adrian Pimento; the two get engaged in \"Paranoia\" while chasing a drug dealer through an alley, but their wedding is delayed when Pimento is targeted by Figgis and forced to leave the state. Once he returns, they try to have their wedding the next day but decide to go steady after realizing they were rushing their relationship.\n\nAt the end of season four, Rosa and Jake are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Following her months of isolation, she starts spending more time with her family and ends her relationship with Pimento. Later in the season, she comes out as bisexual to the precinct and her family, and has a brief relationship with an unseen woman that the squad never meet or learn the name of, nicknamed \"Becky\". She has a brief flirtation with one of Gina's friends, but this does not lead anywhere. On the day of Jake and Amy's wedding, she and Terry meet a cab driver named Alicia that she becomes interested in. The two begin a relationship off-screen. However, it's short-lived, as Rosa mentions in \"The Tattler\" that they broke up because Alicia was moving to London. \n\nIn season six, Rosa begins dating a cosmetologist named Jocelyn and begins to patch up her relationship with her mother, who was initially disapproving of her bisexuality. In season seven, Rosa and Jocelyn broke up prior to the season's Jimmy Jab Games.\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Diaz.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", she received a commendation for her work as the leader of a drug task force.\n\nFirst three-time winner of the Halloween Heist.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Terry Jeffords ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Terry Jeffords\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Sergeant {{small|(seasons 1\u20136)}}|[[Lieutenant]] {{small|(season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Terry Crews]]|Theodore Barnes (child)}}\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Terrence Vincent Jeffords\n| family      = \n| spouse      = [[#Sharon Jeffords|Sharon Jeffords]] (wife)\n| significant_other = {{ubl|[[#Chiaki|Chiaki]] (ex-girlfriend)|[[#Veronica Hopkins|Veronica Hopkins]] (ex-girlfriend)}}\n| children    = {{ubl|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Cagney Jeffords]] (daughter)|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Lacey Jeffords]] (daughter)|Ava Jeffords (daughter)}}\n| relatives   = {{ubl|Lawrence Jeffords (brother)|[[#Zeke|Zeke]] (brother-in-law)|Unnamed father (deceased)|Unnamed grandmother (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Terry Crews by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Terry Crews]]]]\n[[Terry Crews]] portrays Lieutenant (previously Sergeant) '''Terrence \"Terry\" Vincent Jeffords''', the supervisor of the 9-9's Detective Squad. An avid [[bodybuilder]] who stands at more than six feet tall, with a [[linebacker]]'s build, Terry's intimidating size and appearance is contrasted by his caring, protective nature and paternal instincts. Jeffords is devoted to his wife and three young daughters Cagney, Lacey (named after the [[Cagney & Lacey|1980s TV series]]), and Ava. He fears the danger of police work because of the possibility that he could leave his children fatherless. Following a panic attack prior to the show's beginning, Terry was removed from field work, but he has since cautiously returned. He is high-strung, prone to nervous excitement, loves yogurt, and has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person. He is an effective and caring leader to the detective squad, often having to play the mature adult in order to keep them in line.\n\nA running gag throughout the series is for Terry to break things (examples include a Magic 8 Ball, a phone and Captain Holt's office) because of his incredible strength. He has been a detective since 1995 and used to be assigned to the 65th Precinct (as seen in \"Terry Kitties\"), where he was constantly mocked for a botched case which he and Jake later proved he was correct in. In S1.Ep.1. Holt mentions that he and Terry have worked together in the 18th Precinct years prior. In 2005, he was the senior detective at the 9-9 (the position Jake now holds since Terry's promotion). He was a linebacker at [[Syracuse University]], where he graduated ''magna cum laude'', as revealed in \"The Swedes\". He also studied abroad in Japan while in college and dated a Japanese student named Chiaki who broke his heart. He speaks Japanese infrequently throughout the show.\n\nIn season two, Terry nearly gets a [[vasectomy]] at his wife's request, but Jake convinces him not to when he finds out Terry secretly wants to have more kids. His wife becomes pregnant later in the season and gives birth to their third daughter, Ava, in season three. He entrusts Jake to be Ava's godfather.\n\nWhile Terry is satisfied with his role as Sergeant, he aimed to become a Lieutenant during the first six seasons. As revealed in \"The Honeypot\", he brought a new pair of suspenders that he planned to put on after he passed the Lieutenant's Exam but kept them in the box when he ended up failing and held onto them as a reminder of his higher goals. In \"Moo Moo\", he attempted to apply to be a city council liaison to take on more responsibilities but was rejected after reporting that another cop racially profiled him. In season six, Terry reveals to the group that he passed the Lieutenant's Exam weeks before the annual Halloween Heist (which they hosted on Cinco de Mayo).\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Lieutenant Jeffords.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd bronze.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Commendation or Commendation\u2014Integrity\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD Unit Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD Unit Citation\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Amy Santiago===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Amy Santiago\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* Detective {{small|(seasons 1\u20135)}} \n* Sergeant {{small|(season 5\u2013present)}}\n}}\n| portrayer          = [[Melissa Fumero]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| alias              = Isabel Cortez (undercover alias)\n| family             = \n| spouse             = [[#Jake Peralta|Jake Peralta]]\n| significant_other  = {{ubl|[[#Teddy Wells|Teddy Wells]] (ex-boyfriend)|[[#Constantine Kane|Constantine Kane]] (ex-boyfriend)|Luke Mueller (ex-boyfriend)}}\n| children           = \n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Victor Santiago|Victor Santiago]] (father)|[[#Camila Santiago|Camila Santiago]] (mother)|Tony Santiago (brother)|[[#David Santiago|David Santiago]] (brother)|Mason Santiago (nephew)|[[#Roger Peralta|Roger Peralta]] (father-in-law)|[[#Karen Peralta|Karen Peralta]] (mother-in-law)|[[#Kate Peralta|Kate Peralta]] (half sister-in-law)|Five unnamed brothers|Two unnamed half sisters-in-law|An unknown number of half brothers-in-law|Unnamed niece}}\n| religion           = \n| nationality        = Cuban-American\n}}\n[[File:Melissa Fumero May 2018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Melissa Fumero]]]]\n[[Melissa Fumero]] portrays Sergeant (previously Detective) '''Amy Santiago''', Jake's uptight, by-the-book, rule-following [[Cuban-American]] partner, and later wife.<ref name=castlist/> A self-acknowledged [[Type A and Type B personality theory|type A personality]] and neurotic overachiever, she is continually trying to ingratiate herself with Captain Holt, and any authority figure in arm's reach of her. In the pilot, Terry cites Amy's competitiveness to Holt as a result of her having seven brothers. Amy is a stickler for department protocol and is frequently exasperated by Jake's childishness, as well as the ease with which he succeeds as a detective. She is initially seen as Holt's teacher's pet, but over time is shown to command respect from others. \n\nAmy was originally a patrol officer at the 64th precinct but requested a transfer to the 99th when her captain almost sexually assaulted her shortly after her promotion to detective. She didn't tell anyone for years out of fear for what it would do to her career until she revealed it to Jake when they were investigating a sexual assault case in \"He Said, She Said\". \n\nIn [[Charges and Specs]], the season one finale, Jake confesses that he wishes something romantic could happen between them. She confesses to having feelings for Jake in \"[[The Road Trip (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Road Trip]]\", which instigated issues in Amy and Teddy Wells' relationship and is shown to still have feelings for Jake in \"[[Det. Dave Majors]]\". The two share their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]]<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> and begin dating in [[New Captain]], although their working relationship does not change at all. They decide to move in together in the season three finale [[Greg and Larry]], but don't make it official until season four's [[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]. Jake proposes to Amy at the end of their annual Halloween heist in [[HalloVeen]] and the two eventually marry in [[Jake & Amy]]. In \"Ding Dong\", Amy reveals she is pregnant with Jake's child. In \"Admiral Peralta\", it is revealed that Jake and Amy's child is a boy. \n\nNear the end of season three, Amy goes undercover as a pregnant inmate in a women's prison in Texas to obtain information from Maura Figgis. This was done to cover Melissa Fumero's actual pregnancy at the time without making her character pregnant.\n\nAfter some uncertainty in taking the Sergeant's Exam as depicted in \"[[Chasing Amy (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Chasing Amy]]\", she passes the exam and begins wearing her Sergeant's uniform as well as commanding her own uniformed officers in \"[[NutriBoom]]\".\n\nIn season five's \"Casecation\", she is revealed to be 36 years old. In season six's \"The Golden Child\", it is revealed that Amy had a relatively strained relationship with her brother and fellow NYPD Lieutenant David Santiago, chiding her mother for glorifying David's accomplishments over Amy's. Amy enjoys solving crosswords and attending trivia sessions, to the expense of Jake, who often embarrasses himself when attempting to participate or becomes awkwardly excluded in conversation. \n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Sergeant Santiago.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD Baby Delivery Citation.jpg|100px]]\n|Citation bar for delivering a baby\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Charles Boyle ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Charles Boyle\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Male\n| occupation         = Detective\n| portrayer          = [[Joe Lo Truglio]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| spouse             = [[#Eleanor Horstweil|Eleanor Hortsweil]] (ex-wife)\n| significant_other   = {{ubl||[[#Genevieve Mirren-Carter|Genevieve Mirren-Carter]] (girlfriend)|[[#Vivian Ludley|Vivian Ludley]] (ex-fianc\u00e9e)|[[#Gina Linetti|Gina Linetti]] (ex-lover)|[[#Lt.

He is divorced from his wife Eleanor, who had numerous affairs during their marriage, to the point where she has to pay alimony to him. He is also a huge, unapologetic [[foodie]], maintaining a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email and often relishing bizarre foreign cuisine that disgusts his coworkers. \n\nFor saving Detective Diaz's life during \"Christmas\" (during which he was shot in the buttocks), he was awarded the [[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]] in \"The Bet\", though he was overshadowed by a revered and heroic NYPD horse named Sgt Peanut Butter.  In \"The Swedes\", it is revealed that Boyle is a graduate of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].\n\nIn the show's first season, Charles has a crush on Rosa, but he eventually gets over her when he starts dating Vivian Ludley, whom he met at Captain Holt's birthday party. They get engaged but break up after Charles refuses to move to Canada with her. He and Gina start to see each other in season two, and their brief relationship results in his father and Gina's mother's marriage. In season three, he starts dating Genevieve Mirren-Carter after he and Jake clear her name from an art thief. They eventually move in together and adopt a son from Latvia named Nikolaj. \n\nIn season five, Charles starts his own food truck business called \"The One Thing\", which specializes in meatball subs. The truck is burned down by one of Charles' ex-employees, but he's thankful it happened as running the food truck made him spend less time with his family and built up a large debt.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Boyle.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation 1.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:Fictional Police Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar\n|}\n \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Gina Linetti ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Gina Linetti\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| last               = \"Return of the King\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{ubl|[[Administrator (business)|Administrator]] {{small|(Seasons 1\u20136)}}|Internet personality {{small|(Season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer          = [[Chelsea Peretti]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name          = Regina Linetti\n| significant_other   = {{ubl|[[#Charles Boyle|Charles Boyle]] (ex-lover)|[[#Milton Boyle|Milton Boyle]] (lover, father of her child)|Eight unnamed ex-fianc\u00e9s}}\n| children           = The Enigma \"Iggy\" Boyle (daughter)\n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Darlene Linetti|Darlene Linetti]] (mother)|[[#Lynn Boyle|Lynn Boyle]] (stepfather)|Charles Boyle (stepbrother)|Susan Grapecoat (great-aunt)|Anthony (nephew)|Unnamed sibling|Unnamed father}}\n| nationality        = American\n}}\n[[File:Chelsea Peretti at Meltdown (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Chelsea Peretti]]]]\n[[Chelsea Peretti]] portrays '''Regina \"Gina\" Linetti''', the 99th Precinct's sardonic and egomaniacal civilian administrator and Captain Holt's assistant.<ref name=castlist/> Despite maintaining a clueless and dimwitted disposition most of the time, she can be surprisingly observant and has demonstrated traits of being more intelligent than she likes to show. Gina is obsessed with social media and is constantly on her phone. It is a running gag to try to pry her from her phone, to the point where Captain Holt becomes involved. She is extremely narcissistic and constantly praises and exalts herself, such as claiming to be a better dancer than [[Britney Spears]] in the episode \"Karen Peralta\". As the only civilian in the precinct, Gina often uses her outsider's perspective to assist the other detectives. In the episode \"The Party\", to prevent the mostly [[working class]] detectives from embarrassing themselves in front of a crowd of [[academia|academics]], Rosa tricks Gina into talking to a group of psychology professors at Holt's birthday party, who then take copious notes about her narcissistic personality. They conclude that she has a complete overlap of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], a condition previously thought to be purely theoretical.\n\nShe casually admits on myriad occasions that she doesn't value her colleagues \u2013 except for Jake \u2013 as people. She was also childhood friends with Jake, who got her the job at the precinct. Gina also ruined Jake's senior year of high school by framing him as \"The Tattler\", though she did it to avoid Jake getting involved with the wrong crowd. She transferred to the Public relations Division with Captain Holt in \"Johnny and Dora\", and returns to the 9-9 with him in \"The Oolong Slayer\".<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/><ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> In the episode \"The Apartment\", it is revealed that she has been engaged eight times, but never married. At the end of \"The Fugitive Pt. 2\", she gets hit by a bus after receiving a text from Charles. The penultimate episode of season four reveals she has become pregnant following a relationship with Charles' cousin, Milton (which coincided with Chelsea Peretti's actual pregnancy). She is absent for the first half of season five on maternity leave after giving birth to a girl she nicknames \"Iggy\" (short for Enigma). \n\nIn the episode \"Halloween IV\", Gina reveals that in the fourth grade at a classmate's birthday party, a bowling ball fell onto her face. This incident knocked out her two front teeth; she's been wearing false teeth since.\n\nIn season six, Jake helps Gina realize that her talents would be better spent elsewhere and she quits her job. She becomes an internet celebrity and hosts a web show called \"The G-Hive,\" in which she gives her viewers life advice. Her work has made it too busy to spend time with her former coworkers, but she is aiming to improve after Jake confronts her for not talking to them for months. \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Raymond Holt ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Raymond Holt\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Commanding Officer, NYPD 99th Precinct {{small|(seasons 1\u20136; season 7-present)}} \n<br>Head of NYPD public relations {{small| (season 3)}}|Patrol officer {{small|(season 6\u20137)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Andre Braugher]]|Seth Carr (child)}}\n| alias       = Greg Stickney ([[WITSEC]] alias)\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Raymond Jacob Holt\n| spouse      = [[#Kevin Cozner|Kevin Cozner]]\n| significant_other = [[#Frederick|Frederick]] (ex-boyfriend)\n| relatives   = {{ubl|[[#Laverne Holt|Laverne Holt]] (mother)|Unnamed father (deceased)|[[#Debbie|Debbie]] (sister)| [[#Marcus|Marcus]] (nephew)<br>Geoffrey Holt (uncle)<br>Martin Cozner (brother-in-law)<br>Carol Wilg (goddaughter)<br>Gary (ex-brother-in-law)<br>Unnamed uncle (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Andre Braugher 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andre Braugher]]]]\n[[Andre Braugher]] portrays Captain '''Raymond Jacob Holt''', the 99th Precinct's strict Commanding Officer. Holt is known for his cold, calm and robotic manner of speaking, overly formal demeanor and lack of outwardly visible emotion, although his non-work friends frequently refer to him having a much more fun persona that is very rarely seen by either the Nine-Nine members or the viewer. He has sophisticated and cultured interests, enjoying classical music, opera and attending dinner parties with his husband's academic friends, amongst other things. The Nine-Nine is Holt's first command despite many years of outstanding service, and he attributes the delay to prejudice against both his [[race (human classification)|race]] and [[homosexuality]]. He came out in 1987 and until recently led a group that supported LGBT African-American NYPD members, which he himself created.<ref name=castlist/> He was a homicide detective in the 1980s, and spent twelve years in the Community Affairs Bureau immediately prior to commanding the Nine-Nine. \n\nHolt is married to Kevin Cozner, the Chair of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Classics]] Department,<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Party|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 4, 2014|season=1|number=16}}</ref> and has a longstanding professional rivalry with Madeline Wuntch, with whom he came up through the ranks; while his career stalled, she kept advancing and is now his immediate superior. After he and Peralta successfully solved a major case in \"The Chopper\", Bureau Chief Wuntch nominated him for a promotion to head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, a promotion he accepted lest Wuntch transfer his staff to horrible posts around New York City.<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> During the number of weeks he was in charge of Public Affairs, Holt was unable to accomplish anything significant thanks to Chief Wuntch's constant micromanaging. After helping Peralta solve a serial killer case, Holt found himself transferred back to command of the 9-9 by the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> He owned a burgundy [[Chevrolet Corvair]] named Gertie which was his prized possession until it was stolen in \"The Fugitive\". Doug Judy purchased him a new identical one and named it Sexarella.\n\nAt the end of season three, Holt is forced to go into witness protection in Florida with Jake when they are threatened by crime boss Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis. He worked at a family entertainment center called the Fun Zone under the alias of Greg until he and Jake baited Figgis into coming to Florida and took the criminal down with the Nine-Nine. In season five, his life and career are put at risk when he makes a deal with mobster Seamus Murphy in exchange for information to clear Jake and Rosa's names from Lt. Hawkins.\n\nDuring season five, Holt learns that the [[New York City Police Commissioner]] is retiring at the end of the year and that he is on the shortlist of candidates to replace him. He spends the rest of the season campaigning to win the Commissioner title but ends up losing to John Kelly.\n\nIn season six, Holt is encouraged by Jake and Amy to stand up to Kelly's regressive policies, leading the Commissioner to retaliate against the Nine-Nine. However, Peralta and Wuntch team up, without Holt's knowledge, to take Kelly down, resulting in Wuntch being named interim Commissioner. This detente becomes short-lived as Holt is demoted to a uniformed officer by Commissioner Wuntch after she realized he was promoted to detective too soon earlier in his career. Shortly after Wuntch's death, however, he is quickly promoted back to captain in the middle of the seventh season.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Captain Holt.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Meritorious Police Duty (with numeral \"10\")\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", he received a commendation for his supervision of Det.

Despite their inept nature, Hitchcock and Scully have both shown on occasion to be competent and even good detectives, though their laziness tends to keep them from demonstrating this most of the time. As revealed in \"Hitchcock and Scully\", the two were excellent detectives in their youths and had well-built bodies, but their careers and their physiques went downhill after they tried the wings at their eventual favorite restaurant, Wing Slutz.\n\nThe majority of the precinct tends to be disgusted by Hitchcock's more perverted nature and attitude towards women. It's revealed in \"The Last Ride\" (Season 4) that Hitchcock held the all-time record for closed cases at the 99th Precinct, one more than Sgt. Jeffords as of that episode. This is mainly due to Hitchcock being at the 99th twenty years longer than Terry.

He also displayed an uncanny ability to reassemble shredded documents in one episode. Scully routinely discloses disgusting medical issues like the entire bottom of his foot being a wart or having various strains of [[fungi]]. He claims to constantly have medical emergencies, and despite having a [[pacemaker]] fitted, he frequently suffers from [[heart attack]]s. He often embarrasses himself either unintentionally or willingly and admits to being indifferent to the judgment of others (most frequently, the fellow members of his squad.) In the early seasons, Scully is married and has a dog. The team are unsure which one of them is called Kelly, though it is later revealed in season 7 that both of them were named Kelly.

He claims to have changed but Jake and Amy agree that he is still \"The most boring man in America\". He also admits to Amy that he still loves her and proposes to her twice; once in front of his new girlfriend and Jake, and the second time in front of the entire squad.

Wuntch constantly went out of her way to undermine the 99th Precinct, and appeared to take great pleasure in its and Holt's failures; Holt, in turn, gleefully insulted and belittled Wuntch every time their paths cross.  In \"The Chopper\" and \"Johnny and Dora\", she culminated her victory over Holt when she makes him head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, where she humiliated him by making him do menial jobs, although he is eventually transferred back to the 99 thanks to Jake. In \"Suicide Squad\", she helped Jake and the Nine-Nine expose Commissioner Kelly's illegal wiretapping activity and became the acting commissioner until a new one was decided on.

Peralta shows \"class clown\" traits, constantly pulling pranks and making immature jokes at the expense of his colleagues, particularly his partner, Amy Santiago. He is fun-loving and sarcastic but is often motivated by his emotions more than his colleagues. Despite his goofy traits, Peralta is extremely smart, perceptive and quick thinking, and as such has the best arrest rate in the precinct. In the pilot, Terry Jeffords explains to Captain Holt that Peralta is his best detective, that he likes putting away bad guys, and that he loves puzzles, although \"the only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.\" As of season seven, he is 38 years old and has been a detective with the 9-9 since 2005.<ref name=\"Unsolvable\">{{Cite episode|title=Unsolvable|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=March 18, 2014|season=1|number=21}}</ref>\n\nHis father left his family during his childhood and, as a result, he feels a strong tie to memories involving his father, such as his favorite Brooklyn pizza joint. He also initially refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving, since he associates the holiday with his father's absenteeism. He has a strong emotional tie to his muscle car, a 1967 Ford Mustang, which he bought outright on his first day as a cop and always carries a positive association for him (until he sold it to help pay for Terry's new child). He often quotes and makes references to his favorite movie trilogy, ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]''. In \"Boyle-Linetti Wedding\" it is revealed that Jake is Jewish, having lost his childhood sweetheart Jenny Gildenhorn to Eddie Fung at his [[Bar Mitzvah]].\n\nPeralta's best friend is Charles Boyle, who works along with him at the precinct and admires Peralta and encourages his eventual romance with Santiago. Peralta and Gina Linetti are childhood friends, which resulted in him helping Gina get a job at the precinct. Diaz and Peralta were classmates at the police academy.\n\nJake began his career as a patrol officer with the 74th Precinct and was partnered with Stevie Schillens and the two nicknamed themselves the \"Beatsie Boys\"; in 2016, Jake was forced to arrest Stevie, now a detective with the neighboring 98th Precinct for planting evidence.<ref name=\"The 9-8\">{{Cite episode|title=The 9-8|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 9, 2016|season=3|number=15}}</ref> \n\nWhile Jake doesn't initially approve of Captain Holt's strict management, he eventually matures under Holt's supervision and comes to see Holt as a father-figure; even calling him \"Dad\" on many occasions. In \"The Oolong Slayer\", Jake achieves his lifelong dream to catch a serial killer, the Oolong Slayer, but gives up the credit for the arrest to the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives in exchange for effecting Holt's transfer back to the 99th Precinct.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\">{{Cite episode|title=The Oolong Slayer|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=October 18, 2015|season=3|number=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of season four, Jake and Rosa Diaz are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Although he is eager to return to work, his time in prison left him with post-traumatic stress and newfound empathy that affects his job performance.\n\nPeralta continuously pranks and teases his partner Amy Santiago, masking his secret romantic feelings for her. Peralta confesses his feelings to her in \"[[Charges and Specs]]\" before going undercover for a mafia operation. His romantic feelings for her develop further throughout season two and they share their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]].<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\">{{Cite episode|title=Johnny and Dora|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=May 17, 2015|season=2|number=23}}</ref> Jake and Amy start dating in \"[[New Captain]]\" and decide to move in together in the \"[[Greg and Larry]]\", but don't make it official until season four's \"[[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]\".

She attended [[parochial school]], later studied [[ballet]], and was a classmate of Jake's in the police academy.<ref name=\"castlist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/devwatch/brooklyn-nine-nine/|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine (FOX)|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> When she was younger, the pressure for her to succeed at ballet school eventually led her to commit several crimes before landing in juvenile detention. Her parents provided little support, leaving Rosa to turn her life around by herself. \n\nThough Diaz is a loyal and effective member of the squad, her anger management issues and lack of empathy terrify most of her coworkers. She is highly secretive about her personal life \u2013 should anyone discover a secret of hers, she normally threatens them with death should they disclose it. It is also made clear that she does not stay in her apartments for long periods of time, and her neighbors know her by both a different name and a completely different personality. As revealed in \"Cop-Con\", she and Amy are younger than most of the other precinct members as they are hurt by a device that emits a loud noise to those under 35, whereas Jake and Boyle only pretend to be affected by it. In \"White Whale\", she reveals to Amy that she's attended medical school, business school, and has a pilot's license. Rosa also briefly mentions in \"Greg and Larry\" that her name \"Rosa Diaz\" may be an alias to cover up her real name from the rest of the 9-9.\n\nIn season two, Rosa dates Captain Holt's nephew, Marcus, but breaks up with him in season three. Later in the season, she finds love with former undercover detective Adrian Pimento; the two get engaged in \"Paranoia\" while chasing a drug dealer through an alley, but their wedding is delayed when Pimento is targeted by Figgis and forced to leave the state. Once he returns, they try to have their wedding the next day but decide to go steady after realizing they were rushing their relationship.\n\nAt the end of season four, Rosa and Jake are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Following her months of isolation, she starts spending more time with her family and ends her relationship with Pimento. Later in the season, she comes out as bisexual to the precinct and her family, and has a brief relationship with an unseen woman that the squad never meet or learn the name of, nicknamed \"Becky\". She has a brief flirtation with one of Gina's friends, but this does not lead anywhere. On the day of Jake and Amy's wedding, she and Terry meet a cab driver named Alicia that she becomes interested in. The two begin a relationship off-screen. However, it's short-lived, as Rosa mentions in \"The Tattler\" that they broke up because Alicia was moving to London. \n\nIn season six, Rosa begins dating a cosmetologist named Jocelyn and begins to patch up her relationship with her mother, who was initially disapproving of her bisexuality. In season seven, Rosa and Jocelyn broke up prior to the season's Jimmy Jab Games.\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Diaz.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", she received a commendation for her work as the leader of a drug task force.\n\nFirst three-time winner of the Halloween Heist.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Terry Jeffords ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Terry Jeffords\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Sergeant {{small|(seasons 1\u20136)}}|[[Lieutenant]] {{small|(season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Terry Crews]]|Theodore Barnes (child)}}\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Terrence Vincent Jeffords\n| family      = \n| spouse      = [[#Sharon Jeffords|Sharon Jeffords]] (wife)\n| significant_other = {{ubl|[[#Chiaki|Chiaki]] (ex-girlfriend)|[[#Veronica Hopkins|Veronica Hopkins]] (ex-girlfriend)}}\n| children    = {{ubl|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Cagney Jeffords]] (daughter)|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Lacey Jeffords]] (daughter)|Ava Jeffords (daughter)}}\n| relatives   = {{ubl|Lawrence Jeffords (brother)|[[#Zeke|Zeke]] (brother-in-law)|Unnamed father (deceased)|Unnamed grandmother (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Terry Crews by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Terry Crews]]]]\n[[Terry Crews]] portrays Lieutenant (previously Sergeant) '''Terrence \"Terry\" Vincent Jeffords''', the supervisor of the 9-9's Detective Squad. An avid [[bodybuilder]] who stands at more than six feet tall, with a [[linebacker]]'s build, Terry's intimidating size and appearance is contrasted by his caring, protective nature and paternal instincts. Jeffords is devoted to his wife and three young daughters Cagney, Lacey (named after the [[Cagney & Lacey|1980s TV series]]), and Ava. He fears the danger of police work because of the possibility that he could leave his children fatherless. Following a panic attack prior to the show's beginning, Terry was removed from field work, but he has since cautiously returned. He is high-strung, prone to nervous excitement, loves yogurt, and has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person. He is an effective and caring leader to the detective squad, often having to play the mature adult in order to keep them in line.\n\nA running gag throughout the series is for Terry to break things (examples include a Magic 8 Ball, a phone and Captain Holt's office) because of his incredible strength. He has been a detective since 1995 and used to be assigned to the 65th Precinct (as seen in \"Terry Kitties\"), where he was constantly mocked for a botched case which he and Jake later proved he was correct in. In S1.Ep.1. Holt mentions that he and Terry have worked together in the 18th Precinct years prior. In 2005, he was the senior detective at the 9-9 (the position Jake now holds since Terry's promotion). He was a linebacker at [[Syracuse University]], where he graduated ''magna cum laude'', as revealed in \"The Swedes\". He also studied abroad in Japan while in college and dated a Japanese student named Chiaki who broke his heart. He speaks Japanese infrequently throughout the show.\n\nIn season two, Terry nearly gets a [[vasectomy]] at his wife's request, but Jake convinces him not to when he finds out Terry secretly wants to have more kids. His wife becomes pregnant later in the season and gives birth to their third daughter, Ava, in season three. He entrusts Jake to be Ava's godfather.\n\nWhile Terry is satisfied with his role as Sergeant, he aimed to become a Lieutenant during the first six seasons. As revealed in \"The Honeypot\", he brought a new pair of suspenders that he planned to put on after he passed the Lieutenant's Exam but kept them in the box when he ended up failing and held onto them as a reminder of his higher goals. In \"Moo Moo\", he attempted to apply to be a city council liaison to take on more responsibilities but was rejected after reporting that another cop racially profiled him. In season six, Terry reveals to the group that he passed the Lieutenant's Exam weeks before the annual Halloween Heist (which they hosted on Cinco de Mayo).\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Lieutenant Jeffords.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd bronze.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Commendation or Commendation\u2014Integrity\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD Unit Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD Unit Citation\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Amy Santiago===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Amy Santiago\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* Detective {{small|(seasons 1\u20135)}} \n* Sergeant {{small|(season 5\u2013present)}}\n}}\n| portrayer          = [[Melissa Fumero]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| alias              = Isabel Cortez (undercover alias)\n| family             = \n| spouse             = [[#Jake Peralta|Jake Peralta]]\n| significant_other  = {{ubl|[[#Teddy Wells|Teddy Wells]] (ex-boyfriend)|[[#Constantine Kane|Constantine Kane]] (ex-boyfriend)|Luke Mueller (ex-boyfriend)}}\n| children           = \n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Victor Santiago|Victor Santiago]] (father)|[[#Camila Santiago|Camila Santiago]] (mother)|Tony Santiago (brother)|[[#David Santiago|David Santiago]] (brother)|Mason Santiago (nephew)|[[#Roger Peralta|Roger Peralta]] (father-in-law)|[[#Karen Peralta|Karen Peralta]] (mother-in-law)|[[#Kate Peralta|Kate Peralta]] (half sister-in-law)|Five unnamed brothers|Two unnamed half sisters-in-law|An unknown number of half brothers-in-law|Unnamed niece}}\n| religion           = \n| nationality        = Cuban-American\n}}\n[[File:Melissa Fumero May 2018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Melissa Fumero]]]]\n[[Melissa Fumero]] portrays Sergeant (previously Detective) '''Amy Santiago''', Jake's uptight, by-the-book, rule-following [[Cuban-American]] partner, and later wife.<ref name=castlist/> A self-acknowledged [[Type A and Type B personality theory|type A personality]] and neurotic overachiever, she is continually trying to ingratiate herself with Captain Holt, and any authority figure in arm's reach of her. In the pilot, Terry cites Amy's competitiveness to Holt as a result of her having seven brothers. Amy is a stickler for department protocol and is frequently exasperated by Jake's childishness, as well as the ease with which he succeeds as a detective. She is initially seen as Holt's teacher's pet, but over time is shown to command respect from others. \n\nAmy was originally a patrol officer at the 64th precinct but requested a transfer to the 99th when her captain almost sexually assaulted her shortly after her promotion to detective. She didn't tell anyone for years out of fear for what it would do to her career until she revealed it to Jake when they were investigating a sexual assault case in \"He Said, She Said\". \n\nIn [[Charges and Specs]], the season one finale, Jake confesses that he wishes something romantic could happen between them. She confesses to having feelings for Jake in \"[[The Road Trip (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Road Trip]]\", which instigated issues in Amy and Teddy Wells' relationship and is shown to still have feelings for Jake in \"[[Det. Dave Majors]]\". The two share their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]]<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> and begin dating in [[New Captain]], although their working relationship does not change at all. They decide to move in together in the season three finale [[Greg and Larry]], but don't make it official until season four's [[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]. Jake proposes to Amy at the end of their annual Halloween heist in [[HalloVeen]] and the two eventually marry in [[Jake & Amy]]. In \"Ding Dong\", Amy reveals she is pregnant with Jake's child. In \"Admiral Peralta\", it is revealed that Jake and Amy's child is a boy. \n\nNear the end of season three, Amy goes undercover as a pregnant inmate in a women's prison in Texas to obtain information from Maura Figgis. This was done to cover Melissa Fumero's actual pregnancy at the time without making her character pregnant.\n\nAfter some uncertainty in taking the Sergeant's Exam as depicted in \"[[Chasing Amy (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Chasing Amy]]\", she passes the exam and begins wearing her Sergeant's uniform as well as commanding her own uniformed officers in \"[[NutriBoom]]\".\n\nIn season five's \"Casecation\", she is revealed to be 36 years old. In season six's \"The Golden Child\", it is revealed that Amy had a relatively strained relationship with her brother and fellow NYPD Lieutenant David Santiago, chiding her mother for glorifying David's accomplishments over Amy's. Amy enjoys solving crosswords and attending trivia sessions, to the expense of Jake, who often embarrasses himself when attempting to participate or becomes awkwardly excluded in conversation. \n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Sergeant Santiago.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD Baby Delivery Citation.jpg|100px]]\n|Citation bar for delivering a baby\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Charles Boyle ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Charles Boyle\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Male\n| occupation         = Detective\n| portrayer          = [[Joe Lo Truglio]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| spouse             = [[#Eleanor Horstweil|Eleanor Hortsweil]] (ex-wife)\n| significant_other   = {{ubl||[[#Genevieve Mirren-Carter|Genevieve Mirren-Carter]] (girlfriend)|[[#Vivian Ludley|Vivian Ludley]] (ex-fianc\u00e9e)|[[#Gina Linetti|Gina Linetti]] (ex-lover)|[[#Lt.

He is divorced from his wife Eleanor, who had numerous affairs during their marriage, to the point where she has to pay alimony to him. He is also a huge, unapologetic [[foodie]], maintaining a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email and often relishing bizarre foreign cuisine that disgusts his coworkers. \n\nFor saving Detective Diaz's life during \"Christmas\" (during which he was shot in the buttocks), he was awarded the [[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]] in \"The Bet\", though he was overshadowed by a revered and heroic NYPD horse named Sgt Peanut Butter.  In \"The Swedes\", it is revealed that Boyle is a graduate of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].\n\nIn the show's first season, Charles has a crush on Rosa, but he eventually gets over her when he starts dating Vivian Ludley, whom he met at Captain Holt's birthday party. They get engaged but break up after Charles refuses to move to Canada with her. He and Gina start to see each other in season two, and their brief relationship results in his father and Gina's mother's marriage. In season three, he starts dating Genevieve Mirren-Carter after he and Jake clear her name from an art thief. They eventually move in together and adopt a son from Latvia named Nikolaj. \n\nIn season five, Charles starts his own food truck business called \"The One Thing\", which specializes in meatball subs. The truck is burned down by one of Charles' ex-employees, but he's thankful it happened as running the food truck made him spend less time with his family and built up a large debt.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Boyle.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation 1.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:Fictional Police Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar\n|}\n \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Gina Linetti ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Gina Linetti\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| last               = \"Return of the King\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{ubl|[[Administrator (business)|Administrator]] {{small|(Seasons 1\u20136)}}|Internet personality {{small|(Season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer          = [[Chelsea Peretti]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name          = Regina Linetti\n| significant_other   = {{ubl|[[#Charles Boyle|Charles Boyle]] (ex-lover)|[[#Milton Boyle|Milton Boyle]] (lover, father of her child)|Eight unnamed ex-fianc\u00e9s}}\n| children           = The Enigma \"Iggy\" Boyle (daughter)\n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Darlene Linetti|Darlene Linetti]] (mother)|[[#Lynn Boyle|Lynn Boyle]] (stepfather)|Charles Boyle (stepbrother)|Susan Grapecoat (great-aunt)|Anthony (nephew)|Unnamed sibling|Unnamed father}}\n| nationality        = American\n}}\n[[File:Chelsea Peretti at Meltdown (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Chelsea Peretti]]]]\n[[Chelsea Peretti]] portrays '''Regina \"Gina\" Linetti''', the 99th Precinct's sardonic and egomaniacal civilian administrator and Captain Holt's assistant.<ref name=castlist/> Despite maintaining a clueless and dimwitted disposition most of the time, she can be surprisingly observant and has demonstrated traits of being more intelligent than she likes to show. Gina is obsessed with social media and is constantly on her phone. It is a running gag to try to pry her from her phone, to the point where Captain Holt becomes involved. She is extremely narcissistic and constantly praises and exalts herself, such as claiming to be a better dancer than [[Britney Spears]] in the episode \"Karen Peralta\". As the only civilian in the precinct, Gina often uses her outsider's perspective to assist the other detectives. In the episode \"The Party\", to prevent the mostly [[working class]] detectives from embarrassing themselves in front of a crowd of [[academia|academics]], Rosa tricks Gina into talking to a group of psychology professors at Holt's birthday party, who then take copious notes about her narcissistic personality. They conclude that she has a complete overlap of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], a condition previously thought to be purely theoretical.\n\nShe casually admits on myriad occasions that she doesn't value her colleagues \u2013 except for Jake \u2013 as people. She was also childhood friends with Jake, who got her the job at the precinct. Gina also ruined Jake's senior year of high school by framing him as \"The Tattler\", though she did it to avoid Jake getting involved with the wrong crowd. She transferred to the Public relations Division with Captain Holt in \"Johnny and Dora\", and returns to the 9-9 with him in \"The Oolong Slayer\".<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/><ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> In the episode \"The Apartment\", it is revealed that she has been engaged eight times, but never married. At the end of \"The Fugitive Pt. 2\", she gets hit by a bus after receiving a text from Charles. The penultimate episode of season four reveals she has become pregnant following a relationship with Charles' cousin, Milton (which coincided with Chelsea Peretti's actual pregnancy). She is absent for the first half of season five on maternity leave after giving birth to a girl she nicknames \"Iggy\" (short for Enigma). \n\nIn the episode \"Halloween IV\", Gina reveals that in the fourth grade at a classmate's birthday party, a bowling ball fell onto her face. This incident knocked out her two front teeth; she's been wearing false teeth since.\n\nIn season six, Jake helps Gina realize that her talents would be better spent elsewhere and she quits her job. She becomes an internet celebrity and hosts a web show called \"The G-Hive,\" in which she gives her viewers life advice. Her work has made it too busy to spend time with her former coworkers, but she is aiming to improve after Jake confronts her for not talking to them for months. \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Raymond Holt ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Raymond Holt\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Commanding Officer, NYPD 99th Precinct {{small|(seasons 1\u20136; season 7-present)}} \n<br>Head of NYPD public relations {{small| (season 3)}}|Patrol officer {{small|(season 6\u20137)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Andre Braugher]]|Seth Carr (child)}}\n| alias       = Greg Stickney ([[WITSEC]] alias)\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Raymond Jacob Holt\n| spouse      = [[#Kevin Cozner|Kevin Cozner]]\n| significant_other = [[#Frederick|Frederick]] (ex-boyfriend)\n| relatives   = {{ubl|[[#Laverne Holt|Laverne Holt]] (mother)|Unnamed father (deceased)|[[#Debbie|Debbie]] (sister)| [[#Marcus|Marcus]] (nephew)<br>Geoffrey Holt (uncle)<br>Martin Cozner (brother-in-law)<br>Carol Wilg (goddaughter)<br>Gary (ex-brother-in-law)<br>Unnamed uncle (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Andre Braugher 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andre Braugher]]]]\n[[Andre Braugher]] portrays Captain '''Raymond Jacob Holt''', the 99th Precinct's strict Commanding Officer. Holt is known for his cold, calm and robotic manner of speaking, overly formal demeanor and lack of outwardly visible emotion, although his non-work friends frequently refer to him having a much more fun persona that is very rarely seen by either the Nine-Nine members or the viewer. He has sophisticated and cultured interests, enjoying classical music, opera and attending dinner parties with his husband's academic friends, amongst other things. The Nine-Nine is Holt's first command despite many years of outstanding service, and he attributes the delay to prejudice against both his [[race (human classification)|race]] and [[homosexuality]]. He came out in 1987 and until recently led a group that supported LGBT African-American NYPD members, which he himself created.<ref name=castlist/> He was a homicide detective in the 1980s, and spent twelve years in the Community Affairs Bureau immediately prior to commanding the Nine-Nine. \n\nHolt is married to Kevin Cozner, the Chair of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Classics]] Department,<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Party|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 4, 2014|season=1|number=16}}</ref> and has a longstanding professional rivalry with Madeline Wuntch, with whom he came up through the ranks; while his career stalled, she kept advancing and is now his immediate superior. After he and Peralta successfully solved a major case in \"The Chopper\", Bureau Chief Wuntch nominated him for a promotion to head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, a promotion he accepted lest Wuntch transfer his staff to horrible posts around New York City.<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> During the number of weeks he was in charge of Public Affairs, Holt was unable to accomplish anything significant thanks to Chief Wuntch's constant micromanaging. After helping Peralta solve a serial killer case, Holt found himself transferred back to command of the 9-9 by the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> He owned a burgundy [[Chevrolet Corvair]] named Gertie which was his prized possession until it was stolen in \"The Fugitive\". Doug Judy purchased him a new identical one and named it Sexarella.\n\nAt the end of season three, Holt is forced to go into witness protection in Florida with Jake when they are threatened by crime boss Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis. He worked at a family entertainment center called the Fun Zone under the alias of Greg until he and Jake baited Figgis into coming to Florida and took the criminal down with the Nine-Nine. In season five, his life and career are put at risk when he makes a deal with mobster Seamus Murphy in exchange for information to clear Jake and Rosa's names from Lt. Hawkins.\n\nDuring season five, Holt learns that the [[New York City Police Commissioner]] is retiring at the end of the year and that he is on the shortlist of candidates to replace him. He spends the rest of the season campaigning to win the Commissioner title but ends up losing to John Kelly.\n\nIn season six, Holt is encouraged by Jake and Amy to stand up to Kelly's regressive policies, leading the Commissioner to retaliate against the Nine-Nine. However, Peralta and Wuntch team up, without Holt's knowledge, to take Kelly down, resulting in Wuntch being named interim Commissioner. This detente becomes short-lived as Holt is demoted to a uniformed officer by Commissioner Wuntch after she realized he was promoted to detective too soon earlier in his career. Shortly after Wuntch's death, however, he is quickly promoted back to captain in the middle of the seventh season.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Captain Holt.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Meritorious Police Duty (with numeral \"10\")\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", he received a commendation for his supervision of Det.

As revealed in \"Hitchcock and Scully\", the two were excellent detectives in their youths and had well-built bodies, but their careers and their physiques went downhill after they tried the wings at their eventual favorite restaurant, Wing Slutz.\n\nThe majority of the precinct tends to be disgusted by Hitchcock's more perverted nature and attitude towards women. It's revealed in \"The Last Ride\" (Season 4) that Hitchcock held the all-time record for closed cases at the 99th Precinct, one more than Sgt. Jeffords as of that episode. This is mainly due to Hitchcock being at the 99th twenty years longer than Terry.

He also displayed an uncanny ability to reassemble shredded documents in one episode. Scully routinely discloses disgusting medical issues like the entire bottom of his foot being a wart or having various strains of [[fungi]]. He claims to constantly have medical emergencies, and despite having a [[pacemaker]] fitted, he frequently suffers from [[heart attack]]s. He often embarrasses himself either unintentionally or willingly and admits to being indifferent to the judgment of others (most frequently, the fellow members of his squad.) In the early seasons, Scully is married and has a dog. The team are unsure which one of them is called Kelly, though it is later revealed in season 7 that both of them were named Kelly.

{"title_page": "Pope Pius XI and Germany", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922\u20131939), the [[Weimar Republic]] transitioned into [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1933, the ailing [[Paul von Hindenberg|President von Hindenberg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor of Germany in a Coalition Cabinet, and the [[Holy See]] concluded the [[Reich concordat]] treaty with the still nominally functioning Weimar state later that year. Hoping to secure the rights of the Church in Germany, the Church agreed to a requirement that clergy cease to participate in politics. The Hitler regime routinely violated the treaty, and launched a [[kirchenkampf|persecution]] of the Catholic Church in Germany.\n\nClaiming jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, the Nazis interfered with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies, and human rights abuses increased as the Nazis consolidated their power. In 1937, Pius XI issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical which denounced the regime's breaches of the Concordat, along with the racial and nationalist idolatry which underpinned [[Nazi ideology]]. Pius accused the Nazi Government of sowing \"fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\", and noted on the horizon the \"threatening storm clouds\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany. Following the 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom, Pius joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom, and antisemitism, sparking protest from the Nazis. Pius XI died in 1939, on the eve of [[World War II]], and was succeeded by his Cardinal Secretary of State, [[Eugenio Pacelli]], who took the name Pius XII, and was to govern the Church through the war, [[The Holocaust]], and the remainder of the Nazi period.\n\n==Diplomacy==\n===Reichskonkordat===\n{{main article|Reichskonkordat}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R24391, Konkordatsunterzeichnung in Rom.jpg|thumb|Signing of the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' on 20 July 1933.

Wagner said if the Church had not signed a concordat with Germany, the National Socialist government would have abolished the Catholic Youth organisations altogether, and placed them in the same 'anti-state' category as the Marxist groups. ... If the maintenance of Catholic education and of the Catholic Youth associations was, as we have seen often enough before, the principal aim of Papal diplomacy, then his phrase, 'the Concordat prevented greater evils' seems justified. ... The German episcopate considered that neither the Concordats up to then negotiated with individual German States (Lander), nor the Weimar Constitution gave adequate guarantees or assurance to the faithful of respect for their convictions, rights or liberty of action. In such conditions the guarantees could not be secured except through a settlement having the solemn form of a concordat with the central government of the Reich, I would add that since it was the German government which made the proposal, the responsibility for all the regrettable consequences would have fallen on the Holy See if it had refused the proposed Concordat. Although the Church had few illusions about National Socialism, it must be recognized that the Concordat in the years that followed brought some advantages, or at least prevented worse evils. In fact, in spite of all the violations to which it was subjected, it gave German Catholics a juridical basis for their defence, a stronghold behind which to shield themselves in their oppositions to the ever-growing campaign of religious persecution.\"</ref>\n\nThe treaty was to be an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria.<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.118</ref> The Bavarian region, the Rhineland and Westphalia as well as parts in southwest Germany, were predominantly Catholic, and the church had previously enjoyed a degree of privilege there. North Germany was heavily Protestant, and Catholics had suffered some discrimination. In the late 1800s, Bismarck's [[Kulturkampf]] had been an attempt to almost eliminate Catholic institutions in Germany, or at least their strong connections outside of Germany. With this background, Catholic officials wanted a concordat strongly guaranteeing the church's freedoms. Once Hitler came to power and started enacting laws restricting movement of funds (making it impossible for German Catholics to send money to missionaries, for instance), restricting religious institutions and education, and mandating attendance at Hitler Youth functions (held on Sunday mornings to interfere with Church attendance), the need for a concordat seemed even more urgent to church officials.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 and the [[Weimar constitution]] of 1919 had thoroughly reformed the former relationship between state and churches. Therefore the [[Holy See]], represented in Germany by [[Nuncio]] [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], the future Pope Pius XII, made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933''.</ref> Catholic politicians from the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] repeatedly pushed for a concordat with the new [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]]. In February 1930 Pacelli became the Vatican's Secretary of State, and thus responsible for the Church's foreign policy, and in this position continued to work towards this 'great goal'.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Klaus Scholder \"The Churches and the Third Reich\".</ref>\n\nPius XI was eager to negotiate concordats with any country that was willing to do so, thinking that written treaties were the best way to protect the Church's rights against governments increasingly inclined to interfere in such matters. Twelve concordats were signed during his reign with various types of governments, including some German state governments, and with [[Austria]].\n\nOn the level of the states, concordats were achieved with [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden Germany|Baden]] (1932). On the national level, however, negotiations failed for several reasons: the fragility of the national government; opposition from Socialist and Protestant deputies in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]; and discord among the German bishops and between them and the Holy See. In particular the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.\n\nWhen [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 and asked for a concordat, Pius XI accepted. Negotiations were conducted on his behalf by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who later became [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939 &ndash; 1958). The [[Reichskonkordat]] was signed by Pacelli and by the German government in June 1933, and included guarantees of liberty for the Church, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools.\n\n===Negotiations with Hitler===\nOn 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor. On 23 March 1933, his government was given dictatorial powers through an [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] passed by all parties in the Reichstag except the Social Democrats and Communists (whose deputies had already been arrested). Hitler had obtained the votes of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], led by Prelate [[Ludwig Kaas]], by issuing oral guarantees of the party's continued existence and the autonomy of the Church and her educational institutions. He also promised good relations with the Holy See, which some interpret as a hint to a future concordat.\n\nCardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] wrote to [[Cardinal Pacelli]] on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\".<ref name=\"firstthings.com\">\"''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''\", [[Martin Rhonheimer]], First Things Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 5 July 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016114240/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |archivedate=16 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHitler met the representative of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference, Bishop [[Wilhelm Berning]] of Osnabr\u00fcck, on 26 April. At the meeting, Hitler declared:\n<blockquote>\nI have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.\n</blockquote>\nThe notes of the meeting do not record any response by Bishop Berning. In the opinion of [[Martin Rhonheimer]] \"This is hardly surprising: for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was really nothing terribly objectionable in this historically correct reminder. And on this occasion, as always, Hitler was concealing his true intentions.\"<ref name=\"firstthings.com\"/> In April, Hitler sent his vice chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], a Catholic nobleman and former member of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], to Rome to offer negotiations about a ''Reichskonkordat''. On behalf of Cardinal Pacelli, [[Ludwig Kaas]], the out-going chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated the draft of the terms with Papen. One of Hitler's key conditions for agreeing to the concordat, in violation of earlier promises, had been the dissolution of the Centre Party, which occurred on 5 July.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Toland & Atkin.{{Clarify|date=November 2008}}</ref>\n\nShortly before signing the Reichskonkordat on 20 July, Germany signed similar agreements with the major [[Protestant]] churches in Germany. The concordat was finally signed, by Pacelli for the Vatican and von Papen for Germany, on 20 July.

The pressure exercised by the Nazi party on Catholic officials to betray their faith was lambasted as 'base, illegal and inhuman'.

There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the 'idolatrous cult' which replaced belief in the true God with a 'national religion' and the 'myth of race and blood'. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home 'for all peoples and all nations'. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, ''Divini Redemptoris'' denouncing Communism, declaring its principles 'intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever', detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and 'amoral liberalism'. The language of ''Divini Redemptoris'' was stronger than that of ''Mit Brennender Sorge'', its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope's own loathing of Communism as the ultimate enemy. The last year of his life, however, left no one any doubt of his total repudiation of the right-wing tyrannies in Germany and, despite his instinctive sympathy with some aspects of Fascism, increasingly in Italy also.

He had, however, few tangible successes. There had been little improvement in the position of the Church in Germany and there was growing hostility to the Church in Italy on the part of the fascist regime. Almost the only positive result of the last years of his pontificate was a closer relationship with the liberal democracies and yet, even this was seen by many as representing a highly partisan stance on the part of the Pope. In the age of appeasement, the pugnacious obstinancy of Pius XI was held to be contributing more to the polarization of Europe than to its pacification.\"<ref>Peter Kent, p. 601</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Nazi Germany and Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Germany\u2013Holy See relations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922\u20131939), the [[Weimar Republic]] transitioned into [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1933, the ailing [[Paul von Hindenberg|President von Hindenberg]] appointed [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor of Germany in a Coalition Cabinet, and the [[Holy See]] concluded the [[Reich concordat]] treaty with the still nominally functioning Weimar state later that year. Hoping to secure the rights of the Church in Germany, the Church agreed to a requirement that clergy cease to participate in politics. The Hitler regime routinely violated the treaty, and launched a [[kirchenkampf|persecution]] of the Catholic Church in Germany.\n\nClaiming jurisdiction over all collective and social activity, the Nazis interfered with Catholic schooling, youth groups, workers' clubs and cultural societies, and human rights abuses increased as the Nazis consolidated their power. In 1937, Pius XI issued the ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical which denounced the regime's breaches of the Concordat, along with the racial and nationalist idolatry which underpinned [[Nazi ideology]]. Pius accused the Nazi Government of sowing \"fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church\", and noted on the horizon the \"threatening storm clouds\" of religious wars of extermination over Germany. Following the 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom, Pius joined Western leaders in condemning the pogrom, and antisemitism, sparking protest from the Nazis.

Wagner said if the Church had not signed a concordat with Germany, the National Socialist government would have abolished the Catholic Youth organisations altogether, and placed them in the same 'anti-state' category as the Marxist groups. ... If the maintenance of Catholic education and of the Catholic Youth associations was, as we have seen often enough before, the principal aim of Papal diplomacy, then his phrase, 'the Concordat prevented greater evils' seems justified. ... The German episcopate considered that neither the Concordats up to then negotiated with individual German States (Lander), nor the Weimar Constitution gave adequate guarantees or assurance to the faithful of respect for their convictions, rights or liberty of action. In such conditions the guarantees could not be secured except through a settlement having the solemn form of a concordat with the central government of the Reich, I would add that since it was the German government which made the proposal, the responsibility for all the regrettable consequences would have fallen on the Holy See if it had refused the proposed Concordat. Although the Church had few illusions about National Socialism, it must be recognized that the Concordat in the years that followed brought some advantages, or at least prevented worse evils. In fact, in spite of all the violations to which it was subjected, it gave German Catholics a juridical basis for their defence, a stronghold behind which to shield themselves in their oppositions to the ever-growing campaign of religious persecution.\"</ref>\n\nThe treaty was to be an extension of existing concordats already signed with Prussia and Bavaria.<ref>Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.118</ref> The Bavarian region, the Rhineland and Westphalia as well as parts in southwest Germany, were predominantly Catholic, and the church had previously enjoyed a degree of privilege there. North Germany was heavily Protestant, and Catholics had suffered some discrimination. In the late 1800s, Bismarck's [[Kulturkampf]] had been an attempt to almost eliminate Catholic institutions in Germany, or at least their strong connections outside of Germany. With this background, Catholic officials wanted a concordat strongly guaranteeing the church's freedoms. Once Hitler came to power and started enacting laws restricting movement of funds (making it impossible for German Catholics to send money to missionaries, for instance), restricting religious institutions and education, and mandating attendance at Hitler Youth functions (held on Sunday mornings to interfere with Church attendance), the need for a concordat seemed even more urgent to church officials.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 and the [[Weimar constitution]] of 1919 had thoroughly reformed the former relationship between state and churches. Therefore the [[Holy See]], represented in Germany by [[Nuncio]] [[Pope Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], the future Pope Pius XII, made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments.<ref name=\"Volk\">Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933''.</ref> Catholic politicians from the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] repeatedly pushed for a concordat with the new [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]]. In February 1930 Pacelli became the Vatican's Secretary of State, and thus responsible for the Church's foreign policy, and in this position continued to work towards this 'great goal'.<ref name=\"Volk\"/><ref>Klaus Scholder \"The Churches and the Third Reich\".</ref>\n\nPius XI was eager to negotiate concordats with any country that was willing to do so, thinking that written treaties were the best way to protect the Church's rights against governments increasingly inclined to interfere in such matters. Twelve concordats were signed during his reign with various types of governments, including some German state governments, and with [[Austria]].\n\nOn the level of the states, concordats were achieved with [[Bavaria]] (1924), [[Prussia]] (1929) and [[Baden Germany|Baden]] (1932).  On the national level, however, negotiations failed for several reasons: the fragility of the national government; opposition from Socialist and Protestant deputies in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]; and discord among the German bishops and between them and the Holy See. In particular the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.\n\nWhen [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 and asked for a concordat, Pius XI accepted. Negotiations were conducted on his behalf by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who later became [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939 &ndash; 1958). The [[Reichskonkordat]] was signed by Pacelli and by the German government in June 1933, and included guarantees of liberty for the Church, independence for Catholic organisations and youth groups, and religious teaching in schools.\n\n===Negotiations with Hitler===\nOn 30 January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor. On 23 March 1933, his government was given dictatorial powers through an [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] passed by all parties in the Reichstag except the Social Democrats and Communists (whose deputies had already been arrested). Hitler had obtained the votes of the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], led by Prelate [[Ludwig Kaas]], by issuing oral guarantees of the party's continued existence and the autonomy of the Church and her educational institutions. He also promised good relations with the Holy See, which some interpret as a hint to a future concordat.\n\nCardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] wrote to [[Cardinal Pacelli]] on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\".<ref name=\"firstthings.com\">\"''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''\", [[Martin Rhonheimer]], First Things Magazine, November 2003, retrieved 5 July 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016114240/http://www.firstthings.com/article/2007/01/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said-10 |archivedate=16 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHitler met the representative of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference, Bishop [[Wilhelm Berning]] of Osnabr\u00fcck, on 26 April. At the meeting, Hitler declared:\n<blockquote>\n\u201cI have been attacked because of my handling of the Jewish question. The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented.

The pressure exercised by the Nazi party on Catholic officials to betray their faith was lambasted as 'base, illegal and inhuman'.

''Mit Brennender Sorge'' ('With Burning Anxiety') denounced both specific government actions against the Church in breach of the concordat and Nazi racial theory more generally. There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the 'idolatrous cult' which replaced belief in the true God with a 'national religion' and the 'myth of race and blood'. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home 'for all peoples and all nations'. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, ''Divini Redemptoris'' denouncing Communism, declaring its principles 'intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever', detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and 'amoral liberalism'. The language of ''Divini Redemptoris'' was stronger than that of ''Mit Brennender Sorge'', its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope's own loathing of Communism as the ultimate enemy. The last year of his life, however, left no one any doubt of his total repudiation of the right-wing tyrannies in Germany and, despite his instinctive sympathy with some aspects of Fascism, increasingly in Italy also.

He had single-mindedly continued to denounce the evils of the nazi regime at every possible opportunity and feared above all else the re-opening of the rift between Church and State in his beloved Italy. He had, however, few tangible successes. There had been little improvement in the position of the Church in Germany and there was growing hostility to the Church in Italy on the part of the fascist regime. Almost the only positive result of the last years of his pontificate was a closer relationship with the liberal democracies and yet, even this was seen by many as representing a highly partisan stance on the part of the Pope. In the age of appeasement, the pugnacious obstinancy of Pius XI was held to be contributing more to the polarization of Europe than to its pacification.\"<ref>Peter Kent, p. 601</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catholic Church and Nazi Germany]]\n*[[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Foreign relations of Nazi Germany]]\n[[Category:Nazi Germany and Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Germany\u2013Holy See relations]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNegotiations with Hitler:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI_and_Germany"}

{"title_page": "Maudood Chishti", "text_new": "[[Image:Maudood Chishti.jpg|thumb|300px|Mausoleum of Maudood Chishti, Chist, [[Afghanistan]]]]\n{{Islam}}\n'''Maudood Chishti''' (also known as Qutubuddin, Shams Sufiyaan and Chiraag Chishtiyaan) was an early day [[Sufi]] Saint, a successor to his father and master [[Abu Yusuf Bin Saamaan]], twelfth link in the [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[silsilah]] of [[Chishti Order]], and the Master of [[Shareef Zandani]]. He was born around 430 [[Islamic Calendar|Hijri]] in the city of [[Chishti Sharif|Chisht]]. He initially received education from his father. He memorized the [[Qur'an]] by age 7 and completed his education when he was 16. His work includes two books, ''Minhaaj ul Arifeen'' and ''Khulaasat ul Shariah''. He died in the month of [[Rajab]] at the age of 97 in 533 AH (March 1139 CE). He was buried at Chisht like many of the early Chishtiyya.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qKhWAAAAMAAJ&q=Maudood+Chishti&dq=Maudood+Chishti&ei=a0GmSanPMJSqkASmv5GKDg&pgis=1] The big five of India in Sufism: holy biographies of 1. Hazrat Khwaja ... By Wahiduddin Begg</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Tasawuf===\nHazrat Khwaja Al Mawdud Chisti became the mureed of Hazrat Khwaja Nasir [[Abu Yusuf Bin Saamaan]] Chisti. After he became a mureed, his murshid (Master) addressed him by saying, \"O Qutubuddin Mowdud, adopt the path of the Faqr.\" The word \"faqr\" is literally translated as \"poverty\", but in the language of [[Tasawuf|tasawwuf]], it means to be rich with [[Allah]]. It is for one to have total trust in Allah and not to be dependent on any other than Allah. [[Faqar]] is the way of true dervishes. Khwaja Mawdud Al Chisti accepted his [[murshid]]s ([[Spirituality|spiritual]] guidance) advice. Shortly thereafter he went into seclusion and remained absorbed in worship for twenty years. During this period, he rarely ate and was reported to complete two recitations of the Quran during the day and two during the night. He also used to constantly make the [[zikr]] of La Ilaha Illallah. Due to his consistent worship, everything in the universe became apparent to him, and nothing was kept hidden.\n\n===Khwaja Maudood's Khalifa===\nKhwaja Mawdud Chishti visited Balkh (the place of birth of Jalaluddin Rumi) and Bukhara, a place mentioned in the famous line of Hafez, \"If that Turk of Shiraz would take my heart in his hand, I would give for his Hindu mole both Bukhara and Samarkand.\" Khwaja Haji Sharif Zindani, his successor, renounced everything. He led a life of strict seclusion for 40 years and hated society. He used to live on leaves of trees. Although several of the Chishtiyya stressed the value of asceticism, in general they said that seclusion and ascetic practice was for short periods only. Live in the midst of society rather than keep your spiritual ideals. It is said that the followers of Khwaja Qutubuddin were around 10,000, not including close friends and allies. It is impossible to enumerate Khwaja Mawdud's Khulafa. For the sake of barakat, a few are mentioned hereunder.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*Khwaja Abu Ahmed\n*Khwaja Ahmad Zandani\n*Shah Sanjan\n*Shaikh Abu Nasseer Shakeeban\n*Shaikh Hassan Tibti\n*Shaikh Ahmed Baderoon\n*Khwaja Sabz Paush\n*Shaikh Uthman Awwal\n*Khwaja Abul Hassan\n*[[Ataa Ullah Khan Wato Kheshgi]]\n}}\nAmong them the link in this (CHISTI) Silsila is Khwaja Shareef Zindani. That is why his message spread. His influence spread west to Khurasan, Iraq, Syria, Hijaz, and Tihamah and in the south to Iran, Siestan and the subcontinent. In the west, his message was spread by the likes of Sharif Zindani and Khwaja Usman Harooni. Khwaja Qutubuddin was 29 when his father died and he inherited the throne. He never visited the rich or went to the royal courts. He was a simple man who led a simple life. He was always courteous to the needs of others. He always was the first to greet people and respected everyone.<ref>{{google books|sIMwAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>\n\n===Books===\nChisti's works include two books, ''Minhaaj ul Areifeen'' and ''Khulaasat ul Shariah''.\n\n===Sayings===\n#. The lover of sama' (Sufi music) is a stranger to the outside world, but is a friend to God.\n#. The mysteries of sama' are inexplicable. If you reveal them you are liable to punishment.\n\n===Miracles===\n* Moulana Zakariyah says: \"Khwajah Maudood Chisti acquired the capabilities known as Kash-e-Quloob (revelations of the conditions of the hearts) and Kashf-e-Quboor (revelation of the conditions of the graves).\"<ref>Malfozat-e-Khwaja Fareeduddin Ganjshakar</ref>\n* Whenever Khwaja Maudood Chishti wanted to see the Ka'aba, he could see it even though he was in Chisht.<ref>(Malfoozat Khwaja Qutubuddin Bukhtiar Kaki, Fariduddin Ganj Shakar)</ref>\n* Khwaja Qutbuddin Maudood Chishti's dead body flew in the air on its way to the graveyard. Khwaja Fareeduddin Ganj Shakar upon narrating this fell unconscious.<ref>(Rahatil-Quloob, Ganj Shakar)</ref>\n\n==Descendants==\n[[Khwaja]] Maudood Chishti's son Khwaja Najamuddin Ahmed Ahmed Mushtaq Bin Moudod [[Chishti]] was buried at Chisht. [[Syed]] Abul Alla Moudodi was a descendant of his who was born at Aurangabad [[India]] in 1903 [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]]{{Clarify|date=November 2011}}<!-- That date is in the future! -->. Many of his descendants live in the area. [[Khwaja Wali Kirani]] Moudodi Chishti [[Kirani]] and Khwaja Mir Shahdad Moudodi Chishti Kirani are also Khwaja Maudood Chishti's descendants. The tombs of both these famous saints are in a place called [[Kirani]], west of [[Quetta]] city. A large number of his descendants still live in Kirani. [[Khwaja Ibrahim]] Yukpassi another important [[saint]] belonging to Khwaja Maudood Chishti's family is buried in [[Mastung, Pakistan|Mastung]] [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and [[Khwaja Dopassi]] is buried in [[Dhadar]] near the beginning of [[Bolan Pass|Bolan]] pass Balochistan [[Pakistan]].\n\nDescendants Khwaja Qutubuddin Mohammad Thani Chishti migrated to Sindh Old Bukkhar (near Shahdadkot). One of this family descendants named Khwaja Assadullah Kunjnashin Bukkhari migrated to Nawada-Gaya areas of Bihar, India. His followers preached Islam and guided the Muslims there. [[Khwaja Abdullah Chishti]] and Hazrat Taj Mahmood Haqqani Chishti were the Sufi saints of Chishti order and direct descendants of Maudood Chishti's son. Their shrines are situated in Milkitola Chhota Sheikhpura, Narhat block near Hisua (GPRS 24 83N 85 43E)\n\n===Descendants in Balochistan===\nDescendant Khwaja [[Nizam-ud-din Alli]]'s tomb is in the vicinity of [[Pishin, Pakistan|Pishin]] city of Balochistan in a place called Minziki, home for many other descendants. Khwaja Naqruddin Chishti Moudodi (Shaal Pir Baba) is another descendant whose tomb is in Balochistan, located in Quetta chaowni near the old fort. In the valley of shal kot (Quetta) and Bolan in the Balochistan province the influence of the Moudodi family reached within the lifetime of the head of the family. According to one source Khwaja Qutubuddin Moudod visited the area at least once. He came to the home of his follower Shiekh Babut in the area of Shoroak. Shiekh Babut belonged to the pashtoon tribe called 'Bariech'. During the lifetime of Khwaja Moudod Chishti his friends and followers started to spread the message of Islam. Later on Khwaja Qutubuddin Moudod Chishti's own family (the sadat) advanced the message of Islam in greater Balochistan and molded the life of ordinary people according to the ideology of Islam.\n\n*(16) \u2013  Syed Khwaja Qutubuddin Maudood Chishti in Chisht Hirat [[Afghanistan]].(B430h D527h)\n*(18) \u2013  Syed Rukun ud din [[Khwaja Hussain Chishti]] in Chisht Hirat Afghanistan.(B545h D635h)\n*(19) \u2013  Syed Qud ud din [[Khwaja Mohammad]] in Chisht Hirat Afghanistan.

He was born around 430 [[Islamic Calendar|Hijri]] in the city of [[Chishti Sharif|Chisht]]. He initially received education from his father. He memorized the [[Qur'an]] by age 7 and completed his education when he was 16. His work includes two books, ''Minhaaj ul Arifeen'' and ''Khulaasat ul Shariah''. He died in the month of [[Rajab]] at the age of 97 in 533 AH (March 1139 CE). He was buried at Chisht like many of the early Chishtiyya.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qKhWAAAAMAAJ&q=Maudood+Chishti&dq=Maudood+Chishti&ei=a0GmSanPMJSqkASmv5GKDg&pgis=1] The big five of India in Sufism: holy biographies of 1. Hazrat Khwaja ... By Wahiduddin Begg</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Tasawuf===\nHazrat Khwaja Al Mawdud Chisti became the mureed of Hazrat Khwaja Nasir [[Abu Yusuf Bin Saamaan]] Chisti. After he became a mureed, his murshid (Master) addressed him by saying, \"O Qutubuddin Mowdud, adopt the path of the Faqr.\" The word \"faqr\" is literally translated as \"poverty\", but in the language of [[Tasawuf|tasawwuf]], it means to be rich with [[Allah]]. It is for one to have total trust in Allah and not to be dependent on any other than Allah. [[Faqar]] is the way of true dervishes. Khwaja Mawdud Al Chisti accepted his [[murshid]]s ([[Spirituality|spiritual]] guidance) advice. Shortly thereafter he went into seclusion and remained absorbed in worship for twenty years. During this period, he rarely ate and was reported to complete two recitations of the Quran during the day and two during the night. He also used to constantly make the [[zikr]] of La Ilaha Illallah. Due to his consistent worship, everything in the universe became apparent to him, and nothing was kept hidden.\n\n===Khwaja Maudood's Khalifa===\nKhwaja Mawdud Chishti visited Balkh (the place of birth of Jalaluddin Rumi) and Bukhara, a place mentioned in the famous line of Hafez, \"If that Turk of Shiraz would take my heart in his hand, I would give for his Hindu mole both Bukhara and Samarkand.\" Khwaja Haji Sharif Zindani, his successor, renounced everything. He led a life of strict seclusion for 40 years and hated society. He used to live on leaves of trees. Although several of the Chishtiyya stressed the value of asceticism, in general they said that seclusion and ascetic practice was for short periods only. Live in the midst of society rather than keep your spiritual ideals. It is said that the followers of Khwaja Qutubuddin were around 10,000, not including close friends and allies. It is impossible to enumerate Khwaja Mawdud's Khulafa. For the sake of barakat, a few are mentioned hereunder.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*Khwaja Abu Ahmed\n*Khwaja Ahmad Zandani\n*Shah Sanjan\n*Shaikh Abu Nasseer Shakeeban\n*Shaikh Hassan Tibti\n*Shaikh Ahmed Baderoon\n*Khwaja Sabz Paush\n*Shaikh Uthman Awwal\n*Khwaja Abul Hassan\n*[[Ataa Ullah Khan Wato Kheshgi]]\n}}\nAmong them the link in this (CHISTI) Silsila is Khwaja Shareef Zindani. That is why his message spread. His influence spread west to Khurasan, Iraq, Syria, Hijaz, and Tihamah and in the south to Iran, Siestan and the subcontinent. In the west, his message was spread by the likes of Sharif Zindani and Khwaja Usman Harooni. Khwaja Qutubuddin was 29 when his father died and he inherited the throne. He never visited the rich or went to the royal courts. He was a simple man who led a simple life. He was always courteous to the needs of others. He always was the first to greet people and respected everyone.<ref>{{google books|sIMwAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>\n\n===Books===\nChisti's works include two books, ''Minhaaj ul Areifeen'' and ''Khulaasat ul Shariah''.\n\n===Sayings===\n#. The lover of sama' (Sufi music) is a stranger to the outside world, but is a friend to God.\n#. The mysteries of sama' are inexplicable. If you reveal them you are liable to punishment.\n\n===Miracles===\n* Moulana Zakariyah says: \"Khwajah Maudood Chisti acquired the capabilities known as Kash-e-Quloob (revelations of the conditions of the hearts) and Kashf-e-Quboor (revelation of the conditions of the graves).\"<ref>Malfozat-e-Khwaja Fareeduddin Ganjshakar</ref>\n* Whenever Khwaja Maudood Chishti wanted to see the Ka'aba, he could see it even though he was in Chisht.<ref>(Malfoozat Khwaja Qutubuddin Bukhtiar Kaki, Fariduddin Ganj Shakar)</ref>\n* Khwaja Qutbuddin Maudood Chishti's dead body flew in the air on its way to the graveyard. Khwaja Fareeduddin Ganj Shakar upon narrating this fell unconscious.<ref>(Rahatil-Quloob, Ganj Shakar)</ref>\n\n==Descendants==\n[[Khwaja]] Maudood Chishti's son Khwaja Najamuddin Ahmed Ahmed Mushtaq Bin Moudod [[Chishti]] was buried at Chisht. [[Syed]] Abul Alla Moudodi was a descendant of his who was born at Aurangabad [[India]] in 1903 [[Islamic calendar|Hijri]]{{Clarify|date=November 2011}}<!-- That date is in the future! -->. Many of his descendants live in the area. [[Khwaja Wali Kirani]] Moudodi Chishti [[Kirani]] and Khwaja Mir Shahdad Moudodi Chishti Kirani are also Khwaja Maudood Chishti's descendants. The tombs of both these famous saints are in a place called [[Kirani]], west of [[Quetta]] city. A large number of his descendants still live in Kirani. [[Khwaja Ibrahim]] Yukpassi another important [[saint]] belonging to Khwaja Maudood Chishti's family is buried in [[Mastung, Pakistan|Mastung]] [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and [[Khwaja Dopassi]] is buried in [[Dhadar]] near the beginning of [[Bolan Pass|Bolan]] pass Balochistan [[Pakistan]].\n\nDescendants Khwaja Qutubuddin Mohammad Thani Chishti migrated to Sindh Old Bukkhar (near Shahdadkot). One of this family descendants named Khwaja Assadullah Kunjnashin Bukkhari migrated to Nawada-Gaya areas of Bihar, India. His followers preached Islam and guided the Muslims there. Khwaja Abdullah Chishti and Hazrat Taj Mahmood Haqqani Chishti were the Sufi saints of Chishti order and direct descendants of Maudood Chishti's son. Their shrines are situated in Milkitola Chhota Sheikhpura, Narhat block near Hisua (GPRS 24 83N 85 43E)\n\n===Descendants in Balochistan===\nDescendant Khwaja [[Nizam-ud-din Alli]]'s tomb is in the vicinity of [[Pishin, Pakistan|Pishin]] city of Balochistan in a place called Minziki, home for many other descendants. Khwaja Naqruddin Chishti Moudodi (Shaal Pir Baba) is another descendant whose tomb is in Balochistan, located in Quetta chaowni near the old fort. In the valley of shal kot (Quetta) and Bolan in the Balochistan province the influence of the Moudodi family reached within the lifetime of the head of the family. According to one source Khwaja Qutubuddin Moudod visited the area at least once. He came to the home of his follower Shiekh Babut in the area of Shoroak. Shiekh Babut belonged to the pashtoon tribe called 'Bariech'. During the lifetime of Khwaja Moudod Chishti his friends and followers started to spread the message of Islam. Later on Khwaja Qutubuddin Moudod Chishti's own family (the sadat) advanced the message of Islam in greater Balochistan and molded the life of ordinary people according to the ideology of Islam.\n\n*(16) \u2013  Syed Khwaja Qutubuddin Maudood Chishti in Chisht Hirat [[Afghanistan]].(B430h D527h)\n*(18) \u2013  Syed Rukun ud din [[Khwaja Hussain Chishti]] in Chisht Hirat Afghanistan.(B545h D635h)\n*(19) \u2013  Syed Qud ud din [[Khwaja Mohammad]] in Chisht Hirat Afghanistan.

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledges the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]]. The series is produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and [[Mutant Enemy Productions]], with Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and [[Jeffrey Bell]] serving as [[showrunner]]s.\n\nThe series stars [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]], reprising his role from the film series, alongside [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Brett Dalton]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]] and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]]. [[Nick Blood]], [[Adrianne Palicki]], [[Henry Simmons]], [[Luke Mitchell]], [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]], [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]], and [[Jeff Ward (actor)|Jeff Ward]] joined in later seasons. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents deal with various unusual cases and enemies, including [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], [[Inhumans]], [[Life Model Decoy]]s, alien species such as the [[Kree]], and time travel.\n\n''The Avengers'' writer and director Joss Whedon began developing a S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Television pilot|pilot]] following the film's release, and Gregg was confirmed to reprise his role in October 2012. The series was officially picked up by ABC in May 2013. [[Prosthetic makeup]] is created with [[Glenn Hetrick]]'s Optic Nerve Studios, while [[Legacy Effects]] contributes other [[practical effects]]. The [[visual effects]] for the series are created by FuseFX, and have been nominated for multiple awards. Several episodes directly crossover with films or other television series set in the MCU, while other characters from MCU films and [[Marvel One-Shots]] also appear throughout the series.\n\nThe series premiered on September 24, 2013, with the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

(season 7)|seventh season]] is set to premiere on May 27, 2020. After starting the first season with high ratings but mixed reviews, the ratings began to drop while reviews improved. This led to much lower but more consistent ratings, as well as more consistently positive reviews in the subsequent seasons.\n\nSeveral characters created for the series have since been introduced to the [[Marvel Universe|comic universe]] and other media. ''[[Marvel's Most Wanted]]'', a planned spin-off centered on [[Lance Hunter]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]], received a pilot order in August 2015 but did not lead to a series.

In the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]], following the destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D. in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', Coulson becomes director of the organization and is tasked with rebuilding it while dealing with Hydra, a faction of anti-superhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and a newly revealed superhuman race called the [[Inhumans]].<ref name=\"S2Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"Daisy\" />\n\nDuring the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

In the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth season]], Coulson returns to being a field agent so S.H.I.E.L.D. can have a public leader, and is tasked with tracking down more enhanced people, including [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider]].

Jed Whedon explained that they wanted to have \"infiltration based on betrayal\" on a small scale to represent the same thing happening on a massive scale, and to make the Hydra revelation more personal for the characters.<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" /><ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> Dalton felt that Ward was always more loyal to his Hydra superior [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]] than to Hydra itself, and that he would become more of a wildcard after Garrett's death, though still an antagonist to S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"DaltonRebuilding\" /><ref name=\"DaltonS2Finale\" /> Ward is killed by Coulson in season three,<ref name=\"BellTHRDec2015\" /> and his body is possessed by an ancient Inhuman, Hive.<ref name=\"Hive\" /> Dalton returned to the series in its fourth season to portray Ward in the virtual reality Framework, where he is Johnson's boyfriend.<ref name=\"DaltonS4\" /> [[Austin Lyon]] portrays a young Ward.<ref name=\"Lyon\" />\n* [[Chloe Bennet]] as [[Daisy Johnson|Daisy \"Skye\" Johnson / Quake]]:<br />An [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] S.H.I.E.L.D. agent with the ability to create earthquakes.<ref name=\"Daisy\" /><ref name=\"Oct2012TVline\" /> The character of Skye was always intended to become the MCU version of Johnson, having consequences for the character's relationships with the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, especially Coulson.<ref name=\"DaisyEW\" /> Bennet felt that the character was someone who would wear her heart on her sleeve while having some control over her emotions.<ref name=\"BennetRebuilding\" /> Wen noted that the character evolves from being \"anti-establishment into suddenly being someone who wants to create an establishment that would help\" the Inhumans.<ref name=\"CBRTakingCharge\" /> In the third season she no longer goes by \"Skye\" and gains the public name \"Quake\".<ref name=\"SDCC2015\" /><ref name=\"THREPsMay2016\"/>\n* [[Iain De Caestecker]] as [[Leo Fitz]]:<br />An agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who specializes in engineering, especially weapons technology.<ref name=\"Oct2012TVline\" /><ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> De Caestecker described the character as \"quite passionate about what he does\" but not emotionally intelligent.<ref name=\"CaesteckerOnSet\" /> Fitz has a close relationship with Simmons; De Caestecker says they \"just kind of fit each other in a very weird way.\"<ref name=\"CaesteckerIGN\" /> The character suffers brain injuries at the end of the first season. The writers researched brain trauma with doctors and experts before approaching it in the series. De Caestecker did his own research as well, feeling it is \"something that should never be trivialized.

They kind of bounce off each other.\"<ref name=\"HenstridgeCrave\" /> As Fitz and Simmons begin to spend time apart during the series, Henstridge noted that it \"brings a whole new dynamic just to them as characters\" since they have been nearly inseparable since first meeting.<ref name=\"HenstridgeTVGuide\" /> On the harsher side of Simmons seen in later seasons, Henstridge noted that the character has \"always been very mathematical in a way\".<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> Simmons is \"profoundly\" changed after being trapped on the planet [[Maveth]] for six months.<ref name=\"SimmonsEW301\" />\n* [[Nick Blood]] as [[Lance Hunter]]:<br />A mercenary before agreeing to join S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref name=\"Blood\" /> Blood described Hunter as someone who \"doesn't bow down to the etiquette of the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy.\"<ref name=\"BloodSep2014\" /> He later elaborated that the character feels very independent, so would probably not want to admit no longer feeling like an outsider. Also, \"he doesn't have too much respect for authority and titles...If Coulson does something he respects, that's all good. If he doesn't, he's going to say something.\" On Hunter's on-again, off-again relationship with Bobbi Morse, Blood said, \"there is a lot of truth in it of those relationships you have where it's kind of, 'can't live with each other, can't kill each other'\".<ref name=\"BloodPalickiRocky\" />\n* [[Adrianne Palicki]] as [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]]:<br />Hunter's ex-wife and an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who spent time undercover within Hydra.<ref name=\"PalickiMainVariety\" /> Palicki was approached by the showrunners specifically for the part during season two. Palicki already had martial arts and gun training, but had to learn to use the character's signature [[arnis]] sticks; she noted similarities between Morse's fighting style and that of [[Scarlett Johansson]]'s [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Black Widow]] from the MCU films.<ref name=\"PalickiEW\" /> Showrunner [[Jeffrey Bell]] said the character is more loyal to an idea than anything else, so what may seem in the short term as a betrayal by her is usually for what she sees as the greater good.<ref name=\"MockingbirdPoster\" />\n* [[Henry Simmons]] as [[Al MacKenzie|Alphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie]]:<br />A S.H.I.E.L.D. mechanic with a distrust of the alien and superhuman.<ref name=\"Simmons\" /> Simmons said the character is more worried about contributing in his own way and getting his job done away from the field.<ref name=\"SimmonsRebuilding\" /> Mack does not like violence, but does \"what he has to do.\"<ref name=\"SimmonsrS\" /> Mack reveals in the third season that he relies on his \"faith\", implying that he is a [[Christians|Christian]].<ref name=\"MackFaith1\" /> Dee Hogan of ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' described this as \"a refreshingly positive portrayal of people of faith, as Mack demonstrates the quiet confidence and love rather than the aggression and bigotry that's so often associated with it.\"<ref name=\"MackFaith2\" /> Mack becomes the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D. in season six.<ref name=\"MackDirectorS6\" />\n* [[Luke Mitchell]] as Lincoln Campbell:<br />An Inhuman with the ability to manipulate electrical charges.<ref name=\"MitchellRegular\" /> The character was introduced because the series already featured \"[[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters#Gordon|a guy with no eyes]]\" and \"[[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters#Raina|a woman who now is covered in thorns]]\" but, like the [[X-Men]], there are also Inhumans who are \"just attractive people with powers\", and so Campbell represents them in the series.<ref name=\"AfterlifePoster\" /> Campbell dies in the third-season finale,<ref name=\"THREPsMay2016\" /> making him the \"Fallen Agent\" that the series had been teasing for the entire second half of that season.<ref name=\"FlashForward\" /><ref name=\"FallenAgent\" /> The decision was made because the producers did not want \"a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes.\"<ref name=\"EWEPsMay2016\" />\n* [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] as [[Holden Radcliffe]]:<br />A [[transhumanist]] who believes in the improvement of humanity through enhancement.<ref name=\"Radcliffe\" /><ref name=\"HannahRegular\" /> Radcliffe initially worked with Hive before joining S.H.I.E.L.D.,  where he begins work on transferring his [[artificial intelligence]] [[AIDA (comics)|AIDA]] to a Life Model Decoy, an old S.H.I.E.L.D. project.<ref name=\"LMD\" />\n* [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]] as [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez]]:<br />A Colombian Inhuman who can move at super speed for a beat of her heart, before returning to the point she started from. She reluctantly joins S.H.I.E.L.D. and becomes a part of the Secret Warriors, eventually growing close to Mack, who gives her the nickname \"Yo-Yo\".<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyCast\" /><ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyMain\" /> When first portraying the character, Cordova-Buckley smiled whenever Rodriguez was about to use her abilities, to show an adrenaline rush and the feeling of having such power. After positive fan responses to this, the actress morphed this trait into a more mischievous personality for the character.<ref name=\"ThisWeek47\" />\n* [[Jeff Ward (actor)|Jeff Ward]] as Deke Shaw:<br />A \"roguish scavenger\" on the Lighthouse space station in the year 2091,<ref name=\"WardS5\" /> who returns to the present with the S.H.I.E.L.D. team and learns he is the grandson of Fitz and Simmons.<ref name=\"WardSeriesRegular\" />\n\n==Production==\n{{see also|1=Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The series was described as \"'a kernel of an idea' with a number of scenarios being explored, including a high-concept cop show.\"<ref name=\"July2012Kernel\"/> The next month, it was announced that ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''{{'}} director [[Joss Whedon]], creator of other television shows such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', would be involved in the series' development.<ref name=\"Aug2012Whedon\"/>\n\nIn August 2012, ABC ordered a pilot for a series called ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' to be written and directed by Joss Whedon, with [[Jed Whedon]] and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]] also writing.<ref name=\"Aug2012Showrunners\"/><ref name=\"Aug2012PilotGreenlit\"/> Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] greenlit the series after watching the [[Marvel One-Shot]] short film ''[[Item 47]]''.<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\"/> In April 2013, ABC announced that the series would be titled ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',<ref name=\"Apr2013ABCAllAccess\" /> and it was officially picked up for a full season of 22 episodes in May 2013.<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\" /><ref name=\"S1pickup\"/> Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and [[Jeffrey Bell]] act as the series' [[showrunner]]s,<ref name=\"Aug2012Showrunners\"/> with Bell joining the show to help the inexperienced former pair with hiring crew members and \"navigating the politics of studios and networks\", saying, \"My job is to help them learn how to do that, to steer the ship while they learn.\" Joss Whedon assisted them before he started work on ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" />\n\nThe series was renewed for a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] in May 2014,<ref name=\"S2Renew\" /> a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third]] in May 2015,<ref name=\"S3Renew\" /> a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth]] in March 2016,<ref name=\"S4Renew\" /> a fifth in May 2017,<ref name=\"S5Renew\" /> and a sixth in May 2018.<ref name=\"S6Renew\" /> Despite speculation, [[ABC Entertainment]] president [[Channing Dungey]] said the sixth season was not planned to serve as the series' final season, adding that by moving the season to air in mid-2019 would allow ABC to \"super-serve the show's audience and possibly have it on the air longer.\"<ref name=\"S6SummerRelease\" /> That November, ABC renewed the series for a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> The seventh season will serve as the series' final season.<ref name=\"AoSFinalSeason\" />\n\nIn September 2016, discussing the eventual end of the series, Tancharoen said, \"You always just forge ahead. Until someone tells us to stop, we will continue to move forward.\" Jed Whedon added, \"There are always ideas in the back of your mind for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSep2016\" /> By May 2017, Bell noted they had \"a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends. We just need to know when that time is coming so we can build to it properly.\" Jed Whedon continued, \"Our goal is to know ahead of time, because we would love to land the story in a way that's satisfying\".<ref name=\"IGNMay2017\" />\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=The idea of [Coulson] as the long-suffering bureaucrat who deals with [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s insufferability is delightful and hits the core of something I'm also writing about all the time\u2014the little guy versus the big faceless organization....and that's what Clark Gregg embodies: the Everyman.|source=\u2014Creator Joss Whedon on the underlying themes of the series.<ref name=\"definitive\" />}}\nBell explained that he, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen supervise all of the series' creative decisions, often consulting with Loeb. When the showrunners are writing the series, one person can write a script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, a member of the series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" />\n\nIn January 2013, Joss Whedon deflected any direct influences from other series, such as the efforts of [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]] in ''[[The X-Files]]'', and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on \"the peripheral people...the people on the edges of the grand adventures.\"<ref name=\"Jan2013WhedonInterview\"/> As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences \"seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that.\"<ref name=\"BellVarietyS2Finale\" /> Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, \"The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by ''The Avengers'' there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that.\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" />\n\nOn the balance between creating new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics in a way that works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, \"We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it.\"<ref name=\"ProducersEW\" /> About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it was nothing compared to the films or even series like ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. He explained that the series does attempt to create \"Marvel moments\" as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments\u2014something that works really well on television\u2014so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so \"If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we want to be in the car with the character having that experience.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" />\n\n{{multiple image|\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n\n<!-- Images -->\n | width             = \n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width1            = 210\n | alt1              = Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen sitting.\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Jeffrey Bell at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width2            = 100\n | alt2              = Jeffrey Bell sitting.\n\n<!-- Footer -->\n | footer_align      = Left\n | footer            = (L to R) Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell, the showrunners of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''\n}}\nIn September 2015, Bell looked back on the first two seasons and talked about the challenges of and changes in the series. He noted the negative reception from fans concerning the low number of recognizable characters like Coulson, but pointed out that fans seemed to have grown to like the series' original characters as they had been developed over time. He explained that with the increasing number of characters and complex relationships in the series, having different pairings and building new emotional relationships was important, and stated that \"whether it's a quiet moment or in action, we [hope to] deepen the audience's love and concern, and hopes for these characters.\"<ref name=\"BellPasteSep2015\" /> A year later he reiterated the producer's intention to create a tradition moving forward of \"finding new combinations and new conflicts\" between different sets of characters, given \"a lot of procedurals [see] the same people doing the same thing for five years and the character don't evolve or change at all.\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" />\n\nThe producers and writers initially formed a general plan for the show through the end of a third season, after reading the screenplays for upcoming MCU films.<ref name=\"HitfixPg2\" /> In May 2016, [[Chloe Bennet]] likened the end of the third season to \"the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show.\"<ref name=\"BennetFirstBook\" /> She elaborated that \"the storylines that we started at the beginning of season 1 really wrapped up at the end of season 3. We've had some major losses of people who have been with us on the show since season 1. From the table read to the first day on set, there's definitely a new energy of the show\" moving forward.<ref name=\"BennetS4\" /> The series was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the writers hoped to \"skew a little darker because of\" this change, with Loeb adding that \"It absolutely offers opportunities. I don't know that it changes things all that dramatically [though]. I mean, at the end of the day, Marvel is always going to make shows that run somewhere between PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to be making ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' anytime soon on [ABC].\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" /> Marvel \"had a long talk with ABC about what can we get away with, so to speak\" in the new timeslot, which led to the inclusion of [[Ghost Rider]] in the season over one of [[Marvel's Netflix television series]], because Marvel felt \"that this character was right to tell [darker and more violent] stories right now\" and having him on ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' aided that because \"it was so unexpected\". Loeb hoped that the combination of the later timeslot and the introduction of Ghost Rider would lead to some viewers who had stopped watching the series over the previous seasons giving it another chance.<ref name=\"GhostRiderAug2016\" />\n\nIn May 2017, ahead of the fifth season renewal, Jed Whedon said the writers were not sure what would happen in the season, and that it would be \"by the seat of our pants.\"<ref name=\"EWMay2017S5Plan\" /> While beginning to write the final episode of season 5 at the end of February 2018, the writers were planning for it to be able to serve as both a season and series finale, with some elements that could be adjusted based on whether the series was renewed for a sixth season or not. Whedon added, \"we're ready for if this is the end. We're definitely going to make it rewarding either way.\"<ref name=\"TVLineS5Ending\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn October 2012, a casting sheet for five lead roles was sent out.<ref name=\"Oct2012TVline\" /> At the [[New York Comic Con]], Joss Whedon, [[Kevin Feige]], and Clark Gregg announced that Gregg would be reprising his role as agent Phil Coulson from ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', ''The Avengers'', and the Marvel One-Shots in the pilot,<ref name=\"CoulsonSHIELD\"/> and would \"headline\" the series.<ref name=\"NYCCCoulson\"/> Actress [[Ming-Na Wen]] was cast as Melinda May.<ref name=\"Oct2012MingNa\"/> The next month, [[Elizabeth Henstridge]] and [[Iain De Caestecker]] were cast as Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz, respectively,<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> while newcomer [[Brett Dalton]] was cast as Grant Ward.<ref name=\"Dalton\"/> In December, Chloe Bennet was chosen out of more than 400 actresses to play Skye, the sixth and final regular for the first season;<ref name=\"Dec2012Bennet\" /><ref name=\"Skye400\" /> the character is revealed in the second season to be [[Daisy Johnson]], and no longer goes by \"Skye\" starting with the third.<ref name=\"SDCC2015\" />\n\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2014, [[Nick Blood]] was announced as cast in the role of [[Lance Hunter]] for the second season, while the character of [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]] was revealed to be appearing.<ref name=\"Blood\" /> That August, [[Henry Simmons]] joined the cast as [[Al MacKenzie|Alphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie]], a recurring role,<ref name=\"Simmons\" /> and [[Adrianne Palicki]] was cast as Morse in a guest role, to first appear in the episode \"[[A Hen in the Wolf House]]\".<ref name=\"Palicki\" /> The next month, the entire first season principal cast were confirmed to be regulars for the second season, along with Blood.<ref name=\"BloodPrincipal\" /> Palicki joined them with the episode \"[[Aftershocks (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Aftershocks]]\".<ref name=\"PalickiMainVariety\" /><ref name=\"PalickiMain\" /> In February 2015, [[Luke Mitchell]] was cast as Lincoln Campbell, a recurring role for the second half of the season.<ref name=\"Mitchell\" /><ref name=\"MitchellCharacter\" />\n\nAll season-two principal cast members returned for the third season,<ref name=\"SHIELDS3Returners\" /> with Simmons and Mitchell joining them, promoted from their recurring roles.<ref name=\"MitchellRegular\" /><ref name=\"SimmonsRegular\"/> In October 2015, the Inhuman [[Hive (comics)|Hive]] was introduced; for the second part of season three, he possesses the corpse of Grant Ward, again portrayed by Brett Dalton.<ref name=\"Hive\" /> Also introduced were [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]] and [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]], recurring as [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez]] and [[Holden Radcliffe]], respectively.<ref name=\"Radcliffe\" /><ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyCast\" /> Blood and Palicki left the main cast following the season-three episode \"[[Parting Shot]]\", to star in the then-planned spin-off show ''[[Marvel's Most Wanted]]''.<ref name=\"BellPartingShot\" /> Dalton and Mitchell also left following the deaths of their characters in the third-season finale.<ref name=\"EWEPsMay2016\"/>\n\nGregg, Wen, Bennet, De Caestecker, Henstridge, and Simmons returned for the fourth and fifth seasons.<ref name=\"S4Premise\" /><ref name=\"S5Press\" /> They were joined by Hannah in the fourth,<ref name=\"HannahRegular\" /> with Cordova-Buckley once again recurring as Rodriguez in the season,<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyS4\" /> before being promoted to a series regular for the fifth season.<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyMain\" /> Dalton returned as a guest during the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Assistant costume designer Ann Foley took over for subsequent episodes, and worked closely with Tancharoen to create \"very strong, different characters\" whose \"looks evolve along with the show.\"<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> Foley also brought on concept artists Phillip Boutte Jr. and Josh Shaw to assist with the design process.<ref name=\"BoutteInterview\" /><ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> Foley watched every MCU film, paying special attention to ''The Avengers'', and was also inspired by such films as ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''[[Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol]]''.<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> In October 2016, Foley said that she was specifically following the aesthetic of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', \"So any costume has to fit inside that world we've established and has to fit that tactical look.\"<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" /> On the variety of costumes created for each character, Foley preferred to have set pieces in the characters' \"closets\", as \"it's not a fashion show ... a guy like Ward isn't going to have twenty jackets in his closet. He is going to have one that he uses all of the time.\"<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" />\n\nAfter reading each script, Foley would do her own research, before discussing the look of the episode with the writers.<ref name=\"FoleyHiatus\" /> She then studied the comics, general fashion, and history to get a look that is recognizable to fans, but fits into the more realistic world of the series.<ref name=\"BoutteInterview\" /> Costumes are either custom made or bought, and the actors are brought in for fittings before filming. This process was often challenging because of the series' eight-day-per-episode schedule.<ref name=\"FoleyHiatus\" /> Foley stated that all costumes take a similar amount of time to create, whether they are based on the comics or not.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /> Marvel CCO [[Joe Quesada]] is involved in the approval process when costuming preexisting characters,<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> including Daisy Johnson's Quake costume, which is introduced in the third season. The Quake costume incorporates elements from the comic version of the character, and was intended to show that Quake \"could easily be part of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\".<ref name=\"CostumeEvolution\" /><ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Foley took steps to differentiate the Quake costume from [[Scarlett Johansson]]'s [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Black Widow]] costumes from the films, but was \"flattered\" by comparisons made between them. Foley was also adamant about showing that characters such as Quake \"don't have to be sexualised, that they're powerful, strong women\", and so avoided \"a lot of cleavage, you don't see high heels. It's about practicality.\"<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" />\n\nThe costumes go through a natural evolution in the series. There is a shift at the end of the first season to a darker look, and all the characters have \"definitely grown up\" during the second season. In the third season there is another shift, \"from the ragtag group of soldiers and scientists to [a] more precise militaristic outfit\".<ref name=\"CostumeEvolution\" /> This change is also reflected in the series' color palette, going from \"a much lighter tone, much more patterns\" in the first season to having \"stripped away a bit of color\" by the third.<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" /> Despite this increasing darkness in the costumes, Foley intended to define each character as they are introduced and to have them always be recognizable and identifiable.<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> With the start of the fourth season, Foley said that \"each season definitely has its own feel and this season will be no different. I think that you're going to see some subtle differences in the costumes of the characters\"; she felt like Fitz and Simmons, in particular, had become \"more adult looking\", while all the cast had \"a pretty specific ... civilian look\" that would become more prominent as S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized and becomes more public.<ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Foley left the series after the thirteenth episode of the fourth season, to work on a television adaptation of ''[[Altered Carbon]]'',<ref name=\"FoleyLeaves\" /> and was replaced with Amanda Riley. Riley used her previous experience recreating costumes to \"blend in\" with Foley's established look.<ref name=\"ThisWeek58\" />\n\nFoley returned for the first two episodes of the fifth season, before handing costume design over to Whitney Galitz, who had assisted Foley on the previous few seasons, and Christann Chanell.<ref name=\"FoleyBack\" />\n\n====Practical effects====\nThe series' [[Theatrical property|props]] department is led by Scott Bauer. The pilot introduces the Incapacitating Cartridge Emitting Railgun, or ICER, tranquilizer weapons often used by the agents, with Joss Whedon having Bauer design \"sci-fi\"-looking guns, including a large rifle-like weapon. The series' further portrayal of the ICERs was more subtle, with Bauer using airsoft guns that are safe to shoot others with over a small distance. ICER-specific muzzle flashes are then added by the visual effects department. Bauer reused the ICER rifle prop when making Mack's \"Shotgun Ax\", which appears in later seasons. The [[Terrigen Mist|terrigen crystals]] that unlock Inhuman abilities in the series are 3D-printed from solid resin and then altered with extra details.<ref name=\"Props\" /> Additional practical effects and props are created by [[Legacy Effects]], who also work on the MCU films,<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /><ref name=\"LegacyEffectsFilms\" /> notably creating Daisy Johnson's gauntlets for the third season.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /> [[Prosthetic makeup]] for the series is designed in conjunction with [[Glenn Hetrick]] of Optic Nerve Studios. Hetrick began work on the series with the second season, to create [[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters#Raina|Raina]]'s Inhuman look,<ref name=\"RainaMakeUp\" /> and returned for the third season to design and create the more unusual-looking Inhumans such as [[Lash (comics)|Lash]].<ref name=\"HetrickLash\" />\n\n====Title sequence====\n[[File:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. title cards animation.gif|thumb|The title sequence for the series' 100th episode, \"The Real Deal\", featuring a montage of all title cards used throughout the series at that point]]\nThe third season introduces a new title sequence for the series, replacing the one that appeared in the first two seasons.<ref name=\"NewTitle\" /> The title sequence in \"[[4,722 Hours]]\" is drastically different from the design introduced for the third season, with the series' title in the episode's typeface silently fading onto the screen over the back drop of the planet Simmons is stranded on.<ref name=\"4722Title\" /><ref name=\"4722Title2\" /> The fourth season sees new series title cards for the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

(season 4)#LMD|LMD]]'' pods,<ref name=\"S4GRTitle\" /><ref name=\"S4LMDTitle\" /> and an ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' title card for the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)#Agents of Hydra|Agents of Hydra]]'' pod that changes to say ''Agents of Hydra'' for episodes primarily set in the Framework.<ref name=\"HydraTitleCard\" /><ref name=\"FrameworkTitleCard\" /> The ''Ghost Rider'' graphic is used again for the fourth-season finale.<ref name=\"FinaleTitleCard\" /> For the fifth season, the opening of \"Orientation\" is reminiscent of the sequence for \"4,722 Hours\", forgoing the title card and having the typeface silently fading onto the screen.<ref name=\"OrientationOpening\" /> The subsequent episodes of season five feature a title card with the series name in a new typeface against a backdrop of various depictions of Earth: episodes through \"Past Life\" feature a destroyed future Earth;<ref name=\"S5Opening\" /> episodes from \"Principa\" through \"The Devil Complex\" feature a present Earth<!--can be seen at end of 100th episode card montage-->; while episodes from \"Rise and Shine\" through \"All Roads Lead...\" feature the Earth beginning to crack.<ref name=\"515Recap\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction for the pilot took place almost entirely in [[Los Angeles]] to accommodate Joss Whedon's schedule,<ref name=\"Jan2013LeeInterview2\" /> while the rest of the series is primarily filmed in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> Additional filming has also taken place around the world, including in [[Paris]], France,<ref name=\"Oct2013Dalton\" /> [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]],<ref name=\"Oct2013Armand\" /> and [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref name=\"PuertoRicoFilming\" /> The series is filmed on [[Arri Alexa]] cameras,<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> with [[David Boyd (cinematographer)|David Boyd]] serving as [[director of photography]] on the pilot,<ref name=\"BoydDoP\" /> and Feliks Parnell, Jeff Mygatt, and Allan Westbrook doing so throughout the rest of the series.<!-- From the episode credits, unless a separate reliable source can be found --> Garry Brown is the second unit director for the series, with stunts coordinated by Tanner Gill.<ref name=\"302BTS\" /> The series is filmed in [[2K resolution]].<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nFuseFX serves as the lead visual effects vendor for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> with additional work by [[Pixomondo]], Cosa, Greenhaus GFX, Lion VFX, and Synaptic.<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> The series sees an average of 80 to 150 visual effects shots per episode,<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" /> with 10 to 12 days to work on the effects for one episode once background plates have been received from filming.<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> This equates to approximately 2000 visual effects shots per season.<ref name=\"PostVFX\" />  Mark Kolpack serves as visual effects supervisor for the series.<ref name=\"VFX1\" /> David Altenau was the in-house supervisor at FuseFX for \"Pilot\" through episode eight, with Kevin Lingenfelser taking over for subsequent episodes.<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> VFX producer Andrea D'Amico joined the team at FuseFX to work on the series in December 2015.<ref name=\"DAmico\" /> Two separate production management and creative teams were established to work on the show, and producers, compositors and various artists were able to alternate episodes. This was important because most of the episodes had to be worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time.<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> Typical effects for the series include the creation of character-driving effects animation, photo-realistic vehicles, CG set extensions, pyrotechnics, and atmospheric effects.<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> Some assets, such as a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]] and [[Helicarrier]], are shared from [[Industrial Light & Magic]], though \"those models are generally super heavy and dense with data\" and need to be made \"HD friendly or simply manageable to work in [a] TV schedule.\"<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Bear McCreary]] confirmed that he would compose music for the series in July 2013.<ref name=\"McCreary\"/> Unlike on some of his previous scores, ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary to work with a full symphonic orchestra,<ref name=\"McCrearyDoG\" /> typically featuring 50 or 70 players,<ref name=\"McCrearyMaveth\" /> with over 90 for \"important\" episodes.<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> Complex synthesizer programming was also used, to give the score \"a modern edge\".<ref name=\"McCrearyPilot\" /> Since ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was the first MCU television series, McCreary felt there was \"a sense that it had to connect\" to the consistent orchestra sound of the films, but viewed through a television lens.<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> McCreary composes on average 30 minutes of music per episode.<ref name=\"McCrearyS3\" /> Creating the main theme for the series, which McCreary also saw as Coulson's theme, was a process which took a lot of collaboration with the executive producers, who wanted a specific sound\u2014\"something big, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" but also \"intimate because these aren't superheroes, these are regular people.\" McCreary had to work harder to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence.<ref name=\"McCrearyDoG\" /> By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noted \"the score became a little more intense and more electronically driven... [E]lectronics really moved to the forefront as we got into more stories about Inhumans and the digital world our characters inhabit. But the orchestra is always our foundation.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" />\n\nIn September 2014, McCreary announced that there were plans for an ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' soundtrack,<ref name=\"McCrearySoundtrackPlans\" /> which was released digitally a year later by [[Marvel Music]] on September 4, 2015, and on CD on October 9.

He stated that \"ABC and Marvel both want the series to be able to make sense on its own\", but that it was beneficial for the films to have the series fill in any \"gaps\" for them, due to having to be \"big\" and moving \"quickly through a lot of huge pieces\", unlike television which has time to deal with more nuances.<ref name=\"BellPasteSep2015\" />\n\nIn January 2016, Joss Whedon noted that this process \"unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers.\" He stated that, for example, the series' creative team initially wanted to use [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]'s scepter from ''The Avengers'' but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in ''Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"JossScepter\" /> On how their ability to connect with the films changed over the life of the series, Jed Whedon said, \"The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open.\" He added, \"We have relatively free rein [in what the series can introduce and connect to]; we just can't go anywhere that [the films are] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told \"no\" that much\". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as \"something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2017\" />\n\nThe series mimics the films' [[post credits scene]]s with 'end tags', starting with the episode \"[[0-8-4]]\" which features a [[Samuel L. Jackson]] cameo. Bell explained, \"Sometimes it'll be funny, sometimes it'll be a mythology thing ... or an extra little reveal about\" the episode.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> The end tag for \"[[End of the Beginning (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|End of the Beginning]]\" is a \"directly lifted\" scene from ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"WinterSoldierTag\" />\n\nThe series' first major tie-in episode with the wider MCU was \"[[The Well (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Well]]\", which begins immediately after ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''.<ref name=\"ThorTDWCrossover\" /> The episodes \"End of the Beginning\" and \"[[Turn, Turn, Turn (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Turn, Turn, Turn]]\" revolve around the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'',<ref name=\"HitfixPg1\" /><ref name=\"CapTWSCrossover\"/> which led to a retooling of the series.<ref name=\"USATodayHYDRA\" /> Flashback sequences in \"[[Shadows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Shadows]]\" and \"[[The Things We Bury]]\" featuring [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]] served as marketing and set-up for the ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' television series.<ref name=\"ACcrossover\" /><ref name=\"Ep8Synopsis\" /> The events of \"[[The Frenemy of My Enemy]]\" and \"[[The Dirty Half Dozen]]\" led up to the opening sequence of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', while \"[[Scars (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Scars]]\" deals with the aftermath of that film.<ref name=\"AoUTieIn\" /> The third season follows similar themes to the film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', focusing on powered people and the different responses to them,<ref name=\"CWThemes\" /> leading up to the episode \"[[Emancipation (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Emancipation]]\", which takes place after the film and shows how its events affect the series' powered characters.<ref name=\"CWTieIn\" />\n\nThe episode \"[[T.A.H.I.T.I.]]\" introduces the [[Kree]] alien race to the MCU, members of which play a significant role in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.<ref name=\"BennetKree\" /><ref name=\"BennetBellKree\" /> This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU,<ref name=\"Daisy\" /> with Jed Whedon saying that it was something \"in the works\" for a long time, as [[Marvel Studios]] had plans for an ''[[Inhumans (film)|Inhumans]]'' film, and this would be \"one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film.\"<ref name=\"CBRDec2014\" /> The third season introduces the concept of the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]], with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name,<ref name=\"S3SecretWarriors\" /><ref name=\"VarietySecretWarriors\" /> while also [[retcon]]ning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline.<ref name=\"HydraRetcon\" /> Gregg noted in January 2016 that the \"writer and director [of the ''Inhumans'' film] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that.\"<ref name=\"GreggInhumansFilm\" /> When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had \"a little more freedom\" and were \"able to do a little bit more\" with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the \"classic\" Inhumans.<ref name=\"ClassicInhumans\" /> ''Marvel's Inhumans'', a television series centered on [[Black Bolt]] and other members of the [[List of Inhumans#Inhuman Royal Family|Inhuman Royal Family]], was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017.<ref name=\"InhumansSeries\" /> It was not intended to be a spin-off of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansSeries2\" />\n\nThe fourth season explores the concept of Life Model Decoys,<ref name=\"LMD\" /> which were first referenced in ''The Avengers'',<ref name=\"LMDAvengers\" /> and introduces the character Ghost Rider to the MCU.<ref name=\"S4Premise\" /> On why the series waited to begin exploring LMDs, Jed Whedon said that the series previously did not want to explore the concept before the release of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', which sees the introductions of [[Ultron]] and [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] in a similar manner to LMDs.<ref name=\"VarietyEPsMay2016\" /> On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that \"with ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' coming out this year, the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe is moving into new waters,\" referring to the exploration of magic. \"We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift.\"<ref name=\"GhostRiderEW\" /> The season also continues storylines from the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]] of ''Agent Carter'', with the reveal that the Momentum Energy Labs group is a successor to the Isodyne Energy company, with both companies connected by the parent company [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]], a mainstay of the MCU.<ref name=\"IsodyneConnection\" /> The last four episodes of season five take place over a single day, and coincide with the events of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"S5IWConnections\" /> In August 2017, [[Emily VanCamp]] said that discussions had taken place for her to reprise her role of [[Sharon Carter]] for the series, but there were conflicts with her starring role on the series ''[[Revenge (TV series)|Revenge]]''.<ref name=\"VanCampDiscussions\" />\n\nSeason seven sees [[Enver Gjokaj]] reprise his role as Strategic Scientific Reserve agent [[Daniel Sousa (character)|Daniel Sousa]] from ''Agent Carter''.<ref name=\"Gjokaj\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nSocial media accounts for the series were set up in January 2013, months before ABC officially ordered it, \"a rarity for a pilot.\"<ref name=\"SocialMedia\" /> By May 17, 2013, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was the top new show of the television season in terms of social media activity, with the series' official [[Twitter]] account having over 46,000 followers and its official [[Facebook]] page having close to half a million likes.<ref name=\"SocialMedia\" /> Many cast and crew members \"live tweet\" each episode, with [[J. August Richards]] noting that this brings instant feedback from viewers, and allows the crew to \"watch the audience take that journey\" in real time.<ref name=\"RichardsCollider\" />\n\nFor the final six episodes of the first season, Marvel began the \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)#\"The Art of Level Seven\"|''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': The Art of Level Seven]]\" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode. Bell stated that the initiative was a way to tie the series back to its comics roots, and was thought of at the beginning of the first season. The production team tried to pair specific artists to the teaser posters based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode.<ref name=\"ArtLevelSeven\" /> For the second season, the series returned as \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)#\"The Art of Evolution\"|The Art of Evolution]]\", with an image for each of the final twelve episodes of the season.<ref name=\"ArtEvolution\" /> For season five, Marvel revived their marketing art program, with \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)#\"The Road to 100\"|''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': The Road to 100]]\", with five posters, one for each season of the series, representing \"key pivotal moments of each season\" to commemorate the series reaching 100 episodes.<ref name=\"RoadTo100\" />\n\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con 2014]], Marvel Custom Solutions and [[Lexus]] released a limited single-issue [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|comic tie-in]] titled [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics#Other titles|''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Chase'']],<ref name=\"AoSTC\" /> set between the Season 1 episodes \"[[Seeds (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Seeds]]\" and \"[[T.R.A.C.K.S.]]\"<ref name=\"AoSTC1\" /> The comic was written by George Kitson, with art by Mirko Colak, Neil Edwards, and Mirco Pierfederici.<ref name=\"AoSTCTeam\" />\n\nA five-part [[web series]] titled ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Double Agent'', also sponsored by Lexus, was released from March 4 to May 6, 2015 on ABC.com. The web series follows a newly hired ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' production assistant, who acts as a [[double agent]] for the \"Mastermind\", portrayed by [[Stan Lee]]. Cast and crew members from the series, such as Gregg, also appear, with viewers having the ability to vote in an online poll after each episode to guess where the double agent would go in the next episode; votes entered viewers in a drawing to win prizes from the set of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"DoubleAgent\" /><ref name=\"StanLeeMastermind\" /> ''Double Agent'' was nominated for Outstanding Digital Series at the 27th [[Producers Guild Awards]].<ref name=\"DoubleAgentPGA\" /> Another Lexus-sponsored five-part web series, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Academy'', released from March 9 to May 4, 2016. In ''Academy'', three ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' fans compete to play an agent in that series. Members of the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' cast also appear.<ref name=\"Academy\" /> All three fans ultimately made cameo appearances in the third-season finale.<ref name=\"AcademyResult\" />\n\nThe series has been promoted with various subtitles at different times, including ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Uprising'' in season one, leading up to the ''Winter Soldier'' crossover;<ref name=\"Uprising\" /> ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Fallen Agent'' for the end of the third season;<ref name=\"FallenAgent\" /> ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Ghost Rider'' for the first \"pod\" of season four;<ref name=\"GhostRiderSubtitle\" /> and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: LMD'' for the second \"pod\" of season four.<ref name=\"LMDSlingshot\" /> The third \"pod\" of season four was known as ''Agents of Hydra''.<ref name=\"AgentsOfHydra\" />\n\n==Release==\n\n===Broadcast===\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' airs in the United States on ABC,<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\" /> in [[720p]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] and [[5.1 surround sound]],<ref name=\"PilotSynopsis\" /> despite delivering the episodes to ABC in [[1080p]].<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" /> The first season aired on Tuesdays at 8{{nbsp}}pm EST for the first season,<ref name=\"S1Timeslot\" /> and starting with the second season, the series aired on Tuesdays at 9{{nbsp}}pm EST,<ref name=\"S2Timeslot\" /> before moving to the 10{{nbsp}}pm time slot on Tuesdays for the fourth season.<ref name=\"S4Timeslot\" /> For its fifth season, the series aired on Fridays at 9{{nbsp}}pm EST,<ref name=\"S5Timeslot\" /> on Fridays at 8{{nbsp}}pm EST for season six,<ref name=\"S6Timeslot\" /> and will air at 10{{nbsp}}pm EST on Wednesdays for season seven.<ref name=\"S7PremiereDate\" />\n\nThe second and third seasons of the series were broadcast in two blocks each, with a season of ''Agent Carter'' airing in between. Bell explained that this decision was made following the challenge of producing 22 episodes for the first season to be aired over 36\u201340 weeks, which meant having repeats and \"losing momentum\". Instead, ''Agent Carter'' took up much of that gap in a row, leaving the back half of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s season to run uninterrupted.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> This format allowed the producers and writers to approach each season in two parts, each with distinct stories connected by carried-over elements.<ref name=\"TwoArcSeasons\" /> Ahead of the fourth season, Tancharoen explained, \"For the past two seasons, we've been able to break our season down into two little mini-seasons because of the airdate schedule. This upcoming season, our airdate schedule is a little different, so we're breaking it into three pods. Story wise, the development of that has made our lives easier, to break it down in that way.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSep2016\" /> The pod format was described as \"7-10 episodes [that feature] little 'enclosed plotlines' that formed a larger whole.\"<ref name=\"PodDescription\" />\n\nRegarding whether they would break the fifth season into pods again as with season four, Bell said, \"A 22-episode arc is a lot for people to hold on to. By breaking it up into either smaller arcs or different pods, by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down, or moving from space to space, our experience has been that it's something the viewers enjoy, and it makes it a little easier to digest when you're telling some of these stories.\" Whedon also noted it would depend on how the season would be \"broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back to back, it feels weird to start calling it different things... We will try to have it in bite-sized chunks.\"<ref name=\"EWMay2017\" /> The season began airing its episodes on December 1, 2017,<ref name=\"S5Premise\" /> once ''Inhumans'' had aired its eight episodes,<ref name=\"S5StartTimeFrame\" /> with the intent for all 22 episodes to air mostly uninterrupted;<ref name=\"S5StartTimeFrame\" /> a short hiatus was taken for the airing of the [[2018 Winter Olympics]].<ref name=\"2018OlympicsBreak\" /> The season ultimately was formed by two pod story arcs.<ref name=\"S5TwoPods\" /> The sixth and seventh seasons each featured 13 episodes.<ref name=\"S6Renew\" /><ref name=\"S7Renew\" />\n\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' has been licensed in 155 countries and territories:<ref name=\"worldwide\" /> [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] holds the broadcast rights for Canada;<ref name=\"CanadaBroadcast\"/> [[Channel 4]] aired the series in the United Kingdom for the first two seasons, before it moved to [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] for the third;<ref name=\"UKBroadcastNew\" /> in Australia, the series aired on [[Seven Network]] for the first two seasons,<ref name=\"AUSBroadcast\"/> before moving to [[Fox8]] starting with the third;<ref name=\"AUSBroadcastNew\" /> and in New Zealand, the show airs on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]].<ref name=\"NewZealandRatings\" /> [[MyNetworkTV]] was awarded the series' [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] rights in the United States, and began broadcasting it in September 2016.<ref name=\"Syndication\" />\n\n===Home media===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] release dates\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | [[Netflix]] release dates (U.S.)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | [[DVD region 1|Region 1]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[DVD region 2|Region 2]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[DVD region 4|Region 4]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; | [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

It also enjoyed DVR recordings that, according to ''[[TV Guide]]'', were \"through the roof\".<ref name=\"TVGuideNov2013\" />\n\nIn March 2016, Alisha Grauso of ''[[Forbes]]'' discussed the series and its ratings, describing the show as having \"never quite been the ratings hit for ABC that the network had hoped it would be...It's hard enough to write a film script that fits within the continuity of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, even harder to do it with a full-length TV season that must act as connective tissue to the larger world while still being its own thing.\" Grauso opined that the series' ratings may improve if it either focused on trying to be the best series it could be (with fewer connections to the films, like the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel-Netflix shows]]) or on just being \"support and tie-in to the world of the Avengers\". Grauso concluded, \"The end result for either scenario is that, hopefully, ratings move up and stay up. In the first case, fans might be lost by the disconnect from the MCU, but a stronger storyline and more consistent writing would bring them and new fans back. In the second scenario, fans would tune in every week for fear of missing out on a bit of story that's important to the larger world.\"<ref name=\"RatingsMar2016Pg1\" /><ref name=\"RatingsMar2016Pg2\" />\n\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' saw the season five episode \"All Roads Lead...\" earn a series low rating of 0.4/2 in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, as well as the lowest initial viewers with 1.67 million.<ref name=\"518Ratings\" /> In November 2018, Parrot Analytics, which measures \"how viewers interact with a TV show's brand online, assessing everything from global file-sharing and peer-to-peer traffic to social media activity\", ranked ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' in the top 0.03 percent of in-demand television series worldwide, classify it as \"Amazing\". Series with similar demand included ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', and ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', while ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' had higher demand than series such as ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Fear The Walking Dead]]''.<ref name=\"ParrotDataNov2018\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; float:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#F77F00;\"|\n| [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The website's consensus reads, \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is sure to please comic book fans, but the strong ensemble and brisk pacing help to make this better-than-average superhero show accessible to non-fanboys as well.\"<ref name=\"AoSS1RT\" /> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a \"generally favorable\" score of 74 based on 33 reviews.<ref name=\"AoSS1MC\" />\n\nThe second season has a 91% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.66/10 based on 32 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' relaxes into itself during its sophomore season, mitigating the show's growing pains by focusing on characters while amping up narrative thrills.\"<ref name=\"AoSS2RT\"/> The third season has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8.19/10 based on 22 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Still evolving in its third season, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' further hits its stride with a blend of thrills, humor, and heart.\"<ref name=\"AoSS3RT\" />\n\nThe fourth season has a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.75/10 based on 25 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' explores darker territory in its fourth season with the thrilling introduction of Ghost Rider, setting up an action-packed new chapter of Marvel's edgier mythologies.\"<ref name=\"AoSS4RT\" /> The fifth season has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.89/10 based on 22 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' swings for the fences with large-scale storytelling and wild twists that elevate season 5 from the saturated MCU and into its own space\".<ref name=\"AoSS5RT\"/>\n\nThe sixth season has a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.7/10 based on 15 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Six seasons in and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' continues to deepen its exploration of space and the relationships between its heroes.\"<ref name=\"AoSS6RT\"/>\n\n===Analysis===\nThe way that the series is affected by the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' has been called \"miraculous\",<ref name=\"Zap2itSeasonReview\" /><ref name=\"LATimesSeasonReview\" /> with Terri Schwartz at [[Zap2it]] writing \"the fact that the movie so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven\",<ref name=\"Zap2itSeasonReview\" /> while Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' \"faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination.\"<ref name=\"LATimesSeasonReview\" /> The fact that the series also depicts the rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the MCU has also been highlighted, with Merrill Barr, reviewing \"[[Beginning of the End (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Beginning of the End]]\" for ''Forbes'', saying \"what Marvel's daring to say with this season finale is 'everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it.'\"<ref name=\"ForbesSeasonReview\" />\n\nThe series' introduction of the Inhumans was seen by Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' as making ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' an essential part of the MCU and Marvel Studios' plans, with the connections between the series and the films previously having always been reactive on the series' behalf, with \"stuff\" happening in the films, and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' dealing with the fallout of it. However, the series would now be \"making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU\".<ref name=\"SavaAnalysis\" /> Barr wrote that the series \"does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've never seen it do before. Come the final frame [of the second season finale], all anyone\u2014Marvel fan or otherwise\u2014will be asking is when season three begins.\"<ref name=\"BarrAnalysis\" />\n\nThe third season's paralleling of themes from ''Captain America: Civil War'' was called \"topical and relevant\" and \"downright eerie\" by ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Alex McCown and [[Screen Crush]]'s Kevin Fitzpatrick. McCown compared the series' approach to setting up \"a world distrustful of superpowers\" to the real life events surrounding [[Cliven Bundy]] and [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]], and said that \"''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is taking full advantage of its medium in order to tell the story the upcoming Captain America film can't: A full and fraught exploration of the need to protect freedom and privacy, even for those with extraordinary abilities.\" Fitzpatrick added that this \"topical bent...made for a great angle to build up that world mentality without feeling particularly subservient to the movies.\"<ref name=\"McCownAnalysis\" /><ref name=\"FitzpatrickAnalysis\" />\n\nAhead of the fourth season, [[Collider (website)|Collider]]'s Kayti Burt opined that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is \"the X-Men TV show you should be watching\". Burt noted that the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film franchise]] was expanding to television with the series ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'', but that ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' already served that purpose well, highlighting the similarities between the X-Men and the Inhumans, both creations of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby during the 1960s consisting of a large group of super-powered people who \"are our neighbors and our friends ... both heroes and villains\", and face \"the same fears and prejudices\" from the wider community. Burt felt that the similarities between ''S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s Inhumans and the X-Men became \"particularly pointed\" in the third season with the Hive storyline, which had a lot in common with the film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' that was released around the same time; Burt was of the opinion that ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executed the storyline \"much better\" than the film did. Other similarities Burt discussed were the series' diverse and ensemble cast, its take on the [[Gifted (comics)|mutant cure storyline]], the parallels between Daisy Johnson's second season arc and the introduction of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' film, and its social and political commentary. With the latter, Burt also discussed the similarities between the Watchdogs and Donald Trump, calling it \"not very subtle, but social commentary doesn't have to be. I appreciate that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is attempting to comment on the current socio-political state of the country in a way that many of the other superhero TV shows don't even attempt to do. It's perhaps the show's most ''X-Men''-like quality.\" Concluding, Burt said that though the X-Men characters cannot appear in the MCU due to [[20th Century Fox]] holding the rights, \"we still get to enjoy many of the themes prominent in the X-Men universe through ''S.H.I.E.L.D.''\"<ref name=\"XMenAnalysis\" />\n\nAdditionally, Marc N. Kleinheinz at Screen Rant discussed how the series \"continues to resist a status quo\", from the destruction and rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D., to the fallout from the Sokovia Accords. He noted that a major driving force behind the changes was the MCU films, with the series being forced \"to constantly adapt to a changing narrative landscape that it has absolutely no control over.\" He also believed that the series was obligated to adapt various Marvel characters to screen which would not be appearing in films, such as Daisy Johnson, Mockingbird, and Ghost Rider. However, Kleinheinz felt that this mindset also came from within the series crew rather than just from Marvel, saying, \"there's also the storytelling modus operandi that showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen have very obviously demonstrated during their four-year tenure. It seems that constantly staking out new ground from season to season is just as much a personal predilection as it is, possibly, a corporate mandate.\"<ref name=\"StatusQuoAnalysis\" />\n\nDuring the ''Agents of Hydra'' pod in the fourth season, Collider.com's Evan Valentine noted how \"[o]ne of the prevalent themes of this latter half of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s fourth season has been its jabs at the current [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]... When all's said and done, whether you support or disavow the current administration and what it's done with its time in office, does this commentary work here? Sure it does... We need to be able to laugh at what's going on in the world, regardless of whether we agree or disagree, but ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' has managed to throw in some biting commentary this season.\"<ref name=\"Collider419Review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''[[The Atlantic]]'' named \"[[4,722 Hours]]\" one of the best television episodes of 2015.<ref name=\"AtlanticBest2015\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) and acknowledges the continuity of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the franchise's films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|other television series]]. The series is produced by [[ABC Studios]], [[Marvel Television]], and [[Mutant Enemy Productions]], with Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and [[Jeffrey Bell]] serving as [[showrunner]]s.\n\nThe series stars [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]], reprising his role from the film series, alongside [[Ming-Na Wen]], [[Brett Dalton]], [[Chloe Bennet]], [[Iain De Caestecker]] and [[Elizabeth Henstridge]]. [[Nick Blood]], [[Adrianne Palicki]], [[Henry Simmons]], [[Luke Mitchell]], [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]], [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]], and [[Jeff Ward (actor)|Jeff Ward]] joined in later seasons. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents deal with various unusual cases and enemies, including [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], [[Inhumans]], [[Life Model Decoy]]s, alien species such as the [[Kree]], and time travel.\n\n''The Avengers'' writer and director Joss Whedon began developing a S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Television pilot|pilot]] following the film's release, and Gregg was confirmed to reprise his role in October 2012. The series was officially picked up by ABC in May 2013. [[Prosthetic makeup]] is created with [[Glenn Hetrick]]'s Optic Nerve Studios, while [[Legacy Effects]] contributes other [[practical effects]]. The [[visual effects]] for the series are created by FuseFX, and have been nominated for multiple awards. Several episodes directly crossover with films or other television series set in the MCU, while other characters from MCU films and [[Marvel One-Shots]] also appear throughout the series.\n\nThe series premiered on September 24, 2013, with the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)|first season]] concluding on May 13, 2014. This was followed by a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]] from September 2014 to May 2015, a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third]] from September 2015 to May 2016, a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth]] from September 2016 to May 2017, and a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 5)|fifth]] from December 2017 to May 2018. A [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 6)|sixth season]] premiered on May 10, 2019, and a final [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 7)|seventh season]] is set to premiere on May 27, 2020. After starting the first season with high ratings but mixed reviews, the ratings began to drop while reviews improved. This led to much lower but more consistent ratings, as well as more consistently positive reviews in the subsequent seasons.\n\nSeveral characters created for the series have since been introduced to the [[Marvel Universe|comic universe]] and other media. ''[[Marvel's Most Wanted]]'', a planned spin-off centered on [[Lance Hunter]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]], received a pilot order in August 2015 but did not lead to a series. An online digital series, ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot]]'', centered on Cordova-Buckley's [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez]], was launched in December 2016 on ABC.com.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

In the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]], following the destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D. in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', Coulson becomes director of the organization and is tasked with rebuilding it while dealing with Hydra, a faction of anti-superhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and a newly revealed superhuman race called the [[Inhumans]].<ref name=\"S2Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"Daisy\" />\n\nDuring the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The series was described as \"'a kernel of an idea' with a number of scenarios being explored, including a high-concept cop show.\"<ref name=\"July2012Kernel\"/> The next month, it was announced that ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''{{'}} director [[Joss Whedon]], creator of other television shows such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', would be involved in the series' development.<ref name=\"Aug2012Whedon\"/>\n\nIn August 2012, ABC ordered a pilot for a series called ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' to be written and directed by Joss Whedon, with [[Jed Whedon]] and [[Maurissa Tancharoen]] also writing.<ref name=\"Aug2012Showrunners\"/><ref name=\"Aug2012PilotGreenlit\"/> Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] greenlit the series after watching the [[Marvel One-Shot]] short film ''[[Item 47]]''.<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\"/> In April 2013, ABC announced that the series would be titled ''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',<ref name=\"Apr2013ABCAllAccess\" /> and it was officially picked up for a full season of 22 episodes in May 2013.<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\" /><ref name=\"S1pickup\"/> Jed Whedon, Tancharoen, and [[Jeffrey Bell]] act as the series' [[showrunner]]s,<ref name=\"Aug2012Showrunners\"/> with Bell joining the show to help the inexperienced former pair with hiring crew members and \"navigating the politics of studios and networks\", saying, \"My job is to help them learn how to do that, to steer the ship while they learn.\" Joss Whedon assisted them before he started work on ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" />\n\nThe series was renewed for a [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

(season 7)|seventh season]].<ref name=\"S7Renew\" /> The seventh season will serve as the series' final season.<ref name=\"AoSFinalSeason\" />\n\nIn September 2016, discussing the eventual end of the series, Tancharoen said, \"You always just forge ahead. Until someone tells us to stop, we will continue to move forward.\" Jed Whedon added, \"There are always ideas in the back of your mind for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSep2016\" /> By May 2017, Bell noted they had \"a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends.

When the showrunners are writing the series, one person can write a script while the other two break stories, so that a story can be broken every few weeks. If the executive producers sign off on a story, a member of the series' writers room then produces an outline, gets notes on it from the showrunners, writes a full script, gets notes on it from ABC and the production crew, and then goes to set to produce the episode.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" />\n\nIn January 2013, Joss Whedon deflected any direct influences from other series, such as the efforts of [[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]] in ''[[The X-Files]]'', and explained that while the show would involve people with powers and the spectacle of science-fiction storytelling, it would focus on \"the peripheral people...the people on the edges of the grand adventures.\"<ref name=\"Jan2013WhedonInterview\"/> As the series began to introduce more powered individuals, Bell noted that audiences \"seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that.\"<ref name=\"BellVarietyS2Finale\" /> Jed Whedon stated that the series would continue to emphasize the general public's response to powered people, saying, \"The dynamic in the world has changed. There was one person with powers, and then by ''The Avengers'' there were maybe six total ... now they're much more prevalent, so there's reaction from the public based on that.\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" />\n\nOn the balance between creating new material and drawing from existing mythology, Bell noted that telling stories that can entertain both Marvel fans and non-Marvel fans is challenging, and that for the series they try to add nods to the MCU films or the comics in a way that works well on its own for all viewers, but could also mean more for a fan.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> On where the series can draw from the comics, Jed Whedon explained that there are areas of the comics that the series is not allowed to go to, and that ultimately they only use the comics for inspiration in generating their own story. Tancharoen elaborated that, \"We're always going to be inspired and influenced by the comics, but of course on the show, we'll always be doing our spin to it.\"<ref name=\"ProducersEW\" /> About comparisons between the scope of the series and that of the films, Bell said that ABC and Marvel had been very generous with the series' budget, and that the production could not complain for a network series, but that it was nothing compared to the films or even series like ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. He explained that the series does attempt to create \"Marvel moments\" as best it can, but pointed out that some of the more memorable moments from the films are smaller, character moments\u2014something that works really well on television\u2014so the series strives for those when it cannot afford more scope and scale.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> Jed Whedon elaborated that they look at a sequence and try to keep only what is required to tell the story, so \"If a monster is landing on a car, instead of showing the whole monster leaping through the skyline, we want to be in the car with the character having that experience.\"<ref name=\"BuzzFeedMay2014\" />\n\n{{multiple image|\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = horizontal\n\n<!-- Images -->\n | width             = \n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width1            = 210\n | alt1              = Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen sitting.\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Jeffrey Bell at PaleyFest 2014.jpg\n | width2            = 100\n | alt2              = Jeffrey Bell sitting.\n\n<!-- Footer -->\n | footer_align      = Left\n | footer            = (L to R) Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell, the showrunners of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''\n}}\nIn September 2015, Bell looked back on the first two seasons and talked about the challenges of and changes in the series. He noted the negative reception from fans concerning the low number of recognizable characters like Coulson, but pointed out that fans seemed to have grown to like the series' original characters as they had been developed over time. He explained that with the increasing number of characters and complex relationships in the series, having different pairings and building new emotional relationships was important, and stated that \"whether it's a quiet moment or in action, we [hope to] deepen the audience's love and concern, and hopes for these characters.\"<ref name=\"BellPasteSep2015\" /> A year later he reiterated the producer's intention to create a tradition moving forward of \"finding new combinations and new conflicts\" between different sets of characters, given \"a lot of procedurals [see] the same people doing the same thing for five years and the character don't evolve or change at all.\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" />\n\nThe producers and writers initially formed a general plan for the show through the end of a third season, after reading the screenplays for upcoming MCU films.<ref name=\"HitfixPg2\" /> In May 2016, [[Chloe Bennet]] likened the end of the third season to \"the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show.\"<ref name=\"BennetFirstBook\" /> She elaborated that \"the storylines that we started at the beginning of season 1 really wrapped up at the end of season 3. We've had some major losses of people who have been with us on the show since season 1. From the table read to the first day on set, there's definitely a new energy of the show\" moving forward.<ref name=\"BennetS4\" /> The series was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the writers hoped to \"skew a little darker because of\" this change, with Loeb adding that \"It absolutely offers opportunities. I don't know that it changes things all that dramatically [though]. I mean, at the end of the day, Marvel is always going to make shows that run somewhere between PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to be making ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'' anytime soon on [ABC].\"<ref name=\"CBRSDCC2016\" /> Marvel \"had a long talk with ABC about what can we get away with, so to speak\" in the new timeslot, which led to the inclusion of [[Ghost Rider]] in the season over one of [[Marvel's Netflix television series]], because Marvel felt \"that this character was right to tell [darker and more violent] stories right now\" and having him on ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' aided that because \"it was so unexpected\". Loeb hoped that the combination of the later timeslot and the introduction of Ghost Rider would lead to some viewers who had stopped watching the series over the previous seasons giving it another chance.<ref name=\"GhostRiderAug2016\" />\n\nIn May 2017, ahead of the fifth season renewal, Jed Whedon said the writers were not sure what would happen in the season, and that it would be \"by the seat of our pants.\"<ref name=\"EWMay2017S5Plan\" /> While beginning to write the final episode of season 5 at the end of February 2018, the writers were planning for it to be able to serve as both a season and series finale, with some elements that could be adjusted based on whether the series was renewed for a sixth season or not. Whedon added, \"we're ready for if this is the end. We're definitely going to make it rewarding either way.\"<ref name=\"TVLineS5Ending\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn October 2012, a casting sheet for five lead roles was sent out.<ref name=\"Oct2012TVline\" /> At the [[New York Comic Con]], Joss Whedon, [[Kevin Feige]], and Clark Gregg announced that Gregg would be reprising his role as agent Phil Coulson from ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', ''The Avengers'', and the Marvel One-Shots in the pilot,<ref name=\"CoulsonSHIELD\"/> and would \"headline\" the series.<ref name=\"NYCCCoulson\"/> Actress [[Ming-Na Wen]] was cast as Melinda May.<ref name=\"Oct2012MingNa\"/> The next month, [[Elizabeth Henstridge]] and [[Iain De Caestecker]] were cast as Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz, respectively,<ref name=\"HenstridgeDeCaestecker\" /> while newcomer [[Brett Dalton]] was cast as Grant Ward.<ref name=\"Dalton\"/> In December, Chloe Bennet was chosen out of more than 400 actresses to play Skye, the sixth and final regular for the first season;<ref name=\"Dec2012Bennet\" /><ref name=\"Skye400\" /> the character is revealed in the second season to be [[Daisy Johnson]], and no longer goes by \"Skye\" starting with the third.<ref name=\"SDCC2015\" />\n\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2014, [[Nick Blood]] was announced as cast in the role of [[Lance Hunter]] for the second season, while the character of [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]] was revealed to be appearing.<ref name=\"Blood\" /> That August, [[Henry Simmons]] joined the cast as [[Al MacKenzie|Alphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie]], a recurring role,<ref name=\"Simmons\" /> and [[Adrianne Palicki]] was cast as Morse in a guest role, to first appear in the episode \"[[A Hen in the Wolf House]]\".<ref name=\"Palicki\" /> The next month, the entire first season principal cast were confirmed to be regulars for the second season, along with Blood.<ref name=\"BloodPrincipal\" /> Palicki joined them with the episode \"[[Aftershocks (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Aftershocks]]\".<ref name=\"PalickiMainVariety\" /><ref name=\"PalickiMain\" /> In February 2015, [[Luke Mitchell]] was cast as Lincoln Campbell, a recurring role for the second half of the season.<ref name=\"Mitchell\" /><ref name=\"MitchellCharacter\" />\n\nAll season-two principal cast members returned for the third season,<ref name=\"SHIELDS3Returners\" /> with Simmons and Mitchell joining them, promoted from their recurring roles.<ref name=\"MitchellRegular\" /><ref name=\"SimmonsRegular\"/> In October 2015, the Inhuman [[Hive (comics)|Hive]] was introduced; for the second part of season three, he possesses the corpse of Grant Ward, again portrayed by Brett Dalton.<ref name=\"Hive\" /> Also introduced were [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]] and [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]], recurring as [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez]] and [[Holden Radcliffe]], respectively.<ref name=\"Radcliffe\" /><ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyCast\" /> Blood and Palicki left the main cast following the season-three episode \"[[Parting Shot]]\", to star in the then-planned spin-off show ''[[Marvel's Most Wanted]]''.<ref name=\"BellPartingShot\" /> Dalton and Mitchell also left following the deaths of their characters in the third-season finale.<ref name=\"EWEPsMay2016\"/>\n\nGregg, Wen, Bennet, De Caestecker, Henstridge, and Simmons returned for the fourth and fifth seasons.<ref name=\"S4Premise\" /><ref name=\"S5Press\" /> They were joined by Hannah in the fourth,<ref name=\"HannahRegular\" /> with Cordova-Buckley once again recurring as Rodriguez in the season,<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyS4\" /> before being promoted to a series regular for the fifth season.<ref name=\"CordovaBuckleyMain\" /> Dalton returned as a guest during the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Assistant costume designer Ann Foley took over for subsequent episodes, and worked closely with Tancharoen to create \"very strong, different characters\" whose \"looks evolve along with the show.\"<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> Foley also brought on concept artists Phillip Boutte Jr. and Josh Shaw to assist with the design process.<ref name=\"BoutteInterview\" /><ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> Foley watched every MCU film, paying special attention to ''The Avengers'', and was also inspired by such films as ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''[[Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol]]''.<ref name=\"FoleyTyranny\" /> In October 2016, Foley said that she was specifically following the aesthetic of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', \"So any costume has to fit inside that world we've established and has to fit that tactical look.\"<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" /> On the variety of costumes created for each character, Foley preferred to have set pieces in the characters' \"closets\", as \"it's not a fashion show ... a guy like Ward isn't going to have twenty jackets in his closet. He is going to have one that he uses all of the time.\"<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" />\n\nAfter reading each script, Foley would do her own research, before discussing the look of the episode with the writers.<ref name=\"FoleyHiatus\" /> She then studied the comics, general fashion, and history to get a look that is recognizable to fans, but fits into the more realistic world of the series.<ref name=\"BoutteInterview\" /> Costumes are either custom made or bought, and the actors are brought in for fittings before filming. This process was often challenging because of the series' eight-day-per-episode schedule.<ref name=\"FoleyHiatus\" /> Foley stated that all costumes take a similar amount of time to create, whether they are based on the comics or not.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /> Marvel CCO [[Joe Quesada]] is involved in the approval process when costuming preexisting characters,<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> including Daisy Johnson's Quake costume, which is introduced in the third season. The Quake costume incorporates elements from the comic version of the character, and was intended to show that Quake \"could easily be part of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\".<ref name=\"CostumeEvolution\" /><ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Foley took steps to differentiate the Quake costume from [[Scarlett Johansson]]'s [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Black Widow]] costumes from the films, but was \"flattered\" by comparisons made between them. Foley was also adamant about showing that characters such as Quake \"don't have to be sexualised, that they're powerful, strong women\", and so avoided \"a lot of cleavage, you don't see high heels. It's about practicality.\"<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" />\n\nThe costumes go through a natural evolution in the series. There is a shift at the end of the first season to a darker look, and all the characters have \"definitely grown up\" during the second season. In the third season there is another shift, \"from the ragtag group of soldiers and scientists to [a] more precise militaristic outfit\".<ref name=\"CostumeEvolution\" /> This change is also reflected in the series' color palette, going from \"a much lighter tone, much more patterns\" in the first season to having \"stripped away a bit of color\" by the third.<ref name=\"FoleyOct2016\" /> Despite this increasing darkness in the costumes, Foley intended to define each character as they are introduced and to have them always be recognizable and identifiable.<ref name=\"FoleySep2015\" /> With the start of the fourth season, Foley said that \"each season definitely has its own feel and this season will be no different. I think that you're going to see some subtle differences in the costumes of the characters\"; she felt like Fitz and Simmons, in particular, had become \"more adult looking\", while all the cast had \"a pretty specific ... civilian look\" that would become more prominent as S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized and becomes more public.<ref name=\"FoleySep2016\" /> Foley left the series after the thirteenth episode of the fourth season, to work on a television adaptation of ''[[Altered Carbon]]'',<ref name=\"FoleyLeaves\" /> and was replaced with Amanda Riley. Riley used her previous experience recreating costumes to \"blend in\" with Foley's established look.<ref name=\"ThisWeek58\" />\n\nFoley returned for the first two episodes of the fifth season, before handing costume design over to Whitney Galitz, who had assisted Foley on the previous few seasons, and Christann Chanell.<ref name=\"FoleyBack\" />\n\n====Practical effects====\nThe series' [[Theatrical property|props]] department is led by Scott Bauer. The pilot introduces the Incapacitating Cartridge Emitting Railgun, or ICER, tranquilizer weapons often used by the agents, with Joss Whedon having Bauer design \"sci-fi\"-looking guns, including a large rifle-like weapon. The series' further portrayal of the ICERs was more subtle, with Bauer using airsoft guns that are safe to shoot others with over a small distance. ICER-specific muzzle flashes are then added by the visual effects department. Bauer reused the ICER rifle prop when making Mack's \"Shotgun Ax\", which appears in later seasons. The [[Terrigen Mist|terrigen crystals]] that unlock Inhuman abilities in the series are 3D-printed from solid resin and then altered with extra details.<ref name=\"Props\" /> Additional practical effects and props are created by [[Legacy Effects]], who also work on the MCU films,<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /><ref name=\"LegacyEffectsFilms\" /> notably creating Daisy Johnson's gauntlets for the third season.<ref name=\"QuakeCostume\" /> [[Prosthetic makeup]] for the series is designed in conjunction with [[Glenn Hetrick]] of Optic Nerve Studios. Hetrick began work on the series with the second season, to create [[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters#Raina|Raina]]'s Inhuman look,<ref name=\"RainaMakeUp\" /> and returned for the third season to design and create the more unusual-looking Inhumans such as [[Lash (comics)|Lash]].<ref name=\"HetrickLash\" />\n\n====Title sequence====\n[[File:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. title cards animation.gif|thumb|The title sequence for the series' 100th episode, \"The Real Deal\", featuring a montage of all title cards used throughout the series at that point]]\nThe third season introduces a new title sequence for the series, replacing the one that appeared in the first two seasons.<ref name=\"NewTitle\" /> The title sequence in \"[[4,722 Hours]]\" is drastically different from the design introduced for the third season, with the series' title in the episode's typeface silently fading onto the screen over the back drop of the planet Simmons is stranded on.<ref name=\"4722Title\" /><ref name=\"4722Title2\" /> The fourth season sees new series title cards for the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

(season 4)#LMD|LMD]]'' pods,<ref name=\"S4GRTitle\" /><ref name=\"S4LMDTitle\" /> and an ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' title card for the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)#Agents of Hydra|Agents of Hydra]]'' pod that changes to say ''Agents of Hydra'' for episodes primarily set in the Framework.<ref name=\"HydraTitleCard\" /><ref name=\"FrameworkTitleCard\" /> The ''Ghost Rider'' graphic is used again for the fourth-season finale.<ref name=\"FinaleTitleCard\" /> For the fifth season, the opening of \"Orientation\" is reminiscent of the sequence for \"4,722 Hours\", forgoing the title card and having the typeface silently fading onto the screen.<ref name=\"OrientationOpening\" /> The subsequent episodes of season five feature a title card with the series name in a new typeface against a backdrop of various depictions of Earth: episodes through \"Past Life\" feature a destroyed future Earth;<ref name=\"S5Opening\" /> episodes from \"Principa\" through \"The Devil Complex\" feature a present Earth<!--can be seen at end of 100th episode card montage-->; while episodes from \"Rise and Shine\" through \"All Roads Lead...\" feature the Earth beginning to crack.<ref name=\"515Recap\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction for the pilot took place almost entirely in [[Los Angeles]] to accommodate Joss Whedon's schedule,<ref name=\"Jan2013LeeInterview2\" /> while the rest of the series is primarily filmed in [[Culver City, California]].<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> Additional filming has also taken place around the world, including in [[Paris]], France,<ref name=\"Oct2013Dalton\" /> [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]],<ref name=\"Oct2013Armand\" /> and [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref name=\"PuertoRicoFilming\" /> The series is filmed on [[Arri Alexa]] cameras,<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> with [[David Boyd (cinematographer)|David Boyd]] serving as [[director of photography]] on the pilot,<ref name=\"BoydDoP\" /> and Feliks Parnell, Jeff Mygatt, and Allan Westbrook doing so throughout the rest of the series.<!-- From the episode credits, unless a separate reliable source can be found --> Garry Brown is the second unit director for the series, with stunts coordinated by Tanner Gill.<ref name=\"302BTS\" /> The series is filmed in [[2K resolution]].<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nFuseFX serves as the lead visual effects vendor for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> with additional work by [[Pixomondo]], Cosa, Greenhaus GFX, Lion VFX, and Synaptic.<ref name=\"PostVFX\" /> The series sees an average of 80 to 150 visual effects shots per episode,<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" /> with 10 to 12 days to work on the effects for one episode once background plates have been received from filming.<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> This equates to approximately 2000 visual effects shots per season.<ref name=\"PostVFX\" />  Mark Kolpack serves as visual effects supervisor for the series.<ref name=\"VFX1\" /> David Altenau was the in-house supervisor at FuseFX for \"Pilot\" through episode eight, with Kevin Lingenfelser taking over for subsequent episodes.<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> VFX producer Andrea D'Amico joined the team at FuseFX to work on the series in December 2015.<ref name=\"DAmico\" /> Two separate production management and creative teams were established to work on the show, and producers, compositors and various artists were able to alternate episodes. This was important because most of the episodes had to be worked on concurrently, either two or three at a time.<ref name=\"VFX2\" /> Typical effects for the series include the creation of character-driving effects animation, photo-realistic vehicles, CG set extensions, pyrotechnics, and atmospheric effects.<ref name=\"FuseFX\"/> Some assets, such as a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]] and [[Helicarrier]], are shared from [[Industrial Light & Magic]], though \"those models are generally super heavy and dense with data\" and need to be made \"HD friendly or simply manageable to work in [a] TV schedule.\"<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Bear McCreary]] confirmed that he would compose music for the series in July 2013.<ref name=\"McCreary\"/> Unlike on some of his previous scores, ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary to work with a full symphonic orchestra,<ref name=\"McCrearyDoG\" /> typically featuring 50 or 70 players,<ref name=\"McCrearyMaveth\" /> with over 90 for \"important\" episodes.<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> Complex synthesizer programming was also used, to give the score \"a modern edge\".<ref name=\"McCrearyPilot\" /> Since ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' was the first MCU television series, McCreary felt there was \"a sense that it had to connect\" to the consistent orchestra sound of the films, but viewed through a television lens.<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> McCreary composes on average 30 minutes of music per episode.<ref name=\"McCrearyS3\" /> Creating the main theme for the series, which McCreary also saw as Coulson's theme, was a process which took a lot of collaboration with the executive producers, who wanted a specific sound\u2014\"something big, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\" but also \"intimate because these aren't superheroes, these are regular people.\" McCreary had to work harder to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence.<ref name=\"McCrearyDoG\" /> By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noted \"the score became a little more intense and more electronically driven... [E]lectronics really moved to the forefront as we got into more stories about Inhumans and the digital world our characters inhabit. But the orchestra is always our foundation.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" />\n\nIn September 2014, McCreary announced that there were plans for an ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' soundtrack,<ref name=\"McCrearySoundtrackPlans\" /> which was released digitally a year later by [[Marvel Music]] on September 4, 2015, and on CD on October 9.

He stated that \"ABC and Marvel both want the series to be able to make sense on its own\", but that it was beneficial for the films to have the series fill in any \"gaps\" for them, due to having to be \"big\" and moving \"quickly through a lot of huge pieces\", unlike television which has time to deal with more nuances.<ref name=\"BellPasteSep2015\" />\n\nIn January 2016, Joss Whedon noted that this process \"unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers.\" He stated that, for example, the series' creative team initially wanted to use [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]'s scepter from ''The Avengers'' but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in ''Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"JossScepter\" /> On how their ability to connect with the films changed over the life of the series, Jed Whedon said, \"The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open.\" He added, \"We have relatively free rein [in what the series can introduce and connect to]; we just can't go anywhere that [the films are] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told \"no\" that much\". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as \"something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU.\"<ref name=\"IGNMay2017\" />\n\nThe series mimics the films' [[post credits scene]]s with 'end tags', starting with the episode \"[[0-8-4]]\" which features a [[Samuel L. Jackson]] cameo. Bell explained, \"Sometimes it'll be funny, sometimes it'll be a mythology thing ... or an extra little reveal about\" the episode.<ref name=\"BellOct2013\" /> The end tag for \"[[End of the Beginning (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|End of the Beginning]]\" is a \"directly lifted\" scene from ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''.<ref name=\"WinterSoldierTag\" />\n\nThe series' first major tie-in episode with the wider MCU was \"[[The Well (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Well]]\", which begins immediately after ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''.<ref name=\"ThorTDWCrossover\" /> The episodes \"End of the Beginning\" and \"[[Turn, Turn, Turn (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Turn, Turn, Turn]]\" revolve around the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'',<ref name=\"HitfixPg1\" /><ref name=\"CapTWSCrossover\"/> which led to a retooling of the series.<ref name=\"USATodayHYDRA\" /> Flashback sequences in \"[[Shadows (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Shadows]]\" and \"[[The Things We Bury]]\" featuring [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter]] served as marketing and set-up for the ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' television series.<ref name=\"ACcrossover\" /><ref name=\"Ep8Synopsis\" /> The events of \"[[The Frenemy of My Enemy]]\" and \"[[The Dirty Half Dozen]]\" led up to the opening sequence of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', while \"[[Scars (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Scars]]\" deals with the aftermath of that film.<ref name=\"AoUTieIn\" /> The third season follows similar themes to the film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', focusing on powered people and the different responses to them,<ref name=\"CWThemes\" /> leading up to the episode \"[[Emancipation (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Emancipation]]\", which takes place after the film and shows how its events affect the series' powered characters.<ref name=\"CWTieIn\" />\n\nThe episode \"[[T.A.H.I.T.I.]]\" introduces the [[Kree]] alien race to the MCU, members of which play a significant role in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''.<ref name=\"BennetKree\" /><ref name=\"BennetBellKree\" /> This begins a storyline that recurs throughout the series, and introduces Inhumans to the MCU,<ref name=\"Daisy\" /> with Jed Whedon saying that it was something \"in the works\" for a long time, as [[Marvel Studios]] had plans for an ''[[Inhumans (film)|Inhumans]]'' film, and this would be \"one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film.\"<ref name=\"CBRDec2014\" /> The third season introduces the concept of the [[Secret Warriors (Team White)|Secret Warriors]], with new Inhuman characters inspired by the comic of the same name,<ref name=\"S3SecretWarriors\" /><ref name=\"VarietySecretWarriors\" /> while also [[retcon]]ning the history of Hydra in the MCU, tying it into the Inhumans storyline.<ref name=\"HydraRetcon\" /> Gregg noted in January 2016 that the \"writer and director [of the ''Inhumans'' film] will have free rein to do what they want to do with the Inhumans, but hopefully there'll be some way that our Inhumans connect to that.\"<ref name=\"GreggInhumansFilm\" /> When the film was removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, Whedon noted that the series had \"a little more freedom\" and were \"able to do a little bit more\" with the species going into the fourth season, including the potential of introducing some of the \"classic\" Inhumans.<ref name=\"ClassicInhumans\" /> ''Marvel's Inhumans'', a television series centered on [[Black Bolt]] and other members of the [[List of Inhumans#Inhuman Royal Family|Inhuman Royal Family]], was announced in November 2016 to air on ABC in September 2017.<ref name=\"InhumansSeries\" /> It was not intended to be a spin-off of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"InhumansSeries2\" />\n\nThe fourth season explores the concept of Life Model Decoys,<ref name=\"LMD\" /> which were first referenced in ''The Avengers'',<ref name=\"LMDAvengers\" /> and introduces the character Ghost Rider to the MCU.<ref name=\"S4Premise\" /> On why the series waited to begin exploring LMDs, Jed Whedon said that the series previously did not want to explore the concept before the release of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', which sees the introductions of [[Ultron]] and [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]] in a similar manner to LMDs.<ref name=\"VarietyEPsMay2016\" /> On introducing Ghost Rider, Whedon said that \"with ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' coming out this year, the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe is moving into new waters,\" referring to the exploration of magic. \"We felt that this was obviously a great character that we'd love to have on our show that we feel fits with that shift.\"<ref name=\"GhostRiderEW\" /> The season also continues storylines from the [[Agent Carter (season 2)|second season]] of ''Agent Carter'', with the reveal that the Momentum Energy Labs group is a successor to the Isodyne Energy company, with both companies connected by the parent company [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]], a mainstay of the MCU.<ref name=\"IsodyneConnection\" /> The last four episodes of season five take place over a single day, and coincide with the events of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"S5IWConnections\" /> In August 2017, [[Emily VanCamp]] said that discussions had taken place for her to reprise her role of [[Sharon Carter]] for the series, but there were conflicts with her starring role on the series

account having over 46,000 followers and its official [[Facebook]] page having close to half a million likes.<ref name=\"SocialMedia\" /> Many cast and crew members \"live tweet\" each episode, with [[J. August Richards]] noting that this brings instant feedback from viewers, and allows the crew to \"watch the audience take that journey\" in real time.<ref name=\"RichardsCollider\" />\n\nFor the final six episodes of the first season, Marvel began the \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 1)#\"The Art of Level Seven\"|''Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'': The Art of Level Seven]]\" initiative, in which a different image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode. Bell stated that the initiative was a way to tie the series back to its comics roots, and was thought of at the beginning of the first season. The production team tried to pair specific artists to the teaser posters based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode.<ref name=\"ArtLevelSeven\" /> For the second season, the series returned as \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)#\"The Art of Evolution\"|The Art of Evolution]]\", with an image for each of the final twelve episodes of the season.<ref name=\"ArtEvolution\" /> For season five, Marvel revived their marketing art program, with \"[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The web series follows a newly hired ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' production assistant, who acts as a [[double agent]] for the \"Mastermind\", portrayed by [[Stan Lee]]. Cast and crew members from the series, such as Gregg, also appear, with viewers having the ability to vote in an online poll after each episode to guess where the double agent would go in the next episode; votes entered viewers in a drawing to win prizes from the set of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''<ref name=\"DoubleAgent\" /><ref name=\"StanLeeMastermind\" /> ''Double Agent'' was nominated for Outstanding Digital Series at the 27th [[Producers Guild Awards]].<ref name=\"DoubleAgentPGA\" /> Another Lexus-sponsored five-part web series, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Academy'', released from March 9 to May 4, 2016. In ''Academy'', three ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' fans compete to play an agent in that series. Members of the ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' cast also appear.<ref name=\"Academy\" /> All three fans ultimately made cameo appearances in the third-season finale.<ref name=\"AcademyResult\" />\n\nThe series has been promoted with various subtitles at different times, including ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Uprising'' in season one, leading up to the ''Winter Soldier'' crossover;<ref name=\"Uprising\" /> ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Fallen Agent'' for the end of the third season;<ref name=\"FallenAgent\" /> ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Ghost Rider'' for the first \"pod\" of season four;<ref name=\"GhostRiderSubtitle\" /> and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: LMD'' for the second \"pod\" of season four.<ref name=\"LMDSlingshot\" /> The third \"pod\" of season four was known as ''Agents of Hydra''.<ref name=\"AgentsOfHydra\" />\n\n==Release==\n\n===Broadcast===\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' airs in the United States on ABC,<ref name=\"May2013PickedUp\" /> in [[720p]] [[High-definition television|high definition]] and [[5.1 surround sound]],<ref name=\"PilotSynopsis\" /> despite delivering the episodes to ABC in [[1080p]].<ref name=\"HitfilmVFX\" /> The first season aired on Tuesdays at 8{{nbsp}}pm EST for the first season,<ref name=\"S1Timeslot\" /> and starting with the second season, the series aired on Tuesdays at 9{{nbsp}}pm EST,<ref name=\"S2Timeslot\" /> before moving to the 10{{nbsp}}pm time slot on Tuesdays for the fourth season.<ref name=\"S4Timeslot\" /> For its fifth season, the series aired on Fridays at 9{{nbsp}}pm EST,<ref name=\"S5Timeslot\" /> on Fridays at 8{{nbsp}}pm EST for season six,<ref name=\"S6Timeslot\" /> and will air at 10{{nbsp}}pm EST on Wednesdays for season seven.<ref name=\"S7PremiereDate\" />\n\nThe second and third seasons of the series were broadcast in two blocks each, with a season of ''Agent Carter'' airing in between. Bell explained that this decision was made following the challenge of producing 22 episodes for the first season to be aired over 36\u201340 weeks, which meant having repeats and \"losing momentum\". Instead, ''Agent Carter'' took up much of that gap in a row, leaving the back half of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s season to run uninterrupted.<ref name=\"BellSep2014\" /> This format allowed the producers and writers to approach each season in two parts, each with distinct stories connected by carried-over elements.<ref name=\"TwoArcSeasons\" /> Ahead of the fourth season, Tancharoen explained, \"For the past two seasons, we've been able to break our season down into two little mini-seasons because of the airdate schedule. This upcoming season, our airdate schedule is a little different, so we're breaking it into three pods. Story wise, the development of that has made our lives easier, to break it down in that way.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSep2016\" /> The pod format was described as \"7-10 episodes [that feature] little 'enclosed plotlines' that formed a larger whole.\"<ref name=\"PodDescription\" />\n\nRegarding whether they would break the fifth season into pods again as with season four, Bell said, \"A 22-episode arc is a lot for people to hold on to. By breaking it up into either smaller arcs or different pods, by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down, or moving from space to space, our experience has been that it's something the viewers enjoy, and it makes it a little easier to digest when you're telling some of these stories.\" Whedon also noted it would depend on how the season would be \"broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back to back, it feels weird to start calling it different things...

It also enjoyed DVR recordings that, according to ''[[TV Guide]]'', were \"through the roof\".<ref name=\"TVGuideNov2013\" />\n\nIn March 2016, Alisha Grauso of ''[[Forbes]]'' discussed the series and its ratings, describing the show as having \"never quite been the ratings hit for ABC that the network had hoped it would be...It's hard enough to write a film script that fits within the continuity of the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, even harder to do it with a full-length TV season that must act as connective tissue to the larger world while still being its own thing.\" Grauso opined that the series' ratings may improve if it either focused on trying to be the best series it could be (with fewer connections to the films, like the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel-Netflix shows]]) or on just being \"support and tie-in to the world of the Avengers\". Grauso concluded, \"The end result for either scenario is that, hopefully, ratings move up and stay up. In the first case, fans might be lost by the disconnect from the MCU, but a stronger storyline and more consistent writing would bring them and new fans back. In the second scenario, fans would tune in every week for fear of missing out on a bit of story that's important to the larger world.\"<ref name=\"RatingsMar2016Pg1\" /><ref name=\"RatingsMar2016Pg2\" />\n\n''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' saw the season five episode \"All Roads Lead...\" earn a series low rating of 0.4/2 in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, as well as the lowest initial viewers with 1.67 million.<ref name=\"518Ratings\" /> In November 2018, Parrot Analytics, which measures \"how viewers interact with a TV show's brand online, assessing everything from global file-sharing and peer-to-peer traffic to social media activity\", ranked ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' in the top 0.03 percent of in-demand television series worldwide, classify it as \"Amazing\". Series with similar demand included ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', and ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', while ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' had higher demand than series such as ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Fear The Walking Dead]]''.<ref name=\"ParrotDataNov2018\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center; float:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" colspan=\"2\" | Critical response\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | [[Metacritic]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"width:12px; background:#F77F00;\"|\n| [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

The website's consensus reads, \"''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' swings for the fences with large-scale storytelling and wild twists that elevate season 5 from the saturated MCU and into its own space\".<ref name=\"AoSS5RT\"/>\n\nThe sixth season has a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.7/10 based on 15 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"Six seasons in and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' continues to deepen its exploration of space and the relationships between its heroes.\"<ref name=\"AoSS6RT\"/>\n\n===Analysis===\nThe way that the series is affected by the events of ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' has been called \"miraculous\",<ref name=\"Zap2itSeasonReview\" /><ref name=\"LATimesSeasonReview\" /> with Terri Schwartz at [[Zap2it]] writing \"the fact that the movie so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven\",<ref name=\"Zap2itSeasonReview\" /> while Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' \"faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination.\"<ref name=\"LATimesSeasonReview\" /> The fact that the series also depicts the rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the MCU has also been highlighted, with Merrill Barr, reviewing \"[[Beginning of the End (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Beginning of the End]]\" for ''Forbes'', saying \"what Marvel's daring to say with this season finale is 'everything we do matters, and you need to pay attention to all of it.'\"<ref name=\"ForbesSeasonReview\" />\n\nThe series' introduction of the Inhumans was seen by Oliver Sava of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' as making ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' an essential part of the MCU and Marvel Studios' plans, with the connections between the series and the films previously having always been reactive on the series' behalf, with \"stuff\" happening in the films, and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' dealing with the fallout of it. However, the series would now be \"making things happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU\".<ref name=\"SavaAnalysis\" /> Barr wrote that the series \"does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've never seen it do before. Come the final frame [of the second season finale], all anyone\u2014Marvel fan or otherwise\u2014will be asking is when season three begins.\"<ref name=\"BarrAnalysis\" />\n\nThe third season's paralleling of themes from ''Captain America: Civil War'' was called \"topical and relevant\" and \"downright eerie\" by ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Alex McCown and [[Screen Crush]]'s Kevin Fitzpatrick. McCown compared the series' approach to setting up \"a world distrustful of superpowers\" to the real life events surrounding [[Cliven Bundy]] and [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]], and said that \"''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is taking full advantage of its medium in order to tell the story the upcoming Captain America film can't: A full and fraught exploration of the need to protect freedom and privacy, even for those with extraordinary abilities.\" Fitzpatrick added that this \"topical bent...made for a great angle to build up that world mentality without feeling particularly subservient to the movies.\"<ref name=\"McCownAnalysis\" /><ref name=\"FitzpatrickAnalysis\" />\n\nAhead of the fourth season, [[Collider (website)|Collider]]'s Kayti Burt opined that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is \"the X-Men TV show you should be watching\". Burt noted that the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film franchise]] was expanding to television with the series ''[[Legion (TV series)|Legion]]'', but that ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' already served that purpose well, highlighting the similarities between the X-Men and the Inhumans, both creations of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby during the 1960s consisting of a large group of super-powered people who \"are our neighbors and our friends ... both heroes and villains\", and face \"the same fears and prejudices\" from the wider community. Burt felt that the similarities between ''S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s Inhumans and the X-Men became \"particularly pointed\" in the third season with the Hive storyline, which had a lot in common with the film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' that was released around the same time; Burt was of the opinion that ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executed the storyline \"much better\" than the film did. Other similarities Burt discussed were the series' diverse and ensemble cast, its take on the [[Gifted (comics)|mutant cure storyline]], the parallels between Daisy Johnson's second season arc and the introduction of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' film, and its social and political commentary. With the latter, Burt also discussed the similarities between the Watchdogs and Donald Trump, calling it \"not very subtle, but social commentary doesn't have to be. I appreciate that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' is attempting to comment on the current socio-political state of the country in a way that many of the other superhero TV shows don't even attempt to do. It's perhaps the show's most ''X-Men''-like quality.\" Concluding, Burt said that though the X-Men characters cannot appear in the MCU due to [[20th Century Fox]] holding the rights, \"we still get to enjoy many of the themes prominent in the X-Men universe through ''S.H.I.E.L.D.''\"<ref name=\"XMenAnalysis\" />\n\nAdditionally, Marc N. Kleinheinz at Screen Rant discussed how the series \"continues to resist a status quo\", from the destruction and rebuilding of S.H.I.E.L.D., to the fallout from the Sokovia Accords. He noted that a major driving force behind the changes was the MCU films, with the series being forced \"to constantly adapt to a changing narrative landscape that it has absolutely no control over.\" He also believed that the series was obligated to adapt various Marvel characters to screen which would not be appearing in films, such as Daisy Johnson, Mockingbird, and Ghost Rider. However, Kleinheinz felt that this mindset also came from within the series crew rather than just from Marvel, saying, \"there's also the storytelling modus operandi that showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen have very obviously demonstrated during their four-year tenure. It seems that constantly staking out new ground from season to season is just as much a personal predilection as it is, possibly, a corporate mandate.\"<ref name=\"StatusQuoAnalysis\" />\n\nDuring the ''Agents of Hydra'' pod in the fourth season, Collider.com's Evan Valentine noted how \"[o]ne of the prevalent themes of this latter half of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s fourth season has been its jabs at the current [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]]... When all's said and done, whether you support or disavow the current administration and what it's done with its time in office, does this commentary work here? Sure it does... We need to be able to laugh at what's going on in the world, regardless of whether we agree or disagree, but ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'' has managed to throw in some biting commentary this season.\"<ref name=\"Collider419Review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n''[[The Atlantic]]'' named \"[[4,722 Hours]]\" one of the best television episodes of 2015.<ref name=\"AtlanticBest2015\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
