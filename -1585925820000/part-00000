While the turnaround at Murray Chris-Craft seemed to be going smoothly, the relationship between partners George Dale Murray and Dick Genth was souring. Murray wanted to move Genth out of running the day-to-day operations of the company, and in August 1984, he offered the position of vice-chairman to Genth.

The resulting audit detailed serious accounting irregularities. The auditors estimated that the company had $77M in assets and $40M in debt.

Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next [[Yellow card (sports)|caution]], and had picked up an injury which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway.

He made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'', a few weeks earlier [[Adidas]] launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign \"F\u00fatbol meets Football\" starring Beckham and [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Reggie Bush]], and ''W'' magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]]. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air ''David Beckham: New Beginnings'' documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by [[Simon Fuller]], who in turn has a business relationship with the [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400&nbsp;million headquarters in [[Century City]] with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.67</ref> That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special ''[[Victoria Beckham: Coming to America]]'' aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, pp.69\u201370</ref>\n\n[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007 Direction.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Beckham during a LA Galaxy game in November 2007]]\nOn Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for [[Alan Gordon (soccer)|Alan Gordon]] in the 78th minute of a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the [[World Series of Soccer (MLS)|World Series of Soccer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|title=David Beckham's First Match in Major League Soccer Live on ESPN Saturday, 21&nbsp;July|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=14 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224213616/http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|archivedate=24 December 2008}}</ref> With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, [[Eva Longoria]], [[Governor of California]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Drew Carey]] among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Didier Drogba]], [[Michael Ballack]], and [[Frank Lampard]], the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by [[Steve Sidwell]] whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US \u2013 a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.66\"/> As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than [[2007 Open Championship|British Open]] golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the [[2007 IndyCar Series season|Indy Racing League]]'s [[2007 Honda 200|Honda 200]] motor race.<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.66\"/>\n\nThe day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event.

It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star [[King Edward Hotel (Toronto)|Le M\u00e9ridien King Edward]] in [[downtown Toronto]] (an expense paid for by the local [[Toronto]] promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.85\u201387</ref>\n[[File:Beckham LA Galaxy cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Beckham playing for LA Galaxy in March 2008]]\nTwo weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus [[D.C.

On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with [[Herbalife]] nutrition company worth US$20&nbsp;million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home stadium, the [[Dignity Health Sports Park|Home Depot Center]]).<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.44\">''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.44</ref> LA Galaxy owners [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG) also reported an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]], where the company had been working aggressively for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. The company's CEO [[Tim Leiweke]] put it as follows: \"Suddenly, we're known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to play for, so our world changed\".<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.45</ref>\n\nIn the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an [[Expansion of Major League Soccer|MLS expansion]] franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25&nbsp;million whenever he stopped playing in the league<ref name=\"Kennedy\">{{cite news|url=http://www.socceramerica.com/article/51723/beckham-is-mls-expansion-story-du-jour.html|title=Beckham is MLS expansion story du jour|first=Paul|last=Kennedy|date=20 May 2013|work=Soccer Business Insider}}</ref> \u2013 an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract.<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.44\"/> The league had a [[salary cap]] in place, requiring the creation of the [[Designated Player Rule]] for Beckham to bypass the cap; the rule was later nicknamed in his honor. In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2&nbsp;million home on San Ysidro Drive in [[Beverly Hills]].<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.66\">''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.66</ref>\n\n[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Beckham (with a blue captain's armband) became LA Galaxy captain immediately upon joining the team]]\nBeckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.16</ref> Beckham chose to wear number 23.

He made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'', a few weeks earlier [[Adidas]] launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign \"F\u00fatbol meets Football\" starring Beckham and [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Reggie Bush]], and ''W'' magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by [[Steven Klein (photographer)|Steven Klein]]. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air ''David Beckham: New Beginnings'' documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by [[Simon Fuller]], who in turn has a business relationship with the [[Creative Artists Agency]] (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400&nbsp;million headquarters in [[Century City]] with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, p.67</ref> That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special ''[[Victoria Beckham: Coming to America]]'' aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, pp.69\u201370</ref>\n\n[[File:David Beckham Nov 11 2007 Direction.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Beckham during a LA Galaxy game in November 2007]]\nOn Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for [[Alan Gordon (soccer)|Alan Gordon]] in the 78th minute of a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the [[World Series of Soccer (MLS)|World Series of Soccer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|title=David Beckham's First Match in Major League Soccer Live on ESPN Saturday, 21&nbsp;July|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=14 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224213616/http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2007_07_jul/20070705_DavidBeckham.htm|archivedate=24 December 2008}}</ref> With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, [[Eva Longoria]], [[Governor of California]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Drew Carey]] among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as [[Andriy Shevchenko]], [[Didier Drogba]], [[Michael Ballack]], and [[Frank Lampard]], the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by [[Steve Sidwell]] whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US \u2013 a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.66\"/> As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than [[2007 Open Championship|British Open]] golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the [[2007 IndyCar Series season|Indy Racing League]]'s [[2007 Honda 200|Honda 200]] motor race.<ref name=\"The Beckham Experiment p.66\"/>\n\nThe day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood [[A-list]]ers, the lavish bash was big news in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[Access Hollywood]]''.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.68\u201370</ref>\n\nBeckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches \u2013 three in the [[North American SuperLiga]] and an MLS game away at [[Toronto FC]] though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star [[King Edward Hotel (Toronto)|Le M\u00e9ridien King Edward]] in [[downtown Toronto]] (an expense paid for by the local [[Toronto]] promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.<ref>''The Beckham Experiment'', Grant Wahl, Three Rivers Press, New York, 2010 paperback edition, Pp.85\u201387</ref>\n[[File:Beckham LA Galaxy cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Beckham playing for LA Galaxy in March 2008]]\nTwo weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus [[D.C. United]] in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]], coming on for [[Quavas Kirk]] in the 71st minute.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/2007-08-09-beckham-debut_N.htm |title=Beckham makes MLS debut but Galaxy stumbles in D.C. |work=USA Today |accessdate=15 August 2007 |first=Beau |last=Dure |date=12 August 2007 }}</ref> Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that [[Carlos Pav\u00f3n]] failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into [[Landon Donovan]]'s path that United's keeper [[Troy Perkins]] managed to break up in the last moment \u2013 the Galaxy lost 1\u20130. The next match on the road trip was at [[New England Revolution]] and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the [[Gillette Stadium]]'s artificial surface.\n\nBeckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing D.C. United, in the [[North American SuperLiga|SuperLiga]] semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=453684&root=mls&cc=5901|title=Beckham takes captain's armband to great effect|publisher=ESPN |date=16 August 2007}}</ref> He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2\u20130 victory, and a place in the [[2007 North American SuperLiga|North American SuperLiga]] final versus [[C.F. Pachuca|Pachuca]] on 29 August.\n\nDuring the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scan revealing that he had sprained his [[medial collateral ligament]] and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1\u20130 loss to the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league).\n\n====2008====\nBeckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 2008 for three weeks until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7171836.stm |title=Beckham begins Arsenal training |work=BBC Sport |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=4 May 2009}}</ref> Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] in the ninth minute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=237757&cc=5901 |title=Beckham, Donovan propel L.A. past Quakes |publisher=ESPN |date=4 April 2008 |accessdate=4 April 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408050045/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=237757&cc=5901 |archivedate=8 April 2008 }}</ref> On 24 May 2008, the Galaxy defeated the [[Sporting Kansas City|Kansas City Wizards]] 3\u20131, giving the Galaxy their first winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70&nbsp;yards out.

Due to this low efficacy, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) does not recommend the routine use of the RTS,S vaccine in babies between 6 and 12 weeks of age.<ref name=WHO2016>{{cite journal|title=Malaria vaccine: WHO position paper \u2013 January 2016|journal=Weekly Epidemiological Record|date=4 Nov 2016|volume=91|issue=4|pages=33\u201352|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2016/wer9104.pdf?ua=1|lay-url=https://www.who.int/immunization/policy/position_papers/malaria_pp_jan2016_summary.pdf?ua=1}}</ref>\n\nA WHO-led implementation program is piloting the vaccine in three high-malaria countries in Africa in 2019.

It consists of the ''P. falciparum'' [[circumsporozoite protein]] (CSP) from the pre-erythrocytic stage. The CSP antigen causes the production of antibodies capable of preventing the invasion of [[hepatocytes]] and additionally elicits a cellular response enabling the destruction of infected hepatocytes. The CSP vaccine presented problems in trials due to its poor [[immunogenicity]]. RTS,S attempted to avoid these by fusing the protein with a surface antigen from [[hepatitis B]], hence creating a more potent and immunogenic vaccine. When tested in trials an emulsion of oil in water and the added adjuvants of [[monophosphoryl A]] and QS21 (SBAS2), the vaccine gave protective immunity to 7 out of 8 volunteers when challenged with ''P. falciparum.''<ref name=\"Links to articles about recent RTS changes\">{{cite web|title=RTS,S malaria candidate vaccine reduces malaria by approximately one-third in African infants|url=http://www.malariavaccine.org/rd-rtss.php|work=malariavaccine.org|publisher=Malaria Vaccine Initiative Path|accessdate=19 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323002121/http://www.malariavaccine.org/rd-rtss.php|archive-date=23 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRTS,S/AS01 (commercial name Mosquirix),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lse.co.uk/FinanceNews.asp?ArticleCode=zomftb67bm5garg&ArticleHeadline=GSK_malaria_vaccine_shows_longlasting_protection |title=Commercial name of RTS,S |access-date=20 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405215203/http://www.lse.co.uk/FinanceNews.asp?ArticleCode=zomftb67bm5garg&ArticleHeadline=GSK_malaria_vaccine_shows_longlasting_protection |archive-date=5 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> was engineered using genes from the outer protein of ''P. falciparum'' malaria parasite and a portion of a hepatitis B virus plus a chemical [[adjuvant]] to boost the immune response.

The study ended in 2014. The effects of a booster dose were positive, even though overall efficacy seem to wane with time. After four years reductions were 36 percent for children who received three shots and a booster dose. Missing the booster dose reduced the efficacy against severe malaria to a negligible effect. The vaccine was shown to be less effective for infants. Three doses of vaccine plus a booster reduced the risk of clinical episodes by 26 percent over three years, but offered no significant protection against severe malaria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/malaria-vaccine-candidate-trial/37205|title=Malaria vaccine candidate shown to prevent thousands of cases|last=Borghino|first=Dario|date=27 April 2015|website=www.gizmag.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref>\n\nIn a bid to accommodate a larger group and guarantee a sustained availability for the general public, GSK applied for a marketing license with the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) in July 2014.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2014/gsk-announces-eu-regulatory-submission-for-malaria-vaccine-candidate-rtss//|title=GSK announces EU regulatory submission of malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S|publisher=GSK|date=24 July 2014|accessdate=30 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005601/http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2014/gsk-announces-eu-regulatory-submission-for-malaria-vaccine-candidate-rtss/|archive-date=4 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> GSK treated the project as a non-profit initiative, with most funding coming from the Gates Foundation, a major contributor to malaria eradication.<ref>{{cite news|title=GSK aims to market world's first malaria vaccine|author=Kelland, Kate|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/07/us-malaria-vaccine-gsk-idUSBRE9960Y320131007|newspaper=Reuters|date=7 October 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 July 2015, Mosquirix received a positive opinion from the EMA on the proposal of the vaccine to be used to vaccinate children aged 6 weeks to 17 months outside the European Union.<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2015/07/news_detail_002376.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1|title=First malaria vaccine receives positive scientific opinion from EMA| publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA)|date=24 July 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2015/gsk-s-malaria-candidate-vaccine-mosquirix-rtss-receives-positive-opinion-from-european-regulators-for-the-prevention-of-malaria-in-young-children-in-sub-saharan-africa/|title=GSK's malaria candidate vaccine, Mosquirix (RTS,S), receives positive opinion from European regulators for the prevention of malaria in young children in sub-Saharan Africa|publisher=GSK|date=24 July 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728013544/http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2015/gsk-s-malaria-candidate-vaccine-mosquirix-rtss-receives-positive-opinion-from-european-regulators-for-the-prevention-of-malaria-in-young-children-in-sub-saharan-africa/|archivedate=28 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Mosquirix H-W-2300 | website=[[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) | date=17 September 2018 | url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/mosquirix-h-w-2300 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191123055901/https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/mosquirix-h-w-2300 | archive-date=23 November 2019 | url-status=live | access-date=22 November 2019}}</ref><br>Pilot project for vaccination has been launched on 23 April 2019 in [[Malawi]], on 30 April 2019 in [[Ghana]], and on 13 September 2019 in [[Kenya]].<ref name=\"Wuxi\">{{cite press release |last=Alonso |first=Pedro |date=19 June 2019 |title=Letter to partners \u2013 June 2019 |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-06-2019-letter-to-partners-june-2019 |location=Wuxi |publisher=World Health Organization |access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref><ref name=\"Homa\">{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Malaria vaccine launched in Kenya: Kenya joins Ghana and Malawi to roll out landmark vaccine in pilot introduction |url=https://www.afro.who.int/news/malaria-vaccine-launched-kenya-kenya-joins-ghana-and-malawi-roll-out-landmark-vaccine-pilot |location=Homa Bay |publisher=World Health Organization |date=13 September 2019 |access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\n==Considerations==\nThe task of developing a preventive vaccine for malaria is a complex process. There are a number of considerations to be made concerning what strategy a potential vaccine should adopt.\n\n===Parasite diversity===\n\n''P. falciparum'' has demonstrated the capability, through the development of multiple drug-resistant parasites, for evolutionary change. The [[Plasmodium|''Plasmodium'' species]] has a very high rate of replication, much higher than that actually needed to ensure transmission in the parasite's life cycle. This enables pharmaceutical treatments that are effective at reducing the reproduction rate, but not halting it, to exert a high selection pressure, thus favoring the development of resistance. The process of evolutionary change is one of the key considerations necessary when considering potential vaccine candidates. The development of resistance could cause a significant reduction in efficacy of any potential vaccine thus rendering useless a carefully developed and effective treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=David A.|last2=Read|first2=Andrew F.|date=2018-12-18|title=Why the evolution of vaccine resistance is less of a concern than the evolution of drug resistance|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=115|issue=51|pages=12878\u201312886|doi=10.1073/pnas.1717159115|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6304978|pmid=30559199}}</ref>\n\n===Choosing to address the symptom or the source===\n\nThe parasite induces two main response types from the human immune system.  These are anti-parasitic immunity and anti-toxic immunity.\n\n*\"Anti-parasitic immunity\" addresses the source; it consists of an antibody response ([[humoral immunity]]) and a cell-mediated immune response. Ideally a vaccine would enable the development of anti-plasmodial [[antibodies]] in addition to generating an elevated cell-mediated response.  Potential antigens against which a vaccine could be targeted will be discussed in greater depth later. Antibodies are part of the specific immune response. They exert their effect by activating the complement cascade, stimulating [[phagocytic cells]] into [[endocytosis]] through adhesion to an external surface of the antigenic substances, thus 'marking' it as offensive.  Humoral or cell-mediated immunity consists of many interlinking mechanisms that essentially aim to prevent infection entering the body (through external barriers or hostile internal environments) and then kill any micro-organisms or foreign particles that succeed in penetration. The cell-mediated component consists of many white blood cells (such as [[monocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[macrophages]], [[lymphocytes]], [[basophils]], [[mast cells]], [[natural killer cells]], and [[eosinophils]]) that target foreign bodies by a variety of different mechanisms. In the case of malaria both systems would be targeted to attempt to increase the potential response generated, thus ensuring the maximum chance of preventing disease. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n*\"Anti-toxic immunity\" addresses the symptoms; it refers to the suppression of the immune response associated with the production of factors that either induce symptoms or reduce the effect that any toxic by-products (of micro-organism presence) have on the development of disease. For example, it has been shown that [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] has a central role in generating the symptoms experienced in severe ''P. falciparum'' malaria. Thus a therapeutic vaccine could target the production of TNF-a, preventing respiratory distress and cerebral symptoms. This approach has serious limitations as it would not reduce the parasitic load; rather it only reduces the associated pathology.  As a result, there are substantial difficulties in evaluating efficacy in human trials.\n\nTaking this information into consideration an ideal vaccine candidate would attempt to generate a more substantial cell-mediated and antibody response on parasite presentation. This would have the benefit of increasing the rate of parasite clearance, thus reducing the experienced symptoms and providing a level  of consistent future immunity against the parasite.\n\n===Potential targets===\n{{see also|PFSPZ vaccine}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Potential vaccine targets in the [[Plasmodium#Life cycle|malaria lifecycle]] (Doolan and Hoffman)\n|-\n!

Anti-host [[erythrocyte]], antibodies blocking fertilisation, antibodies blocking egress from the mosquito midgut. \n|}\n\nBy their very nature, protozoa are more complex organisms than bacteria and viruses, with more complicated structures and life cycles. This presents problems in vaccine development but also increases the number of potential targets for a vaccine. These have been summarised into the life cycle stage and the antibodies that could potentially elicit an immune response.\n\nThe epidemiology of malaria varies enormously across the globe, and has led to the belief that it may be necessary to adopt very different vaccine development strategies to target the different populations. A Type 1 vaccine is suggested for those exposed mostly to ''P. falciparum'' malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, with the primary objective to reduce the number of severe malaria cases and deaths in infants and children exposed to high transmission rates. The Type 2 vaccine could be thought of as a 'travellers' vaccine', aiming to prevent all cases of clinical symptoms in individuals with no previous exposure. This is another major public health problem, with malaria presenting as one of the most substantial threats to travellers' health. Problems with the current available pharmaceutical therapies include costs, availability, adverse effects and contraindications, inconvenience and compliance, many of which would be reduced or eliminated entirely if an effective (greater than 85\u201390%) vaccine was developed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe life cycle of the malaria parasite is particularly complex, presenting initial developmental problems. Despite the huge number of vaccines available at the current time, there are none that target parasitic infections. The distinct developmental stages involved in the life cycle present numerous opportunities for targeting antigens, thus potentially eliciting an immune response.  Theoretically, each developmental stage could have a vaccine developed specifically to target the parasite. Moreover, any vaccine produced would ideally have the ability to be of therapeutic value as well as preventing further transmission and is likely to consist of a combination of antigens from different phases of the parasite's development.  More than 30 of these antigens are currently being researched by teams all over the world in the hope of identifying a combination that can elicit immunity in the inoculated individual. Some of the approaches involve surface expression of the antigen, inhibitory effects of specific antibodies on the life cycle and the protective effects through immunization or passive transfer of antibodies between an immune and a non-immune host. The majority of research into malarial vaccines has focused on the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' strain due to the high mortality caused by the parasite and the ease of a carrying out in vitro/in vivo studies. The earliest vaccines attempted to use the parasitic [[circumsporozoite]] (CS) protein. This is the most dominant surface antigen of the initial pre-erythrocytic phase. However, problems were encountered due to low efficacy, [[reactogenicity]] and low [[immunogenicity]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n*The initial stage in the life cycle, following inoculation, is a relatively short \"pre-erythrocytic\" or \"hepatic\" phase. A vaccine at this stage must have the ability to protect against sporozoites invading and possibly inhibiting the development of parasites in the hepatocytes (through inducing [[cytotoxic]] [[T-lymphocytes]] that can destroy the infected [[liver cells]]). However, if any sporozoites evaded the immune system they would then have the potential to be symptomatic and cause the clinical disease.\n*The second phase of the life cycle is the \"erythrocytic\" or blood phase. A vaccine here could prevent [[merozoite]] multiplication or the invasion of [[red blood cells]]. This approach is complicated by the lack of [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC molecule]] expression on the surface of erythrocytes. Instead, malarial antigens are expressed, and it is this towards which the antibodies could potentially be directed. Another approach would be to attempt to block the process of erythrocyte adherence to blood vessel walls. It is thought that this process is accountable for much of the clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection; therefore a vaccine given during this stage would be therapeutic and hence administered during clinical episodes to prevent further deterioration. \n*The last phase of the life cycle that has the potential to be targeted by a vaccine is the \"sexual stage\". This would not give any protective benefits to the individual inoculated but would prevent further transmission of the parasite by preventing the [[gametocytes]] from producing multiple sporozoites in the gut wall of the mosquito. It therefore would be used as part of a policy directed at eliminating the parasite from areas of low prevalence or to prevent the development and spread of vaccine-resistant parasites. This type of transmission-blocking vaccine is potentially very important. The evolution of resistance in the malaria parasite occurs very quickly, potentially making any vaccine redundant within a few generations. This approach to the prevention of spread is therefore essential.\n*Another approach is to target the [[protein kinases]], which are present during the entire lifecycle of the malaria parasite. Research is underway on this, yet production of an actual vaccine targeting these protein kinases may still take a long time.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang VM, Chavchich M, Waters NC |title=Targeting protein kinases in the malaria parasite: update of an antimalarial drug target |journal=Curr Top Med Chem |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=456\u201372 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22242850 |doi=10.2174/156802612799362922 |url=http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CTMC/2012/00000012/00000005/0006R.SGM |access-date=23 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530081801/http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CTMC%2F2012%2F00000012%2F00000005%2F0006R.SGM |archive-date=30 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Report of a new candidate of vaccine capable to neutralize all tested strains of ''Plasmodium falciparum'', the most deadly form of the parasite causing malaria, was published in [[Nature Communications]] by a team of scientists from the [[University of Oxford]].<ref name=vaccine>{{cite journal|last1=Douglas|first1=Alexander|last2=et|first2=al|title=The blood-stage malaria antigen PfRH5 is susceptible to vaccine-inducible cross-strain neutralizing antibody|journal=Nature Communications|volume=2|pages=601|year=2011|doi=10.1038/ncomms1615|issue=12|pmid=22186897|pmc=3504505|bibcode=2011NatCo...2E.601D}}</ref>  The viral vectored vaccine, targeting a full-length ''P. falciparum'' reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (PfRH5) was found to induce an antibody response in an animal model.

It is able to stay dormant in the [[liver]] and reemerge years later to elicit new infections.  Two key proteins involved in the invasion of the red blood cells (RBC) by ''P. vivax'' are potential targets for drug or vaccine development.  When the Duffy binding protein (DBP) of ''P. vivax'' binds the Duffy antigen (DARC) on the surface of RBC, process for the parasite to enter the RBC is initiated.  Structures of the core region of DARC and the receptor binding pocket of DBP have been mapped by scientists at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]].  The researchers found that the binding is a two-step process which involves two copies of the parasite protein acting together like a pair of tongs which 'clamp'' two copies of DARC.    Antibodies that interfere with the binding, by either targeting the key region of the DARC or the DBP will prevent the infection.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/protein-discovery-could-aid-malaria-vaccine-design/2014-01-13|title=Scientists capture key protein structures that could aid malaria vaccine design|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Batchelor|first1=J.|last2=Malpede|first2=B.|last3=Omattage|first3=N.|last4=DeKoster|first4=G.|last5=Henzler-Wildman|first5=K.|last6=Tolia|first6=N.|title=Red Blood Cell Invasion by ''Plasmodium vivax'': Structural Basis for DBP Engagement of DARC|journal=[[PLOS Pathogens]]|volume=10|issue=1|page= e1003869|year=2014|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003869|pmid=24415938|pmc=3887093}}</ref>\n*Antibodies against the [[Schizont]] Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1) were found to disable the parasite ability to rupture from the infected red blood cells (RBCs) thus prevent it from continuing with its life cycle.

A vaccine targeting several antigens may require delivery to different areas and by different means in order to elicit an effective response. Some [[adjuvants]] can direct the vaccine to the specifically targeted cell type\u2014e.g. the use of [[Hepatitis B virus]] in the [[RTS,S]] vaccine to target infected hepatocytes\u2014but in other cases, particularly when using combined antigenic vaccines, this approach is very complex. Some methods that have been attempted include the use of two vaccines, one directed at generating a blood response and the other a liver-stage response. These two vaccines could then be injected into two different sites, thus enabling the use of a more specific and potentially efficacious delivery system.\n\nTo increase, accelerate or modify the development of an immune response to a vaccine candidate it is often necessary to combine the antigenic substance to be delivered with an adjuvant or specialised delivery system. These terms are often used interchangeably in relation to vaccine development; however in most cases a distinction can be made. An adjuvant is typically thought of as a substance used in combination with the antigen to produce a more substantial and robust immune response than that elicited by the antigen alone. This is achieved through three mechanisms: by affecting the antigen delivery and presentation, by inducing the production of immunomodulatory cytokines, and by affecting the [[antigen presenting cells]] (APC). Adjuvants can consist of many different materials, from cell microparticles to other particulated delivery systems (e.g. [[liposome]]s).\n\nAdjuvants are crucial in affecting the specificity and isotype of the necessary antibodies. They are thought to be able to potentiate the link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Due to the diverse nature of substances that can potentially have this effect on the immune system, it is difficult to classify adjuvants into specific groups. In most circumstances they consist of easily identifiable components of micro-organisms that are recognised by the innate immune system cells. The role of delivery systems is primarily to direct the chosen adjuvant and antigen into target cells to attempt to increase the efficacy of the vaccine further, therefore acting synergistically with the adjuvant.\n\nThere is increasing concern that the use of very potent adjuvants could precipitate autoimmune responses, making it imperative that the vaccine is focused on the target cells only. Specific delivery systems can reduce this risk by limiting the potential toxicity and systemic distribution of newly developed adjuvants.\n\nStudies into the efficacy of malaria vaccines developed to date{{when|date=November 2019}} have illustrated that the presence of an adjuvant is key in determining any protection gained against malaria. A large number of natural and synthetic adjuvants have been identified throughout the history of vaccine development. Options identified thus far for use combined with a malaria vaccine include mycobacterial cell walls, liposomes, monophosphoryl lipid A and squalene.\n\n==Agents under development==\nA completely effective vaccine is not yet available for malaria, although several vaccines are under development. SPf66 a synthetic peptide based vaccine developed by [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo]] team in [[Colombia]] was tested extensively in endemic areas in the 1990s, but clinical trials showed it to be insufficiently effective, 28% efficacy in South America and minimal or no efficacy in Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16625647 |pmc=6532709 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (SPf66) |issue=2 |pages=CD005966 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005966 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}</ref> Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have also been insufficient on their own.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17054281 |pmc=6532641 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (blood-stage) |issue=4 |pages=CD006199 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006199 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}</ref> Several potential vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage are being developed, with [[RTS,S]] showing the most promising results so far.,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17054280 |pmc=6532586 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (pre-erythrocytic) |issue=4 |pages=CD006198 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006198 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}</ref><ref name=\"doi10.1056/NEJMoa1208394\">{{cite journal | author1= RTS&#x2c;S Clinical Trials Partnership | last2= Agnandji | first2= S.

It is also based on the circumsporozoite protein, but additionally has the recombinant (Asn-Ala-Pro15Asn-Val-Asp-Pro)2-Leu-Arg([[R32LR]]) protein covalently bound to a purified ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' toxin (A9). However at an early stage a complete lack of protective immunity was demonstrated in those inoculated. The study group used in [[Kenya]] had an 82% incidence of [[parasitaemia]] whilst the control group only had an 89% incidence. The vaccine intended to cause an increased T-lymphocyte response in those exposed, this was also not observed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n* The [[NYVAC-Pf7]] multi-stage vaccine attempted to use different technology, incorporating seven ''P.falciparum'' antigenic genes. These came from a variety of stages during the life cycle. CSP and sporozoite surface protein 2 (called [[PfSSP2]]) were derived from the sporozoite phase. The liver stage antigen 1 (LSA1), three from the erythrocytic stage (merozoite surface protein 1, serine repeat antigen and AMA-1) and one sexual stage antigen (the 25-kDa Pfs25) were included. This was first investigated using [[Rhesus monkeys]] and produced encouraging results: 4 out of the 7 antigens produced specific antibody responses (CSP, PfSSP2, [[Merozoite surface protein|MSP1]] and PFs25). Later trials in humans, despite demonstrating cellular immune responses in over 90% of the subjects, had very poor antibody responses. Despite this following administration of the vaccine some candidates had complete protection when challenged with ''P.falciparum''. This result has warranted ongoing trials. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n* In 1995 a field trial involving [NANP]19-5.1 proved to be very successful. Out of 194 children vaccinated none developed symptomatic malaria in the 12-week follow up period and only 8 failed to have higher levels of antibody present. The vaccine consists of the [[schizont export protein]] (5.1) and 19 repeats of the sporozoite surface protein [NANP]. Limitations of the technology exist as it contains only 20% [[peptide]] and has low levels of immunogenicity. It also does not contain any immunodominant T-cell [[epitopes]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ratanji|first=Kirsty D.|last2=Derrick|first2=Jeremy P.|last3=Dearman|first3=Rebecca J.|last4=Kimber|first4=Ian|date=April 2014|title=Immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins: Influence of aggregation|journal=Journal of Immunotoxicology|volume=11|issue=2|pages=99\u2013109|doi=10.3109/1547691X.2013.821564|issn=1547-691X|pmc=4002659|pmid=23919460}}</ref>\n\n=== Nanoparticle enhancement of RTS,S ===\nIn 2015, researchers used a repetitive antigen display technology to engineer a nanoparticle that displayed malaria specific B cell and T cell epitopes.

Three doses of vaccine plus a booster reduced the risk of clinical episodes by 26 percent over three years, but offered no significant protection against severe malaria.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/malaria-vaccine-candidate-trial/37205|title=Malaria vaccine candidate shown to prevent thousands of cases|last=Borghino|first=Dario|date=27 April 2015|website=www.gizmag.com|access-date=2016-06-11}}</ref>\n\nIn a bid to accommodate a larger group and guarantee a sustained availability for the general public, GSK applied for a marketing license with the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) in July 2014.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2014/gsk-announces-eu-regulatory-submission-for-malaria-vaccine-candidate-rtss//|title=GSK announces EU regulatory submission of malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S|publisher=GSK|date=24 July 2014|accessdate=30 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204005601/http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2014/gsk-announces-eu-regulatory-submission-for-malaria-vaccine-candidate-rtss/|archive-date=4 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> GSK treated the project as a non-profit initiative, with most funding coming from the Gates Foundation, a major contributor to malaria eradication.<ref>{{cite news|title=GSK aims to market world's first malaria vaccine|author=Kelland, Kate|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/07/us-malaria-vaccine-gsk-idUSBRE9960Y320131007|newspaper=Reuters|date=7 October 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 July 2015, Mosquirix received a positive opinion from the EMA on the proposal of the vaccine to be used to vaccinate children aged 6 weeks to 17 months outside the European Union.<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2015/07/news_detail_002376.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1|title=First malaria vaccine receives positive scientific opinion from EMA| publisher=[[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA)|date=24 July 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2015/gsk-s-malaria-candidate-vaccine-mosquirix-rtss-receives-positive-opinion-from-european-regulators-for-the-prevention-of-malaria-in-young-children-in-sub-saharan-africa/|title=GSK's malaria candidate vaccine, Mosquirix (RTS,S), receives positive opinion from European regulators for the prevention of malaria in young children in sub-Saharan Africa|publisher=GSK|date=24 July 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728013544/http://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/2015/gsk-s-malaria-candidate-vaccine-mosquirix-rtss-receives-positive-opinion-from-european-regulators-for-the-prevention-of-malaria-in-young-children-in-sub-saharan-africa/|archivedate=28 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Mosquirix H-W-2300 | website=[[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) | date=17 September 2018 | url=https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/mosquirix-h-w-2300 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191123055901/https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/mosquirix-h-w-2300 | archive-date=23 November 2019 | url-status=live | access-date=22 November 2019}}</ref><br>Pilot project for vaccination has been launched on 23 April 2019 in [[Malawi]], on 30 April 2019 in [[Ghana]], and on 13 September 2019 in [[Kenya]].<ref name=\"Wuxi\">{{cite press release |last=Alonso |first=Pedro |date=19 June 2019 |title=Letter to partners \u2013 June 2019 |url=https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-06-2019-letter-to-partners-june-2019 |location=Wuxi |publisher=World Health Organization |access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref><ref name=\"Homa\">{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Malaria vaccine launched in Kenya: Kenya joins Ghana and Malawi to roll out landmark vaccine in pilot introduction |url=https://www.afro.who.int/news/malaria-vaccine-launched-kenya-kenya-joins-ghana-and-malawi-roll-out-landmark-vaccine-pilot |location=Homa Bay |publisher=World Health Organization |date=13 September 2019 |access-date=2019-10-22}}</ref>\n\n==Considerations==\nThe task of developing a preventive vaccine for malaria is a complex process. There are a number of considerations to be made concerning what strategy a potential vaccine should adopt.\n\n===Parasite diversity===\n\n''P. falciparum'' has demonstrated the capability, through the development of multiple drug-resistant parasites, for evolutionary change. The [[Plasmodium|''Plasmodium'' species]] has a very high rate of replication, much higher than that actually needed to ensure transmission in the parasite's life cycle. This enables pharmaceutical treatments that are effective at reducing the reproduction rate, but not halting it, to exert a high selection pressure, thus favoring the development of resistance. The process of evolutionary change is one of the key considerations necessary when considering potential vaccine candidates. The development of resistance could cause a significant reduction in efficacy of any potential vaccine thus rendering useless a carefully developed and effective treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=David A.|last2=Read|first2=Andrew F.|date=2018-12-18|title=Why the evolution of vaccine resistance is less of a concern than the evolution of drug resistance|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=115|issue=51|pages=12878\u201312886|doi=10.1073/pnas.1717159115|issn=0027-8424|pmc=6304978|pmid=30559199}}</ref>\n\n===Choosing to address the symptom or the source===\n\nThe parasite induces two main response types from the human immune system.  These are anti-parasitic immunity and anti-toxic immunity.\n\n*\"Anti-parasitic immunity\" addresses the source; it consists of an antibody response ([[humoral immunity]]) and a cell-mediated immune response. Ideally a vaccine would enable the development of anti-plasmodial [[antibodies]] in addition to generating an elevated cell-mediated response.  Potential antigens against which a vaccine could be targeted will be discussed in greater depth later. Antibodies are part of the specific immune response. They exert their effect by activating the complement cascade, stimulating [[phagocytic cells]] into [[endocytosis]] through adhesion to an external surface of the antigenic substances, thus 'marking' it as offensive.  Humoral or cell-mediated immunity consists of many interlinking mechanisms that essentially aim to prevent infection entering the body (through external barriers or hostile internal environments) and then kill any micro-organisms or foreign particles that succeed in penetration. The cell-mediated component consists of many white blood cells (such as [[monocytes]], [[neutrophils]], [[macrophages]], [[lymphocytes]], [[basophils]], [[mast cells]], [[natural killer cells]], and [[eosinophils]]) that target foreign bodies by a variety of different mechanisms. In the case of malaria both systems would be targeted to attempt to increase the potential response generated, thus ensuring the maximum chance of preventing disease. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n*\"Anti-toxic immunity\" addresses the symptoms; it refers to the suppression of the immune response associated with the production of factors that either induce symptoms or reduce the effect that any toxic by-products (of micro-organism presence) have on the development of disease. For example, it has been shown that [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha]] has a central role in generating the symptoms experienced in severe ''P. falciparum'' malaria. Thus a therapeutic vaccine could target the production of TNF-a, preventing respiratory distress and cerebral symptoms. This approach has serious limitations as it would not reduce the parasitic load; rather it only reduces the associated pathology.  As a result, there are substantial difficulties in evaluating efficacy in human trials.\n\nTaking this information into consideration an ideal vaccine candidate would attempt to generate a more substantial cell-mediated and antibody response on parasite presentation. This would have the benefit of increasing the rate of parasite clearance, thus reducing the experienced symptoms and providing a level  of consistent future immunity against the parasite.\n\n===Potential targets===\n{{see also|PFSPZ vaccine}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Potential vaccine targets in the [[Plasmodium#Life cycle|malaria lifecycle]] (Doolan and Hoffman)\n|-\n!

Anti-host [[erythrocyte]], antibodies blocking fertilisation, antibodies blocking egress from the mosquito midgut. \n|}\n\nBy their very nature, protozoa are more complex organisms than bacteria and viruses, with more complicated structures and life cycles. This presents problems in vaccine development but also increases the number of potential targets for a vaccine. These have been summarised into the life cycle stage and the antibodies that could potentially elicit an immune response.\n\nThe epidemiology of malaria varies enormously across the globe, and has led to the belief that it may be necessary to adopt very different vaccine development strategies to target the different populations. A Type 1 vaccine is suggested for those exposed mostly to ''P. falciparum'' malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, with the primary objective to reduce the number of severe malaria cases and deaths in infants and children exposed to high transmission rates. The Type 2 vaccine could be thought of as a 'travellers' vaccine', aiming to prevent all cases of clinical symptoms in individuals with no previous exposure. This is another major public health problem, with malaria presenting as one of the most substantial threats to travellers' health. Problems with the current available pharmaceutical therapies include costs, availability, adverse effects and contraindications, inconvenience and compliance, many of which would be reduced or eliminated entirely if an effective (greater than 85\u201390%) vaccine was developed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe life cycle of the malaria parasite is particularly complex, presenting initial developmental problems. Despite the huge number of vaccines available at the current time, there are none that target parasitic infections. The distinct developmental stages involved in the life cycle present numerous opportunities for targeting antigens, thus potentially eliciting an immune response.  Theoretically, each developmental stage could have a vaccine developed specifically to target the parasite. Moreover, any vaccine produced would ideally have the ability to be of therapeutic value as well as preventing further transmission and is likely to consist of a combination of antigens from different phases of the parasite's development.  More than 30 of these antigens are currently being researched by teams all over the world in the hope of identifying a combination that can elicit immunity in the inoculated individual. Some of the approaches involve surface expression of the antigen, inhibitory effects of specific antibodies on the life cycle and the protective effects through immunization or passive transfer of antibodies between an immune and a non-immune host. The majority of research into malarial vaccines has focused on the ''Plasmodium falciparum'' strain due to the high mortality caused by the parasite and the ease of a carrying out in vitro/in vivo studies. The earliest vaccines attempted to use the parasitic [[circumsporozoite]] (CS) protein. This is the most dominant surface antigen of the initial pre-erythrocytic phase. However, problems were encountered due to low efficacy, [[reactogenicity]] and low [[immunogenicity]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n*The initial stage in the life cycle, following inoculation, is a relatively short \"pre-erythrocytic\" or \"hepatic\" phase. A vaccine at this stage must have the ability to protect against sporozoites invading and possibly inhibiting the development of parasites in the hepatocytes (through inducing [[cytotoxic]] [[T-lymphocytes]] that can destroy the infected [[liver cells]]). However, if any sporozoites evaded the immune system they would then have the potential to be symptomatic and cause the clinical disease.\n*The second phase of the life cycle is the \"erythrocytic\" or blood phase. A vaccine here could prevent [[merozoite]] multiplication or the invasion of [[red blood cells]]. This approach is complicated by the lack of [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC molecule]] expression on the surface of erythrocytes. Instead, malarial antigens are expressed, and it is this towards which the antibodies could potentially be directed. Another approach would be to attempt to block the process of erythrocyte adherence to blood vessel walls. It is thought that this process is accountable for much of the clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection; therefore a vaccine given during this stage would be therapeutic and hence administered during clinical episodes to prevent further deterioration. \n*The last phase of the life cycle that has the potential to be targeted by a vaccine is the \"sexual stage\". This would not give any protective benefits to the individual inoculated but would prevent further transmission of the parasite by preventing the [[gametocytes]] from producing multiple sporozoites in the gut wall of the mosquito. It therefore would be used as part of a policy directed at eliminating the parasite from areas of low prevalence or to prevent the development and spread of vaccine-resistant parasites. This type of transmission-blocking vaccine is potentially very important. The evolution of resistance in the malaria parasite occurs very quickly, potentially making any vaccine redundant within a few generations. This approach to the prevention of spread is therefore essential.\n*Another approach is to target the [[protein kinases]], which are present during the entire lifecycle of the malaria parasite. Research is underway on this, yet production of an actual vaccine targeting these protein kinases may still take a long time.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Zhang VM, Chavchich M, Waters NC |title=Targeting protein kinases in the malaria parasite: update of an antimalarial drug target |journal=Curr Top Med Chem |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=456\u201372 |date=March 2012 |pmid=22242850 |doi=10.2174/156802612799362922 |url=http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CTMC/2012/00000012/00000005/0006R.SGM |access-date=23 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530081801/http://www.benthamdirect.org/pages/content.php?CTMC%2F2012%2F00000012%2F00000005%2F0006R.SGM |archive-date=30 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*Report of a new candidate of vaccine capable to neutralize all tested strains of ''Plasmodium falciparum'', the most deadly form of the parasite causing malaria, was published in [[Nature Communications]] by a team of scientists from the [[University of Oxford]].<ref name=vaccine>{{cite journal|last1=Douglas|first1=Alexander|last2=et|first2=al|title=The blood-stage malaria antigen PfRH5 is susceptible to vaccine-inducible cross-strain neutralizing antibody|journal=Nature Communications|volume=2|pages=601|year=2011|doi=10.1038/ncomms1615|issue=12|pmid=22186897|pmc=3504505|bibcode=2011NatCo...2E.601D}}</ref>  The viral vectored vaccine, targeting a full-length ''P. falciparum'' reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (PfRH5) was found to induce an antibody response in an animal model.

It is able to stay dormant in the [[liver]] and reemerge years later to elicit new infections.  Two key proteins involved in the invasion of the red blood cells (RBC) by ''P. vivax'' are potential targets for drug or vaccine development.  When the Duffy binding protein (DBP) of ''P. vivax'' binds the Duffy antigen (DARC) on the surface of RBC, process for the parasite to enter the RBC is initiated.  Structures of the core region of DARC and the receptor binding pocket of DBP have been mapped by scientists at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]].  The researchers found that the binding is a two-step process which involves two copies of the parasite protein acting together like a pair of tongs which 'clamp'' two copies of DARC.    Antibodies that interfere with the binding, by either targeting the key region of the DARC or the DBP will prevent the infection.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercebiotechresearch.com/story/protein-discovery-could-aid-malaria-vaccine-design/2014-01-13|title=Scientists capture key protein structures that could aid malaria vaccine design|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotechresearch.com|date=13 January 2014|accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Batchelor|first1=J.|last2=Malpede|first2=B.|last3=Omattage|first3=N.|last4=DeKoster|first4=G.|last5=Henzler-Wildman|first5=K.|last6=Tolia|first6=N.|title=Red Blood Cell Invasion by ''Plasmodium vivax'': Structural Basis for DBP Engagement of DARC|journal=[[PLOS Pathogens]]|volume=10|issue=1|page= e1003869|year=2014|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003869|pmid=24415938|pmc=3887093}}</ref>\n*Antibodies against the [[Schizont]] Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1) were found to disable the parasite ability to rupture from the infected red blood cells (RBCs) thus prevent it from continuing with its life cycle.

A vaccine targeting several antigens may require delivery to different areas and by different means in order to elicit an effective response. Some [[adjuvants]] can direct the vaccine to the specifically targeted cell type\u2014e.g. the use of [[Hepatitis B virus]] in the [[RTS,S]] vaccine to target infected hepatocytes\u2014but in other cases, particularly when using combined antigenic vaccines, this approach is very complex. Some methods that have been attempted include the use of two vaccines, one directed at generating a blood response and the other a liver-stage response. These two vaccines could then be injected into two different sites, thus enabling the use of a more specific and potentially efficacious delivery system.\n\nTo increase, accelerate or modify the development of an immune response to a vaccine candidate it is often necessary to combine the antigenic substance to be delivered with an adjuvant or specialised delivery system. These terms are often used interchangeably in relation to vaccine development; however in most cases a distinction can be made. An adjuvant is typically thought of as a substance used in combination with the antigen to produce a more substantial and robust immune response than that elicited by the antigen alone. This is achieved through three mechanisms: by affecting the antigen delivery and presentation, by inducing the production of immunomodulatory cytokines, and by affecting the [[antigen presenting cells]] (APC). Adjuvants can consist of many different materials, from cell microparticles to other particulated delivery systems (e.g. [[liposome]]s).\n\nAdjuvants are crucial in affecting the specificity and isotype of the necessary antibodies. They are thought to be able to potentiate the link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Due to the diverse nature of substances that can potentially have this effect on the immune system, it is difficult to classify adjuvants into specific groups. In most circumstances they consist of easily identifiable components of micro-organisms that are recognised by the innate immune system cells. The role of delivery systems is primarily to direct the chosen adjuvant and antigen into target cells to attempt to increase the efficacy of the vaccine further, therefore acting synergistically with the adjuvant.\n\nThere is increasing concern that the use of very potent adjuvants could precipitate autoimmune responses, making it imperative that the vaccine is focused on the target cells only. Specific delivery systems can reduce this risk by limiting the potential toxicity and systemic distribution of newly developed adjuvants.\n\nStudies into the efficacy of malaria vaccines developed to date{{when|date=November 2019}} have illustrated that the presence of an adjuvant is key in determining any protection gained against malaria. A large number of natural and synthetic adjuvants have been identified throughout the history of vaccine development. Options identified thus far for use combined with a malaria vaccine include mycobacterial cell walls, liposomes, monophosphoryl lipid A and squalene.\n\n==Agents under development==\nA completely effective vaccine is not yet available for malaria, although several vaccines are under development. SPf66 a synthetic peptide based vaccine developed by [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo]] team in [[Colombia]] was tested extensively in endemic areas in the 1990s, but clinical trials showed it to be insufficiently effective, 28% efficacy in South America and minimal or no efficacy in Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=16625647 |pmc=6532709 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (SPf66) |issue=2 |pages=CD005966 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005966 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}</ref> Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have also been insufficient on their own.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17054281 |pmc=6532641 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (blood-stage) |issue=4 |pages=CD006199 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006199 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}</ref> Several potential vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage are being developed, with [[RTS,S]] showing the most promising results so far.,<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=17054280 |pmc=6532586 |year=2006 |vauthors=Graves P, Gelband H |title=Vaccines for preventing malaria (pre-erythrocytic) |issue=4 |pages=CD006198 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006198 |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev}}</ref><ref name=\"doi10.1056/NEJMoa1208394\">{{cite journal | author1= RTS&#x2c;S Clinical Trials Partnership | last2= Agnandji | first2= S.

It is also based on the circumsporozoite protein, but additionally has the recombinant (Asn-Ala-Pro15Asn-Val-Asp-Pro)2-Leu-Arg([[R32LR]]) protein covalently bound to a purified ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' toxin (A9). However at an early stage a complete lack of protective immunity was demonstrated in those inoculated. The study group used in [[Kenya]] had an 82% incidence of [[parasitaemia]] whilst the control group only had an 89% incidence. The vaccine intended to cause an increased T-lymphocyte response in those exposed, this was also not observed. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n* The [[NYVAC-Pf7]] multi-stage vaccine attempted to use different technology, incorporating seven ''P.falciparum'' antigenic genes. These came from a variety of stages during the life cycle. CSP and sporozoite surface protein 2 (called [[PfSSP2]]) were derived from the sporozoite phase. The liver stage antigen 1 (LSA1), three from the erythrocytic stage (merozoite surface protein 1, serine repeat antigen and AMA-1) and one sexual stage antigen (the 25-kDa Pfs25) were included. This was first investigated using [[Rhesus monkeys]] and produced encouraging results: 4 out of the 7 antigens produced specific antibody responses (CSP, PfSSP2, [[Merozoite surface protein|MSP1]] and PFs25). Later trials in humans, despite demonstrating cellular immune responses in over 90% of the subjects, had very poor antibody responses. Despite this following administration of the vaccine some candidates had complete protection when challenged with ''P.falciparum''. This result has warranted ongoing trials. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n* In 1995 a field trial involving [NANP]19-5.1 proved to be very successful. Out of 194 children vaccinated none developed symptomatic malaria in the 12-week follow up period and only 8 failed to have higher levels of antibody present. The vaccine consists of the [[schizont export protein]] (5.1) and 19 repeats of the sporozoite surface protein [NANP]. Limitations of the technology exist as it contains only 20% [[peptide]] and has low levels of immunogenicity. It also does not contain any immunodominant T-cell [[epitopes]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ratanji|first=Kirsty D.|last2=Derrick|first2=Jeremy P.|last3=Dearman|first3=Rebecca J.|last4=Kimber|first4=Ian|date=April 2014|title=Immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins: Influence of aggregation|journal=Journal of Immunotoxicology|volume=11|issue=2|pages=99\u2013109|doi=10.3109/1547691X.2013.821564|issn=1547-691X|pmc=4002659|pmid=23919460}}</ref>\n\n=== Nanoparticle enhancement of RTS,S ===\nIn 2015, researchers used a repetitive antigen display technology to engineer a nanoparticle that displayed malaria specific B cell and T cell epitopes.

The leading edge of their feathers have serrations that help to disrupt the turbulence generated by wing flapping, then the softer feathers help deaden the sound, and finally the trailing fringe of the feathers that works to finish cutting the sounds made by flight. The structure of the great horned owl wing also allows it to fly at a very low speeds for the size of the species, as slow as 2 miles per hour when they are gliding on breezes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.audubon.org/news/the-silent-flight-owls-explained|title=The Silent Flight of Owls, Explained|date=2017-07-28|website=Audubon|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n[[File:Talons, Great Horned Owl.jpg|thumb|Great horned owl (Canada)]]\nThe legs, feet, and talons are large and powerful.

The different height holes, while still close together, are differentiated enough that the owl is able to use the timing and direction of the sound waves hitting each hole that they can use it to precisely locate prey even if located under cover like snow. The disc like shape of their faces also helps to direct the sounds they hear toward their ears.

All mated great horned owls are permanent residents of their territories, but unmated and younger birds move freely in search of company and a territory, and leave regions with little food in winter.<ref name=Konig/>\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Great-horned-owl-in-flight.jpg|thumb|left|Composite photo of great horned owl flight phases]]\n[[File:Bubo virginianus (Grand-duc d'Am\u00e9rique).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Great horned owls are typically sluggish and passive but aware during daytime.]]\nIn most aspects of their behavior, great horned owls are typical of owls and most birds of prey. From experimentally raising young owls in captivity, Paul L. Errington felt that they were a bird of \"essentially low intelligence\" who could only hunt when partially wild and instinctually driven by hunger to hunt whatever they first encounter. He showed captive birds that were provided strips of meat from hatching, rather than having to hunt or to simulate hunting to obtain food, had no capacity to hunt.<ref name= Errington>Errington, P.L. 1932. ''Studies on the Behavior of the Great Horned Owl''.  Wilson Bulletin, 12: 212-220.</ref> On the contrary, William J. Baerg compared his captive raised behaviorally great horned owls to [[parrot]]s, which are famously intelligent birds, although not as often playful \"it knows its keeper and usually accepts whatever he wishes to do with a good deal of tolerance\".<ref name= Baerg>Baerg, W. J. (1926). ''Trying to Tame a Great Horned Owl''. The Auk, 214-217.</ref> Arthur C. Bent also noted the variability in temperaments of great horned owls to their handlers, some generally pleasant, though most are eventually aggressive.<ref name= Bent/> Most captive specimens, once mature, seem to resent attempts at contact and are often given to attacking their keepers. They will only follow cues when conditioned from an early age but rarely with the same level of success seen in some diurnal birds of prey trained for [[falconry]] or entertainment, although this does not necessarily correlate with intelligence as posited by Errington.<ref name= Errington/><ref name= Baerg/> Carl D. Marti also disagrees with Errington's assessments, noting that their prey selection is not as \"completely random as Errington suggested\"; while \"Great Horned Owls appeared to select their mammalian prey in general relation to the prey populations...[[Cottontail rabbit|Cottontail]]s, appeared to be selected as prey out of relation to their population status.\"<ref name= Marti/>\n\nLike most owls, the great horned owl makes great use of secrecy and stealth. Due to its natural-colored plumage, it is well camouflaged both while active at night and while roosting during the day. During the daytime it roosts usually in large trees (including snags & large hollows but usually thick branches) but may occasionally be in crevices or small caves in rocks or in dense shrubbery. [[Pine]] and other [[Pinophyta|coniferous trees]] may be preferred where available since they are particularly dense and provide cover throughout the year. Typically, males have a favorite roosting site not far from the nest, sometimes used over successive years.<ref name= Austing/> While roosting, great horned owls may rest in the \"tall-thin\" position, where they sit as erect and hold themselves as slim as is possible. The kind of posture is well known as a further method of camouflage for other owls, like long-eared owls or great grey owls, especially if humans or other potential mammalian carnivores approach them. The Eurasian eagle owl rarely, if ever, assumes the tall-thin position.<ref name= Hume>Hume, R. (1991). ''Owls of the world''. Running Press, Philadelphia, PA. 1991.</ref> Outside of the nesting season, great horned owls may roost wherever their foraging path ends at dawn.<ref name= Rohner/> Generally great horned owls are active at night, although in some areas may be active in the late afternoon or early morning. At dusk, the owl utters a few calls before flying to a more open sing-post, i.e. large bare branch or large rocks to deliver song. Normally several perches are used to mark occupied territory or to attract a female.<ref name= Konig/> Despite its camouflage and cryptic locations, this species can still sometimes be spotted on its daytime roosts, especially by [[American crow]]s (''Corvus brachyrhynchos''). Since owls are, next to [[red-tailed hawk]]s, perhaps the main predator of crows and their young, crows sometimes congregate from considerable distances to mob owls and caw angrily at them for hours on end. When the owls try to fly off to avoid this harassment, they are often followed by the corvids.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wesleytheowl.blogspot.ca/2010/04/crows-and-ravens-corvids-and-their-odd.html | title=Stacey O'Brien : Wesley the Owl: Crows and Ravens: The Corvids and their odd behavior| date=2010-04-13}}</ref>\n\n===Territoriality and movements===\nTypically, great horned owls are highly sedentary, often capable of utilizing a single territory throughout their mature lives.<ref>Baumgartner, F. M. 1939. ''Territory and population in the Great Horned Owl''. Auk 56:274-282.</ref> Although some species such as snowy owls, [[northern saw-whet owl]]s, [[long-eared owl|long-eared]] and short-eared owls are true migrants, most North American owls are not migratory and will generally show fidelity to a single territory year around.<ref name= Voous/> In great horned owls, mated pairs occupy territories year-round and long-term. Territories are established and maintained through hooting, with highest activity before egg-laying and second peak in autumn when juveniles disperse, and can range from an average of {{convert|16 |km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Yukon]] to an average of {{convert|2.1 |km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Wyoming]].<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Rohner/>\n\nMost territorial defense is performed by males, but females frequently assist their partners in hooting contests with neighbors or intruders, even during incubation.<ref name= Houston/> On occasion, although territory borders may be successfully maintained via vocalizations alone without even seeing the competing owl, such confrontations may turn physical, with various levels of threats distinguished. The highest threat level involves the spreading of wings, bill-clapping, hissing, higher-pitched screams of longer duration, with general body poised to strike with its feet at intruder. If the intruder continues to press the confrontation, the defending owl will \"hop\" forward and strike it with feet, attempting to grasp and rake with claws.<ref name= Houston/>\n\nTerritoriality appears to place a limit on the number of breeding pairs in a given area. Individuals prevented from establishing a territory live a silent existence as \"floaters\". Radio-telemetry revealed that such floaters concentrate along boundaries of established territories. At [[Kluane]]  in [[Yukon]], incursions into neighboring territories were observed only twice\u2014by females when neighboring female had died or emigrated, suggesting that territorial defense may be sex specific. At least four dead great horned owls in Kluane were apparently killed by others of their own species in territorial conflicts.<ref name= Rohner/> Owls killed by other horned owls are sometimes cannibalized, although the origin of the killing may have been territorial aggression.<ref>Millard, J.

During hunting forays, they often fly about {{convert|50|to|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} from perch to perch, stopping to survey for food at each, until they sense a prey item below. From such vantage points, owls dive down to the ground, often with wings folded, to ambush their prey.<ref name=Konig/> Effective maximum hunting distance of an owl from an elevated perch is {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name= Petersen/> Due to their short but broad wings, great horned owls are ideally suited for low speed and maneuverability.<ref name= Johnson/> Despite reports that they do not hunt on the wing,<ref name= Rudolph>Rudolph, S. G. (1978). ''Predation Ecology of Coexistng Great Horned and Barn Owls''. The Wilson Bulletin, 134-137.</ref> they also sometimes hunt by flying low over openings on the ground, scanning below for prey activity.<ref name= Konig/> Great horned owls can fly at speeds of more than {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in level flight.<ref name= Voous/> Hunting flights are slow, often quartering low above the ground where prey is likely to occur in open country or open woodland. Brief hovering flight (for about 6\u201318 seconds) have been described, especially in windy areas.<ref>Smith, D. G. and B. A. Smith. 1972. ''Hunting methods and success of newly-fledged Great Horned Owls''. Bird-Banding 43:142.</ref> On occasion owls may actually walk on the ground in pursuit of small prey or, rarely, inside a chicken coop to prey on the fowl within.<ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/> [[Rodent]]s and [[invertebrate]]s may be caught on foot around the base of bushes, through grassy areas, and near culverts and other human structures in range and farm habitat.<ref name= Houston/> The great horned owl is generally a poor walker on the ground; it walks like a [[starling]], with a pronounced side-to-side gait. They have been known to wade into shallow water for aquatic prey, although this has been only rarely reported.<ref name= Houston/> Owls can snatch [[bird]]s and some arboreal mammals directly from tree branches in a glide as well. The stiff feathering of their wings allows owls to produce minimal sound in flight while hunting.<ref name=Cornell/><ref name=Konig/><ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/>\n\nAlmost all prey are killed by crushing with the owl's feet or by incidentally stabbing of the talons, though some may be bitten about the face as well. Prey is swallowed whole when possible. When prey is swallowed whole, owls regurgitate [[Pellet (ornithology)|pellets]] of bone and other non-digestible bits about 6 to 10 hours later, usually in the same location where the prey was consumed.<ref name=Konig/> Great horned owl pellets are dark gray or brown in color and very large, {{convert|7.6|to|10.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and have been known to contain skulls up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width inside them.<ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/> However, not all prey can be swallowed at once, and owls will also fly with prey to a perch and tear off pieces with their bill. Most dietary studies focus on pellets found under perches and around nests, since they provide a more complete picture of the diversity of prey consumed, but prey remains outside of pellets may provide clues to prey excluded from the pellets and a combination of both is recommended.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Hamerstrom/><ref name= Orians>Orians, G., & Kuhlman, F. (1956). ''Red-tailed hawk and horned owl populations in Wisconsin''. Condor, 371-385.</ref> Many large prey items are dismembered. Great horned owls may behead large prey before taking it to its nest or eating perch. The legs may also be removed, as may (in some bird prey) the wings. The great horned owl will also crush the bones of its prey to make it more compact for carrying.<ref>Einarsen, A. S. 1956. ''Determination of some predator species by food signs''. Oregon State Monographs, 10: 34.</ref> On occasion, the owls may return to the kill site to continue eating if the prey is too heavy to fly with after dismemberment.<ref name= Bent/> Many owls will accrue a cache of prey, especially those who are nesting. Caches must be at a safe location, usually the crotch of a tall tree. In northern regions, where large prey is prevalent, an owl may let uneaten food freeze and then thaw it out later using its own body heat.<ref name= Mikkola/>  Hunting success seems to require fairly open understory, and experimental testing of microhabitat proved that open areas provided more hunting success on five species of rodent, with cloudy nights and denser bush foliage both decreasing success.<ref>Longland, W.

Weighing a mere {{convert|14|to|31.5|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|to|58|g|oz|abbr=on}} on average, the nine species of New World mice in ''Peromyscus'' and eight species voles in ''Microtus'' recorded in the diet would appear to be overly small to be as important as they are to a predatory bird of this size. The prominence of these genera is undoubtedly due to the abundance of both genera in the wooded edge habitats frequented by great horned owls. It is estimated that a family of owls with two offspring would need to take about a half dozen (voles) to a dozen (mice) of these rodents every night to satisfy their dietary requirements but apparently the accessibility and abundance of these foods is irresistible as their numeric dominance is indisputable.<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> By winter in areas that hold heavy snow, ''[[Peromyscus]]'' mice often come to outnumber the voles in the diet since the mice tend to travel over the surface of the snow while the voles make tunnels underneath the snow.<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Voous/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> In fact, a healthy family of great horned owls can decimate a colony of field rats, thus potentially performing a key role in controlling a highly destructive pest.<ref name= Hamerstrom/>  Great horned owls living in the timbered fringes of garbage or refuse dumps may subsist mostly on rats.<ref name= Mikkola/>\n\nIn the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], California, the [[Southwestern United States]] and northern [[Mexico]], the diversity of this species' diet rises, in sync with the diversity of rodents.

The predatory effect of this species on other raptorial birds, which is often considerable, is explored in the following section. In [[Brazil]], it was found in a small study that birds overall outnumbered mammals in pellets, although most were not determined to species and the ones that were shown a tremendously diverse assemblage of birds with no obvious dietary preference.<ref name= Tomazzoni/> Although not usually numerically significant, 86 species of [[passerine]] have been taken by great horned owls. Members from most North American families are known as prey, although among smaller types such as [[chickadee]]s, [[New World warbler|warbler]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinals]], [[wren]]s and most [[tyrant flycatcher]]s only a few species from each have been recorded.

However, [[lizard]]s are largely unavailable as prey due to their typically diurnal periods of activity.<ref name= Houston/> However, some snakes are partially or largely nocturnal, and more than a dozen species are hunted in North America. Snakes hunted range from small, innocuous [[garter snake]]s (''Thamnophis'' ssp.) and [[night snake]]s (''Hypsiglena torquata'') to venomous species like [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouth]]s (''Agkistrodon piscivorus'') and [[Crotalus viridis|prairie rattlesnake]]s (''Crotalus virdis'') and formidable, large species like [[Lampropeltis getula|common king snake]]s (''Lampropeltis getula'') and [[Western rat snake|black rat snake]]s (''Pantherophis obsoletus''), which in mature specimens can rival the owl in mass and sheer predatory power.<ref name= Bent/> The capture of the hatchlings of very large reptiles such as [[loggerhead turtle]]s (''Caretta caretta'') and [[American alligator]]s (''Alligator mississippiensis'') by great horned owls has been reported, in both cases likely when the baby reptiles are attempting to make their way to the security of water.<ref name= Bent/><ref>Toland, B. (1991). ''Great horned owl predation of Atlantic loggerhead turtle hatchlings''.

The occasionally invertebrate prey taken largely consists of common, large insects such as various [[beetle]]s, [[crickets]], [[grasshopper]]s, [[Nepomorpha|water bug]]s and [[Tettigoniidae|katydid]]s, some of which the great horned owl has even reportedly caught via \"hawking\", i.e. swooping at on the wing.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Houston/><ref>Duncan, J.R. & Lane, P.A. 1998.

Almost every study comparing the diets of North American owls illustrates the considerable overlap in the dietary selection of these species, as all species, besides the primarily insectivorous varieties, rely on many of the same small rodent species for most of their diet, extending from the small northern saw-whet owl and [[eastern screech owl]] to the great horned and great grey owls.<ref name= Marti/><ref name= Cromrich/>\n\nIn a long-term study of a block of [[Michigan]], all nine species of accipitrid, falcon and owl that stayed to breed there were found to be primarily dependent on the same two rodent genera, the [[meadow vole]] and the two common ''[[Peromyscus]]'' species.<ref name= Craighead/> In the [[Great Basin]], the owls share black-tailed jackrabbit and [[desert cottontail]] as the primary prey with golden eagles, red-tailed hawks and [[ferruginous hawk]]s (''Buteo regalis''); all four species had diets with more than 90% of the biomass is made up of those lagomorphs. Of these, the great horned owl and golden eagle were able to nest most closely to one another because they had the most strongly dissimilar periods of activity.<ref name= Smith/><ref name= Smith3/> In California, when compared to the local red-tailed hawks and [[Crotalus atrox|western diamondback rattlesnake]]s (''Crotalus atrox''), the diets were most similar in that by number about 15-20% of all three species' diets depended on [[Cottontail rabbit|cottontail]]s, but the largest portion was made up of [[ground squirrel]]s in the hawk and the rattlesnake and desert woodrats and other assorted [[rodent]]s in the great horned owl.<ref name= Fitch/> In the [[Taiga|boreal forests]], the great horned owl's prolificacy as a [[snowshoe hare]] hunter places it second only to the [[Canada lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis'') among all predators. Although locally dependent on the hares as their main food, [[northern goshawk]]s (''Accipiter gentilis''), red-tailed hawks and golden eagles apparently do not have as large of an impact on the hares, nor do mammalian carnivore generalists that also kill many hares, like the [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[bobcat]], [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo''), [[coyote]] and larger varieties (i.e. [[Gray wolf|wolves]] (''Canis lupus''), [[cougar]]s (''Puma concolor'') and [[bear]]s (''Ursus'' ssp.)).<ref name= Rohner/><ref name= Houston2/><ref name= Mcinvaille/><ref>WLM. (1918). ''Bird Enemies of the Varying Hare''. The Auk, 372-373.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between great horned owls and other raptorial birds in its range is usually decidedly one-sided. While certain species, such as the red-tailed hawk and [[northern goshawk]], might be seen as potential competition for the owls, most others seem to be regarded merely as prey by great horned owls. The great horned owl is both the most prolific and diverse predator in America of other birds of prey, with other accomplished raptor-hunters such as the goshawk and the golden eagle being more restricted in range, habitat and number in North America and thus having a more minor impact. All studies have found raptors are a small portion of this owl's diet but predation can be seriously detrimental for such prey, as raptors tend to be territorial and sparsely distributed as a rule and thus can be effectively decimated by a small number of losses.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Cromrich/> In the [[gray hawk]] (''Buteo plagiatus''), for example, in a study of one breeding block of [[Arizona]], the owls were observed to visit nests nightly until all the nestlings were gone.<ref>Bibles, Brent D., Richard L. Glinski and R. Roy Johnson. 2002. ''Gray Hawk (Buteo plagiatus)'', The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</ref>\n\nRaptorial birds in general tend to have large, conspicuous nests which may make them easier for a hunting owl to locate. The great horned owl gains an advantage by nesting earlier than any other raptor in its range (indeed any bird), as it is able to exploit the other raptors as food while in a more vulnerable state as their own nestlings have become well developed.<ref name= Craighead/> On average, great horned owls begin nesting about three weeks before red-tailed hawks begin to build nests, although some raptors may locally breed as much as two months after the owls.<ref name= Houston/><ref name= Dunstan>Dunstan, T. C., & Harrell, B. E. (1973). ''Spatio-temporal relationships between breeding red-tailed hawks and great horned owls in South Dakota''. Raptor Research, 7(2), 49\u201354.</ref>\n\nMore so than diurnal varieties of raptor, fairly significant numbers of owls are hunted, as all species are to some extent nocturnal and thus their corresponding activity can attract the horned owl's unwanted attention. The extent of predation on other owls depends on the habitat preferences of the other species. Eastern and western screech owls may be most vulnerable since they prefer similar wooded edge habitat. In a block of [[Wisconsin]], great horned owls were responsible for the failure of 78% of eastern screech owl's nests.<ref name= Craighead/> Long-eared owls and, to a lesser extent, barn owls tend to hunt in open, sparsely treed habitats more so than great horned owls, but since they may return to wooded spots for nesting purposes, they may be more vulnerable there. The long-eared owl and barn owls are often compared to the great horned owl as these medium-sized species often occur in abutting habitats and often hunt primarily the same vole and mice species, although the alternate prey of the great horned tends to be much larger, including the smaller owls themselves.<ref name= Earhart/><ref name= Rudolph/><ref>Barrows, C.

In the boreal forests, both the northern hawk owl and great grey owl appear to be in greater danger of great horned owl predation in years where the snowshoe hare have low populations.<ref name= Duncan>Duncan, J.

Anecdotally, both snowy and great horned owls have rarely been reported to dominate or even kill one another depending on the size and disposition of the individual owls, although the snowy's preference for more open areas again acts as something of a buffer. The snowy may be the one North American owl too formidable for the great horned owl to consider as prey.<ref name= Potapov/>\n\nWhereas owls of any age are freely attacked by great horned owls whether nesting or not, when it comes to diurnal raptors, great horned owls are mainly a danger around the nest. They often hunt diurnal raptors when they come across their often relatively conspicuous active platform nests during hunting forays in spring and summer, taking numbers of both nestlings and brooding adults.<ref name= Houston/> Again, like owls, diurnal raptors are attacked depending on the relative similarity of their habitat preferences to the owl. [[Cooper's hawk]]s (''Accipiter cooperii'') and red-tailed hawks tend to be most vulnerable, as they prefer the same wooded edges frequented by great horned owls. Other diurnal raptors may be attracted to more enclosed wooded areas, such as [[sharp-shinned hawk]]s (''Accipiter striatus'') or [[zone-tailed hawk]]s (''Buteo albonotatus''), or more open plain and meadow areas, such as [[Northern harrier]]s (''Circus hudsonius'') and ferruginous hawks, but this is almost never a total insurance against predation as all of these are recorded prey.<ref name= Hamerstrom/><ref>Stoleson, S.

In most of North America, courtship is from October to December and mates are chosen by December to January.<ref name=Konig/> This species was once thought to be strictly monogamous, but recent analysis indicates one male may mate with two females simultaneously, as was discovered for the first time in 2018 in Reno, Nevada.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/animals-owls-birds-parenting-polygamy/#close | title=These Owl Chicks Have Two Moms and a Dad\u2014a First| date=2018-05-02}}</ref> During courtship in late fall or early winter, the male attracts the attention of his mate by hooting emphatically while leaning over (with the tail folded or cocked) and puffing up his white throat to look like a ball.<ref name= Konig/> The white throat may serve as a visual stimuli in the low light conditions typical of when this owl courts.<ref name= Rohner/> He often flies up and down on a perch, while approaching the potential mate. Eventually, he comes to approach the female and tries to rub his bill against hers while repeatedly bowing. If receptive, the female hoots back when the pair meet but is more subdued in both her hoot and display. The male may convince the female by bringing her freshly caught prey, which they will share.<ref name=Bent/><ref name= Konig/> While males often hoot emphatically for about a month or six weeks towards the end of the year, the period where females also hoot is usually only a week to ten days.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Pairs typically breed together year after year and may mate for life, although they associate with each other more loosely when their young become mostly independent.<ref name= Konig/> Pairs rekindling their reproductive relationship in the winter may perform a milder courtship to strengthen pair bonds before producing young.<ref name= Baumgartner/>\n\nMales select nesting sites and bring the females' attention to them by flying to them and then stomping on them.<ref name=Konig/> Nests with open access, considering this birds large size, as opposed to enclosed with surrounding branches, are preferred. Like all owls, great horned owls do not build their own nest. Great horned owls tend to examine an area for an abandoned nest, generally from larger birds like hawks, and take over the nest for raising their own young.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morse|first=Douglass H.|date=April 1971|title=Great Horned Owls and Nesting Seabirds|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4083889|journal=The Auk|volume=88|issue=2|pages=426\u2013427|doi=10.2307/4083889|issn=0004-8038}}</ref> They nest in a wider variety of nest sites than any other North American bird.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Many nests are in cavernous hollows of dead trees or their branches, especially in southern states in large trees along the edge of old-growth lots.<ref name= Baumgartner/> In mountainous or hilly areas, especially in canyons of the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] and [[Rocky Mountains]], cliff ledges, small caves, and other sheltered depressions may be used.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Owls living in prairie country, in the absence of other animals' nests, riparian trees or non-native trees or the bare ground of tree hollows or man-made structures, will use boulders, buttes, railroad cuts, low bushes and even the bare ground as nest sites.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Ground nests have also been recorded in the midst of tall grasses in [[Florida]] and in the midsts of brushy spots on the desert ground.<ref name= Voous/> Even the burrow entrances of [[American badger]] and [[coyote]] dens have reportedly been used as nests, in spite of the inherent risk of sharing space with such potentially dangerous co-inhabitants.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Nesting behavior for the great horned owl appears to be more closely related to prey availability than it does to seasonal conditions.

Gradually the soft juvenal downy plumage comes through the down, being typically a cinnamon-buff color, but with variable hues predicting the eventual color of the mature owls. The extent of down gradually diminishes, developing mature-looking plumage by late summer, although many first year birds still have scattered bits of down into autumn. By late autumn, first-year birds look similar to adults but with a slightly warmer, reddish tinge, less well developed ear tufts and a smaller white throat patch.<ref name= Bent/> The nestling owls develop mostly in behavior between two weeks and two months of age, in which time they adapt the ability to defend themselves, grasp foods and climb. Vocally, the young are able to exert weak chips while still in the egg, developing into a raspy chirp shortly after hatching. The calls of the young increase rapidly in intensity, pitch and character, some juvenile males mimicking their father's hooting in fall but usually they conclude with various odd gurgling notes. The earliest competent hooting by juvenile owls is not until January.<ref name= Houston/><ref>Sumner, Jr., E. L. 1934. ''The behavior of some young raptorial birds''.

Occasionally, nestlings and fledglings will fall from the nest too early to escape or to competently defend themselves and fall prey to [[fox]]es, [[bobcat]], [[coyote]]s, or wild or feral [[cat]]s. Occasionally [[raccoon]]s and [[American black bear]]s consume eggs and nestlings from tree nests and [[Virginia opossum]] may take the rare unguarded egg.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Houston/> [[Crow]]s and [[raven]]s have been reported eating eggs and small nestlings. This can normally only happen when owls are driven from the nest by human activity or are forced to leave the nest to forage by low food resources but on occasion huge flocks of crows have been able to displace owls by harassing them endlessly.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Houston/> In general, great horned owls rarely engage in [[siblicide]], unlike many other raptorial birds. Siblicide occurred at 9 of 2,711 nests in [[Saskatchewan]].<ref name= Houston2/> Most cases where young owls are killed and/or consumed by their siblings or parents appear to occur when the nestling is diseased, impaired or starving or is inadvertently crushed.<ref name= Hamerstrom/> Adults generally have no natural predators, excepting both North American [[eagle]]s and other owls of their own species.<ref name= Bent/>\n\nOccasionally, great horned owls may be killed by their own prey. Although typically able to kill skunks without ill effect, five owls were found blind after getting sprayed in their eyes by skunks.<ref>Garcelon, D. K. 1981. ''Mortality of Great Horned Owls associated with skunks''. Murrelet 62:26.</ref> Cases where the quills of porcupines have killed or functionally disabled them have been observed as well.<ref name= Powell/> Violent fights have been observed between great horned owls after attempts to capture [[Western rat snake|rat snake]]s and [[Coluber constrictor|black racers]].<ref name= Bent/><ref>Peterson, R.

A. (1969). ''Movements, population fluctuations, and mortality among great horned owls''. The Wilson Bulletin, 155-162.</ref> Among 209 banded nestlings in yet another study, 67% were found dead after independence: 56 were found shot, 41 were trapped, 15 hit by cars, 14 found dead on highways and 14 electrocuted by overhead power lines.<ref>Olendorff, R.

The first genuine nature conservationists, while campaigning against the \"Extermination Being Waged Against the Hawks and Owls\", continued to advocate the destruction of great horned owls due to their predatory effect on other wildlife.<ref name= Voous/> Thus, small bounties were offered in trade for owl bodies. Around the turn of the 20th century, the great horned owl was considered endangered in the state of [[Michigan]] because of a large quantity of poachers who were illegally hunting and collecting it.<ref>Barrows, W. B. 1912. \"Michigan bird life\". Michigan Agricultural College, Lansing.</ref> Hunting and trapping of great horned owls may continue on a small scale but is now illegal in most countries.\n\n===Effect on conservation-dependent species===\nOccasionally, these owls may prey on threatened species. Following the devastation to its populations from [[DDT]], the reintroduction of the [[peregrine falcon]] to the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Hudson River]]s was hampered by great horned owls killing both young and adult peregrines at night.<ref>Cade, T. J., P. T. Redig, and H. B. Tordoff. 1989. ''Peregrine Falcon restoration: Expectation vs. reality''. Loon 61:160-162.</ref> Similarly, as mainly recorded in [[New England]], attempts to reintroduce [[osprey]]s, after they were also hit hard by DDT, were affected by heavy owl predation on nestlings, and the owls were also recorded to take a large toll locally on the threatened colonies of [[roseate tern]]s.<ref name= Houston/> Where clear-cutting occurs in old-growth areas of the [[Pacific Northwest]], spotted owls have been badly affected by considerable great horned owl predation.<ref name= Johnson2/><ref>Forsman, E.

The [[Arikara]] of the [[Great Plains]] had mystic owl societies in which initiates were made to adorn facial mask made of the wing and tail feathers of great horned owls. Some Indian nations regarded the great horned owl as a friendly spirit who could aid in matters of love, such as the [[Passamaquoddy]] of [[Maine]] who felt the call of this species was a magical love flute designed to ignite human passions. The [[Hopi]] of the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] also associated this owl with fertility, albeit of a different kind: they believed the calling of the owls into summer predicted hot weather, which produced good peach crops. During the [[winter solstice]], the Hopi performed a ceremony with great horned owl feathers in hopes of summoning the heat of summer. Tribes in [[New Mexico]] were known to use owl wing feathers to produce arrows which could strike their enemies with a minimum of sound. The [[Zuni people|Zuni]] held owl feathers in their mouths hoping to gain some of the silence that owls use in ambushes while striking their own enemies from other tribes. The [[Iroquois]] felt the origin of the great horned owl was due to an unformed owl annoying [[Iroquois mythology|Raweno]], the almighty creator, while Raweno created the [[rabbit]], causing Raweno to make the owl \"covered with mud\" (dark camouflage) and doomed to ceaselessly call \"whoo whoo\", which he used while harassing Raweno, by night because Raweno was active during the day.<ref name=DwightSmith/>\n\n===Provincial bird===\n\nThe great horned owl is the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial bird]] of [[Alberta]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus)|url=http://aep.alberta.ca/fish-wildlife/wild-species/birds/owls/great-horned-owl.aspx|website=Alberta Environment & Parks}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Accordi|first=Iury Almeida|author2=Barcellos, Andre|title=Composi\u00e7\u00e3o da avifauna em oito \u00e1reas \u00famidas da Bacia Hidrogr\u00e1fica do Lago Gua\u00edba, Rio Grande do Sul|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia|date=June 2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=101\u2013115|url=http://www.ararajuba.org.br/sbo/ararajuba/artigos/Volume142/ara142art2.pdf|language=Portuguese, English|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219192057/http://www.ararajuba.org.br/sbo/ararajuba/artigos/Volume142/ara142art2.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-19}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Banks|first=R.C. |author2=Cicero, C. |author3=Dunn, J.L. |author4=Kratter, A.W. |author5=Ouellet, H. |author6=Rasmussen, P.C. |author7=Remsen, J.V.

The white throat may continue as a streak running down the middle of the breast even when the birds are not displaying, which in particularly pale individuals can widen at the belly into a large white area. [[South American great horned owl]]s typically have a smaller white throat patch, often unseen unless actively displaying, and rarely display the white area on the chest.<ref name= Voous/> Individual and regional variations in overall color occur, with birds from the [[subarctic]] showing a washed-out, light-buff color, while those from the [[Pacific Coast]] of North America, Central America, and much of South America can be a dark brownish color overlaid with blackish blotching. The skin of the feet and legs, though almost entirely obscured by feathers, is black. Even tropical great horned owls have feathered legs and feet.

Like other owl species, the great horned owl is capable of \u201csilent flight\u201d, which is the way owls fly while making almost no discernable noise, despite their large size. This is made possible thanks to three main components of the owl's wing structure. The leading edge of their feathers have serrations that help to disrupt the turbulence generated by wing flapping, then the softer feathers help deaden the sound, and finally the trailing fringe of the feathers that works to finish cutting the sounds made by flight. The structure of the great horned owl wing also allows it to fly at a very low speeds for the size of the species, as slow as 2 miles per hour when they are gliding on breezes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.audubon.org/news/the-silent-flight-owls-explained|title=The Silent Flight of Owls, Explained|date=2017-07-28|website=Audubon|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n[[File:Talons, Great Horned Owl.jpg|thumb|Great horned owl (Canada)]]\nThe legs, feet, and talons are large and powerful.

The different height holes, while still close together, are differentiated enough that the owl is able to use the timing and direction of the sound waves hitting each hole that they can use it to precisely locate prey even if located under cover like snow. The disc like shape of their faces also helps to direct the sounds they hear toward their ears. While the true nature/purpose of the ear tufts that are present on the great horned owl are unknown, researchers agree that the tufts do not play any role in the hearing ability of the owl. It is estimated that their hearing is up to ten times that of a human being.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Traynor|first=Robert M.|date=September 1997|title=The missing link for success in hearing aid fittings|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00025572-199709000-00001|journal=The Hearing Journal|volume=50|issue=9|pages=10|doi=10.1097/00025572-199709000-00001|issn=0745-7472}}</ref>\n\nThe great horned owl's eyes, just slightly smaller than the eyes of a [[human being]], are large even for an owl and rank proportionately among the largest eyes of all terrestrial vertebrates.<ref>Hall, M.

From experimentally raising young owls in captivity, Paul L. Errington felt that they were a bird of \"essentially low intelligence\" who could only hunt when partially wild and instinctually driven by hunger to hunt whatever they first encounter. He showed captive birds that were provided strips of meat from hatching, rather than having to hunt or to simulate hunting to obtain food, had no capacity to hunt.<ref name= Errington>Errington, P.L. 1932. ''Studies on the Behavior of the Great Horned Owl''.  Wilson Bulletin, 12: 212-220.</ref> On the contrary, William J. Baerg compared his captive raised behaviorally great horned owls to [[parrot]]s, which are famously intelligent birds, although not as often playful \"it knows its keeper and usually accepts whatever he wishes to do with a good deal of tolerance\".<ref name= Baerg>Baerg, W. J. (1926). ''Trying to Tame a Great Horned Owl''. The Auk, 214-217.</ref> Arthur C. Bent also noted the variability in temperaments of great horned owls to their handlers, some generally pleasant, though most are eventually aggressive.<ref name= Bent/> Most captive specimens, once mature, seem to resent attempts at contact and are often given to attacking their keepers. They will only follow cues when conditioned from an early age but rarely with the same level of success seen in some diurnal birds of prey trained for [[falconry]] or entertainment, although this does not necessarily correlate with intelligence as posited by Errington.<ref name= Errington/><ref name= Baerg/> Carl D. Marti also disagrees with Errington's assessments, noting that their prey selection is not as \"completely random as Errington suggested\"; while \"Great Horned Owls appeared to select their mammalian prey in general relation to the prey populations...[[Cottontail rabbit|Cottontail]]s, appeared to be selected as prey out of relation to their population status.\"<ref name= Marti/>\n\nLike most owls, the great horned owl makes great use of secrecy and stealth. Due to its natural-colored plumage, it is well camouflaged both while active at night and while roosting during the day. During the daytime it roosts usually in large trees (including snags & large hollows but usually thick branches) but may occasionally be in crevices or small caves in rocks or in dense shrubbery. [[Pine]] and other [[Pinophyta|coniferous trees]] may be preferred where available since they are particularly dense and provide cover throughout the year. Typically, males have a favorite roosting site not far from the nest, sometimes used over successive years.<ref name= Austing/> While roosting, great horned owls may rest in the \"tall-thin\" position, where they sit as erect and hold themselves as slim as is possible. The kind of posture is well known as a further method of camouflage for other owls, like long-eared owls or great grey owls, especially if humans or other potential mammalian carnivores approach them. The Eurasian eagle owl rarely, if ever, assumes the tall-thin position.<ref name= Hume>Hume, R. (1991). ''Owls of the world''. Running Press, Philadelphia, PA. 1991.</ref> Outside of the nesting season, great horned owls may roost wherever their foraging path ends at dawn.<ref name= Rohner/> Generally great horned owls are active at night, although in some areas may be active in the late afternoon or early morning. At dusk, the owl utters a few calls before flying to a more open sing-post, i.e. large bare branch or large rocks to deliver song. Normally several perches are used to mark occupied territory or to attract a female.<ref name= Konig/> Despite its camouflage and cryptic locations, this species can still sometimes be spotted on its daytime roosts, especially by [[American crow]]s (''Corvus brachyrhynchos''). Since owls are, next to [[red-tailed hawk]]s, perhaps the main predator of crows and their young, crows sometimes congregate from considerable distances to mob owls and caw angrily at them for hours on end. When the owls try to fly off to avoid this harassment, they are often followed by the corvids.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wesleytheowl.blogspot.ca/2010/04/crows-and-ravens-corvids-and-their-odd.html | title=Stacey O'Brien : Wesley the Owl: Crows and Ravens: The Corvids and their odd behavior| date=2010-04-13}}</ref>\n\n===Territoriality and movements===\nTypically, great horned owls are highly sedentary, often capable of utilizing a single territory throughout their mature lives.<ref>Baumgartner, F. M. 1939. ''Territory and population in the Great Horned Owl''. Auk 56:274-282.</ref> Although some species such as snowy owls, [[northern saw-whet owl]]s, [[long-eared owl|long-eared]] and short-eared owls are true migrants, most North American owls are not migratory and will generally show fidelity to a single territory year around.<ref name= Voous/> In great horned owls, mated pairs occupy territories year-round and long-term. Territories are established and maintained through hooting, with highest activity before egg-laying and second peak in autumn when juveniles disperse, and can range from an average of {{convert|16 |km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Yukon]] to an average of {{convert|2.1 |km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Wyoming]].<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Rohner/>\n\nMost territorial defense is performed by males, but females frequently assist their partners in hooting contests with neighbors or intruders, even during incubation.<ref name= Houston/> On occasion, although territory borders may be successfully maintained via vocalizations alone without even seeing the competing owl, such confrontations may turn physical, with various levels of threats distinguished. The highest threat level involves the spreading of wings, bill-clapping, hissing, higher-pitched screams of longer duration, with general body poised to strike with its feet at intruder. If the intruder continues to press the confrontation, the defending owl will \"hop\" forward and strike it with feet, attempting to grasp and rake with claws.<ref name= Houston/>\n\nTerritoriality appears to place a limit on the number of breeding pairs in a given area. Individuals prevented from establishing a territory live a silent existence as \"floaters\". Radio-telemetry revealed that such floaters concentrate along boundaries of established territories. At [[Kluane]]  in [[Yukon]], incursions into neighboring territories were observed only twice\u2014by females when neighboring female had died or emigrated, suggesting that territorial defense may be sex specific. At least four dead great horned owls in Kluane were apparently killed by others of their own species in territorial conflicts.<ref name= Rohner/> Owls killed by other horned owls are sometimes cannibalized, although the origin of the killing may have been territorial aggression.<ref>Millard, J.

During hunting forays, they often fly about {{convert|50|to|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} from perch to perch, stopping to survey for food at each, until they sense a prey item below. From such vantage points, owls dive down to the ground, often with wings folded, to ambush their prey.<ref name=Konig/> Effective maximum hunting distance of an owl from an elevated perch is {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name= Petersen/> Due to their short but broad wings, great horned owls are ideally suited for low speed and maneuverability.<ref name= Johnson/> Despite reports that they do not hunt on the wing,<ref name= Rudolph>Rudolph, S. G. (1978). ''Predation Ecology of Coexistng Great Horned and Barn Owls''. The Wilson Bulletin, 134-137.</ref> they also sometimes hunt by flying low over openings on the ground, scanning below for prey activity.<ref name= Konig/> Great horned owls can fly at speeds of more than {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in level flight.<ref name= Voous/> Hunting flights are slow, often quartering low above the ground where prey is likely to occur in open country or open woodland. Brief hovering flight (for about 6\u201318 seconds) have been described, especially in windy areas.<ref>Smith, D. G. and B. A. Smith. 1972. ''Hunting methods and success of newly-fledged Great Horned Owls''. Bird-Banding 43:142.</ref> On occasion owls may actually walk on the ground in pursuit of small prey or, rarely, inside a chicken coop to prey on the fowl within.<ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/> [[Rodent]]s and [[invertebrate]]s may be caught on foot around the base of bushes, through grassy areas, and near culverts and other human structures in range and farm habitat.<ref name= Houston/> The great horned owl is generally a poor walker on the ground; it walks like a [[starling]], with a pronounced side-to-side gait. They have been known to wade into shallow water for aquatic prey, although this has been only rarely reported.<ref name= Houston/> Owls can snatch [[bird]]s and some arboreal mammals directly from tree branches in a glide as well. The stiff feathering of their wings allows owls to produce minimal sound in flight while hunting.<ref name=Cornell/><ref name=Konig/><ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/>\n\nAlmost all prey are killed by crushing with the owl's feet or by incidentally stabbing of the talons, though some may be bitten about the face as well. Prey is swallowed whole when possible. When prey is swallowed whole, owls regurgitate [[Pellet (ornithology)|pellets]] of bone and other non-digestible bits about 6 to 10 hours later, usually in the same location where the prey was consumed.<ref name=Konig/> Great horned owl pellets are dark gray or brown in color and very large, {{convert|7.6|to|10.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and have been known to contain skulls up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width inside them.<ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/> However, not all prey can be swallowed at once, and owls will also fly with prey to a perch and tear off pieces with their bill. Most dietary studies focus on pellets found under perches and around nests, since they provide a more complete picture of the diversity of prey consumed, but prey remains outside of pellets may provide clues to prey excluded from the pellets and a combination of both is recommended.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Hamerstrom/><ref name= Orians>Orians, G., & Kuhlman, F. (1956). ''Red-tailed hawk and horned owl populations in Wisconsin''. Condor, 371-385.</ref> Many large prey items are dismembered. Great horned owls may behead large prey before taking it to its nest or eating perch. The legs may also be removed, as may (in some bird prey) the wings. The great horned owl will also crush the bones of its prey to make it more compact for carrying.<ref>Einarsen, A. S. 1956. ''Determination of some predator species by food signs''. Oregon State Monographs, 10: 34.</ref> On occasion, the owls may return to the kill site to continue eating if the prey is too heavy to fly with after dismemberment.<ref name= Bent/> Many owls will accrue a cache of prey, especially those who are nesting. Caches must be at a safe location, usually the crotch of a tall tree. In northern regions, where large prey is prevalent, an owl may let uneaten food freeze and then thaw it out later using its own body heat.<ref name= Mikkola/>  Hunting success seems to require fairly open understory, and experimental testing of microhabitat proved that open areas provided more hunting success on five species of rodent, with cloudy nights and denser bush foliage both decreasing success.<ref>Longland, W.

Weighing a mere {{convert|14|to|31.5|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|to|58|g|oz|abbr=on}} on average, the nine species of New World mice in ''Peromyscus'' and eight species voles in ''Microtus'' recorded in the diet would appear to be overly small to be as important as they are to a predatory bird of this size. The prominence of these genera is undoubtedly due to the abundance of both genera in the wooded edge habitats frequented by great horned owls. It is estimated that a family of owls with two offspring would need to take about a half dozen (voles) to a dozen (mice) of these rodents every night to satisfy their dietary requirements but apparently the accessibility and abundance of these foods is irresistible as their numeric dominance is indisputable.<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> By winter in areas that hold heavy snow, ''[[Peromyscus]]'' mice often come to outnumber the voles in the diet since the mice tend to travel over the surface of the snow while the voles make tunnels underneath the snow.<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Voous/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> In fact, a healthy family of great horned owls can decimate a colony of field rats, thus potentially performing a key role in controlling a highly destructive pest.<ref name= Hamerstrom/>  Great horned owls living in the timbered fringes of garbage or refuse dumps may subsist mostly on rats.<ref name= Mikkola/>\n\nIn the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], California, the [[Southwestern United States]] and northern [[Mexico]], the diversity of this species' diet rises, in sync with the diversity of rodents. Especially important, from [[Colorado]] to [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] is the [[northern pocket gopher]] (''Thomomys talpoides''), although assorted other pocket gophers (''[[Geomys]], [[Cratogeomys]], [[Michoacan pocket gopher|Zygogeomys]], [[Pappogeomys]]'' and other ''[[Thomomys]]'' ssp.) are readily taken.

Some grouse, such as [[greater prairie chicken]] (''Tympanuchus cupido''), [[sharp-tailed grouse]] (''Tympanuchus phasianellus'') and [[greater sage-grouse]] (''Centrocercus urophasianus''),  may also been vulnerable to great horned owls while displaying conspicuously in openings on a [[Lek mating|lek]] first thing in the morning.<ref name= Hamerstrom2>Hamerstrom, F.

They have been known to predate more than 110 different species of assorted water bird.<ref name= Voous/> In prairie wetlands of [[North Dakota]], avian prey, primarily represented by [[duck]]s and the [[American coot]] (''Fulica americana'') came to represent 65% by number and 83% by biomass of the diet of the local owls, also including secondarily [[grebe]]s, smaller [[Rail (bird)|rails]] and [[Wader|shorebird]]s as well as upland-based species like [[grey partridge]] (''Perdix perdix''), [[sharp-tailed grouse]] and [[passerine]]s. 77% of the ducks in that study were juveniles, the largest duck being a male [[mallard]] (''Anas platyrhnychos'') weighing approximately {{convert|1250|g|lb|abbr=on}}, but nearly all the coots were adults.<ref name= Murphy/> On [[Protection Island (Washington)|Protection Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], where they are no native land mammals, [[rhinoceros auklet]]s (''Cerorhinca monocerata''), both adults and nestlings, were the most numerous prey, present in 93% of 120 pellets.<ref name= Hayward/> Species as large as adult [[Canada goose|Canada geese]], [[snow goose]]<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> and [[great blue heron]]s<ref name= Houston/> have been successfully killed.

The predatory effect of this species on other raptorial birds, which is often considerable, is explored in the following section. In [[Brazil]], it was found in a small study that birds overall outnumbered mammals in pellets, although most were not determined to species and the ones that were shown a tremendously diverse assemblage of birds with no obvious dietary preference.<ref name= Tomazzoni/> Although not usually numerically significant, 86 species of [[passerine]] have been taken by great horned owls. Members from most North American families are known as prey, although among smaller types such as [[chickadee]]s, [[New World warbler|warbler]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinals]], [[wren]]s and most [[tyrant flycatcher]]s only a few species from each have been recorded. Nonetheless, an occasionally unlucky migrant or local breeder is sometimes snatched.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Bent/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> Fledgling songbirds are regularly taken in spring and summer.<ref name=DwightSmith/> The smallest avian prey known for great horned owls are the {{convert|5.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[blue-grey gnatcatcher]] (''Polioptila caerulea'') and the {{convert|6.2|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[ruby-crowned kinglet]] (''Regulus calendula'').<ref name= Hamerstrom/> Somewhat larger bodied families are more prominent, i.e. the [[corvid]]s (14 species) and [[icterid]]s (14 species) and, secondarily, the [[kingbird]]s (''Tyrannus'' ssp.), [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]], [[mimid]]s and [[European starling]] (''Sturnus vulgaris'').<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Bent/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> This is likely due to the fact that the larger passerines usually roost in relatively open spots and have larger, more conspicuous nests. [[Crow]]s and [[raven]]s tend to be grabbed off of their communal roosts by night.<ref name= Houston/>\n\n===Other prey===\nThe great horned owl rarely misses an opportunity to hunt [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. However, [[lizard]]s are largely unavailable as prey due to their typically diurnal periods of activity.<ref name= Houston/> However, some snakes are partially or largely nocturnal, and more than a dozen species are hunted in North America. Snakes hunted range from small, innocuous [[garter snake]]s (''Thamnophis'' ssp.) and [[night snake]]s (''Hypsiglena torquata'') to venomous species like [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouth]]s (''Agkistrodon piscivorus'') and [[Crotalus viridis|prairie rattlesnake]]s (''Crotalus virdis'') and formidable, large species like [[Lampropeltis getula|common king snake]]s (''Lampropeltis getula'') and [[Western rat snake|black rat snake]]s (''Pantherophis obsoletus''), which in mature specimens can rival the owl in mass and sheer predatory power.<ref name= Bent/> The capture of the hatchlings of very large reptiles such as [[loggerhead turtle]]s (''Caretta caretta'') and [[American alligator]]s (''Alligator mississippiensis'') by great horned owls has been reported, in both cases likely when the baby reptiles are attempting to make their way to the security of water.<ref name= Bent/><ref>Toland, B. (1991). ''Great horned owl predation of Atlantic loggerhead turtle hatchlings''. Florida Field Naturalist 19, 117-119.</ref> On rare occasion, [[salamander]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s are reported as prey.  On rare occasions, fish are taken including [[goldfish]] (''Carassius auratus''), [[bluegill]] (''Lepomis macrochirus''), [[Ameiurus|bullhead]]s (''Ameiurus'' ssp.), other [[catfish]], [[Catostomidae|suckers]], [[Centrarchidae|sunfish]], [[eel]]s and [[Cyprinidae|dace and chub]].<ref name= Bent/><ref name=DwightSmith/> Many types of invertebrates are recorded as prey. These include mainly insects, but also [[crayfish]], [[crab]]s, [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s and [[worm]]s. The occasionally invertebrate prey taken largely consists of common, large insects such as various [[beetle]]s, [[crickets]], [[grasshopper]]s, [[Nepomorpha|water bug]]s and [[Tettigoniidae|katydid]]s, some of which the great horned owl has even reportedly caught via \"hawking\", i.e. swooping at on the wing.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Houston/><ref>Duncan, J.R. & Lane, P.A. 1998. ''Great Horned Owl Observed Hawking \"Insects\"''.

It is clearly inefficient for owls of this size to attempt to raise young on a diet of foods as small as insects.<ref name= Marti/> Although rare, [[carrion]]-feeding has been recorded in great horned owls, especially ones wintering in Canada and other northern areas during harsh weather.<ref>Errington, P.

Almost every study comparing the diets of North American owls illustrates the considerable overlap in the dietary selection of these species, as all species, besides the primarily insectivorous varieties, rely on many of the same small rodent species for most of their diet, extending from the small northern saw-whet owl and [[eastern screech owl]] to the great horned and great grey owls.<ref name= Marti/><ref name= Cromrich/>\n\nIn a long-term study of a block of [[Michigan]], all nine species of accipitrid, falcon and owl that stayed to breed there were found to be primarily dependent on the same two rodent genera, the [[meadow vole]] and the two common ''[[Peromyscus]]'' species.<ref name= Craighead/> In the [[Great Basin]], the owls share black-tailed jackrabbit and [[desert cottontail]] as the primary prey with golden eagles, red-tailed hawks and [[ferruginous hawk]]s (''Buteo regalis''); all four species had diets with more than 90% of the biomass is made up of those lagomorphs. Of these, the great horned owl and golden eagle were able to nest most closely to one another because they had the most strongly dissimilar periods of activity.<ref name= Smith/><ref name= Smith3/> In California, when compared to the local red-tailed hawks and [[Crotalus atrox|western diamondback rattlesnake]]s (''Crotalus atrox''), the diets were most similar in that by number about 15-20% of all three species' diets depended on [[Cottontail rabbit|cottontail]]s, but the largest portion was made up of [[ground squirrel]]s in the hawk and the rattlesnake and desert woodrats and other assorted [[rodent]]s in the great horned owl.<ref name= Fitch/> In the [[Taiga|boreal forests]], the great horned owl's prolificacy as a [[snowshoe hare]] hunter places it second only to the [[Canada lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis'') among all predators. Although locally dependent on the hares as their main food, [[northern goshawk]]s (''Accipiter gentilis''), red-tailed hawks and golden eagles apparently do not have as large of an impact on the hares, nor do mammalian carnivore generalists that also kill many hares, like the [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[bobcat]], [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo''), [[coyote]] and larger varieties (i.e. [[Gray wolf|wolves]] (''Canis lupus''), [[cougar]]s (''Puma concolor'') and [[bear]]s (''Ursus'' ssp.)).<ref name= Rohner/><ref name= Houston2/><ref name= Mcinvaille/><ref>WLM. (1918). ''Bird Enemies of the Varying Hare''. The Auk, 372-373.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between great horned owls and other raptorial birds in its range is usually decidedly one-sided. While certain species, such as the red-tailed hawk and [[northern goshawk]], might be seen as potential competition for the owls, most others seem to be regarded merely as prey by great horned owls. The great horned owl is both the most prolific and diverse predator in America of other birds of prey, with other accomplished raptor-hunters such as the goshawk and the golden eagle being more restricted in range, habitat and number in North America and thus having a more minor impact. All studies have found raptors are a small portion of this owl's diet but predation can be seriously detrimental for such prey, as raptors tend to be territorial and sparsely distributed as a rule and thus can be effectively decimated by a small number of losses.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Cromrich/> In the [[gray hawk]] (''Buteo plagiatus''), for example, in a study of one breeding block of [[Arizona]], the owls were observed to visit nests nightly until all the nestlings were gone.<ref>Bibles, Brent D., Richard L. Glinski and R. Roy Johnson. 2002. ''Gray Hawk (Buteo plagiatus)'', The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</ref>\n\nRaptorial birds in general tend to have large, conspicuous nests which may make them easier for a hunting owl to locate. The great horned owl gains an advantage by nesting earlier than any other raptor in its range (indeed any bird), as it is able to exploit the other raptors as food while in a more vulnerable state as their own nestlings have become well developed.<ref name= Craighead/> On average, great horned owls begin nesting about three weeks before red-tailed hawks begin to build nests, although some raptors may locally breed as much as two months after the owls.<ref name= Houston/><ref name= Dunstan>Dunstan, T. C., & Harrell, B. E. (1973). ''Spatio-temporal relationships between breeding red-tailed hawks and great horned owls in South Dakota''. Raptor Research, 7(2), 49\u201354.</ref>\n\nMore so than diurnal varieties of raptor, fairly significant numbers of owls are hunted, as all species are to some extent nocturnal and thus their corresponding activity can attract the horned owl's unwanted attention. The extent of predation on other owls depends on the habitat preferences of the other species. Eastern and western screech owls may be most vulnerable since they prefer similar wooded edge habitat. In a block of [[Wisconsin]], great horned owls were responsible for the failure of 78% of eastern screech owl's nests.<ref name= Craighead/> Long-eared owls and, to a lesser extent, barn owls tend to hunt in open, sparsely treed habitats more so than great horned owls, but since they may return to wooded spots for nesting purposes, they may be more vulnerable there. The long-eared owl and barn owls are often compared to the great horned owl as these medium-sized species often occur in abutting habitats and often hunt primarily the same vole and mice species, although the alternate prey of the great horned tends to be much larger, including the smaller owls themselves.<ref name= Earhart/><ref name= Rudolph/><ref>Barrows, C.

In the boreal forests, both the northern hawk owl and great grey owl appear to be in greater danger of great horned owl predation in years where the snowshoe hare have low populations.<ref name= Duncan>Duncan, J.

Anecdotally, both snowy and great horned owls have rarely been reported to dominate or even kill one another depending on the size and disposition of the individual owls, although the snowy's preference for more open areas again acts as something of a buffer. The snowy may be the one North American owl too formidable for the great horned owl to consider as prey.<ref name= Potapov/>\n\nWhereas owls of any age are freely attacked by great horned owls whether nesting or not, when it comes to diurnal raptors, great horned owls are mainly a danger around the nest. They often hunt diurnal raptors when they come across their often relatively conspicuous active platform nests during hunting forays in spring and summer, taking numbers of both nestlings and brooding adults.<ref name= Houston/> Again, like owls, diurnal raptors are attacked depending on the relative similarity of their habitat preferences to the owl. [[Cooper's hawk]]s (''Accipiter cooperii'') and red-tailed hawks tend to be most vulnerable, as they prefer the same wooded edges frequented by great horned owls. Other diurnal raptors may be attracted to more enclosed wooded areas, such as [[sharp-shinned hawk]]s (''Accipiter striatus'') or [[zone-tailed hawk]]s (''Buteo albonotatus''), or more open plain and meadow areas, such as [[Northern harrier]]s (''Circus hudsonius'') and ferruginous hawks, but this is almost never a total insurance against predation as all of these are recorded prey.<ref name= Hamerstrom/><ref>Stoleson, S.

In most of North America, courtship is from October to December and mates are chosen by December to January.<ref name=Konig/> This species was once thought to be strictly monogamous, but recent analysis indicates one male may mate with two females simultaneously, as was discovered for the first time in 2018 in Reno, Nevada.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/animals-owls-birds-parenting-polygamy/#close | title=These Owl Chicks Have Two Moms and a Dad\u2014a First| date=2018-05-02}}</ref> During courtship in late fall or early winter, the male attracts the attention of his mate by hooting emphatically while leaning over (with the tail folded or cocked) and puffing up his white throat to look like a ball.<ref name= Konig/> The white throat may serve as a visual stimuli in the low light conditions typical of when this owl courts.<ref name= Rohner/> He often flies up and down on a perch, while approaching the potential mate. Eventually, he comes to approach the female and tries to rub his bill against hers while repeatedly bowing. If receptive, the female hoots back when the pair meet but is more subdued in both her hoot and display. The male may convince the female by bringing her freshly caught prey, which they will share.<ref name=Bent/><ref name= Konig/> While males often hoot emphatically for about a month or six weeks towards the end of the year, the period where females also hoot is usually only a week to ten days.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Pairs typically breed together year after year and may mate for life, although they associate with each other more loosely when their young become mostly independent.<ref name= Konig/> Pairs rekindling their reproductive relationship in the winter may perform a milder courtship to strengthen pair bonds before producing young.<ref name= Baumgartner/>\n\nMales select nesting sites and bring the females' attention to them by flying to them and then stomping on them.<ref name=Konig/> Nests with open access, considering this birds large size, as opposed to enclosed with surrounding branches, are preferred. Like all owls, great horned owls do not build their own nest. Great horned owls tend to examine an area for an abandoned nest, generally from larger birds like hawks, and take over the nest for raising their own young.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morse|first=Douglass H.|date=April 1971|title=Great Horned Owls and Nesting Seabirds|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4083889|journal=The Auk|volume=88|issue=2|pages=426\u2013427|doi=10.2307/4083889|issn=0004-8038}}</ref> They nest in a wider variety of nest sites than any other North American bird.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Many nests are in cavernous hollows of dead trees or their branches, especially in southern states in large trees along the edge of old-growth lots.<ref name= Baumgartner/> In mountainous or hilly areas, especially in canyons of the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] and [[Rocky Mountains]], cliff ledges, small caves, and other sheltered depressions may be used.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Owls living in prairie country, in the absence of other animals' nests, riparian trees or non-native trees or the bare ground of tree hollows or man-made structures, will use boulders, buttes, railroad cuts, low bushes and even the bare ground as nest sites.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Ground nests have also been recorded in the midst of tall grasses in [[Florida]] and in the midsts of brushy spots on the desert ground.<ref name= Voous/> Even the burrow entrances of [[American badger]] and [[coyote]] dens have reportedly been used as nests, in spite of the inherent risk of sharing space with such potentially dangerous co-inhabitants.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Nesting behavior for the great horned owl appears to be more closely related to prey availability than it does to seasonal conditions. There has been some evidence to support that if prey availability is low enough that the species may forgo mating entirely for a season. Male and female owls of the species have been observed to help incubate the eggs once they have been laid on a nest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greathornedowl.net/great-horned-owl-nest/|title=Great Horned Owl Nest \u2013 Interesting Facts & Information|last=WALEED|date=2018-08-29|website=Great Horned Owl|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bubo virginianus00.jpg|thumb|right|A brooding female common great horned owl (''B. v. virginianus'') on her nest in [[Louisiana]]]]\nMost tree nests used by great horned owls are constructed by other animals, often from a height of about {{convert|4.5|to|22|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the ground. They often take over a nest used by some other large bird, sometimes adding feathers to line the nest but usually not much more. Allegedly there have some cases where the owls have reinforced a nest structure or appeared to have reconstructed a nest, but as a rule no owl species has ever been known to actually build a nest.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Great horned owls in the southwest may also use nests in [[Cactus|cacti]], built by [[Harris's hawk]] and red-tailed hawk, as well as large hollows in cacti.<ref>Mader, W.

In [[Southern Florida]], eggs may be laid as early as late November to as late as early January. In the [[Southeastern United States|southeast]], from south [[Texas]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], egg laying may begin from late December to early February. From [[Southern California]] to northern [[Louisiana]], egg laying is from early February to late March. The largest swath of egg-laying owls from central California to [[South Carolina]] to as far north as [[Ohio]] and [[Massachusetts]] is from late February to early April. In the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Northwestern United States]], northern [[New England]] and eastern Canada, egg laying is from early March to late April.

Gradually the soft juvenal downy plumage comes through the down, being typically a cinnamon-buff color, but with variable hues predicting the eventual color of the mature owls. The extent of down gradually diminishes, developing mature-looking plumage by late summer, although many first year birds still have scattered bits of down into autumn. By late autumn, first-year birds look similar to adults but with a slightly warmer, reddish tinge, less well developed ear tufts and a smaller white throat patch.<ref name= Bent/> The nestling owls develop mostly in behavior between two weeks and two months of age, in which time they adapt the ability to defend themselves, grasp foods and climb. Vocally, the young are able to exert weak chips while still in the egg, developing into a raspy chirp shortly after hatching. The calls of the young increase rapidly in intensity, pitch and character, some juvenile males mimicking their father's hooting in fall but usually they conclude with various odd gurgling notes. The earliest competent hooting by juvenile owls is not until January.<ref name= Houston/><ref>Sumner, Jr., E. L. 1934. ''The behavior of some young raptorial birds''.

Occasionally, nestlings and fledglings will fall from the nest too early to escape or to competently defend themselves and fall prey to [[fox]]es, [[bobcat]], [[coyote]]s, or wild or feral [[cat]]s. Occasionally [[raccoon]]s and [[American black bear]]s consume eggs and nestlings from tree nests and [[Virginia opossum]] may take the rare unguarded egg.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Houston/> [[Crow]]s and [[raven]]s have been reported eating eggs and small nestlings. This can normally only happen when owls are driven from the nest by human activity or are forced to leave the nest to forage by low food resources but on occasion huge flocks of crows have been able to displace owls by harassing them endlessly.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Houston/> In general, great horned owls rarely engage in [[siblicide]], unlike many other raptorial birds.

The [[Arikara]] of the [[Great Plains]] had mystic owl societies in which initiates were made to adorn facial mask made of the wing and tail feathers of great horned owls. Some Indian nations regarded the great horned owl as a friendly spirit who could aid in matters of love, such as the [[Passamaquoddy]] of [[Maine]] who felt the call of this species was a magical love flute designed to ignite human passions. The [[Hopi]] of the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] also associated this owl with fertility, albeit of a different kind: they believed the calling of the owls into summer predicted hot weather, which produced good peach crops. During the [[winter solstice]], the Hopi performed a ceremony with great horned owl feathers in hopes of summoning the heat of summer. Tribes in [[New Mexico]] were known to use owl wing feathers to produce arrows which could strike their enemies with a minimum of sound. The [[Zuni people|Zuni]] held owl feathers in their mouths hoping to gain some of the silence that owls use in ambushes while striking their own enemies from other tribes. The [[Iroquois]] felt the origin of the great horned owl was due to an unformed owl annoying [[Iroquois mythology|Raweno]], the almighty creator, while Raweno created the [[rabbit]], causing Raweno to make the owl \"covered with mud\" (dark camouflage) and doomed to ceaselessly call \"whoo whoo\", which he used while harassing Raweno, by night because Raweno was active during the day.<ref name=DwightSmith/>\n\n===Provincial bird===\n\nThe great horned owl is the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial bird]] of [[Alberta]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus)|url=http://aep.alberta.ca/fish-wildlife/wild-species/birds/owls/great-horned-owl.aspx|website=Alberta Environment & Parks}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Accordi|first=Iury Almeida|author2=Barcellos, Andre|title=Composi\u00e7\u00e3o da avifauna em oito \u00e1reas \u00famidas da Bacia Hidrogr\u00e1fica do Lago Gua\u00edba, Rio Grande do Sul|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia|date=June 2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=101\u2013115|url=http://www.ararajuba.org.br/sbo/ararajuba/artigos/Volume142/ara142art2.pdf|language=Portuguese, English|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219192057/http://www.ararajuba.org.br/sbo/ararajuba/artigos/Volume142/ara142art2.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-19}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Banks|first=R.C. |author2=Cicero, C. |author3=Dunn, J.L. |author4=Kratter, A.W. |author5=Ouellet, H. |author6=Rasmussen, P.C. |author7=Remsen, J.V.

A diode [[vacuum tube]] or '''thermionic diode''' is a vacuum tube with two [[electrode]]s, a heated [[cathode]] and a [[plate electrode|plate]], in which electrons can flow in only one direction, from cathode to plate.

As such, the diode can be viewed as an electronic version of a [[check valve]]. This unidirectional behavior is called [[rectification (electricity)|rectification]], and is used to convert [[alternating current]] (ac) to [[direct current]] (dc). Forms of [[rectifier]]s, diodes can be used for such tasks as extracting [[modulation]] from radio signals in radio receivers.\n\nHowever, diodes can have more complicated behavior than this simple on\u2013off action, because of their [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] current-voltage characteristics.<ref name=\"Turner\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Turner\n | first1 = L.

The voltage drop across a forward-biased diode varies only a little with the current, and is a function of temperature; this effect can be used as a [[#Temperature measurements|temperature sensor]] or as a [[voltage reference]].  Also, diodes' high resistance to current flowing in the reverse direction suddenly drops to a low resistance when the reverse voltage across the diode reaches a value called the [[breakdown voltage]].\n\nA semiconductor diode's current\u2013voltage characteristic can be tailored by selecting the [[semiconductor materials]] and the [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] impurities introduced into the materials during manufacture.<ref name=\"Turner\" /> These techniques are used to create special-purpose diodes that perform many different functions.<ref name=\"Turner\" />  For example, diodes are used to regulate voltage ([[Zener diode]]s), to protect circuits from high voltage surges ([[avalanche diode]]s), to electronically tune radio and TV receivers ([[varactor diode]]s), to generate [[radio frequency|radio-frequency]] [[oscillation]]s ([[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s), and to produce light ([[light-emitting diode]]s). Tunnel, Gunn and IMPATT diodes exhibit [[negative resistance]], which is useful in [[microwave]] and switching circuits.\n\nDiodes, both vacuum and semiconductor, can be used as [[Noise generator#Shot noise generators|shot-noise generators]].\n\n==History==\nThermionic ([[vacuum-tube]]) diodes and [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] (semiconductor) diodes were developed separately, at approximately the same time, in the early 1900s, as radio receiver [[detector (radio)|detectors]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2011|title=Trailblazers in Solid-State Electronics|journal=IEEE Ind.

From top to bottom, the element names are: ''plate'', ''cathode'', and ''heater''.]]\n\nA thermionic diode is a [[thermionic valve|thermionic-valve]] device consisting of a sealed, evacuated glass or metal envelope containing two [[electrode]]s: a [[thermionic cathode|cathode]] and a [[plate electrode|plate]]. The cathode is either ''indirectly heated'' or ''directly heated''. If indirect heating is employed, a heater is included in the envelope.\n\nIn operation, the cathode is heated to red heat  (800\u20131000&nbsp;\u00b0C). A directly heated cathode is made of tungsten wire and is heated by current passed through it from an external voltage source. An indirectly heated cathode is heated by infrared radiation from a nearby heater that is formed of [[Nichrome]] wire and supplied with current provided by an external voltage source.\n\nThe operating temperature of the cathode causes it to release [[electron]]s into the vacuum, a process called [[thermionic emission]]. The cathode is coated with [[oxide]]s of [[alkaline earth metal]]s, such as [[barium]] and [[strontium]] [[oxide]]s. These have a low [[work function]], meaning that they more readily emit electrons than would the uncoated cathode.\n\nThe plate, not being heated, does not emit electrons; but is able to absorb them.\n\nThe alternating voltage to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the plate.  When the plate voltage is positive with respect to the cathode, the plate [[electrostatics|electrostatically]] attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate. When the plate voltage is negative with respect to the cathode, no electrons are emitted by the plate, so no current can pass from the plate to the cathode.\n\n==Semiconductor diodes==<!-- This section is linked from [[Boltzmann constant]] -->\n[[File:EFD108_Point_Contact_Germanium_Diode.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Close-up of an EFD108 germanium point-contact diode in DO7 glass package, showing the sharp metal wire (''cat whisker'') that forms the semiconductor junction.]]\n\n===Point-contact diodes===\nPoint-contact diodes were developed starting in the 1930s, out of the early [[crystal detector]] technology, and are now generally used in the 3 to 30 gigahertz range.<ref name=\"Scaff_Ohl_01\"/><ref name=\"SG\">[https://www.semigen.net/point-contact-diodes/ SemiGen Inc.]</ref><ref name=\"AS\">[http://www.advancedsemiconductor.com/pdf/diodes/SiliconPointContactMixer.pdf Advanced Semiconductor, Inc.]</ref><ref name=\"MB\">[https://massbaytech.com/point-contact-diodes/  Massachusetts Bay Technologies]</ref> Point-contact diodes use a small diameter metal wire in contact with a semiconductor crystal, and are of either ''non-welded'' contact type or ''welded contact'' type.

Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative [[charge carrier]]s (electrons), called an [[n-type semiconductor]], and a region on the other side that contains positive charge carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]]), called a [[p-type semiconductor]]. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the [[depletion region]] because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a [[p\u2013n junction]], is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher [[Electric potential|electrical potential]] is applied to the P side (the [[anode]]) than to the N side (the [[cathode]]), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical [[check valve]].\n\n====Schottky diode====\n{{main article|Schottky diode}}\nAnother type of junction diode, the [[Schottky diode]], is formed from a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]] rather than a p\u2013n junction, which reduces capacitance and increases switching speed.<ref name=\"skyworks_01\">[http://www.skyworksinc.com/uploads/documents/200826A.pdf Skyworks Solutions, Inc., ''Mixer and Detector Diodes'']</ref><ref>[https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/rf-microwave-a-millimeter-wave/1575-diodes-schottky Microsemi Corporation Schottky web page]</ref>\n\n===Current\u2013voltage characteristic===\n[[File:Diode current wiki.png|thumb|400px|I\u2013V (current vs. voltage) characteristics of a p\u2013n junction diode]]\n\nA semiconductor diode's behavior in a circuit is given by its [[current\u2013voltage characteristic]], or I\u2013V graph (see graph below). The shape of the curve is determined by the transport of charge carriers through the so-called ''[[depletion zone|depletion layer]]'' or ''[[depletion region]]'' that exists at the [[p\u2013n junction]] between differing semiconductors. When a p\u2013n junction is first created, conduction-band (mobile) electrons from the N-[[dopant|doped]] region diffuse into the P-[[dopant|doped]] region where there is a large population of holes (vacant places for electrons) with which the electrons \"recombine\". When a mobile electron recombines with a hole, both hole and electron vanish, leaving behind an immobile positively charged donor (dopant) on the N side and negatively charged acceptor (dopant) on the P side. The region around the p\u2013n junction becomes depleted of [[charge carrier]]s and thus behaves as an [[nonconductor|insulator]].\n\nHowever, the width of the depletion region (called the [[depletion width]]) cannot grow without limit. For each [[electron\u2013hole pair]] recombination made, a positively charged [[dopant]] ion is left behind in the N-doped region, and a negatively charged dopant ion is created in the P-doped region. As recombination proceeds and more ions are created, an increasing electric field develops through the depletion zone that acts to slow and then finally stop recombination. At this point, there is a \"built-in\" potential across the depletion zone.\n\n[[File:PN band.gif|thumb|600px|right|A [[PN junction]] diode in forward bias mode, the [[depletion width]] decreases. Both p and n junctions are doped at a 1e15/cm3 [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] level, leading to built-in potential of ~0.59V. Observe the different [[quasi Fermi level]]s for conduction band and valence band in n and p regions (red curves).]]\n\n====Reverse bias====\nIf an external voltage is placed across the diode with the same polarity as the built-in potential, the depletion zone continues to act as an insulator, preventing any significant electric current flow (unless [[electron\u2013hole pair]]s are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see [[photodiode]]). This is called the ''[[reverse bias]]'' phenomenon.\n\n====Forward bias====\nHowever, if the polarity of the external voltage opposes the built-in potential, recombination can once again proceed, resulting in a substantial electric current through the p\u2013n junction (i.e. substantial numbers of electrons and holes recombine at the junction). For silicon diodes, the built-in potential is approximately 0.7 V (0.3 V for germanium and 0.2 V for Schottky). Thus, if an external voltage greater than and opposite to the built-in voltage is applied, a current will flow and the diode is said to be \"turned on\" as it has been given an external ''[[p\u2013n junction#Forward bias|forward bias]]''. The diode is commonly said to have a forward \"threshold\" voltage, above which it conducts and below which conduction stops. However, this is only an approximation as the forward characteristic is smooth (see I-V graph above).\n\nA diode's [[I\u2013V characteristic]] can be approximated by four regions of operation:\n\n# At very large reverse bias, beyond the [[peak inverse voltage]] or PIV, a process called reverse [[avalanche breakdown|breakdown]] occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., a large number of electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p\u2013n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The [[avalanche diode]] is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the [[Zener diode]], the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p\u2013n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is \"clamped\" to a known value (called the ''Zener voltage''), and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also, following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is reverse current for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking capability until the reverse current ceases.\n# For a bias less than the PIV, the reverse current is very small. For a normal P\u2013N rectifier diode, the reverse current through the device in the micro-ampere (\u03bcA) range is very low. However, this is temperature dependent, and at sufficiently high temperatures, a substantial amount of reverse current can be observed (mA or more). There is also a tiny surface leakage current caused by electrons simply going around the diode as though it were an imperfect insulator.\n# With a small forward bias, where only a small forward current is conducted, the current\u2013voltage curve is [[Exponential function|exponential]] in accordance with the ideal diode equation.  There is a definite forward voltage at which the diode starts to conduct significantly.  This is called the ''knee voltage'' or ''cut-in voltage'' and is equal to the [[p\u2013n junction#Properties of a p\u2013n junction|barrier potential]] of the p-n junction. This is a feature of the exponential curve, and appears sharper on a current scale more compressed than in the diagram shown here.\n# At larger forward currents the current-voltage curve starts to be dominated by the ohmic resistance of the bulk semiconductor.  The curve is no longer exponential, it is asymptotic to a straight line whose slope is the bulk resistance.  This region is particularly important for power diodes.  The diode can be modeled as an ideal diode in series with a fixed resistor.\n\nIn a small silicon diode operating at its rated currents, the voltage drop is about 0.6 to 0.7 [[volt]]s. The value is different for other diode types\u2014[[Schottky diode]]s can be rated as low as 0.2 V, germanium diodes 0.25 to 0.3 V, and red or blue [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) can have values of 1.4 V and 4.0 V respectively.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nAt higher currents the forward voltage drop of the diode increases. A drop of 1 V to 1.5 V is typical at full rated current for power diodes.\n\n===Shockley diode equation===\n{{main article|Shockley diode equation}}\nThe ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' or the ''diode law'' (named after the [[bipolar junction transistor]] co-inventor [[William Shockley|William Bradford Shockley]]) gives the I\u2013V characteristic of an ideal diode in either forward or reverse bias (or no bias). The following equation is called the ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' when ''n'', the ideality factor, is set equal to 1 :\n\n:<math>I=I_\\mathrm{S} \\left( e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}} - 1 \\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n:''I'' is the diode current,\n:''I''<sub>S</sub> is the reverse bias [[saturation current]] (or scale current),\n:''V''<sub>D</sub> is the voltage across the diode,\n:''V''<sub>T</sub> is the [[thermal voltage]], and\n:''n'' is the ''ideality factor'', also known as the ''quality factor'' or sometimes ''emission coefficient''. The ideality factor ''n'' typically varies from 1 to 2 (though can in some cases be higher), depending on the fabrication process and semiconductor material and is set equal to 1 for the case of an \"ideal\" diode (thus the n is sometimes omitted). The ideality factor was added to account for imperfect junctions as observed in real transistors. The factor mainly accounts for [[carrier recombination]] as the charge carriers cross the [[depletion region]].\n\nThe [[thermal voltage]] ''V''<sub>T</sub> is approximately 25.85 mV at 300 K, a temperature close to \"room temperature\" commonly used in device simulation software. At any temperature it is a known constant defined by:\n\n:<math>V_\\text{T} = \\frac{k T}{q} \\, ,</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''T'' is the absolute temperature of the p\u2013n junction, and ''q'' is the magnitude of charge of an [[electron]] (the [[elementary charge]]).\n\nThe reverse saturation current, ''I''<sub>S</sub>, is not constant for a given device, but varies with temperature; usually more significantly than ''V''<sub>T</sub>, so that ''V''<sub>D</sub> typically decreases as ''T'' increases.\n\nThe ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' or the ''diode law'' is derived with the assumption that the only processes giving rise to the current in the diode are drift (due to electrical field), diffusion, and thermal [[carrier generation and recombination|recombination\u2013generation]] (R\u2013G) (this equation is derived by setting n = 1 above). It also assumes that the R\u2013G current in the depletion region is insignificant. This means that the ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' does not account for the processes involved in reverse breakdown and photon-assisted R\u2013G. Additionally, it does not describe the \"leveling off\" of the I\u2013V curve at high forward bias due to internal resistance. Introducing the ideality factor, n, accounts for recombination and generation of carriers.\n\nUnder ''reverse bias'' voltages the exponential in the diode equation is negligible, and the current is a constant (negative) reverse current value of \u2212''I<sub>S</sub>''. The reverse ''breakdown region'' is not modeled by the Shockley diode equation.\n\nFor even rather small ''forward bias'' voltages the exponential is very large, since the thermal voltage is very small in comparison. The subtracted '1' in the diode equation is then negligible and the forward diode current can be approximated by\n\n:<math>I = I_\\text{S} e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}}</math>\n\nThe use of the diode equation in circuit problems is illustrated in the article on [[diode modelling#Shockley diode model|diode modeling]].\n\n===Small-signal behavior===\nAt forward voltages less than the saturation voltage, the voltage versus current characteristic curve of most diodes is not a straight line. The current can be approximated by <math>I = I_\\text{S} e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}}</math> as mentioned in the previous section.\n\nIn detector and mixer applications, the current can be estimated by a Taylor's series.<ref name=\"Giacoletto_1977\">{{cite book |author-first=Lawrence Joseph |author-last=Giacoletto |title=Electronics Designers' Handbook |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |date=1977 |page=24\u2013138}}</ref> The odd terms can be omitted because they produce frequency components that are outside the pass band of the mixer or detector.  Even terms beyond the second derivative usually need not be included because they are small compared to the second order term.<ref name=\"Giacoletto_1977\" /> The desired current component is approximately proportional to the square of the input voltage, so the response is called ''[[square-law detector|square law]]'' in this region.<ref name=\"HC\" />{{rp|p. 3}}\n\n===Reverse-recovery effect===\nFollowing the end of forward conduction in a p\u2013n type diode, a reverse current can flow for a short time. The device does not attain its blocking capability until the mobile charge in the junction is depleted.\n\nThe effect can be significant when switching large currents very quickly.<ref>[http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5817/hw/hw1/Diode%20reverse%20recovery%20in%20a%20boost%20converter.pdf Diode reverse recovery in a boost converter].

During this recovery time, the diode can actually conduct in the reverse direction. This might give rise to a large constant current in the reverse direction for a short time while the diode is reverse biased. The magnitude of such a reverse current is determined by the operating circuit (i.e., the series resistance) and the diode is said to be in the storage-phase.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/LED.2014.2353301| title = Gate-Controlled Reverse Recovery for Characterization of LDMOS Body Diode| journal = IEEE Electron Device Letters| volume = 35| issue = 11| page = 1079| year = 2014| last1 = Elhami Khorasani | first1 = A. | last2 = Griswold | first2 = M. | last3 = Alford | first3 = T.

ECEN5797. ecee.colorado.edu</ref> However, when the [[slew rate]] of the current is not so severe (e.g. Line frequency) the effect can be safely ignored. For most applications, the effect is also negligible for [[Schottky diode]]s.\n\nThe reverse current ceases abruptly when the stored charge is depleted; this abrupt stop is exploited in [[step recovery diode]]s for generation of extremely short pulses.\n\n===Types of semiconductor diode===\n\nNormal (p\u2013n) diodes, which operate as described above, are usually made of doped [[silicon]] or [[germanium]]. Before the development of silicon power rectifier diodes, [[cuprous oxide]] and later [[selenium]] was used. Their low efficiency required a much higher forward voltage to be applied (typically 1.4 to 1.7&nbsp;V per \"cell\", with multiple cells stacked so as to increase the peak inverse voltage rating for application in high voltage rectifiers), and required a large heat sink (often an extension of the diode's metal [[Substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]]), much larger than the later silicon diode of the same current ratings would require. The vast majority of all diodes are the p\u2013n diodes found in [[CMOS]] [[integrated circuits]]{{CN|date=June 2019}}, which include two diodes per pin and many other internal diodes.\n\n;[[Avalanche diode]]s\n:These are diodes that conduct in the reverse direction when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically very similar to Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the ''avalanche effect''. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p\u2013n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2&nbsp;V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on the way through the channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.\n;[[Constant current diode]]s\n:These are actually [[JFET]]s<ref>[http://digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Vishay_8026/PDF/Vishay_CurrentRegulatorDiodes.pdf Current regulator diodes].

They can also be used as low loss [[rectifier]]s, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are [[majority carrier]] devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes\u2014so they have a faster reverse recovery than p\u2013n junction diodes.

Most diodes have a 1-prefix designation (e.g., 1N4003). Among the most popular in this series were: 1N34A/1N270 (germanium signal), 1N914/[[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] (silicon signal), [[1N400x general-purpose diodes|1N400x]] (silicon 1A power rectifier), and [[1N58xx schottky diodes|1N580x]] (silicon 3A power rectifier).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jedec.org/Home/about_jedec.cfm |title=About JEDEC |publisher=Jedec.org |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.elektroda.net/introduction-dates-of-common-transistors-and-diodes-t94332.html |title=Introduction dates of common transistors and diodes? |publisher=EDAboard.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011133032/http://news.elektroda.net/introduction-dates-of-common-transistors-and-diodes-t94332.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://semiconductormuseum.com/Museum_Index.htm |title=Transistor Museum Construction Projects Point Contact Germanium Western Electric Vintage Historic Semiconductors Photos Alloy Junction Oral History |publisher=Semiconductormuseum.com |author=I.D.E.A |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n====JIS====\nThe [[JIS semiconductor designation]] system has all semiconductor diode designations starting with \"1S\".\n\n====Pro Electron====\nThe European [[Pro Electron]] coding system for [[active component]]s was introduced in 1966 and comprises two letters followed by the part code. The first letter represents the semiconductor material used for the component (A = germanium and B = silicon) and the second letter represents the general function of the part (for diodes, A = low-power/signal, B = variable capacitance, X = multiplier, Y = rectifier and Z = voltage reference); for example:\n* AA-series germanium low-power/signal diodes (e.g., AA119)\n* BA-series silicon low-power/signal diodes (e.g., BAT18 silicon RF switching diode)\n* BY-series silicon rectifier diodes (e.g., BY127 1250V, 1A rectifier diode)\n* BZ-series silicon Zener diodes (e.g., BZY88C4V7 4.7V Zener diode)\n\nOther common numbering / coding systems (generally manufacturer-driven) include:\n* GD-series germanium diodes (e.g., GD9){{spaced ndash}}this is a very old coding system\n* OA-series germanium diodes (e.g., OA47){{spaced ndash}}a [[Mullard\u2013Philips tube designation|coding sequence]] developed by [[Mullard]], a UK company\n\nAs well as these common codes, many manufacturers or organisations have their own systems too{{spaced ndash}}for example:\n* HP diode 1901-0044 = JEDEC 1N4148\n* UK military diode CV448 = Mullard type OA81 = [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] type GEX23\n\n==Related devices==\n* [[Rectifier]]\n* [[Transistor]]\n* [[Thyristor]] or silicon controlled rectifier (SCR)\n* [[TRIAC]]\n* [[DIAC]]\n* [[Varistor]]\nIn optics, an equivalent device for the diode but with laser light would be the [[Optical isolator]], also known as an Optical Diode{{CN|date=June 2019}}, that allows light to only pass in one direction. It uses a [[Faraday rotator]] as the main component.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Radio demodulation===\n[[File:Simple envelope detector.svg|thumb|300x300px|A simple [[envelope detector|envelope demodulator]] circuit.]]\nThe first use for the diode was the demodulation of [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the [[radio]] article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose [[amplitude]] or envelope is proportional to the original audio signal. The diode [[rectifier|rectifies]] the AM radio frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave. The audio is then extracted from the rectified carrier wave using a simple [[electronic filter|filter]] and fed into an audio amplifier or [[transducer]], which generates sound waves.\n\nIn microwave and millimeter wave technology, beginning in the 1930s, researchers improved and miniaturized the crystal detector. [[Diode#Point-contact diodes|Point contact diodes]] (''crystal diodes'') and [[Diode#Junction diodes|Schottky diodes]] are used in radar, microwave and millimeter wave detectors.<ref name=\"skyworks_01\"/>\n\n===Power conversion===\n{{Main article|Rectifier}}\n[[File:ACtoDCpowersupply.png|250px|thumb|Schematic of basic ac-to-dc power supply]]\n\n[[Rectifier]]s are constructed from diodes, where they are used to convert [[alternating current]] (AC) electricity into [[direct current]] (DC). Automotive [[alternator (auto)|alternators]] are a common example, where the diode, which rectifies the AC into DC, provides better performance than the [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] or earlier, [[electrical generator|dynamo]]. Similarly, diodes are also used in ''[[Cockcroft-Walton generator|Cockcroft\u2013Walton]] [[voltage multiplier]]s'' to convert ac into higher ac voltages.\n\n===Over-voltage protection===\nDiodes are frequently used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage rises above the normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in ([[stepper motor]] and [[H-bridge]]) [[motor controller]] and [[relay]] circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging [[voltage spike]]s that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a [[flyback diode]]). Many [[integrated circuits]] also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive [[transistors]]. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see [[#Types of semiconductor diode|Diode types]] above).\n\n===Logic gates===\nDiodes can be combined with other components to construct [[logical conjunction|AND]] and [[logical disjunction|OR]] [[logic gate]]s. This is referred to as [[diode logic]].\n\n===Ionizing radiation detectors===\nIn addition to light, mentioned above, [[semiconductor]] diodes are sensitive to more [[energy|energetic]] radiation. In [[electronics]], [[cosmic ray]]s and other sources of ionizing radiation cause [[noise]] [[pulse]]s and single and multiple bit errors.\nThis effect is sometimes exploited by [[particle detector]]s to detect radiation. A single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of [[electron volt]]s of energy, generates many charge carrier pairs, as its energy is deposited in the semiconductor material. If the depletion layer is large enough to catch the whole shower or to stop a heavy particle, a fairly accurate measurement of the particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc.\nThese semiconductor radiation detectors need efficient and uniform charge collection and low leakage current. They are often cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]]. For longer-range (about a centimetre) particles, they need a very large depletion depth and large area. For short-range particles, they need any contact or un-depleted semiconductor on at least one surface to be very thin. The back-bias voltages are near breakdown (around a thousand volts per centimetre). Germanium and silicon are common materials. Some of these detectors sense position as well as energy.\nThey have a finite life, especially when detecting heavy particles, because of radiation damage. Silicon and germanium are quite different in their ability to convert [[gamma ray]]s to electron showers.\n\n[[Semiconductor detector]]s for high-energy particles are used in large numbers. Because of energy loss fluctuations, accurate measurement of the energy deposited is of less use.\n\n===Temperature measurements===\nA diode can be used as a [[temperature]] measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a [[silicon bandgap temperature sensor]]. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might ''appear'' that the voltage has a ''positive'' temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the [[Saturation current|reverse saturation current]] term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a ''negative'' temperature coefficient, typically \u22122 mV/\u02daC for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 [[kelvin]]. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cliftonlaboratories.com/1n400x_diode_family_forward_voltage.htm |title=1N400x Diode Family Forward Voltage |website=cliftonlaboratories.com |access-date=2013-12-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524153406/http://www.cliftonlaboratories.com/1n400x_diode_family_forward_voltage.htm |archivedate=2013-05-24}}</ref> and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.<ref>[http://www.omega.com/Temperature/pdf/CY7.pdf Cryogenic Temperature Sensors]. omega.com</ref>\n\n===Current steering===\nDiodes will prevent currents in unintended directions. To supply power to an electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. An [[uninterruptible power supply]] may use diodes in this way to ensure that current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.\n\nDiodes are also used in [[electronic keyboards|electronic musical keyboards]]. To reduce the amount of wiring needed in electronic musical keyboards, these instruments often use [[keyboard matrix circuit]]s. The keyboard controller scans the rows and columns to determine which note the player has pressed. The problem with matrix circuits is that, when several notes are pressed at once, the current can flow backwards through the circuit and trigger \"[[Keyboard (computing)#Control processor|phantom keys]]\" that cause \"ghost\" notes to play. To avoid triggering unwanted notes, most keyboard matrix circuits have diodes soldered with the switch under each key of the [[musical keyboard]]. The same principle is also used for the switch matrix in solid-state [[pinball machine]]s.\n\n===Waveform clipper===\n{{main article|Clipper (electronics)}}\nDiodes can be used to limit the positive or negative excursion of a signal to a prescribed voltage.\n\n===Clamper===\n{{main article|Clamper (electronics)}}\n[[File:DiodeClamp.png|150px|thumb|This simple diode clamp will clamp the negative peaks of the incoming waveform to the common rail voltage]]\nA diode [[Clamper (electronics)|clamp circuit]] can take a periodic alternating current signal that oscillates between positive and negative values, and vertically displace it such that either the positive, or the negative peaks occur at a prescribed level. The clamper does not restrict the peak-to-peak excursion of the signal, it moves the whole signal up or down so as to place the peaks at the reference level.\n\n==Abbreviations==\nDiodes are usually referred to as ''D'' for diode on [[printed circuit board|PCBs]]. Sometimes the abbreviation ''CR'' for ''crystal rectifier'' is used.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Ambrose Fleming|year=1919|url=https://archive.org/details/principleselect01flemgoog|title=The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy and Telephony|place=London|publisher=Longmans, Green|page=[https://archive.org/details/principleselect01flemgoog/page/n588 550]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Active rectification]]\n* [[Diode modelling]]\n* [[Lambda diode]]\n* [[p\u2013n junction]]\n* [[Small-signal model]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Periodicals\n* ''Solid-State Diodes''; Electronics World; pp. 37\u201360; July 1966. <small>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Electronics-World/60s/1966/Electronics-World-1966-07.pdf (archive)]</small>\n\n;Books\n* ''Rectifier Applications Manual''; 2nd Ed; William Roehr; ON Semiconductor; 270 pages; 2001. <small>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090407093106/http://www.ieeta.pt/~alex/docs/ApplicationNotes/Rectifier%20Applications%20Handbook.pdf (archive)]</small>\n* ''Silicon Rectifier Handbook''; 1st Ed; Bob Dale; Motorola; 213 pages; 1966. <small>[https://archive.org/details/RectifiersSCRsTriacs-MotorolaSiliconRectifierHandbook1966OCR/ (archive)]</small>\n* ''Electronic Rectification''; F.G.

A diode [[vacuum tube]] or '''thermionic diode''' is a vacuum tube with two [[electrode]]s, a heated [[cathode]] and a [[plate electrode|plate]], in which electrons can flow in only one direction, from cathode to plate.   A '''semiconductor diode''', the most commonly used type today, is a [[Crystallinity|crystalline]] piece of [[semiconductor]] material with a [[p\u2013n junction]] connected to two electrical terminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-22519/l/physical-explanation-general-semiconductors |title=Physical Explanation \u2013 General Semiconductors |date=2010-05-25 |access-date=2010-08-06}}</ref> Semiconductor diodes were the first [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor electronic devices]].

As such, the diode can be viewed as an electronic version of a [[check valve]]. This unidirectional behavior is called [[rectification (electricity)|rectification]], and is used to convert [[alternating current]] (ac) to [[direct current]] (dc). Forms of [[rectifier]]s, diodes can be used for such tasks as extracting [[modulation]] from radio signals in radio receivers.\n\nHowever, diodes can have more complicated behavior than this simple on\u2013off action, because of their [[linear circuit|nonlinear]] current-voltage characteristics.<ref name=\"Turner\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Turner\n | first1 = L.

The voltage drop across a forward-biased diode varies only a little with the current, and is a function of temperature; this effect can be used as a [[#Temperature measurements|temperature sensor]] or as a [[voltage reference]].  Also, diodes' high resistance to current flowing in the reverse direction suddenly drops to a low resistance when the reverse voltage across the diode reaches a value called the [[breakdown voltage]].\n\nA semiconductor diode's current\u2013voltage characteristic can be tailored by selecting the [[semiconductor materials]] and the [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] impurities introduced into the materials during manufacture.<ref name=\"Turner\" /> These techniques are used to create special-purpose diodes that perform many different functions.<ref name=\"Turner\" />  For example, diodes are used to regulate voltage ([[Zener diode]]s), to protect circuits from high voltage surges ([[avalanche diode]]s), to electronically tune radio and TV receivers ([[varactor diode]]s), to generate [[radio frequency|radio-frequency]] [[oscillation]]s ([[tunnel diode]]s, [[Gunn diode]]s, [[IMPATT diode]]s), and to produce light ([[light-emitting diode]]s).

In addition, most receiving sets had vacuum tubes for amplification that could easily have the thermionic diodes included in the tube (for example the [[12SQ7]] [[double diode triode]]), and vacuum-tube rectifiers and gas-filled rectifiers were capable of handling some high-voltage/high-current rectification tasks better than the semiconductor diodes (such as [[selenium rectifier]]s) that were available at that time.\n\n===Vacuum tube diodes===\n{{further|Vacuum tube#History and development}}\nIn 1873, [[Frederick Guthrie]] observed that a grounded, white hot metal ball brought in close proximity to an electroscope would discharge a positively charged electroscope, but not a negatively charged electroscope.<ref>Guthrie, Frederick (October 1873) [https://books.google.com/books?id=U08wAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA257 \"On a relation between heat and static electricity,\"] ''The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science'', 4th series, '''46''' :  257\u2013266.</ref><ref>[http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1928/richardson-lecture.pdf 1928 Nobel Lecture:] Owen W.

In 1919, the year [[tetrode]]s were invented, [[William Henry Eccles]] coined the term ''diode'' from the [[Greek and Latin roots|Greek roots]] ''di'' (from ''\u03b4\u03af''), meaning 'two', and ''ode'' (from ''\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2''), meaning 'path'. The word ''diode'', however, as well as ''[[triode]], [[tetrode]], [[pentode]], [[hexode]]'', were already in use as terms of [[Time-division multiplexing|multiplex]] [[telegraphy]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ifA2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA252#v=onepage&q&f=false W.

From top to bottom, the element names are: ''plate'', ''cathode'', and ''heater''.]]\n\nA thermionic diode is a [[thermionic valve|thermionic-valve]] device consisting of a sealed, evacuated glass or metal envelope containing two [[electrode]]s: a [[thermionic cathode|cathode]] and a [[plate electrode|plate]]. The cathode is either ''indirectly heated'' or ''directly heated''. If indirect heating is employed, a heater is included in the envelope.\n\nIn operation, the cathode is heated to red heat  (800\u20131000&nbsp;\u00b0C). A directly heated cathode is made of tungsten wire and is heated by current passed through it from an external voltage source. An indirectly heated cathode is heated by infrared radiation from a nearby heater that is formed of [[Nichrome]] wire and supplied with current provided by an external voltage source.\n\nThe operating temperature of the cathode causes it to release [[electron]]s into the vacuum, a process called [[thermionic emission]]. The cathode is coated with [[oxide]]s of [[alkaline earth metal]]s, such as [[barium]] and [[strontium]] [[oxide]]s. These have a low [[work function]], meaning that they more readily emit electrons than would the uncoated cathode.\n\nThe plate, not being heated, does not emit electrons; but is able to absorb them.\n\nThe alternating voltage to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the plate.  When the plate voltage is positive with respect to the cathode, the plate [[electrostatics|electrostatically]] attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate. When the plate voltage is negative with respect to the cathode, no electrons are emitted by the plate, so no current can pass from the plate to the cathode.\n\n==Semiconductor diodes==<!-- This section is linked from [[Boltzmann constant]] -->\n[[File:EFD108_Point_Contact_Germanium_Diode.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Close-up of an EFD108 germanium point-contact diode in DO7 glass package, showing the sharp metal wire (''cat whisker'') that forms the semiconductor junction.]]\n\n===Point-contact diodes===\nPoint-contact diodes were developed starting in the 1930s, out of the early [[crystal detector]] technology, and are now generally used in the 3 to 30 gigahertz range.<ref name=\"Scaff_Ohl_01\"/><ref name=\"SG\">[https://www.semigen.net/point-contact-diodes/ SemiGen Inc.]</ref><ref name=\"AS\">[http://www.advancedsemiconductor.com/pdf/diodes/SiliconPointContactMixer.pdf Advanced Semiconductor, Inc.]</ref><ref name=\"MB\">[https://massbaytech.com/point-contact-diodes/  Massachusetts Bay Technologies]</ref> Point-contact diodes use a small diameter metal wire in contact with a semiconductor crystal, and are of either ''non-welded'' contact type or ''welded contact'' type.

Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative [[charge carrier]]s (electrons), called an [[n-type semiconductor]], and a region on the other side that contains positive charge carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]]), called a [[p-type semiconductor]]. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the [[depletion region]] because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a [[p\u2013n junction]], is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher [[Electric potential|electrical potential]] is applied to the P side (the [[anode]]) than to the N side (the [[cathode]]), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical [[check valve]].\n\n====Schottky diode====\n{{main article|Schottky diode}}\nAnother type of junction diode, the [[Schottky diode]], is formed from a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]] rather than a p\u2013n junction, which reduces capacitance and increases switching speed.<ref name=\"skyworks_01\">[http://www.skyworksinc.com/uploads/documents/200826A.pdf Skyworks Solutions, Inc., ''Mixer and Detector Diodes'']</ref><ref>[https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/rf-microwave-a-millimeter-wave/1575-diodes-schottky Microsemi Corporation Schottky web page]</ref>\n\n===Current\u2013voltage characteristic===\n[[File:Diode current wiki.png|thumb|400px|I\u2013V (current vs. voltage) characteristics of a p\u2013n junction diode]]\n\nA semiconductor diode's behavior in a circuit is given by its [[current\u2013voltage characteristic]], or I\u2013V graph (see graph below). The shape of the curve is determined by the transport of charge carriers through the so-called ''[[depletion zone|depletion layer]]'' or ''[[depletion region]]'' that exists at the [[p\u2013n junction]] between differing semiconductors. When a p\u2013n junction is first created, conduction-band (mobile) electrons from the N-[[dopant|doped]] region diffuse into the P-[[dopant|doped]] region where there is a large population of holes (vacant places for electrons) with which the electrons \"recombine\". When a mobile electron recombines with a hole, both hole and electron vanish, leaving behind an immobile positively charged donor (dopant) on the N side and negatively charged acceptor (dopant) on the P side. The region around the p\u2013n junction becomes depleted of [[charge carrier]]s and thus behaves as an [[nonconductor|insulator]].\n\nHowever, the width of the depletion region (called the [[depletion width]]) cannot grow without limit. For each [[electron\u2013hole pair]] recombination made, a positively charged [[dopant]] ion is left behind in the N-doped region, and a negatively charged dopant ion is created in the P-doped region. As recombination proceeds and more ions are created, an increasing electric field develops through the depletion zone that acts to slow and then finally stop recombination. At this point, there is a \"built-in\" potential across the depletion zone.\n\n[[File:PN band.gif|thumb|600px|right|A [[PN junction]] diode in forward bias mode, the [[depletion width]] decreases. Both p and n junctions are doped at a 1e15/cm3 [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] level, leading to built-in potential of ~0.59V. Observe the different [[quasi Fermi level]]s for conduction band and valence band in n and p regions (red curves).]]\n\n====Reverse bias====\nIf an external voltage is placed across the diode with the same polarity as the built-in potential, the depletion zone continues to act as an insulator, preventing any significant electric current flow (unless [[electron\u2013hole pair]]s are actively being created in the junction by, for instance, light; see [[photodiode]]). This is called the ''[[reverse bias]]'' phenomenon.\n\n====Forward bias====\nHowever, if the polarity of the external voltage opposes the built-in potential, recombination can once again proceed, resulting in a substantial electric current through the p\u2013n junction (i.e. substantial numbers of electrons and holes recombine at the junction). For silicon diodes, the built-in potential is approximately 0.7 V (0.3 V for germanium and 0.2 V for Schottky). Thus, if an external voltage greater than and opposite to the built-in voltage is applied, a current will flow and the diode is said to be \"turned on\" as it has been given an external ''[[p\u2013n junction#Forward bias|forward bias]]''. The diode is commonly said to have a forward \"threshold\" voltage, above which it conducts and below which conduction stops. However, this is only an approximation as the forward characteristic is smooth (see I-V graph above).\n\nA diode's [[I\u2013V characteristic]] can be approximated by four regions of operation:\n\n# At very large reverse bias, beyond the [[peak inverse voltage]] or PIV, a process called reverse [[avalanche breakdown|breakdown]] occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., a large number of electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p\u2013n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The [[avalanche diode]] is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the [[Zener diode]], the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p\u2013n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is \"clamped\" to a known value (called the ''Zener voltage''), and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also, following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is reverse current for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking capability until the reverse current ceases.\n# For a bias less than the PIV, the reverse current is very small. For a normal P\u2013N rectifier diode, the reverse current through the device in the micro-ampere (\u03bcA) range is very low. However, this is temperature dependent, and at sufficiently high temperatures, a substantial amount of reverse current can be observed (mA or more). There is also a tiny surface leakage current caused by electrons simply going around the diode as though it were an imperfect insulator.\n# With a small forward bias, where only a small forward current is conducted, the current\u2013voltage curve is [[Exponential function|exponential]] in accordance with the ideal diode equation.  There is a definite forward voltage at which the diode starts to conduct significantly.  This is called the ''knee voltage'' or ''cut-in voltage'' and is equal to the [[p\u2013n junction#Properties of a p\u2013n junction|barrier potential]] of the p-n junction. This is a feature of the exponential curve, and appears sharper on a current scale more compressed than in the diagram shown here.\n# At larger forward currents the current-voltage curve starts to be dominated by the ohmic resistance of the bulk semiconductor.  The curve is no longer exponential, it is asymptotic to a straight line whose slope is the bulk resistance.  This region is particularly important for power diodes.  The diode can be modeled as an ideal diode in series with a fixed resistor.\n\nIn a small silicon diode operating at its rated currents, the voltage drop is about 0.6 to 0.7 [[volt]]s. The value is different for other diode types\u2014[[Schottky diode]]s can be rated as low as 0.2 V, germanium diodes 0.25 to 0.3 V, and red or blue [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) can have values of 1.4 V and 4.0 V respectively.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nAt higher currents the forward voltage drop of the diode increases. A drop of 1 V to 1.5 V is typical at full rated current for power diodes.\n\n===Shockley diode equation===\n{{main article|Shockley diode equation}}\nThe ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' or the ''diode law'' (named after the [[bipolar junction transistor]] co-inventor [[William Shockley|William Bradford Shockley]]) gives the I\u2013V characteristic of an ideal diode in either forward or reverse bias (or no bias). The following equation is called the ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' when ''n'', the ideality factor, is set equal to 1 :\n\n:<math>I=I_\\mathrm{S} \\left( e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}} - 1 \\right)</math>\n\nwhere\n:''I'' is the diode current,\n:''I''<sub>S</sub> is the reverse bias [[saturation current]] (or scale current),\n:''V''<sub>D</sub> is the voltage across the diode,\n:''V''<sub>T</sub> is the [[thermal voltage]], and\n:''n'' is the ''ideality factor'', also known as the ''quality factor'' or sometimes ''emission coefficient''. The ideality factor ''n'' typically varies from 1 to 2 (though can in some cases be higher), depending on the fabrication process and semiconductor material and is set equal to 1 for the case of an \"ideal\" diode (thus the n is sometimes omitted). The ideality factor was added to account for imperfect junctions as observed in real transistors. The factor mainly accounts for [[carrier recombination]] as the charge carriers cross the [[depletion region]].\n\nThe [[thermal voltage]] ''V''<sub>T</sub> is approximately 25.85 mV at 300 K, a temperature close to \"room temperature\" commonly used in device simulation software. At any temperature it is a known constant defined by:\n\n:<math>V_\\text{T} = \\frac{k T}{q} \\, ,</math>\n\nwhere ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], ''T'' is the absolute temperature of the p\u2013n junction, and ''q'' is the magnitude of charge of an [[electron]] (the [[elementary charge]]).\n\nThe reverse saturation current, ''I''<sub>S</sub>, is not constant for a given device, but varies with temperature; usually more significantly than ''V''<sub>T</sub>, so that ''V''<sub>D</sub> typically decreases as ''T'' increases.\n\nThe ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' or the ''diode law'' is derived with the assumption that the only processes giving rise to the current in the diode are drift (due to electrical field), diffusion, and thermal [[carrier generation and recombination|recombination\u2013generation]] (R\u2013G) (this equation is derived by setting n = 1 above). It also assumes that the R\u2013G current in the depletion region is insignificant. This means that the ''Shockley ideal diode equation'' does not account for the processes involved in reverse breakdown and photon-assisted R\u2013G. Additionally, it does not describe the \"leveling off\" of the I\u2013V curve at high forward bias due to internal resistance. Introducing the ideality factor, n, accounts for recombination and generation of carriers.\n\nUnder ''reverse bias'' voltages the exponential in the diode equation is negligible, and the current is a constant (negative) reverse current value of \u2212''I<sub>S</sub>''. The reverse ''breakdown region'' is not modeled by the Shockley diode equation.\n\nFor even rather small ''forward bias'' voltages the exponential is very large, since the thermal voltage is very small in comparison. The subtracted '1' in the diode equation is then negligible and the forward diode current can be approximated by\n\n:<math>I = I_\\text{S} e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}}</math>\n\nThe use of the diode equation in circuit problems is illustrated in the article on [[diode modelling#Shockley diode model|diode modeling]].\n\n===Small-signal behavior===\nAt forward voltages less than the saturation voltage, the voltage versus current characteristic curve of most diodes is not a straight line. The current can be approximated by <math>I = I_\\text{S} e^\\frac{V_\\text{D}}{n V_\\text{T}}</math> as mentioned in the previous section.\n\nIn detector and mixer applications, the current can be estimated by a Taylor's series.<ref name=\"Giacoletto_1977\">{{cite book |author-first=Lawrence Joseph |author-last=Giacoletto |title=Electronics Designers' Handbook |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |date=1977 |page=24\u2013138}}</ref> The odd terms can be omitted because they produce frequency components that are outside the pass band of the mixer or detector.  Even terms beyond the second derivative usually need not be included because they are small compared to the second order term.<ref name=\"Giacoletto_1977\" /> The desired current component is approximately proportional to the square of the input voltage, so the response is called ''[[square-law detector|square law]]'' in this region.<ref name=\"HC\" />{{rp|p. 3}}\n\n===Reverse-recovery effect===\nFollowing the end of forward conduction in a p\u2013n type diode, a reverse current can flow for a short time. The device does not attain its blocking capability until the mobile charge in the junction is depleted.\n\nThe effect can be significant when switching large currents very quickly.<ref>[http://ecee.colorado.edu/~ecen5817/hw/hw1/Diode%20reverse%20recovery%20in%20a%20boost%20converter.pdf Diode reverse recovery in a boost converter].

During this recovery time, the diode can actually conduct in the reverse direction. This might give rise to a large constant current in the reverse direction for a short time while the diode is reverse biased. The magnitude of such a reverse current is determined by the operating circuit (i.e., the series resistance) and the diode is said to be in the storage-phase.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/LED.2014.2353301| title = Gate-Controlled Reverse Recovery for Characterization of LDMOS Body Diode| journal = IEEE Electron Device Letters| volume = 35| issue = 11| page = 1079| year = 2014| last1 = Elhami Khorasani | first1 = A. | last2 = Griswold | first2 = M. | last3 = Alford | first3 = T.

ECEN5797. ecee.colorado.edu</ref> However, when the [[slew rate]] of the current is not so severe (e.g. Line frequency) the effect can be safely ignored. For most applications, the effect is also negligible for [[Schottky diode]]s.\n\nThe reverse current ceases abruptly when the stored charge is depleted; this abrupt stop is exploited in [[step recovery diode]]s for generation of extremely short pulses.\n\n===Types of semiconductor diode===\n\nNormal (p\u2013n) diodes, which operate as described above, are usually made of doped [[silicon]] or [[germanium]]. Before the development of silicon power rectifier diodes, [[cuprous oxide]] and later [[selenium]] was used. Their low efficiency required a much higher forward voltage to be applied (typically 1.4 to 1.7&nbsp;V per \"cell\", with multiple cells stacked so as to increase the peak inverse voltage rating for application in high voltage rectifiers), and required a large heat sink (often an extension of the diode's metal [[Substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]]), much larger than the later silicon diode of the same current ratings would require. The vast majority of all diodes are the p\u2013n diodes found in [[CMOS]] [[integrated circuits]]{{CN|date=June 2019}}, which include two diodes per pin and many other internal diodes.\n\n;[[Avalanche diode]]s\n:These are diodes that conduct in the reverse direction when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically very similar to Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the ''avalanche effect''. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p\u2013n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2&nbsp;V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on the way through the channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.\n;[[Constant current diode]]s\n:These are actually [[JFET]]s<ref>[http://digikey.com/Web%20Export/Supplier%20Content/Vishay_8026/PDF/Vishay_CurrentRegulatorDiodes.pdf Current regulator diodes].

Schottky diodes are [[majority carrier]] devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes\u2014so they have a faster reverse recovery than p\u2013n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p\u2013n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as [[switched-mode power supply]], [[Frequency mixer|mixers]], and [[Detector (radio)|detectors]].\n;Super barrier diodes\n:Super barrier diodes are rectifier diodes that incorporate the low forward voltage drop of the Schottky diode with the surge-handling capability and low reverse leakage current of a normal p\u2013n junction diode.\n;[[Gold]]-doped diodes\n:As a dopant, gold (or [[platinum]]) acts as recombination centers, which helps a fast recombination of minority carriers. This allows the diode to operate at signal frequencies, at the expense of a higher forward voltage drop. Gold-doped diodes are faster than other p\u2013n diodes (but not as fast as Schottky diodes). They also have less reverse-current leakage than Schottky diodes (but not as good as other p\u2013n diodes).<ref>[http://www.ixyspower.com/images/technical_support/Application%20Notes%20By%20Topic/FREDs,%20Schottky%20and%20GaAS%20Diodes/IXAN0044.pdf Fast Recovery Epitaxial Diodes (FRED) Characteristics \u2013 Applications \u2013 Examples].

These are important in PLL ([[phase-locked loop]]) and FLL ([[frequency-locked loop]]) circuits, allowing tuning circuits, such as those in television receivers, to lock quickly on to the frequency. They also enabled tunable oscillators in early discrete tuning of radios, where a cheap and stable, but fixed-frequency, crystal oscillator provided the reference frequency for a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]].\n;[[Zener diode]]s\n:These can be made to conduct in reverse bias (backward), and are correctly termed reverse breakdown diodes. This effect, called [[Zener breakdown]], occurs at a precisely defined voltage, allowing the diode to be used as a precision voltage reference. The term Zener diode is colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly speaking Zener diodes have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst avalanche diodes are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In practical voltage reference circuits, Zener and switching diodes are connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero. Some devices labeled as high-voltage Zener diodes are actually avalanche diodes (see above). Two (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package, constitute a transient absorber (or [[Transorb]], a registered trademark).\n\nOther uses for semiconductor diodes include the sensing of temperature, and computing analog [[logarithm]]s (see [[Operational amplifier applications#Logarithmic output]]).\n\n===Graphic symbols===\n{{Main article|Electronic symbol}}\n\nThe symbol used to represent a particular type of diode in a [[circuit diagram]] conveys the general electrical function to the reader.  There are alternative symbols for some types of diodes, though the differences are minor. The triangle in the symbols points to the forward direction, i.e. in the direction of [[conventional current]] flow.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Diode symbol.svg|Diode\nFile:LED symbol.svg|[[Light-emitting diode]] (LED)\nFile:Photodiode symbol.svg|[[w:Photodiode|Photodiode]]\nFile:Schottky diode symbol.svg|[[w:Schottky diode|Schottky diode]]\nFile:Transient voltage suppression diode symbol.svg|[[Transient-voltage-suppression diode]] (TVS)\nFile:Tunnel diode symbol.svg|[[Tunnel diode]]\nFile:Varicap symbol.svg|[[w:Varicap|Varicap]]\nFile:Zener diode symbol.svg|[[Zener diode]]\nFile:Diode pinout en fr.svg|Typical diode packages in same alignment as diode symbol.

Most diodes have a 1-prefix designation (e.g., 1N4003). Among the most popular in this series were: 1N34A/1N270 (germanium signal), 1N914/[[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] (silicon signal), [[1N400x general-purpose diodes|1N400x]] (silicon 1A power rectifier), and [[1N58xx schottky diodes|1N580x]] (silicon 3A power rectifier).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jedec.org/Home/about_jedec.cfm |title=About JEDEC |publisher=Jedec.org |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.elektroda.net/introduction-dates-of-common-transistors-and-diodes-t94332.html |title=Introduction dates of common transistors and diodes? |publisher=EDAboard.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011133032/http://news.elektroda.net/introduction-dates-of-common-transistors-and-diodes-t94332.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://semiconductormuseum.com/Museum_Index.htm |title=Transistor Museum Construction Projects Point Contact Germanium Western Electric Vintage Historic Semiconductors Photos Alloy Junction Oral History |publisher=Semiconductormuseum.com |author=I.D.E.A |accessdate=2008-09-22}}</ref>\n\n====JIS====\nThe [[JIS semiconductor designation]] system has all semiconductor diode designations starting with \"1S\".\n\n====Pro Electron====\nThe European [[Pro Electron]] coding system for [[active component]]s was introduced in 1966 and comprises two letters followed by the part code. The first letter represents the semiconductor material used for the component (A = germanium and B = silicon) and the second letter represents the general function of the part (for diodes, A = low-power/signal, B = variable capacitance, X = multiplier, Y = rectifier and Z = voltage reference); for example:\n* AA-series germanium low-power/signal diodes (e.g., AA119)\n* BA-series silicon low-power/signal diodes (e.g., BAT18 silicon RF switching diode)\n* BY-series silicon rectifier diodes (e.g., BY127 1250V, 1A rectifier diode)\n* BZ-series silicon Zener diodes (e.g., BZY88C4V7 4.7V Zener diode)\n\nOther common numbering / coding systems (generally manufacturer-driven) include:\n* GD-series germanium diodes (e.g., GD9){{spaced ndash}}this is a very old coding system\n* OA-series germanium diodes (e.g., OA47){{spaced ndash}}a [[Mullard\u2013Philips tube designation|coding sequence]] developed by [[Mullard]], a UK company\n\nAs well as these common codes, many manufacturers or organisations have their own systems too{{spaced ndash}}for example:\n* HP diode 1901-0044 = JEDEC 1N4148\n* UK military diode CV448 = Mullard type OA81 = [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] type GEX23\n\n==Related devices==\n* [[Rectifier]]\n* [[Transistor]]\n* [[Thyristor]] or silicon controlled rectifier (SCR)\n* [[TRIAC]]\n* [[DIAC]]\n* [[Varistor]]\nIn optics, an equivalent device for the diode but with laser light would be the [[Optical isolator]], also known as an Optical Diode{{CN|date=June 2019}}, that allows light to only pass in one direction. It uses a [[Faraday rotator]] as the main component.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Radio demodulation===\n[[File:Simple envelope detector.svg|thumb|300x300px|A simple [[envelope detector|envelope demodulator]] circuit.]]\nThe first use for the diode was the demodulation of [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the [[radio]] article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose [[amplitude]] or envelope is proportional to the original audio signal. The diode [[rectifier|rectifies]] the AM radio frequency signal, leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave. The audio is then extracted from the rectified carrier wave using a simple [[electronic filter|filter]] and fed into an audio amplifier or [[transducer]], which generates sound waves.\n\nIn microwave and millimeter wave technology, beginning in the 1930s, researchers improved and miniaturized the crystal detector. [[Diode#Point-contact diodes|Point contact diodes]] (''crystal diodes'') and [[Diode#Junction diodes|Schottky diodes]] are used in radar, microwave and millimeter wave detectors.<ref name=\"skyworks_01\"/>\n\n===Power conversion===\n{{Main article|Rectifier}}\n[[File:ACtoDCpowersupply.png|250px|thumb|Schematic of basic ac-to-dc power supply]]\n\n[[Rectifier]]s are constructed from diodes, where they are used to convert [[alternating current]] (AC) electricity into [[direct current]] (DC). Automotive [[alternator (auto)|alternators]] are a common example, where the diode, which rectifies the AC into DC, provides better performance than the [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] or earlier, [[electrical generator|dynamo]]. Similarly, diodes are also used in ''[[Cockcroft-Walton generator|Cockcroft\u2013Walton]] [[voltage multiplier]]s'' to convert ac into higher ac voltages.\n\n===Over-voltage protection===\nDiodes are frequently used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage rises above the normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in ([[stepper motor]] and [[H-bridge]]) [[motor controller]] and [[relay]] circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging [[voltage spike]]s that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a [[flyback diode]]). Many [[integrated circuits]] also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive [[transistors]]. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see [[#Types of semiconductor diode|Diode types]] above).\n\n===Logic gates===\nDiodes can be combined with other components to construct [[logical conjunction|AND]] and [[logical disjunction|OR]] [[logic gate]]s. This is referred to as [[diode logic]].\n\n===Ionizing radiation detectors===\nIn addition to light, mentioned above, [[semiconductor]] diodes are sensitive to more [[energy|energetic]] radiation. In [[electronics]], [[cosmic ray]]s and other sources of ionizing radiation cause [[noise]] [[pulse]]s and single and multiple bit errors.\nThis effect is sometimes exploited by [[particle detector]]s to detect radiation. A single particle of radiation, with thousands or millions of [[electron volt]]s of energy, generates many charge carrier pairs, as its energy is deposited in the semiconductor material. If the depletion layer is large enough to catch the whole shower or to stop a heavy particle, a fairly accurate measurement of the particle's energy can be made, simply by measuring the charge conducted and without the complexity of a magnetic spectrometer, etc.\nThese semiconductor radiation detectors need efficient and uniform charge collection and low leakage current. They are often cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]]. For longer-range (about a centimetre) particles, they need a very large depletion depth and large area. For short-range particles, they need any contact or un-depleted semiconductor on at least one surface to be very thin. The back-bias voltages are near breakdown (around a thousand volts per centimetre). Germanium and silicon are common materials. Some of these detectors sense position as well as energy.\nThey have a finite life, especially when detecting heavy particles, because of radiation damage. Silicon and germanium are quite different in their ability to convert [[gamma ray]]s to electron showers.\n\n[[Semiconductor detector]]s for high-energy particles are used in large numbers. Because of energy loss fluctuations, accurate measurement of the energy deposited is of less use.\n\n===Temperature measurements===\nA diode can be used as a [[temperature]] measuring device, since the forward voltage drop across the diode depends on temperature, as in a [[silicon bandgap temperature sensor]]. From the Shockley ideal diode equation given above, it might ''appear'' that the voltage has a ''positive'' temperature coefficient (at a constant current), but usually the variation of the [[Saturation current|reverse saturation current]] term is more significant than the variation in the thermal voltage term. Most diodes therefore have a ''negative'' temperature coefficient, typically \u22122 mV/\u02daC for silicon diodes. The temperature coefficient is approximately constant for temperatures above about 20 [[kelvin]]. Some graphs are given for 1N400x series,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cliftonlaboratories.com/1n400x_diode_family_forward_voltage.htm |title=1N400x Diode Family Forward Voltage |website=cliftonlaboratories.com |access-date=2013-12-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524153406/http://www.cliftonlaboratories.com/1n400x_diode_family_forward_voltage.htm |archivedate=2013-05-24}}</ref> and CY7 cryogenic temperature sensor.<ref>[http://www.omega.com/Temperature/pdf/CY7.pdf Cryogenic Temperature Sensors]. omega.com</ref>\n\n===Current steering===\nDiodes will prevent currents in unintended directions. To supply power to an electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. An [[uninterruptible power supply]] may use diodes in this way to ensure that current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.\n\nDiodes are also used in [[electronic keyboards|electronic musical keyboards]]. To reduce the amount of wiring needed in electronic musical keyboards, these instruments often use [[keyboard matrix circuit]]s. The keyboard controller scans the rows and columns to determine which note the player has pressed. The problem with matrix circuits is that, when several notes are pressed at once, the current can flow backwards through the circuit and trigger \"[[Keyboard (computing)#Control processor|phantom keys]]\" that cause \"ghost\" notes to play. To avoid triggering unwanted notes, most keyboard matrix circuits have diodes soldered with the switch under each key of the [[musical keyboard]]. The same principle is also used for the switch matrix in solid-state [[pinball machine]]s.\n\n===Waveform clipper===\n{{main article|Clipper (electronics)}}\nDiodes can be used to limit the positive or negative excursion of a signal to a prescribed voltage.\n\n===Clamper===\n{{main article|Clamper (electronics)}}\n[[File:DiodeClamp.png|150px|thumb|This simple diode clamp will clamp the negative peaks of the incoming waveform to the common rail voltage]]\nA diode [[Clamper (electronics)|clamp circuit]] can take a periodic alternating current signal that oscillates between positive and negative values, and vertically displace it such that either the positive, or the negative peaks occur at a prescribed level. The clamper does not restrict the peak-to-peak excursion of the signal, it moves the whole signal up or down so as to place the peaks at the reference level.\n\n==Abbreviations==\nDiodes are usually referred to as ''D'' for diode on [[printed circuit board|PCBs]]. Sometimes the abbreviation ''CR'' for ''crystal rectifier'' is used.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Ambrose Fleming|year=1919|url=https://archive.org/details/principleselect01flemgoog|title=The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy and Telephony|place=London|publisher=Longmans, Green|page=[https://archive.org/details/principleselect01flemgoog/page/n588 550]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n* [[Active rectification]]\n* [[Diode modelling]]\n* [[Lambda diode]]\n* [[p\u2013n junction]]\n* [[Small-signal model]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Periodicals\n* ''Solid-State Diodes''; Electronics World; pp. 37\u201360; July 1966. <small>[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Electronics-World/60s/1966/Electronics-World-1966-07.pdf (archive)]</small>\n\n;Books\n* ''Rectifier Applications Manual''; 2nd Ed; William Roehr; ON Semiconductor; 270 pages; 2001. <small>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090407093106/http://www.ieeta.pt/~alex/docs/ApplicationNotes/Rectifier%20Applications%20Handbook.pdf (archive)]</small>\n* ''Silicon Rectifier Handbook''; 1st Ed; Bob Dale; Motorola; 213 pages; 1966. <small>[https://archive.org/details/RectifiersSCRsTriacs-MotorolaSiliconRectifierHandbook1966OCR/ (archive)]</small>\n* ''Electronic Rectification''; F.G.

SCANFAR was intended to be better at tracking multiple airborne targets than conventional rotating antenna radars. SCANFAR consisted of two radars, the AN/SPS-32 and the AN/SPS-33. The AN/SPS-32 was a long-range air search and target acquisition radar developed by Hughes for the U.S. Navy. The AN/SPS-32 operated together with the AN/SPS-33, which was the square array used for 3D tracking, into one system. It was installed on only two vessels, ''Enterprise'' and the cruiser {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|6}}, placing a massive power drain on the ship's electric system.{{Citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe technology of the AN/SPS-32 was based on vacuum tubes and the system required constant repairs.

While they are considered to be an early form of \"phased array\" radar, it would take the later technology of the Aegis phased array AN/SPY-1 with its electronically controlled beam steering to make phased array radars both reliable and practical for the USN.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The dome above the SCANFAR contained the unique electronic warfare suite, the Andrew Alford AA-8200 dipole antennas (which never acquired a military designation). The system consisted of six rows of antennae encircling the dome.

[[Henry Fonda]] played the role of Frank Beardsley, a U.S. Navy warrant officer attached to the ship.\n\n''Enterprise'' was a principal setting of the popular movie ''[[Top Gun]]'' released in 1986. Director [[Tony Scott]] filmed actual flight operations aboard ship and incorporated them into the film's plot. Some interior scenes taking place aboard ''Enterprise'' were actually filmed on {{USS|Ranger|CV-61}}.\n\nIn 1986, ''Enterprise'' was a setting of scenes in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''. The ship was unavailable for filming, so scenes depicting ''Enterprise'' were again filmed aboard USS ''[[USS Ranger (CV-61)|Ranger]]''.<ref>Okuda, Denise & Michael (1999). ''The Star Trek Encyclopedia'', p. 90. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-53609-5}}.</ref> More important for ''[[Star Trek]]'' lore, the first nuclear aircraft carrier was in position to inspire naming of Starship {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}} The original premise by [[Gene Roddenberry]] dated March 1964 describes a starship USS ''Yorktown''. As USS ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65) was then one of the newest and most celebrated ships of the US Navy, occupying a similar status as the fictional Starship ''Enterprise'', the aircraft carrier may have inspired a name change, though Roddenberry himself had already dispelled that notion in a 1973 radio interview, reaffirming that he had named his fictional starship after its illustrious World War 2 namesake.<ref>Scott Arthur's interview with Gene Roddenberry (1973) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k77gMo8ifh4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/oral-history-star-trek-180958779/|title=An Oral History of \"Star Trek\"|last=Gross|first=Edward|last2=Altman|first2=Mark A.|year=2016|website=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref>.

''The Making of Star Trek'', p. 167. New York, Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|978-0-345-24691-2}}.</ref> Many of the subsequent ''Star Trek'' television shows and movies have been set aboard a ship named ''Enterprise'', and the starship {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|6}} of the show ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' has a relief of five Enterprise starship models and a model of CVN-65 on the wall of its observation lounge. Futhermore, in the subsequent prequel series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', a quartet of portraits depicting vessels named ''Enterprise'' adorns the wall of Captain [[Jonathan Archer]]'s ready room, the second of which is the CVN-65. A similar display is seen on the recreation deck of the ''Enterprise'' in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. The [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'' (OV-101)]], originally slated to be named ''Constitution'', was renamed after the Starship ''Enterprise'' following a write-in campaign to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]]. In 1995, ''Enterprise'' (covered as the USS ''Seahawk'') was also used to film scenes for the pilot episodes of the TV series \"[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerial warfare]]\n* [[Air supremacy]]\n* [[Carrier strike group]]\n* [[Carrier battle group]]\n* [[List of aircraft carriers]]\n* [[List of aircraft carriers of the United States Navy]]\n*[[List of ships of the United States Navy named Enterprise|List of ships of the United States Navy named ''Enterprise'']]\n* [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov]]\n* [[U.S. Carrier Group tactics]]\n* [[Carrier Strike Group Twelve]]\n* [[List of world's longest ships]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Citation | last = Cracknell | first = W.

SCANFAR was intended to be better at tracking multiple airborne targets than conventional rotating antenna radars. SCANFAR consisted of two radars, the AN/SPS-32 and the AN/SPS-33. The AN/SPS-32 was a long-range air search and target acquisition radar developed by Hughes for the U.S. Navy. The AN/SPS-32 operated together with the AN/SPS-33, which was the square array used for 3D tracking, into one system.

As USS ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65) was then one of the newest and most celebrated ships of the US Navy, occupying a similar status as the fictional Starship ''Enterprise'', the aircraft carrier may have inspired a name change, though Roddenberry himself had already dispelled that notion in a 1973 radio interview, reaffirming that he had named his fictional starship after its illustrious World War 2 namesake.<ref>Scott Arthur's interview with Gene Roddenberry (1973) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k77gMo8ifh4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/oral-history-star-trek-180958779/|title=An Oral History of \"Star Trek\"|last=Gross|first=Edward|last2=Altman|first2=Mark A.|year=2016|website=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref>.

Futhermore, in the subsequent prequel series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', a quartet of portraits depicting vessels named ''Enterprise'' adorns the wall of Captain [[Jonathan Archer]]'s ready room, the second of which is the CVN-65. A similar display is seen on the recreation deck of the ''Enterprise'' in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. The [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'' (OV-101)]], originally slated to be named ''Constitution'', was renamed after the Starship ''Enterprise'' following a write-in campaign to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]].
