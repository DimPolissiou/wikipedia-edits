Upon Brian's return, Peter makes too much of an effort to welcome him back into the family. Meanwhile, [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] makes friends with a girl named Sarah at her school, unaware that she is about to be offered a place in the Lesbian Alliance Club. After speaking with [[Neil Goldman (Family Guy)|Neil Goldman]], she realizes that she is now considered a [[lesbian]] by the group and prepares to drop out; however, when she realizes the effect being a member may have on her social status (finding herself more popular as a lesbian), she pretends to be one.\n\nMeanwhile, Brian becomes [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] after the accident, but after speaking with [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]], he begins to perform with him, changing his outlook on life to that of positivity. After being told of Brian's new lifestyle, the family is impressed and encourage him to continue. However, when he is invited by Sinatra to perform with him again, their duo is interrupted by [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], who joins the performance. Meanwhile, Meg tells the family that she is now a lesbian, but is mocked by [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], knowing that she is not being honest. Even as they do so, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] exit Meg's closet, having attempted to film some lesbian interaction. Meanwhile, Brian and Stewie continue their performances across Quahog with Sinatra. In a drunken condition following a performance, Brian loses Stewie, which results in Stewie's ear being bitten off by a deer. Peter says that Brian will stop performing with Sinatra immediately and threatens to telephone Sinatra's \"mother\" [[Mia Farrow]]. Angry at Peter's bossiness, Brian bites his arm, which leaves Peter afraid of him; the next day, Brian tries to reconcile with Peter, but Peter, still scared, only pelts him with furniture, dishes and Stewie, angering Brian who storms off in a rage.\n\nBrian, regretful of biting Peter, quits performing with Stewie and Sinatra, resorting to drinking wine from a gutter. However, Brian regains his confidence when Stewie finds him, where he tells Brian that there are things in life which are beyond his control, telling him that even though they aren't in his control, they do matter, contrary to Brian's common beliefs. Meanwhile, Meg prepares to tell Sarah that she is not a lesbian and that she only pretended to be in order to make friends; however, Sarah is in her underwear, believing Meg has come to her house to have [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with her. They are both interrupted by Quagmire and his [[American Movie|production team]] filming their antics. The episode ends with Stewie, Brian and Frank Sinatra Jr. singing once more at a club until Mia Farrow (called in by Peter) intervenes, reprimanding Frank for \"hanging out 'till all hours with a baby and a dog\", and spanks him in front of the audience, much to his chagrin.<ref name=\"Episode\">{{cite video|date=2005|title=Plot synopsis information for the episode \"Brian Sings and Swings\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mike Rowe by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Michael Rowe wrote the episode.]]\nScripts and other production materials were altered and modified extensively.

The cutaway shows a trailer with Stewie and the Rock. The narrator ([[Don LaFontaine]]) speculates about the Rock's race and then that of actress [[Jessica Alba]]. When Meg says that she is a super mega-lesbian, Sarah tells her that she will fit in with the other super-mega-lesbians, who sing \"[[Elvira (song)|Elvira]]\" by the [[Oak Ridge Boys]], much to Meg's excitement. In a cutaway mentioned by Stewie, [[Thomas Edison]] hoards [[electricity]], as he fights with [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. Edison talks about how much more fortunate he is than Bell, since he has hoarded electricity. He says that he watches ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', and plays \"[[Foxy Lady]]\" by [[Jimi Hendrix]]. When Brian says \"you gotta live life and live it hard\", Stewie responds by calling it \"the [[Chris Farley]] method\", a reference to the late comedian. The scene where Meg is talking to a friend about kissing is interrupted by Quagmire coming out of the closet with electric equipment, commenting that is \"just awful\". Than a filmmaker he refers to as Mark and his friend, who Mark refers to as Mike, comes out of the closet which he asks their opinion on it. After Mark says he doesn't know, he asks Mike his opinion, where he proceeds to mumble. This is a reference to the cult 1999 documentary ''[[American Movie]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n''Family Guy'' and this episode are highly regarded in the music community of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], due to the show featuring many music-inspired scenes and for the use of its own [[orchestra]].<ref name=\"Sinatra\"/> Ryan J.

After speaking with [[Neil Goldman (Family Guy)|Neil Goldman]], she realizes that she is now considered a [[lesbian]] by the group and prepares to drop out; however, when she realizes the effect being a member may have on her social status (finding herself more popular as a lesbian), she pretends to be one.\n\nMeanwhile, Brian becomes [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] after the accident, but after speaking with [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]], he begins to perform with him, changing his outlook on life to that of positivity. After being told of Brian's new lifestyle, the family is impressed and encourage him to continue. However, when he is invited by Sinatra to perform with him again, their duo is interrupted by [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], who joins the performance. Meanwhile, Meg tells the family that she is now a lesbian, but is mocked by [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], knowing that she is not being honest. Even as they do so, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] exit Meg's closet, having attempted to film some lesbian interaction. Meanwhile, Brian and Stewie continue their performances across Quahog with Sinatra. In a drunken condition following a performance, Brian loses Stewie, which results in Stewie's ear being bitten off by a deer. Peter says that Brian will stop performing with Sinatra immediately and threatens to telephone Sinatra's \"mother\" [[Mia Farrow]]. Angry at Peter's bossiness, Brian bites his arm, which leaves Peter afraid of him; the next day, Brian tries to reconcile with Peter, but Peter, still scared, only pelts him with furniture, dishes and Stewie, angering Brian who storms off in a rage.\n\nBrian, regretful of biting Peter, quits performing with Stewie and Sinatra, resorting to drinking wine from a gutter. However, Brian regains his confidence when Stewie finds him, where he tells Brian that there are things in life which are beyond his control, telling him that even though they aren't in his control, they do matter, contrary to Brian's common beliefs. Meanwhile, Meg prepares to tell Sarah that she is not a lesbian and that she only pretended to be in order to make friends; however, Sarah is in her underwear, believing Meg has come to her house to have [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with her. They are both interrupted by Quagmire and his [[American Movie|production team]] filming their antics. The episode ends with Stewie, Brian and Frank Sinatra Jr. singing once more at a club until Mia Farrow (called in by Peter) intervenes, reprimanding Frank for \"hanging out 'till all hours with a baby and a dog\", and spanks him in front of the audience, much to his chagrin.<ref name=\"Episode\">{{cite video|date=2005|title=Plot synopsis information for the episode \"Brian Sings and Swings\"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mike Rowe by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Michael Rowe wrote the episode.]]\nScripts and other production materials were altered and modified extensively.

The cutaway shows a trailer with Stewie and the Rock. The narrator ([[Don LaFontaine]]) speculates about the Rock's race and then that of actress [[Jessica Alba]]. When Meg says that she is a super mega-lesbian, Sarah tells her that she will fit in with the other super-mega-lesbians, who sing \"[[Elvira (song)|Elvira]]\" by the [[Oak Ridge Boys]], much to Meg's excitement. In a cutaway mentioned by Stewie, [[Thomas Edison]] hoards [[electricity]], as he fights with [[Alexander Graham Bell]]. Edison talks about how much more fortunate he is than Bell, since he has hoarded electricity. He says that he watches ''[[The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', and plays \"[[Foxy Lady]]\" by [[Jimi Hendrix]]. When Brian says \"you gotta live life and live it hard\", Stewie responds by calling it \"the [[Chris Farley]] method\", a reference to the late comedian. The scene where Meg is talking to a friend about kissing is interrupted by Quagmire coming out of the closet with electric equipment, commenting that is \"just awful\". Than a filmmaker he refers to as Mark and his friend, who Mark refers to as Mike, comes out of the closet which he asks their opinion on it. After Mark says he doesn't know, he asks Mike his opinion, where he proceeds to mumble. This is a reference to the cult 1999 documentary ''[[American Movie]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n''Family Guy'' and this episode are highly regarded in the music community of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], due to the show featuring many music-inspired scenes and for the use of its own [[orchestra]].<ref name=\"Sinatra\"/> Ryan J.
