In contrast to the usual myth, he is portrayed in a sympathetic light and seems to be intended to serve (similarly to the Kami, Togashi in the [[Legend of the Five Rings]] RPG by the same publishers) as a source of adventure hooks and occasionally a [[Donor (fairy tale)]] to whom it is perilous in the extreme to apply.\n\nThe [[Morevna Project]], an [[open-source model|open-source]], [[Free culture movement|free culture]] film project, is currently{{when|date=July 2018}} working on an anime-style adaptation of this story set in a [[cyberpunk]] science-fiction future<ref>Morevna Project, [https://morevnaproject.org/2015/01/14/koschei-the-deathless-artwork-1/]</ref>\n\nCombined with [[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Firebird and the Gray Wolf]] in [[Mercedes Lackey]]'s ''Firebird'', wherein Ilya Ivanovich (son of self-styled Tsar Ivan), encounters Koschei the Deathless and, with the assistance of the titular Firebird, manages to slay him and free the maidens that the sorcerer had kept trapped.\n\n==See also== <!-- Relevance not established -->\n{{Portal|Children's literature}}\n*[[Bash Chelik]]\n*[[Bluebeard]]\n*[[The Fair Fiorita]]\n*[[The Flower Queen's Daughter]]\n*[[The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples]]\n*[[The Three Enchanted Princes]]\n*[[The Young King Of Easaidh Ruadh]]\n*[[Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf]]\n*[[What Came of Picking Flowers]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Death Of Koschei The Deathless}}\n[[Category:Russian folk fairy tale|Death Of Koschei the Deathless]]\n[[Category:Fiction about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:Baba Yaga]]\n[[ru:\u041c\u0430\u0440\u044c\u044f \u041c\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Koschei_the_Deathless"}

The product basis choice has proven very effective during trials and in the field on various types of terrain.\n\nThe max. speed on paved roads is 120\u2013140&nbsp;km/h and reduced to 80&nbsp;km/h on terrain. Acceleration from 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h is achieved in 22 seconds. The cruising range at 60&nbsp;km/h is 500&nbsp;km. Each unit has at least one 20&nbsp;L fuel can in reserve. The vehicle can operate at temperatures ranging from -32&nbsp;\u00b0C to +55&nbsp;\u00b0C and remains unaffected by heavy meteorological conditions. The wheels consist of Hutchinson 12r20 mpt80 type tyres which have a run flat capability of 50&nbsp;km at 50&nbsp;km/h.\n\nThe Didgori has 400mm ground clearance and is able to climb slopes at a 60% gradient and drive sideways along a slope at a 40% gradient. The vehicle base version is not amphibious - although such a variant is an option, but can move in up to 1m deep water.<ref>http://delta.gov.ge/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Didgori_STC_Delta_Production-Catalogue_01.01.2015.pdf</ref><ref>http://delta.gov.ge/en/product/didgori/</ref>\n\n===Saudi Arabia trials===\nIn August 27, 2014 Georgia participated with a MedEvac prototype in a tender for Armoured Personnel Carriers hosted by the Ministry of Defence of Saudi Arabia. The tests were carried out mostly in the Arabian desert but also urban areas and included movement on different altitudes - mountains, various types of terrain and gradients, weather conditions, under extreme stress and maximum weight burden at top speed. The trials culminated in a 40&nbsp;km simulated fully loaded evacuation at max.speed. \n\nThe Didgori successfully passed every single test with very good results and made it to the finals alongside the US [[Lenco BearCat]] after eliminating four other competing vehicles, including the US [[Oshkosh M-ATV]]. Even though the Didgori also showed better results than its U.S. finalist counterpart in every single aspect, the winner wasn't announced earlier than January 2016, after months of consulting and evaluation. The Saudi Arabia tender was a very important event to test the vehicle's capabilities in extreme conditions, particularly in a desert environment. \n\nDELTA consequently made necessary adjustments and changes for both its export and home products.<ref>http://agenda.ge/news/51342/eng</ref><ref>http://cbw.ge/georgia/georgian-weaponry-gains-popularity-in-military-industry/</ref><ref>http://razm.info/ru/7879</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Didgori-1 operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Didgori Medevac operators in blue]]\n\n<!-- READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

Scholars have different opinions about whether sleeping first is absolutely required or not. In [[Saudi Arabia]] during the fasting month of [[Ramadan]], there are many people who leave the [[Tarawih]] prayers in the main [[masjid]] in a hurry so that they can go home, go to sleep, and then wake up to perform their Tahajjud prayers in the early morning. Others simply stay in the mosque and perform these optional prayers before going home.\n\nThe time for the Tahajjud prayers falls between the prayer times of the [[isha'a]] prayers and the [[fajr]] prayers. It is also recommended that the prayers be done in the last third of the night. Muslims believe that the reward is greater for those who do this prayer at a later time.

This prayer can be done alone, in a group, at home, or in a mosque or other public meeting area it does not matter. Typically, Muslims gather together and perform tarawih as a group, often amongst extended family members in one large house. Others may meet in their local [[mosque]], a meeting hall, or even in an outdoor field. Depending on the country, the tarawih prayers might be done in mosque by men only, or by a mixture of men and women (although physically separated from each other). The number of raka'ah of Tarawih salah is Twenty. Muhammad ( \u0633\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0644\u0645 ) was afraid that if he continued to perform the prayers in the mosque, then his followers might come to think that they were compulsory and not optional.\n\nAfter Muhammad (\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u0627\u0645), Taraweeh was Still prayed by 20 rakahs. The issue that people make that he prayed 8 is about Tahajjud ( salah ). In the main mosque in Mecca, the [[Imam]] (prayer leader) performs twenty raka'ah and then you pray your isha [[witr]] prayers. The total number of people joining the [[tarawih]] prayers in the main mosque in Mecca may reach 3-4 million. They fill up all levels inside the [[mosque]], the flat roof, outside in the courtyard, some nearby streets (which are closed off), and on occasions even using up space in the lobbies of some nearby hotels.\n\nIt is also customary for the Imam in any mosque to recite the entire contents of the [[Qur'an]] during the fasting month by reading approximately one section per day. This practice of reading the Qur'an completely is known as ''khatm'' (complete recitation).\n\n==Istisqa==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nSalat ul istasqa ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u062a\u0633\u0642\u0627\u0621}}) is a prayer consisting of two rakaah performed during the times of drought to ask Allah for rain.\n\nsalah = Prayer\nRak'at = (One cycle unit of Muslim prayer from standing position to prostration, back to standing position)\nSura = (A Chapter of the Quran)\nKhutbah = (Sermon)\n\nThe imam prays, with the followers, two rak'at during any time except those times in which it is not desirable to pray. In the first rak'ah, the imam recites Sura Al-A'la after Sura Al-Fatihah. And in the second rak'ah, he reads Sura Al-Ghashiyah after Al-Fatihah, and he delivers a khutbah before or after the salah. As soon as he finishes the khutbah, people face the qiblah and supplicate to Allah. It was first introduced in Madina in the month of Ramadan of 6th Hijrah.\n\nAsh-Shaf'i states that it has been related from Salim ibn 'Abdullah, on the authority of his father that Muhammad would say for ishsqa': \"O Allah, give us a saving rain, productive, plentiful, general, continuous. O Allah, give us rain and do not make us among the despondent. O Allah, (Your) slaves, land, animals, and (Your) creation all are suffering and seek protection. And we do not complain except to You. O Allah, let our crops grow, and let the udders be refilled. Give us from the blessings of the sky and grow for us from the blessings of the earth. O Allah, remove from us the hardship, starvation,and barrenness and remove the affliction from us as no one removes afflictions save Thee. O Allah, we seek Your forgiveness as You are the Forgiving, and send upon us plenteous rains.\" Ash-Shaf'i said: \"I prefer that the imam would supplicate with that (prayer).\"\n\nSa'd reported that for ishsqa', Muhammad would supplicate: \"O Allah, let us be covered with thick clouds that have abundant and beneficial rain, frequently making a light rain upon us and sprinkling upon us with lightning. O Allah, You are full of majesty, bounty and Honour.\" This is related by Abu 'Awanah in his Sahih.\n\n'Amr ibn Shuaib relates from his father, on the authority of his grandfather, that for istisqa', Muhammad would say: \"O Allah, provide water for Your slaves and Your cattle, display Your mercy and give life to Your dead lands.\" This is related by Abu Dawud.\n\nIt is preferred for the one who is making this supplication to raise his hands with the back of his hands toward the sky. Muslim records from Anas that Muhammad would point with the back of his hands during ishsqa.\n\nIt is also preferred, upon seeing the rain, to say: \"O Allah, make it a beneficial rain\" and he should uncover part of his body to the rain. On the other hand, if one fears that there is too much rain, one should say: \"O Allah give us mercy and do not give us punishment, calamities, destruction or flooding. O Allah, make it upon the woods, farms and trees. Make it around us and not upon us.\"\n\n{{anchor|Kusuf}}\n{{anchor|Khusuf}}\n\n==''Kusuf'' and ''Khusuf'' (Solar and Lunar Eclipse)==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n''Salat ul-Kusuf'' ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0633\u0648\u0641}}) is a prayer consisting of two rakaah performed during a [[solar eclipse]], while ''Salat ul-Khusuf'' is a two rakaah prayer performed during a [[lunar eclipse]]. They are performed by the Muslim community in congregation.<ref>http://islam.about.com/cs/prayer/a/eclipse.htm</ref>\n\nKhusuf ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0633\u0648\u0641}}) (Lunar Eclipse) salah (Prayers) is a Nafl (Not Obligatory) salah (Prayers). It is offered at the time of a lunar eclipse. Khusuf salah is offered only in the areas of lunar eclipse. Two or four Rak'ah (Units) of Khusuf salah are offered in a Jama'ah (Group) or individually, with individual prayers preferred.<ref>Ar-Risala by Ibn Abi Zaid al-Qayrawani</ref> Neither Adhan (Call for Prayers) nor Iqamah (Second Call for Prayers) is called for Khusuf salah. Recitation of the Quran during Khusuf salah can be done either silently or loudly.\n\nDuring the time of Muhammad, a solar eclipse happened. People hurried to link this to a worldly event, namely, the death of his son, [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad|Ibrahim]]. Muhammad explained the truth of this matter to them. In his Sahih, [[Imam Muslim]] reported that [[Aishah|`A'ishah (rali)]] said: There was a solar eclipse in the time of the Messenger of Allah. He stood up to pray and prolonged his standing very much. He then bowed and prolonged very much his bowing. He then raised his head and prolonged his standing much, but it was less than the (duration) of the first standing. He then bowed and prolonged bowing much, but it was less than the duration of his first bowing. He then prostrated and then stood up and prolonged the standing, but it was less than the first standing. He then bowed and prolonged his bowing, but it was less than the first bowing. He then lifted his head and then stood up and prolonged his standing, but it was less than the first standing. He then bowed and prolonged bowing and it was less than the first bowing. He then prostrated himself; then he turned about, and the sun had become bright, and he addressed the people. He praised Allah and lauded Him and said: \"The sun and the moon are two signs of Allah; they are not eclipsed on account of anyone's death or on account of anyone's birth. So when you see them, glorify and supplicate Allah, observe the Prayer, give alms. O Ummah of Muhammad, none is more indignant than Allah when His servant or maid commits fornication. O people of Muhammad, by Allah, if you knew what I know, you would weep much and laugh little. O Allah, witness, I informed them.\"<ref>http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1119503547604&pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaEAskTheScholar</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Nafl prayer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Islamic prayer}}\n\n[[Category:Salat]]\n[[Category:Salah terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=April 2015}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=April 2015}}\n{{Expert-subject|Islam|date=November 2008}}\n}}\n\n{{Fiqh |theological}}\n\n'''Sunnah prayer''' ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u0629}}) is an optional or [[Supererogation|supererogatory]] [[salah]] that can be performed by [[Muslims]] at almost any time of the day.

The total number of people joining the [[tarawih]] prayers in the main mosque in Mecca may reach 3-4 million. They fill up all levels inside the [[mosque]], the flat roof, outside in the courtyard, some nearby streets (which are closed off), and on occasions even using up space in the lobbies of some nearby hotels.\n\nIt is also customary for the Imam in any mosque to recite the entire contents of the [[Qur'an]] during the fasting month by reading approximately one section per day. This practice of reading the Qur'an completely is known as ''khatm'' (complete recitation).\n\n==Istisqa==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nSalat ul istasqa ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u062a\u0633\u0642\u0627\u0621}}) is a prayer consisting of two rakaah performed during the times of drought to ask Allah for rain.\n\nsalah = Prayer\nRak'at = (One cycle unit of Muslim prayer from standing position to prostration, back to standing position)\nSura = (A Chapter of the Quran)\nKhutbah = (Sermon)\n\nThe imam prays, with the followers, two rak'at during any time except those times in which it is not desirable to pray. In the first rak'ah, the imam recites Sura Al-A'la after Sura Al-Fatihah. And in the second rak'ah, he reads Sura Al-Ghashiyah after Al-Fatihah, and he delivers a khutbah before or after the salah. As soon as he finishes the khutbah, people face the qiblah and supplicate to Allah. It was first introduced in Madina in the month of Ramadan of 6th Hijrah.\n\nAsh-Shaf'i states that it has been related from Salim ibn 'Abdullah, on the authority of his father that Muhammad would say for ishsqa': \"O Allah, give us a saving rain, productive, plentiful, general, continuous. O Allah, give us rain and do not make us among the despondent. O Allah, (Your) slaves, land, animals, and (Your) creation all are suffering and seek protection. And we do not complain except to You. O Allah, let our crops grow, and let the udders be refilled. Give us from the blessings of the sky and grow for us from the blessings of the earth. O Allah, remove from us the hardship, starvation,and barrenness and remove the affliction from us as no one removes afflictions save Thee. O Allah, we seek Your forgiveness as You are the Forgiving, and send upon us plenteous rains.\" Ash-Shaf'i said: \"I prefer that the imam would supplicate with that (prayer).\"\n\nSa'd reported that for ishsqa', Muhammad would supplicate: \"O Allah, let us be covered with thick clouds that have abundant and beneficial rain, frequently making a light rain upon us and sprinkling upon us with lightning. O Allah, You are full of majesty, bounty and Honour.\" This is related by Abu 'Awanah in his Sahih.\n\n'Amr ibn Shuaib relates from his father, on the authority of his grandfather, that for istisqa', Muhammad would say: \"O Allah, provide water for Your slaves and Your cattle, display Your mercy and give life to Your dead lands.\" This is related by Abu Dawud.\n\nIt is preferred for the one who is making this supplication to raise his hands with the back of his hands toward the sky. Muslim records from Anas that Muhammad would point with the back of his hands during ishsqa.\n\nIt is also preferred, upon seeing the rain, to say: \"O Allah, make it a beneficial rain\" and he should uncover part of his body to the rain. On the other hand, if one fears that there is too much rain, one should say: \"O Allah give us mercy and do not give us punishment, calamities, destruction or flooding. O Allah, make it upon the woods, farms and trees. Make it around us and not upon us.\"\n\n{{anchor|Kusuf}}\n{{anchor|Khusuf}}\n\n==''Kusuf'' and ''Khusuf'' (Solar and Lunar Eclipse)==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n''Salat ul-Kusuf'' ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0633\u0648\u0641}}) is a prayer consisting of two rakaah performed during a [[solar eclipse]], while ''Salat ul-Khusuf'' is a two rakaah prayer performed during a [[lunar eclipse]]. They are performed by the Muslim community in congregation.<ref>http://islam.about.com/cs/prayer/a/eclipse.htm</ref>\n\nKhusuf ({{lang-ar|\u0635\u0644\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0633\u0648\u0641}}) (Lunar Eclipse) salah (Prayers) is a Nafl (Not Obligatory) salah (Prayers). It is offered at the time of a lunar eclipse. Khusuf salah is offered only in the areas of lunar eclipse. Two or four Rak'ah (Units) of Khusuf salah are offered in a Jama'ah (Group) or individually, with individual prayers preferred.<ref>Ar-Risala by Ibn Abi Zaid al-Qayrawani</ref> Neither Adhan (Call for Prayers) nor Iqamah (Second Call for Prayers) is called for Khusuf salah. Recitation of the Quran during Khusuf salah can be done either silently or loudly.\n\nDuring the time of Muhammad, a solar eclipse happened. People hurried to link this to a worldly event, namely, the death of his son, [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad|Ibrahim]]. Muhammad explained the truth of this matter to them. In his Sahih, [[Imam Muslim]] reported that [[Aishah|`A'ishah (rali)]] said: There was a solar eclipse in the time of the Messenger of Allah. He stood up to pray and prolonged his standing very much. He then bowed and prolonged very much his bowing. He then raised his head and prolonged his standing much, but it was less than the (duration) of the first standing. He then bowed and prolonged bowing much, but it was less than the duration of his first bowing. He then prostrated and then stood up and prolonged the standing, but it was less than the first standing. He then bowed and prolonged his bowing, but it was less than the first bowing. He then lifted his head and then stood up and prolonged his standing, but it was less than the first standing. He then bowed and prolonged bowing and it was less than the first bowing. He then prostrated himself; then he turned about, and the sun had become bright, and he addressed the people. He praised Allah and lauded Him and said: \"The sun and the moon are two signs of Allah; they are not eclipsed on account of anyone's death or on account of anyone's birth. So when you see them, glorify and supplicate Allah, observe the Prayer, give alms. O Ummah of Muhammad, none is more indignant than Allah when His servant or maid commits fornication. O people of Muhammad, by Allah, if you knew what I know, you would weep much and laugh little. O Allah, witness, I informed them.\"<ref>http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?cid=1119503547604&pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaEAskTheScholar</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Nafl prayer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Islamic prayer}}\n\n[[Category:Salat]]\n[[Category:Salah terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Musthafa TS", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah_prayer"}

The most notable criticism came from the AWA World Heavyweight Champion Jerry Lawler, who was not paid for his participation in the event and Gagne ultimately stripped him off the title and buried him on AWA television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/classics/awa/history-of-awa|title=The sensational history of the AWA|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=26 December 2018|date=May 2, 2012|author=Ryan Murphy|author2=Bobby Melok}}</ref>\n\nAdam Nedeff of ''411Mania'' rated it 4.2 out of 10 stars, considering it a poor event citing \"Terrible, but not as terrible as I was expecting, which might be the most glowing review anyone ever gave this show.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://411mania.com/wrestling/name-marquee-super-clash-iii-12-13-1988/|author=Adam Nedeff|accessdate=26 December 2018|work=411Mania|title=The Name on the Marquee: Super Clash III (12.13.1988)|date=November 25, 2018}}</ref>\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|future  = no\n|times = <ref name=\"AlmanacPPV\">{{cite news|title=Historical Cards|work=2007 Wrestling Almanac and Book of Facts|publisher=Kappa Publications| id=2007 Edition|page=159}}</ref><ref name=Clash3>{{cite web|title=SuperClash III | url= http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/misc/awa/superclash.html#sc3 | date=December 13, 1988 | accessdate=April 4, 2015 | publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}</ref>\n\n|match1 =[[Chavo Guerrero, Sr.|Chavo Guerrero]], [[Mando Guerrero]], and [[Hector Guerrero]] defeated [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] and The [[Rock 'n' Roll RPMs]] ([[Mike Davis (wrestler)|Mike Davis]] and [[Tommy Lee Jones (wrestler)|Tommy Lane]])\n|stip1   = [[Six-man tag team match]]\n|time1   = 06:35\n\n|match2 =[[Eric Embry]] defeated [[Jeff Jarrett]] (c)\n|stip2  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]] for the [[WCWA World Light Heavyweight Championship]]\n|time2  = 04:13\n\n|match3 =[[Jimmy Valiant]] defeated [[Wayne Bloom]]\n|stip3  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]\n|time3 = 00:24\n\n|match4 =[[Iceman King Parsons]] (c) defeated [[Brickhouse Brown]]\n|stip4 = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]] for the [[WCWA Texas Heavyweight Championship]]\n|time4  = 05:41\n\n|match5 =[[Wendi Richter]] (Women's) and The Top Guns ([[Ricky Rice]] and [[Derrick Dukes]]) defeated [[Badd Company]] ([[Paul Diamond]] and [[Pat Tanaka]]) (Tag Team) and [[Madusa Miceli]] (with [[Diamond Dallas Page]])\n|stip5  = [[Mixed tag team match]] for the [[AWA World Women's Championship]] and the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]]\n|time5   = 05:43\n\n|match6 =[[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg Gagne]] defeated [[Ron Garvin]] by count-out\n|stip6 = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]] for the vacant [[AWA International Television Championship]]\n|time6  = 05:52\n\n|match7 =The Syrian Terrorist defeated [[Selina Majors|Bambi]], [[Peggy Lee Leather]], Laurie Lynn, [[Brandi Mae]], Malibu, [[Ivory (wrestler)|Nina]], Pocohantas and [[Luna Vachon]]\n|stip7 = [[Bra and Panties match|Lingerie]] [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]]\n|time7  = 08:36\n\n|match8 =[[Sgt.

Suffren reembarked his troops and moved to intercept, leading to the [[Battle of Trincomalee]].<ref name=Hennequin314>Hennequin, p.314</ref> The French line fought desorganised, especially after ''Vengeur'' caught fire and have to distance herself from other ships. The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships of East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.
