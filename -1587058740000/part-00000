The [[Irish Guards]] have an over one hundred year-long history during which the regiment have served with distinction in almost all of the [[United Kingdom's]]  conflicts throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries ranging from the [[First World War]] to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].\n\nThe Irish Guards were formed by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1900 to honour the Irishmen who had fought in the [[Second Boer War]]. The Irish Guards first saw combat as a regiment in the First World War during which they fought on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] from the beginning to the end of the war. The regiment played a significant role in many of the First World War's pivotal battles such as the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the [[Battle of Loos]] and the [[Battle of the Somme]]. By the end of the war, the regiment had experienced significant losses and won four [[Victoria Cross]]es, two of them posthumous. The Irish Guards were to experience similar fighting just twenty one years later with the commencement of the [[Second World War]]. The regiment won two further Victoria Crosses and saw action during the [[Norwegian Campaign]], the [[Battle of France]], the [[Tunisian Campaign]], the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], [[Operation Overlord]] and [[Operation Market Garden]]. Following the conclusion of the Second World War, the Irish Guards were involved in several conflicts arising from the decline of the [[British Empire]], including the [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine]], against the [[EOKA]] group in [[Cyprus]] and in the [[Aden Emergency]]. Moving into the 21st Century, the Irish Guards served in the [[Yugoslav Wars|Balkans Conflicts]], the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|War in Afghanistan]].\n\n==Creation==\n[[File:Irish Guards Pre-1914 Q67391.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts of Kandahar|Lord Roberts]] presenting shamrock to the Irish Guards at Chelsea Barracks on 17 March 1904.]]\nThe Irish Guards was formed on 1 April 1900 by order of [[Queen Victoria]] to commemorate the Irish people who fought in the [[Second Boer War]] for the [[British Empire]].<ref>{{cite book |title=A Military History of Ireland | last=Bartlett |first=Thomas |author2=Jeffery, Keith |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1997 |isbn=0-521-62989-6 | page=380 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPZiWhhAmXAC&pg=PA380&dq=%22Irish+Guards%22+1900+victoria&hl=en&ei=UPXRTPLREJGC4Qbg7JSFDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=%22Irish%20Guards%22%201900%20victoria&f=false |accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.irishguards.org.uk/pages/history/index.html Irish Guards Regimental website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108021721/http://www.irishguards.org.uk/pages/history/index.html |date=2015-11-08 }} \"''103 Years of the Irish Guards''\"</ref> This followed an initial suggestion from the Irish-born<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley |work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646710/Garnet-Wolseley-1st-Viscount-Wolseley |accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref> British Army officer [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Field Marshal Viscount Wolseley]] to allow soldiers in Irish Regiments to wear the [[shamrock]] in their headdress on [[St. Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Forgotten protest: Ireland and the Anglo-Boer War |last=McCracken |first=Donal P |year=2003 |publisher=Ulster Historical Foundation |isbn=1-903688-18-3 |page=66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYB0RiqcidIC&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=%22Irish+Guards%22+Wolseley&source=bl&ots=1P-Zaimbm5&sig=3qMVplNlxecI-koTTW1OjpQDP9k&hl=en&ei=KvHRTOLiH9Oz4Qa_o-XvDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22Irish%20Guards%22%20Wolseley&f=false |accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref> This developed into a suggestion that an Irish Guards regiment should be created.\n\nThe Irish Guards' first honorary [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel-of-the-Regiment]] was [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts of Kandahar|Lord Roberts]], known to many troops as \"Bobs\". Because of this, the regiment gained the nickname \"Bob's Own\" but are now known affectionately as \"The Micks\" (although a generally derogatory term if used in society, this term is not seen as offensive or derogatory by the regiment.)\n\nRoberts, as the new Commander-in-Chief in the Second Boer War, was too busy at the time to take over a new regiment, but he was appointed a Colonel of the regiment on 17 October 1900. Major Richard Joshua Cooper, of the 1st Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]], was appointed the first Commanding Officer on 2 May 1900 and 200 Irishmen from the same regiment were transferred as the nucleus of the new regiment. Selected members of the line infantry regiments were chosen to fill out the ranks of the new regiment.<ref>R. G.

George Morris]] and the Second-in-Command Major Hubert Crichton were killed. Le Cateau was a successful action that inflicted very heavy losses on the Germans and helped delay their advance towards Paris.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=12}}\n\nIn August that year, the 2nd (Reserve) Battalion was raised at [[Warley Barracks]] to serve as a training battalion for the men needed to replace losses sustained by the 1st Battalion in France.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=4}} The 1st Irish Guards later in September took part in the [[First Battle of the Marne]] and the [[First Battle of the Aisne|advance towards the Aisne]].{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=14}} The Irish Guards, having lost their Commanding Officer only a few weeks after they had reached France, would take part in one of the bloodiest battles of 1914, the [[First Battle of Ypres]], which began on 19 October. The battle caused major casualties among the old [[Standing army|Regular Army]]. The 1st Battalion was involved in fighting for the duration of the battle, taking part in the major actions, at [[First Battle of Ypres|Langemarck]], [[Battle of Gheluvelt|Gheluvelt]] and [[Battle of Nonne Bosschen|Nonne Bosschen]].{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=30-52}}\n\nThe 1st Battalion suffered huge casualties between November 1\u20138 holding the line against near defeat by German forces, while defending [[Klein Zillebeke]], with No. 3 Company suffering severe casualties on November 1 and No. 1 Company being caught in the open after a French retreat on November 6 exposed their flank, ensuring that at the end of the day \"the greater part of them were missing\".<ref>The Irish Guards in the Great War \u2013 First Battalion \u2013 Rudyard Kipling p. 57-61</ref> By the end of First Battle of Ypres on the 22 November, the battalion had suffered over 700 casualties and could only field two companies from the survivors.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=42}} The 2nd Division, of which the 1st Irish Guards were part of, suffered 5,769 officers and men killed, wounded or missing in action. The original battalion of 1st Irish Guards which had arrived in France barely two months before had been practically wiped out and had to be reconstructed with new arrivals.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=46}} The rest of 1914 and early 1915 was spent in the trenches with little action, although the soldiers were at risk from snipers and shells.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=52}}\n\n[[File:Irish Guards marching in France, 1915.jpg|thumb|left|1st Battalion, Irish Guards marching through a French village on the Western Front, August 1915.]]\nIn February 1915, [[Lance corporal|Lance-Corporal]] [[Michael O'Leary (VC)|Michael O'Leary]] performed an act of bravery at [[Cuinchy]], where attack and counter-attack had been taking place between the British and Germans since 29 January until early February. On 1 February, O'Leary was part of a storming party which attacked an enemy barricade, during the attack the party suffered casualties and a group of the storming party then were hit by their own artillery bombardment. O'Leary rushed forward, shooting five Germans before attacking a further three in a machine-gun position at the next barricade, capturing two Germans in the process. The trench and many prisoners were taken thanks to the actions of O'Leary. He was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], the first VC the Irish Guards won in the war.<ref name=\"P2\">Batchelor & Matson, p. 2</ref>\n\nIn May 1915, the 1st Irish Guards took part in the [[Battle of Festubert]], though did not see much action. In July 1915, the 2nd (Reserve) Battalion was redesignated the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, and another battalion, the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards was formed at Warley Barracks.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=4}} In August that year the 1st Irish Guards, along with the rest of the 4th (Guards) Brigade, was moved to the [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]].

They were involved in the capture of the northern part of the village on 25 September and were relieved the following day by the 2nd Irish Guards.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=103-105}} The 1st Irish Guards suffered quite heavily during the Morval engagement with over 250 casualties.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=180}} The 2nd Irish Guards fought until 28 September when they too were relieved and entered into a period of rest along with the rest of the Guard's Division.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=105}}\n\nThe Irish Guards had been brought back up to strength sufficiently during their rest period so that by the summer of 1917 they would once again be called on to front a major British offensive with the start of the [[Battle of Passchendaele]].{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=145}} The 2nd Irish Guards were the first to enter the [[Battle of Pilckem]] which began on 31 July and despite taking heavy casualties, including their Commanding Officer, achieved their objectives in the face of heavy German resistance.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=151}} [[File:Irish Guards during the Battle of Passchendaele.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards resting during the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], 10 October 1917.]]1st Irish Guards spent the first day of the offensive in reserve before joining their sister battalion on 1 September.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=221}} Further actions took place for the 1st Irish Guards at the [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge]], where they beat off several German counterattacks, and at the [[Battle of Poelcapelle]], during which the battalion lost every one of its company commanders although 2nd Irish Guards suffered few casualties.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=231-235}}\n\nIn a testament to the ferocity of fighting that the Irish Guards faced at the [[Battle of Passchendaele]], an action took place on 12 September that would see two members of the regiment win the Victoria Cross. Lance-Sergeant [[John Moyney]] and Private [[Thomas Woodcock (VC)|Thomas Woodcock]] of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards, were part of an advance post that became surrounded by Germans. During the defence, the Lance-Sergeant attacked the advancing Germans with grenades and with his [[lewis gun]]. He, and his men, then charged the Germans, breaking through them and reaching a stream where he and Private Woodcock formed a rearguard while the rest of the party withdrew. They subsequently began to withdraw, crossing the stream, but Private Woodcock heard cries for help and he returned, retrieving the wounded man and carrying him back to British lines under machine-gun fire. They had held out for ninety-six hours.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30338|supp=y|pages=10678\u201310679|date=16 October 1917 }}</ref>\n\nThe Irish Guards took part in the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]], the first large use of the tank in battle took place during the engagement.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=231-235}} The 1st Irish Guards initially enjoyed a quite sector for the opening of the battle until 30 November when they suffered heavy casualties fighting through the streets of the village of [[Gouzeaucourt]].{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=245}} The Guards Division, and with it the 1st and 2nd Irish Guards, were pulled off the line on 6 December for a rest period, having fought almost continuously since the start of August.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=249}}\n\n===1918: Final victory and the ending of the War===\n[[File:Irish Guards late 1918.jpg|thumb|right|Irish Guards pass a railway carriage set on fire by the retreating Germans.]]\nThe regiment enjoyed the relative respite provided by the stalemate that the Western Front experienced in early 1918.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=181}} This respite, however, was going to be short lived with a major German offensive expected. This great German offensive, termed the [[Spring Offensive]], began on 21 March 1918 with the launching of [[Operation Michael]]. The 1st Irish Guards were ordered to join the fight on the night of 21 March once the British realised how serious the situation had become and the battalion found themselves forming the rearguard for a retreating army on the defensive for the first time since the opening stages of the war four years previously.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=187}} The 2nd Irish Guards, who had been in reserve to meet the expected German offensive, were ordered to create a defensive line east of [[Boisleux-Saint-Marc]] in an attempt to stem the German advance.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=261-264}} The men of the 2nd Irish Guards would continue a fighting withdrawal for ten days until, finally, the German offensive ran out of momentum and the battalion were relieved from the line on 31 March.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=190}} The failed German offensive marked the beginning of the end of the war but the Irish Guards would fight in a number of engagements before its finish, including at the [[Battle of Arras (1918)|Battle of Arras]] and the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Battle of Albert]]. The regiment also took part in a number of battles during the British offensives against the [[Hindenburg Line]].{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=200-220}}\n\nOn 4 November 1918 at the [[Sambre-Oise Canal]], [[Acting (rank)|Acting]] [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[James Marshall (soldier)|James Marshall]] of the Irish Guards but attached to the 16th (Service) Battalion, [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], organised repair parties who were trying to repair a damaged partly finished bridge. The first party soon came under fire and all were killed or wounded. Marshall, disregarding his own safety, stood on the bank, encouraging and helping the men as they worked on the bridge. [[File:Irish Guards at the end of the First World War.jpg|thumb|left|Irish Guardsmen reading news of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]] at the conclusion of the First World War.]]Once it was repaired, he began to lead his men across the bridge but was shot and killed. He was awarded the posthumous Victoria Cross, the fourth and final to be earned by the Irish Guards during the First World War.<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=31178 |pages=2249\u20132250|date=11 February 1919  }}</ref>\n\nThroughout October and early November, the Irish Guards took place in the last advances on the Western Front against the crumbling German Army.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=325}} On 11 November 1918 the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice with Germany]] was signed. The 1st Battalion, Irish Guards were at [[Maubeuge]] when the Armistice was signed, which was near to where the Irish Guards began their war in 1914 at Mons, although by 11 November there were few surviving Irish Guardsmen of that first battle.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=327}} The sacrifice by the Irish Guards during the First World War had been immense. The two battalions of Irish Guards had suffered 2,349 officers and men killed and well over 5,000 wounded. The regiment was awarded 406 medals, including four Victoria Crosses, during the Great War.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=332}}\n\nAmong those killed serving with the Irish Guards in the First World War was [[Second lieutenant|Second Lieutenant]] [[John Kipling]], the 18-year-old son of author [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was listed as missing during the Battle of Loos in September 1915.<ref group=\"nb\">It was claimed that his grave was identified in 1992, though this is disputed.</ref> In tribute to his son's regiment, Kipling composed the poem [https://web.archive.org/web/20070607011644/http://whitewolf.newcastle.edu.au/words/authors/K/KiplingRudyard/verse/p1/irishguards.html \"The Irish Guards\"] and after the war wrote a two-volume history of the regiment's service in the war.\n\n==Inter-War==\n[[File:Irish Guards Occupation of Germany.jpg|thumb|right|Irish Guards passing the [[Cologne Cathedral]] during the Allied occupation of Germany, February 1919.]]\nWith the First World War at an end, occupation duties awaited the Irish Guards and on 11 December 1918 the regiment marched into Germany, drums beating, as part of the [[British Army of the Rhine]].{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=332}} Both battalions returned to Britain victoriously in the spring of 1919 and after a final parade through London, the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards were now surplus to requirements and disbanded.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=215}} In 1920, for St Patrick's Day, the regiment donned its full-dress for the first time since before the outbreak of World War I. The regiment was also compelled to cope with the internal tensions caused by the political situation back home in Ireland following the end of the First World War although the regiment remained largely detached from the events of the [[Irish War of Independence]], with only one member of the Irish Guards being charged with trying to smuggle weapons to republicans and even this act was motivated by a desire for monetary gain rather than political motives.{{sfn|Verney|1973|p=73}}\n\nThe regiment's continued existence was threatened briefly when [[Winston Churchill]] (later destined to become the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]), who served as Secretary of State for War between 1919 and 1921, sought the elimination of the Irish Guards and [[Welsh Guards]] as an economy measure. This proposal, however, did not find favour in government or Army circles and was dropped.{{sfn|Verney|1973|p=72}}\n\nIn 1922 the regiment deployed to [[Constantinople]] as part of an allied force during the troubles in that region. In late 1923 the regiment deployed to the garrison at [[Gibraltar]]. They returned to the United Kingdom in 1924. They were then based in the south of England until 1936 when they deployed to [[Egypt]]. While stationed there, the regiment deployed to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] for a number of months on internal security duties against [[Arab]] militants. The regiment returned to the United Kingdom in 1938 as war with Germany looked increasingly likely.

''Chrobry'' was attacked by German [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers which killed many men, including the [[commanding officer]] (CO), the [[second-in-command]], the [[adjutant]] and three of the five [[company commander]]s of the 1st Irish Guards, as well as all their heavy equipment. Fire engulfed the ship and, considering the amount of ammunition on board, an immense explosion seemed imminent. However, the surviving Guardsmen were rescued by escorting vessels.<ref name=\"navops\">David Brown, Great Britain.

The battalion returned to the United Kingdom the day after the evacuation, but had only a short respite, for just a few days later they, along with the [[Welsh Guards]], crossed over to the northern French port of [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], reaching the town on 22 May.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=153\u2013154}} Their orders were to [[Battle of Boulogne (1940)|defend part of Boulogne]] during the [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation]] of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) from the overwhelming and inexorable advance of the Germans.

Later that day the battalion was evacuated from Boulogne, being the last to leave and having fought valiantly while awaiting evacuation.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=157}}\n\nIn 1941, 2nd Irish Guards made regimental history when they were reorganised as an armoured battalion, the first in the Irish Guard's history, joining the newly formed [[Guards Armoured Division]] as part of [[5th Guards Armoured Brigade]]. The Training Battalion of the Irish Guards was raised the same year, later becoming the 3rd Battalion, Irish Guards. In 1943, the 3rd Irish Guards were reorganised as a full infantry battalion and followed their sister regiment into the Guards Armoured Division as part of the [[32nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|32nd Guards Brigade]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/Units/UnitOrderofBattle?UniX=4154&OobDate=15+September+1941|title=5 Guards Armoured Brigade|website=www.ordersofbattle.com|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref>\n\n===North Africa and Italy===\nIn March 1943 the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards, who had been based in the United Kingdom since their return from Norway in June 1940, landed, with the rest of the [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]], in [[Tunisia]], to fight in the final stages of the [[Tunisia Campaign|campaign in North Africa]]. The battalion fought in the Medjez Plain area, seeing heavy action at Djebel bou Aoukaz, or 'Bou'. The 1st Irish Guards were tasked with capturing a vital ridge and part of the area was taken on 27 April but further fighting continued for several days with the Irish Guards beating off several German counterattacks and suffering heavy casualties before they were relieved on 1 May.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=Major Colin Kennard}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA11445.jpg|thumb|right|Irish Guardsmen advancing north of Anzio supported by [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]]s of the [[46th (Liverpool Welsh) Royal Tank Regiment]] during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], 25 January 1944.]]\nIt was in this fierce fighting which marked the Irish Guard's Tunisian Campaign that the regiment would win their first Victoria Cross of the Second World War. During an action on 28 April, Lance-Corporal [[John Patrick Kenneally]] of the 1st Irish Guards charged down the forward slope of the ridge on which his company was positioned, attacking the main body of a German company preparing to assault the ridge. He fired his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren LMG]] as he advanced, causing so much surprise and confusion that the Germans broke in disorder and retreated. Lance-Corporal Kenneally then returned to his position unharmed. On 30 April Lance-Corporal Kenneally repeated his brave actions when, accompanied by a sergeant of the [[Reconnaissance Corps]], he charged the enemy who were again forming up to assault the same ridge.  Both men charged the Germans, inflicting heavy casualties on the Germans which resulted in the rout of the German force. The two men began to return to their position but as they did so, Kenneally was hit in the thigh. However, he continued to fight, refusing to relinquish his Bren gun or leave his position. Despite his wound he fought for the rest of the day and for his actions was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue= 36136|date=13 August 1943 |page=3689|supp=y}}</ref>\n\nSixty hand-picked men of the Irish Guards were part of the 14,000 strong British contingent that took part in the victory parade in the capital [[Tunis]] on 20 May 1943. The 1st Irish Guards did not have much time to bask on their victories in North Africa however when in December of that year they were, together with the rest of the 24th Guards Brigade, deployed to the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]].\n\nThe battalion took part in the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]] (codenamed Operation Shingle) as one of the first units to land in Italy on 22 January 1944. The landings were met by stronger than expected resistance as the Allied armies moved inland and a German counterattack was launched several days later. The Allies were soon driven back to the beachhead where fierce fighting raged and the 1st Irish Guards saw action at Carroceto where they repulsed several German attacks. The battalion also took part in the attack on [[Campoleone]], where they experienced heavy casualties. The Irish Guards inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans, but were surrounded the following day with little support against German armour, and were forced to fight their way through to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] lines, suffering many casualties in the process.<ref>D'Este, p. 200.</ref> A few further actions took place for the battalion's companies but, by April, the 1st Irish Guards, having suffered devastating losses, had been severely depleted in manpower and were returned to the UK along with the remainder of the 24th Guards Brigade. Back in the UK, it was decided that the 1st Irish Guards would become the regiment's training battalion in order to provide manpower to the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards who would soon be undertaking the invasion of Europe.\n\n===Landing in Normandy, Market Garden and the advance to Germany===\n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B8334.jpg|thumb|left|A Sherman tank and infantry of the Irish Guards advance along a road near St Martin-des-Besaces during [[Operation Bluecoat]], 1 August 1944.]]\nFollowing the [[Normandy landings]] on 6 June 1944, the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards were landed in France on 25 June to take part in the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy Campaign]].

Gorman's tank fired one shot at the Tiger II, but the shot bounced off its thick armour. The Sherman's gun jammed before a second shot could be fired, and Gorman then gave the order to ram the Tiger II just as it was beginning to turn its massive 88mm gun on his tank. The Sherman smashed into the Tiger II, the collision disabling both tanks. The crews of both tanks then bailed out. Lieutenant Gorman, once he had seen his crew to safety, returned to the scene in a commandeered [[Sherman Firefly]] and destroyed the King Tiger. He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his actions, while the driver from his own crew, Lance-Corporal James Baron, won the [[Military Medal]].<ref name=\"Gorman-Telegraph-Obit\" /> The Irish Guards were involved in the further fighting that raged around Cagny for the rest of the day. Cagny, devastated by heavy bombing, was finally liberated by the Guards on the morning of 19 July.{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|p=123\u2013126.}} The Irish Guards also saw action in [[Operation Bluecoat]] launched on 30 July which saw the British capture the strategically important high ground around the [[Mont Pin\u00e7on|Mont Pincon]] area.{{sfn|Ellis|1962|p=386}} Following the breakout from Normandy and rapid advance through the more open French terrain, the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards crossed the [[River Seine]] on 29 August and began the advance into Belgium with the rest of the Guards Armoured Division towards [[Brussels]] which was liberated on 3 September.\n\n[[File:Sherman tanks of the Irish Guards Group.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards advance past previously destroyed ones in the initial stage of [[Operation Market Garden]] on 17 September 1944.]]\nFollowing the liberation of Brussels, the Irish Guards pushed into north-east Belgium in the face of stiffening resistance and reached the Dutch border on the evening of 10 September, capturing the strategically vital [[Joe's Bridge]] in a daring surprise assault. The Irish Guards were then chosen to be part of the ground force of [[Operation Market Garden]], 'Market' being the airborne assault and 'Garden' the ground attack, which one of the most ambitious operations of the entire war and designed to enable a swift advance into Germany by capturing vital bridges over the [[River Rhine]]. The Irish Guards Group were commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Ormsby Evelyn Vandeleur|\"JOE\" Vandeleur]]. The 2nd Irish Guards led [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] in their advance towards [[Arnhem]], which was the objective of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]], furthest from XXX Corps' start line.{{sfn|Bennett|2008|p=29}}\n\nOperation Market Garden opened on the afternoon of 17 September with the dropping of three Allied Airborne divisions behind the German line. XXX Corps crossed the Belgian-Dutch border 15:00 hours, advancing from [[Neerpelt]], but met very heavy resistance from German forces prepared with anti-tank weapons and most of the tanks in the initial troops were hit and destroyed. After [[Hawker Typhoon]]s were called in to provide the Irish Guards aerial support, the Guardsmen moved forward to clear the German positions, manned by elements from two German parachute battalions and two battalions of the [[9th SS Panzer Division]] and soon routed the German forces flanking the road.{{sfn|Ryan|1999|pp=185\u201386}} The fighting soon died down and the Irish Guards were able to advance and occupy [[Valkenswaard]]{{sfn|Ryan|1999|pp=187}} Despite the progress of XXX Corps, the unexpected resistance meant that the advance was already much slower than planned. Early on 18 September, [[reconnaissance]] units of the Guards Armoured Division made contact with the [[101st Airborne Division|U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] who had liberated [[Eindhoven]], with the rest of XXX Corps reaching the city later that day. The Irish Guards now camped outside [[Son (Netherlands)|Son]] while the [[Royal Engineers]] built a [[Bailey bridge]] over the Wilhelmina Canal so that XXX Corps could advance to [[Nijmegen]]. The bridge was completed early on 19 September and XXX Corps continued their advance.{{sfn|Randel|1945|p=33}} Later that day the Guards Division, still led by the 2nd Irish Guards, reached [[Nijmegen]] where the [[82nd Airborne Division|U.S. 82nd Airborne Division]] was located. Their advance had to be halted, however, for the 82nd had failed to take the bridge due to heavy German resistance. The bridge was finally captured on the evening of the 20th but the Irish Guards and the rest of the Guards Armoured Division were now scattered over 25 square miles trying to secure Nijmegen itself and defend their rear from constant German attacks.<ref>Nijmegen: U.S. 82nd Airborne Division \u2013 1944, p. 188 by Tim Saunders</ref> On the 21st, the British 1st Airborne Division at [[Arnhem]], heavily outnumbered and outgunned, had to surrender after many days fighting that saw true heroism and courage. XXX Corps had been just an hour from the bridge at Arnhem but had to wait for the arrival of the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]] before they could advance. The Irish Guards took part in further fighting until 25 September when the remnants of the 1st Airborne Division were evacuated across the Rhine.\n\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU4157.jpg|thumb|left|Two Irish Guardsmen and a camouflaged [[Sherman Firefly]] guard a section of the [[Bremen]]-[[Hamburg]] autobahn, 20 April 1945.]]\nThe Irish Guards remained in the Netherlands until the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|Allied advance into Germany]] was launched, seeing heavy action during the [[Rhineland Campaign]]. On 21 April 1945, at the village of [[Wistedt]] in northern Germany, Guardsman [[Edward Colquhoun Charlton|Edward Charlton]] of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards, was a co-driver of a tank during the capture of the village by a small force of the Irish Guards. The Germans soon attempted to retake the village with numerically superior forces, consisting mostly of officer cadets under the command of very experienced instructor officers as well as two or three [[self-propelled gun]]s. Three of the four tanks of the Irish Guards force were knocked out, while the fourth (Charlton's) was disabled by a complete electrical failure before the action started.  When the tank was disabled, Guardsman Charlton was ordered to dismount the turret [[M2 machine gun|0.50 Browning]] machine gun and support the infantry, who were in danger of being overrun by the Germans. Charlton took the machine gun from his disabled tank and advanced in full view of the attacking Germans, firing and inflicting heavy casualties on them, halting their lead company and allowing the rest of the Guards to reorganise and retire. Charlton, despite having one arm shattered, continued firing until he collapsed from a further wound and loss of blood.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37551|date=30 April 1946|page=2119|supp=y}}</ref> His courageous and selfless disregard for his own safety helped most of the Irish Guards to escape capture. He later died of the wounds he had received and was awarded a posthumous [[Victoria Cross]], the last VC of the European theatre, and the last, so far, of the Irish Guards. Unusually, much of the citation for the award of the VC was based on German accounts of the fight as most of his later actions were not witnessed by any Guards officers or surviving non-commissioned officers.<ref>\"Europe's Last VC \u2013 Guardsman Edward Charlton\", ''[[After the Battle]]'' (magazine) No. 49, 1985.

For the second time in barely a generation, the Irish Guards had served throughout a [[world war]] with distinction and sacrifice with the regiment losing over 700 men killed, 1,500 wounded and being awarded 252 gallantry medals, including two Victoria Crosses.\n\n==1945 \u2013 present day==\n===End of Empire and the Cold War in Europe===\nThe end of the Second World War signaled the inevitable downsizing of the British Army and the demobilisation of its wartime strength which led to the 3rd Irish Guards being disbanded in 1946 and the 2nd doing so the following year. The ending of the Second World War had also signaled the beginning of the end for the [[British Empire]] and over the next decades the Irish Guards would find themselves serving in conflicts throughout Britain's withdrawal from its remaining colonies. In 1947, the 1st Irish Guards deployed abroad for the first time since 1944, heading for troubled [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] to perform internal security duties there against the [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine]].<ref>Murphy, J.

Faced with the new reality of the [[Cold War]] tensions with the [[Soviet Union]] in Europe, the Irish Guards joined the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) in [[West Germany]] in 1951, remaining there until 1953. After returning to the UK, the Irish Guards participated in ceremonial duty for the [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II]] before it was posted to the [[Suez Canal Zone]] in Egypt, remaining there until the British withdrawal in 1956.\n\nIt was not long before the Irish Guards would find themselves in another trouble spot of Britain's declining Empire when they were deployed to [[Cyprus]] to once again perform vital internal security duties due to the [[EOKA]] campaign against the British forces as well as the tension, indeed violence, that was occurring between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. They returned to Britain in the closing months of that year before once again joining the BAOR in 1961 when they were moved back to [[West Germany]]. In 1966, the regiment was deployed to [[Aden Protectorate|Aden]], another colony experiencing violence with the [[Aden Emergency|Radfan Uprising]] against British rule. During their tour of Aden, the Irish Guards experienced some of the fiercest fighting they had seen since the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-41985352|title=Four Irish Guards killed in hand to hand fighting|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref> The Irish Guards returned home to the UK just before Aden gained independence from the British Empire in 1967.\n\nIn 1970 the Irish Guards were posted to the Hong Kong garrison, remaining there for two years until its return to the UK. In 1974, the regiment was re-roled as a [[mechanised infantry|mechanised]] battalion, subsequently being posted to the BAOR for the third time. During this time the Irish Guards had to once again contend with face the difficult reality of trouble on their home island of Ireland and in 1977 the regiment suffered their only fatal casualty of [[The Troubles]], when Guardsman Samuel Murphy was shot by the Provisional IRA while walking with his mother near his parents\u2019 home in [[Andersonstown]] in West Belfast whilst on leave.

The [[Irish Guards]] have an over one hundred year-long history during which the regiment have served with distinction in almost all of the [[United Kingdom's]]  conflicts throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries ranging from the [[First World War]] to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]]. \n\nThe Irish Guards were formed by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1900 to honour the Irishmen who had fought in the [[Second Boer War]]. The Irish Guards first saw combat as a regiment in the First World War during which they fought on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] from the beginning to the end of the war. The regiment played a significant role in many of the First World War's pivotal battles such as the [[First Battle of Ypres]], the [[Battle of Loos]] and the [[Battle of the Somme]]. By the end of the war, the regiment had experienced significant losses and won four [[Victoria Cross|Victoria Crosses]], two of them posthumous. The Irish Guards were to experience similar fighting just twenty one years later with the commencement of the [[Second World War]]. The regiment won two further Victoria Crosses and saw action during the [[Norwegian Campaign]], the [[Battle of France]], the [[Tunisian Campaign]], the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], [[Operation Overlord]] and [[Operation Market Garden]]. Following the conclusion of the Second World War, the Irish Guards were involved in several conflicts arising from the decline of the [[British Empire]], including the [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine]], against the [[EOKA]] group in [[Cyprus]] and in the [[Aden Emergency]]. Moving into the 21st Century, the Irish Guards served in the [[Yugoslav Wars|Balkans Conflicts]], the [[Iraq War]] and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|War in Afghanistan]]. \n\n==Creation==\n[[File:Irish Guards Pre-1914 Q67391.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts of Kandahar|Lord Roberts]] presenting shamrock to the Irish Guards at Chelsea Barracks on 17 March 1904.]]\nThe Irish Guards was formed on 1 April 1900 by order of [[Queen Victoria]] to commemorate the Irish people who fought in the [[Second Boer War]] for the [[British Empire]].<ref>{{cite book |title=A Military History of Ireland | last=Bartlett |first=Thomas |author2=Jeffery, Keith |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1997 |isbn=0-521-62989-6 | page=380 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MPZiWhhAmXAC&pg=PA380&dq=%22Irish+Guards%22+1900+victoria&hl=en&ei=UPXRTPLREJGC4Qbg7JSFDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=%22Irish%20Guards%22%201900%20victoria&f=false |accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.irishguards.org.uk/pages/history/index.html Irish Guards Regimental website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108021721/http://www.irishguards.org.uk/pages/history/index.html |date=2015-11-08 }} \"''103 Years of the Irish Guards''\"</ref> This followed an initial suggestion from the Irish-born<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley |work=Enyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646710/Garnet-Wolseley-1st-Viscount-Wolseley |accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref> British Army officer [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Field Marshal Viscount Wolseley]] to allow soldiers in Irish Regiments to wear the [[shamrock]] in their headdress on [[St. Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Forgotten protest: Ireland and the Anglo-Boer War |last=McCracken |first=Donal P |year=2003 |publisher=Ulster Historical Foundation |isbn=1-903688-18-3 |page=66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYB0RiqcidIC&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=%22Irish+Guards%22+Wolseley&source=bl&ots=1P-Zaimbm5&sig=3qMVplNlxecI-koTTW1OjpQDP9k&hl=en&ei=KvHRTOLiH9Oz4Qa_o-XvDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22Irish%20Guards%22%20Wolseley&f=false |accessdate=3 November 2010}}</ref> This developed into a suggestion that an Irish Guards regiment should be created.\n\nThe Irish Guards' first honorary [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel-of-the-Regiment]] was [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts of Kandahar|Lord Roberts]], known to many troops as \"Bobs\".

Major Richard Joshua Cooper, of the 1st Battalion, [[Grenadier Guards]], was appointed the first Commanding Officer on 2 May 1900 and 200 Irishmen from the same regiment were transferred as the nucleus of the new regiment.

On 1 February, O'Leary was part of a storming party which attacked an enemy barricade, during the attack the party suffered casualties and a group of the storming party then were hit by their own artillery bombardment. O'Leary rushed forward, shooting five Germans before attacking a further three in a machine-gun position at the next barricade, capturing two Germans in the process.

During the defence, the Lance-Sergeant attacked the advancing Germans with grenades and with his [[lewis gun]]. He, and his men, then charged the Germans, breaking through them and reaching a stream where he and Private Woodcock formed a rearguard while the rest of the party withdrew. They subsequently began to withdraw, crossing the stream, but Private Woodcock heard cries for help and he returned, retrieving the wounded man and carrying him back to British lines under machine-gun fire.

The 1st Battalion, Irish Guards were at [[Maubeuge]] when the Armistice was signed, which was near to where the Irish Guards began their war in 1914 at Mons, although by 11 November there were few surviving Irish Guardsmen of that first battle.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=327}}. The sacrifice by the Irish Guards during the First World War had been immense. The two battalions of Irish Guards had suffered 2,349 officers and men killed and well over 5,000 wounded. The regiment was awarded 406 medals, including four Victoria Crosses, during the Great War.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=332}}\n\nAmong those killed serving with the Irish Guards in the First World War was [[Second lieutenant|Second Lieutenant]] [[John Kipling]], the 18-year-old son of author [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was listed as missing during the Battle of Loos in September 1915.<ref group=\"nb\">It was claimed that his grave was identified in 1992, though this is disputed.</ref> In tribute to his son's regiment, Kipling composed the poem [https://web.archive.org/web/20070607011644/http://whitewolf.newcastle.edu.au/words/authors/K/KiplingRudyard/verse/p1/irishguards.html \"The Irish Guards\"] and after the war wrote a two-volume history of the regiment's service in the war.\n\n==Inter-War==\n[[File:Irish Guards Occupation of Germany.jpg|thumb|right|Irish Guards passing the [[Cologne Cathedral]] during the Allied occupation of Germany, February 1919.]]\nWith the First World War at an end, occupation duties awaited the Irish Guards and on 11 December 1918 the regiment marched into Germany, drums beating, as part of the [[British Army of the Rhine]].{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=332}} Both battalions returned to Britain victoriously in the spring of 1919 and after a final parade through London, the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards were now surplus to requirements and disbanded.{{sfn|Kipling|1923|p=215}} In 1920, for St Patrick's Day, the regiment donned its full-dress for the first time since before the outbreak of World War I. The regiment was also compelled to cope with the internal tensions caused by the political situation back home in Ireland following the end of the First World War although the regiment remained largely detached from the events of the [[Irish War of Independence]], with only one member of the Irish Guards being charged with trying to smuggle weapons to republicans and even this act was motivated by a desire for monetary gain rather than political motives.{{sfn|Verney|1973|p=73}}\n\nThe regiment's continued existence was threatened briefly when [[Winston Churchill]] (later destined to become the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]), who served as Secretary of State for War between 1919 and 1921, sought the elimination of the Irish Guards and [[Welsh Guards]] as an economy measure. This proposal, however, did not find favour in government or Army circles and was dropped.{{sfn|Verney|1973|p=72}}\n\nIn 1922 the regiment deployed to [[Constantinople]] as part of an allied force during the troubles in that region. In late 1923 the regiment deployed to the garrison at [[Gibraltar]]. They returned to the United Kingdom in 1924. They were then based in the south of England until 1936 when they deployed to [[Egypt]]. While stationed there, the regiment deployed to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] for a number of months on internal security duties against [[Arab]] militants. The regiment returned to the United Kingdom in 1938 as war with Germany looked increasingly likely.

The Training Battalion of the Irish Guards was raised the same year, later becoming the 3rd Battalion, Irish Guards. In 1943, the 3rd Irish Guards were reorganised as a full infantry battalion and followed their sister regiment into the Guards Armoured Division as part of the [[32nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|32nd Guards Brigade]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/Units/UnitOrderofBattle?UniX=4154&OobDate=15+September+1941|title=5 Guards Armoured Brigade|website=www.ordersofbattle.com|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref>\n\n===North Africa and Italy===\nIn March 1943 the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards, who had been based in the United Kingdom since their return from Norway in June 1940, landed, with the rest of the [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]], in [[Tunisia]], to fight in the final stages of the [[Tunisia Campaign|campaign in North Africa]]. The battalion fought in the Medjez Plain area, seeing heavy action at Djebel bou Aoukaz, or 'Bou'. The 1st Irish Guards were tasked with capturing a vital ridge and part of the area was taken on 27 April but further fighting continued for several days with the Irish Guards beating off several German counterattacks and suffering heavy casualties before they were relieved on 1 May.{{sfn|Davies|2015|p=Major Colin Kennard}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA11445.jpg|thumb|right|Irish Guardsmen advancing north of Anzio supported by [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]]s of the [[46th (Liverpool Welsh) Royal Tank Regiment]] during the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], 25 January 1944.]]\nIt was in this fierce fighting which marked the Irish Guard's Tunisian Campaign that the regiment would win their first Victoria Cross of the Second World War. During an action on 28 April, Lance-Corporal [[John Patrick Kenneally]] of the 1st Irish Guards charged down the forward slope of the ridge on which his company was positioned, attacking the main body of a German company preparing to assault the ridge. He fired his [[Bren light machine gun|Bren LMG]] as he advanced, causing so much surprise and confusion that the Germans broke in disorder and retreated. Lance-Corporal Kenneally then returned to his position unharmed. On 30 April Lance-Corporal Kenneally repeated his brave actions when, accompanied by a sergeant of the [[Reconnaissance Corps]], he charged the enemy who were again forming up to assault the same ridge.  Both men charged the Germans, inflicting heavy casualties on the Germans which resulted in the rout of the German force. The two men began to return to their position but as they did so, Kenneally was hit in the thigh. However, he continued to fight, refusing to relinquish his Bren gun or leave his position. Despite his wound he fought for the rest of the day and for his actions was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue= 36136|date=13 August 1943 |page=3689|supp=y}}</ref>\n\nSixty hand-picked men of the Irish Guards were part of the 14,000 strong British contingent that took part in the victory parade in the capital [[Tunis]] on 20 May 1943. The 1st Irish Guards did not have much time to bask on their victories in North Africa however when in December of that year they were, together with the rest of the 24th Guards Brigade, deployed to the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]].\n\nThe battalion took part in the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio landings]] (codenamed Operation Shingle) as one of the first units to land in Italy on 22 January 1944. The landings were met by stronger than expected resistance as the Allied armies moved inland and a German counterattack was launched several days later. The Allies were soon driven back to the beachhead where fierce fighting raged and the 1st Irish Guards saw action at Carroceto where they repulsed several German attacks. The battalion also took part in the attack on [[Campoleone]], where they experienced heavy casualties. The Irish Guards inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans, but were surrounded the following day with little support against German armour, and were forced to fight their way through to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] lines, suffering many casualties in the process.<ref>D'Este, p. 200.</ref> A few further actions took place for the battalion's companies but, by April, the 1st Irish Guards, having suffered devastating losses, had been severely depleted in manpower and were returned to the UK along with the remainder of the 24th Guards Brigade. Back in the UK, it was decided that the 1st Irish Guards would become the regiment's training battalion in order to provide manpower to the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards who would soon be undertaking the invasion of Europe.\n\n===Landing in Normandy, Market Garden and the advance to Germany=== \n[[File:The British Army in Normandy 1944 B8334.jpg|thumb|left|A Sherman tank and infantry of the Irish Guards advance along a road near St Martin-des-Besaces during [[Operation Bluecoat]], 1 August 1944.]]\nFollowing the [[Normandy landings]] on 6 June 1944, the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards were landed in France on 25 June to take part in the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy Campaign]].

During 18 July 1944, near Cagny, Lieutenant (later Sir) [[John Gorman (politician)|John Gorman]] of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards was in his [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]] when he was confronted by a far superior German [[Tiger II]] or 'King Tiger'. Gorman's tank fired one shot at the Tiger II, but the shot bounced off its thick armour. The Sherman's gun jammed before a second shot could be fired, and Gorman then gave the order to ram the Tiger II just as it was beginning to turn its massive 88mm gun on his tank. The Sherman smashed into the Tiger II, the collision disabling both tanks. The crews of both tanks then bailed out. Lieutenant Gorman, once he had seen his crew to safety, returned to the scene in a commandeered [[Sherman Firefly]] and destroyed the King Tiger. He was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for his actions, while the driver from his own crew, Lance-Corporal James Baron, won the [[Military Medal]].<ref name=\"Gorman-Telegraph-Obit\" /> The Irish Guards were involved in the further fighting that raged around Cagny for the rest of the day. Cagny, devastated by heavy bombing, was finally liberated by the Guards on the morning of 19 July.{{sfn|Dunphie|2005|p=123\u2013126.}} The Irish Guards also saw action in [[Operation Bluecoat]] launched on 30 July which saw the British capture the strategically important high ground around the [[Mont Pin\u00e7on|Mont Pincon]] area.{{sfn|Ellis|1962|p=386}} Following the breakout from Normandy and rapid advance through the more open French terrain, the 2nd and 3rd Irish Guards crossed the [[River Seine]] on 29 August and began the advance into Belgium with the rest of the Guards Armoured Division towards [[Brussels]] which was liberated on 3 September.\n\n[[File:Sherman tanks of the Irish Guards Group.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards advance past previously destroyed ones in the initial stage of [[Operation Market Garden]] on 17 September 1944.]]\nFollowing the liberation of Brussels, the Irish Guards pushed into north-east Belgium in the face of stiffening resistance and reached the Dutch border on the evening of 10 September, capturing the strategically vital [[Joe's Bridge]] in a daring surprise assault. The Irish Guards were then chosen to be part of the ground force of [[Operation Market Garden]], 'Market' being the airborne assault and 'Garden' the ground attack, which one of the most ambitious operations of the entire war and designed to enable a swift advance into Germany by capturing vital bridges over the [[River Rhine]]. The Irish Guards Group were commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Ormsby Evelyn Vandeleur|\"JOE\" Vandeleur]]. The 2nd Irish Guards led [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXX Corps]] in their advance towards [[Arnhem]], which was the objective of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]], furthest from XXX Corps' start line.{{sfn|Bennett|2008|p=29}}\n\nOperation Market Garden opened on the afternoon of 17 September with the dropping of three Allied Airborne divisions behind the German line. XXX Corps crossed the Belgian-Dutch border 15:00 hours, advancing from [[Neerpelt]], but met very heavy resistance from German forces prepared with anti-tank weapons and most of the tanks in the initial troops were hit and destroyed. After [[Hawker Typhoon|Hawker Typhoons]] were called in to provide the Irish Guards aerial support, the Guardsmen moved forward to clear the German positions, manned by elements from two German parachute battalions and two battalions of the [[9th SS Panzer Division]] and soon routed the German forces flanking the road.{{sfn|Ryan|1999|pp=185\u201386}} The fighting soon died down and the Irish Guards were able to advance and occupy [[Valkenswaard]]{{sfn|Ryan|1999|pp=187}} Despite the progress of XXX Corps, the unexpected resistance meant that the advance was already much slower than planned. Early on 18 September, [[reconnaissance]] units of the Guards Armoured Division made contact with the [[101st Airborne Division|U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] who had liberated [[Eindhoven]], with the rest of XXX Corps reaching the city later that day. The Irish Guards now camped outside [[Son (Netherlands)|Son]] while the [[Royal Engineers]] built a [[Bailey bridge]] over the Wilhelmina Canal so that XXX Corps could advance to [[Nijmegen]]. The bridge was completed early on 19 September and XXX Corps continued their advance.{{sfn|Randel|1945|p=33}} Later that day the Guards Division, still led by the 2nd Irish Guards, reached [[Nijmegen]] where the [[82nd Airborne Division|U.S. 82nd Airborne Division]] was located. Their advance had to be halted, however, for the 82nd had failed to take the bridge due to heavy German resistance. The bridge was finally captured on the evening of the 20th but the Irish Guards and the rest of the Guards Armoured Division were now scattered over 25 square miles trying to secure Nijmegen itself and defend their rear from constant German attacks.<ref>Nijmegen: U.S. 82nd Airborne Division \u2013 1944, p. 188 by Tim Saunders</ref> On the 21st, the British 1st Airborne Division at [[Arnhem]], heavily outnumbered and outgunned, had to surrender after many days fighting that saw true heroism and courage. XXX Corps had been just an hour from the bridge at Arnhem but had to wait for the arrival of the [[43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division]] before they could advance. The Irish Guards took part in further fighting until 25 September when the remnants of the 1st Airborne Division were evacuated across the Rhine.\n\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 BU4157.jpg|thumb|left|Two Irish Guardsmen and a camouflaged [[Sherman Firefly]] guard a section of the [[Bremen]]-[[Hamburg]] autobahn, 20 April 1945.]]\nThe Irish Guards remained in the Netherlands until the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|Allied advance into Germany]] was launched, seeing heavy action during the [[Rhineland Campaign]]. On 21 April 1945, at the village of [[Wistedt]] in northern Germany, Guardsman [[Edward Colquhoun Charlton|Edward Charlton]] of the 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards, was a co-driver of a tank during the capture of the village by a small force of the Irish Guards. The Germans soon attempted to retake the village with numerically superior forces, consisting mostly of officer cadets under the command of very experienced instructor officers as well as two or three [[self-propelled gun]]s. Three of the four tanks of the Irish Guards force were knocked out, while the fourth (Charlton's) was disabled by a complete electrical failure before the action started.  When the tank was disabled, Guardsman Charlton was ordered to dismount the turret [[M2 machine gun|0.50 Browning]] machine gun and support the infantry, who were in danger of being overrun by the Germans. Charlton took the machine gun from his disabled tank and advanced in full view of the attacking Germans, firing and inflicting heavy casualties on them, halting their lead company and allowing the rest of the Guards to reorganise and retire. Charlton, despite having one arm shattered, continued firing until he collapsed from a further wound and loss of blood.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=37551|date=30 April 1946|page=2119|supp=y}}</ref> His courageous and selfless disregard for his own safety helped most of the Irish Guards to escape capture. He later died of the wounds he had received and was awarded a posthumous [[Victoria Cross]], the last VC of the European theatre, and the last, so far, of the Irish Guards. Unusually, much of the citation for the award of the VC was based on German accounts of the fight as most of his later actions were not witnessed by any Guards officers or surviving non-commissioned officers.<ref>\"Europe's Last VC \u2013 Guardsman Edward Charlton\", ''[[After the Battle]]'' (magazine) No. 49, 1985.

For the second time in barely a generation, the Irish Guards had served throughout a [[world war]] with distinction and sacrifice with the regiment losing over 700 men killed, 1,500 wounded and being awarded 252 gallantry medals, including two Victoria Crosses.\n\n==1945 \u2013 present day==\n===End of Empire and the Cold War in Europe===\nThe end of the Second World War signaled the inevitable downsizing of the British Army and the demobilisation of its wartime strength which led to the 3rd Irish Guards being disbanded in 1946 and the 2nd doing so the following year. The ending of the Second World War had also signaled the beginning of the end for the [[British Empire]] and over the next decades the Irish Guards would find themselves serving in conflicts throughout Britain's withdrawal from its remaining colonies. In 1947, the 1st Irish Guards deployed abroad for the first time since 1944, heading for troubled [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] to perform internal security duties there against the [[Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine]].<ref>Murphy, J.

Faced with the new reality of the [[Cold War]] tensions with the [[Soviet Union]] in Europe, the Irish Guards joined the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR) in [[West Germany]] in 1951, remaining there until 1953. After returning to the UK, the Irish Guards participated in ceremonial duty for the [[Coronation of the British monarch|Coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II]] before it was posted to the [[Suez Canal Zone]] in Egypt, remaining there until the British withdrawal in 1956.\n\nIt was not long before the Irish Guards would find themselves in another trouble spot of Britain's declining Empire when they were deployed to [[Cyprus]] to once again perform vital internal security duties due to the [[EOKA]] campaign against the British forces as well as the tension, indeed violence, that was occurring between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. They returned to Britain in the closing months of that year before once again joining the BAOR in 1961 when they were moved back to [[West Germany]]. In 1966, the regiment was deployed to [[Aden Protectorate|Aden]], another colony experiencing violence with the [[Aden Emergency|Radfan Uprising]] against British rule. During their tour of Aden, the Irish Guards experienced some of the fiercest fighting they had seen since the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-41985352|title=Four Irish Guards killed in hand to hand fighting|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref> The Irish Guards returned home to the UK just before Aden gained independence from the British Empire in 1967.\n\nIn 1970 the Irish Guards were posted to the Hong Kong garrison, remaining there for two years until its return to the UK.

This was a remarkable honour, given the fact that the late Queen Mother not only was not the regiment's colonel (she was, in fact, colonel-in-chief of the [[Black Watch]]), she had no official connection with the regiment at all, in spite of her long identification with it.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/04/06/uk.royals.funeral/index.html CNN]</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the Irish Guards were deployed to [[Kuwait]] during the build-up to the [[2003 Iraq War|Iraq War]]. The Irish Guards formed part of the [[British 7th Armoured Brigade|7th Armoured Brigade]] which was the successor of the famed [[British 7th Armoured Division|7th Armoured Division]], or 'The Desert Rats', which had fought throughout the deserts of North Africa during the Second World War, and began training to prepare for the war. Similarly to their experience in the Balkans, the Irish Guards were split up with companies, platoons and sections being attached to various units of the Desert Rats. The war began on 21 March when British and American forces began crossing the Iraq border, with the Desert Rats beginning the journey towards [[Basra]],  Iraq's second largest city. The British troops spent the next few weeks gradually taking control of much of the area that surrounded Basra with soldiers of the Irish Guards leading the [[Battle of Basra (2003)|British advance on Basra]] from late March, helping in securing objectives on the outskirts of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/2915311.stm|title=Irish Guards advance on Basra|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref> After a number of days consolidating their position, the Irish Guards fought their way into the city on 6 April and took a number of casualties in heavy [[urban warfare]] before securing the city by the end of the day.

They performed these duties until early May when they left Iraq and returned home but upon their return to the UK, they were almost immediately posted back to Northern Ireland  for a four-month posting for their third tour of the province.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/13/iraq.military|title=What happened to the first British soldiers to enter Basra?|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref> In 2005, the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards became the first regiment in the British Army to be officially awarded [[battle honours]] for service in Iraq \u2013 this was to enable these to be displayed on the battalion's new [[colours, standards and guidons|regimental colour]] during the [[Trooping the Colour|Sovereign's Birthday Parade]]. The Irish Guards returned to Iraq in April 2007 for a six-month tour of the country during which they were based [[Basra International Airport|Basra Airport]] and were responsible for training the [[Iraqi Army]] in the face of an intensifying [[Shia]]-led insurgency.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/on-guard-the-irishmen-fighting-in-iraq-1.970276|title=ON GUARD The Irishmen fighting in Iraq|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nFollowing their return from their second tour of Iraq, the Irish Guards enjoyed a two-year rest period before, in September 2010, they deployed to [[Afghanistan]] as part of the British forces in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-11440494|title=Irish Guards on tour of duty in Afghanistan|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref> While deployed in [[Helmand Province]], the Irish Guards fought the [[Taliban]] insurgency and helped to train the [[Afghan National Army]] before returning home in April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-12867786|title=Two Irish Guards killed in Afghanistan blast named|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 July 2019}}</ref> The regiment returned to Afghanistan in 2013 to complete their second and final tour of Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/corps-regiments-and-units/infantry/irish-guards/|title=The Irish Guards|publisher=British Army|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref> Following the [[Manchester Arena bombing]], 1st Battalion, Irish Guards were deployed in London to guard key locations, including the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] building in [[Whitehall]], as part of [[Operation Temperer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warfare.today/2017/05/24/first-troops-deployed-in-operation-temperer|title=First Troops Deployed in Operation Temperer|publisher=Warfare.Today|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nOver twelve years after their last deployment to Iraq, the Irish Guards returned to the country in early December 2019 to help train the Iraqi security forces in their fight against [[ISIS]] as part of [[Operation Shader]]. However, the deployment rapidly changed in January 2020 with the escalation of the [[2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis]] following the American [[2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike|killing of Major General Qasem Soleimani]] of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]]. The Irish Guard's role switched from training to force protection in order to protect British assets in Iraq from possible retaliation by [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/trapped-in-a-middle-east-tinderbox-7t6ls9fxh|title=US will hit \u2018very fast and very hard\u2019 if Iran retaliates for Qassem Soleimani assassination, Trump warns|publisher=The Times|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n;Notes\n{{reflist |group=\"nb\"}}\n;Citations\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050210192530/http://1914-1918.net/irisguards.htm The Long, Long Trail \u2013 Irish Guards]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100528161802/http://www.irishguards.org.uk/ Irish Guards.org.uk]\n*{{cite book|last=Verney|first= Peter |year=1970|title=The Micks: The Story of the Irish Guards|publisher= Peter Davies|ISBN = 0-432-18650-6}}\n*{{cite book|last=Verney|first= Peter |year=1973|title=The Micks: The Story of the Irish Guards (abridged edition)| publisher= London, UK: Pan Books|ISBN = 0-330-23632-6}}\n*{{cite book|last=Johnstone|first= Thomas |year=1992|title=Orange and Green and Khaki: The Story of the Irish Regiments in the Great War, 1914-18 |location=Dublin|publisher= Gill and MacMillen|ISBN = 978-0-7171-1994-3}}\n*{{cite book|last=Harris|first= R.

The buses form part of the integrated transit network of the [[Lower Mainland]].\n\n==History==\nThe Coast Mountain Bus Company was created on April 1, 1999, concurrent with the implementation of [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]]. Bus service in [[Metro Vancouver Regional District|Metro Vancouver]] was formerly provided by [[BC Transit]] (the [[British Columbia#Politics|provincial government]] crown corporation that operates transit outside of Metro Vancouver).\n\n==Services==\nCoast Mountain Bus Company operates the buses throughout Greater Vancouver, except in [[West Vancouver]], which operates its own [[West Vancouver Municipal Transit|municipal transit]] system. One contract operator provides select Community Shuttle service, and another contract operator provides HandyDART services:\n\n* 210 bus routes in total\n** Regular transit service\n** Express coach service to suburban municipalities\n** [[Trolleybus|Trolley bus]] service \u2013 13 routes primarily in the [[Vancouver|City of Vancouver]]\n** NightBus \u2013 special late-night routes after midnight, 8 routes with plans for expansion\n** B-Line express bus (1 route \u2013 see below)\n** [[RapidBus (TransLink)|RapidBus]] express bus (4 routes)\n** Community shuttles \u2013 routes operating minibuses that connect to the larger ones\n* [[SeaBus]] \u2013 passenger ferry across the [[Burrard Inlet]]\n\nThe regional transit network including bus routes, service levels and fares are set by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]].\n\n===B-Line<span id=\"B-Line services\"></span>===\n[[File:CMBC-B18007.jpg|thumb|The [[99 B-Line]] is the busiest bus route in [[North America]], with an average weekday ridership of 56,000 passengers as of 2016.]]\nB-Lines are a type of [[express bus]] route with [[bus rapid transit]] elements using mostly {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} low-floor articulated buses.

Initially, these were only in effect in [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] and SeaBus stations and vehicles until June 25, 2007, when the law was changed. Now, all buses, including West Vancouver buses, are designated Fare Paid Zones. The reason for implementing Fare Paid Zones on buses was to remove the responsibility of fare enforcement from bus drivers, as too many of them were being assaulted in disputes over fare payment. Fare enforcement on all buses are now the responsibility of the Transit Police and Transit Security Department. Officers may board a bus at any time and conduct a fare inspection. Those who fail to pay the fare and retain proof of payment could be removed from the bus and/or fined $173.\n\n==Facilities==\n===Current facilities===\n* Burnaby Transit Centre: Located at 3855 Kitchener Street, Burnaby, it was built in 1986. This transit centre is split into two facilities separated by Kitchener Street. Serving parts of Burnaby and New Westminster, as well the North Shore and east Vancouver, Burnaby Transit Centre is also home to many support services such as Environmental Services, Trolley Overhead, Facilities Maintenance, Fire Prevention, and Non-Revenue Vehicle Maintenance. Beginning in September 2016, North Shore transit routes operate out of this transit centre. Fleet Overhaul at this location is where the majority of body repair and repainting is carried out, as well as engine and component overhaul, while minor repair is most likely carried out at the bus's home garage. Fleet Overhaul is in the process of having a new facility built within the Maple Ridge area.\n* Hamilton Transit Centre: Located at 4111 Boundary Road, Richmond, this facility opened in September 2016, and took over operations of various South Delta, Richmond, Burnaby and New Westminster routes. It is the second transit centre to have abilities to house CNG buses.\n* Port Coquitlam Transit Centre: Located at 2061 Kingsway Avenue, Port Coquitlam, it opened in August 1978. It was the first garage to support Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles. Serves the Tri-Cities, New Westminster, Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows areas.\n* Richmond Transit Centre: Located at 11133 Coppersmith Way, Richmond, it opened on September 4, 2000. It is the main base for the suburban routes served by Orion V highway coaches and local routes in Richmond, White Rock, Delta, and some Burnaby, Surrey and Vancouver routes. \n* Surrey Transit Centre: Located at 7740 132nd Street, Surrey, it opened in May 1975. It is the base for most Surrey, Langley, and North Delta services and some White Rock and Ladner services. As of May 2018, it is the third transit centre to have abilities to house CNG buses.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://buzzer.translink.ca/2018/05/106-new-cng-buses-roll-into-surrey/ |title=106 new CNG buses roll into Surrey |date=2018-05-15 |work=The Buzzer blog |access-date=2018-05-18}}</ref>\n* Vancouver Transit Centre: Located at 9149 Hudson Street, Vancouver, it opened on September 2, 2006. It is the garage for Vancouver bus services. This garage serves the trolley routes, as well as most of Vancouver's buses.\n\n===Former facilities===\n* North Vancouver Transit Centre (1946\u20132016): This depot, built in 1945, was located at 536 East 3rd Street, North Vancouver. It was the base for most North Shore services not operated by West Vancouver Municipal Transit. It closed in September 2016, and all North Vancouver routes now operate from Burnaby Transit Centre.\n* Oakridge Transit Centre (1948\u20132016): Located at 949 West 41st Avenue, it opened in 1948. Oakridge was to be decommissioned and likely sold for re-development beginning in 2007. However, with the arrival of several New Flyer and Nova Bus orders starting in 2006, it remained an active support facility, conducting retrofitting on these vehicles in preparation for revenue service. Additionally, the Oakridge yard was home to many retired coaches, including E901/902 trolleys, New Flyer D40s, and other vehicles. In the second quarter of 2008, as part of a re-organization and expansion at Burnaby Transit Centre, Oakridge took over many of the tasks formerly located at the other facilities. The Community Shuttle service was one of the groups moved, making Oakridge an active transit centre once again. However, in September 2016, the shuttle operations were shifted to the new Hamilton Transit Centre. The property has since been sold for $440{{nbsp}}million to a developer.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/12/21/translink-sells-oakridge-transit-centre-for-440-m.html |title=TransLink sells Oakridge Transit Centre for $440 M {{!}} Metro Vancouver|work=metronews.ca |access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref>\n\n==Management and personnel==\n===Employees===\n\nCMBC's 4300+ employees are spread across [[Metro Vancouver Regional District|Metro Vancouver]].\n* The 3700 bus operators, represented by [[Unifor Local 111]], and the 1100 maintenance employees, represented by [[Unifor Local 2200]], work out of the six regional depots.\n* The [[SeaBus]] staff of 80, including marine attendants, deck officers, engineers, coordinators (also represented by Unifor Local 2200), and office staff work from their North Vancouver location.\n* The 600 staff involved in scheduling, training, operational planning, and administrative services are spread throughout the system, as well as at CMBC's head office in [[New Westminster, British Columbia|New Westminster]] are represented by the Canadian Office and Professional Employees Union, Local 378.\n* In October 2008, CMBC was named one of [[BC's Top Employers]] by Mediacorp Canada Inc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-coast-mountain-bus-company |title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 BC's Top Employers competition}}</ref>\n* Coast Mountain Bus Company operates the Transit Security Department for TransLink.

Transit security officers are also authorized to enforce ''Transit Conduct and Safety Regulations'', as well as the Transit Tariff Bylaw.\n\n===Labour disputes===\nIn 2001, over 3,400 workers rallied in a strike and disrupted transit service for 123 days, from April 1, 2001, to August 1, 2001.

Generally, the prefixes are used to identify which garage the bus is operating from.\n\n* B \u2013 Burnaby \n* H \u2013 Hamilton \n* P \u2013 Port Coquitlam\n* R \u2013 Richmond\n* S \u2013 Surrey (or Community Shuttle)\n* V \u2013 Vancouver (formerly Oakridge)\n* T \u2013 Training vehicle (or HandyDART)\n\n=====Former prefixes=====\nThese are prefixes not in use that were formerly used.\n* N \u2013 North Vancouver (until September 2016)\n\n====Numbering====\nSince 2012, Coast Mountain buses are numbered by the order year, series number and unit number. For example, bus number 12001 would have been ordered in 2012, is part of that year's \"000\" series (denoting New Flyer XDE60 articulated buses), and the first bus received. The order year may not reflect a bus' production year; bus number 12024 is the 24th bus in the same order placed in 2012 but was not produced until 2013. Series numbers vary by year and are often not reused on the same models each year. Community Shuttles since 2016 are always numbered in the \"500\" series. Prior to 2012, buses followed a legacy numbering system adopted from the former BC Transit Vancouver Regional Transit System, where buses would be numbered by series. Bus number 3334, for example, would be bus number 134 of the New Flyer C40LF/C40LFR 3200/3300 series. Unlike the current numbering system, all bus numbers ending in \u221200 would be skipped due to BC Transit policy. This was abolished when the new system was implemented in 2012. Exceptions to this are trolley buses, which follow a numbering scheme dating back to the [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] era, and older Community Shuttles, which followed either a three-digit system or the four-digit system of [[West Vancouver Municipal Transit|West Vancouver]]. These Community Shuttles carried \"S\" prefixes to denote \"Shuttle\" and their numbering systems did not skip bus numbers ending in \u221200.\n\n====Additional fleet notes====\nThe first prototype {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]]/[[Vossloh Kiepe]] [[low-floor]] trolley bus arrived at the Oakridge Transit Centre on July 2, 2005.<ref>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 263 (September\u2013October 2005), p. 117.

Regional District|Metro Vancouver]] and is a wholly owned subsidiary of the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority, known locally as [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], the entity responsible for public transit in the region. The buses form part of the integrated transit network of the [[Lower Mainland]].\n\n==History==\nThe Coast Mountain Bus Company was created on April 1, 1999, concurrent with the implementation of [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]]. Bus service in [[Metro Vancouver Regional District|Metro Vancouver]] was formerly provided by [[BC Transit]] (the [[British Columbia#Politics|provincial government]] crown corporation that operates transit outside of Metro Vancouver).\n\n==Services==\nCoast Mountain Bus Company operates the buses throughout Greater Vancouver, except in [[West Vancouver]], which operates its own [[West Vancouver Municipal Transit|municipal transit]] system. One contract operator provides select Community Shuttle service, and another contract operator provides HandyDART services:\n\n* 210 bus routes in total\n** Regular transit service\n** Express coach service to suburban municipalities\n** [[Trolleybus|Trolley bus]] service \u2013 13 routes primarily in the [[Vancouver|City of Vancouver]]\n** NightBus \u2013 special late-night routes after midnight, 8 routes with plans for expansion\n** B-Line express bus (1 route \u2013 see below)\n** [[RapidBus (TransLink)|RapidBus]] express bus (4 routes)\n** Community shuttles \u2013 routes operating minibuses that connect to the larger ones\n* [[SeaBus]] \u2013 passenger ferry across the [[Burrard Inlet]]\n\nThe regional transit network including bus routes, service levels and fares are set by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]].\n\n===B-Line<span id=\"B-Line services\"></span>===\n[[File:CMBC-B18007.jpg|thumb|The [[99 B-Line]] is the busiest bus route in [[North America]], with an average weekday ridership of 56,000 passengers as of 2016.]]\nB-Lines are a type of [[express bus]] route with [[bus rapid transit]] elements using mostly {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} low-floor articulated buses. All B-Line routes currently in operation feature all-door boarding {{as of|2018|1|1|lc=y|df=US}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.translink.ca/-/media/Documents/rider_guide/Buzzer-Vault/2010s/2017/Buzzer_12_15_2017.pdf |title=The Buzzer December 15, 2017 Issue |publisher=TransLink |accessdate=January 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne route is currently in operation:\n* [[99 B-Line]]: Broadway between [[UBC Exchange]] and [[Commercial\u2013Broadway station]], via [[Broadway\u2013City Hall station]]\n\nFour routes no longer operate:\n*[[95 B-Line]]: Waterfront station to Simon Fraser University's Burnaby campus. It was replaced by the R5 Hastings St RapidBus service.\n*[[96 B-Line]]: From [[Newton Exchange]] to [[Guildford Mall]]. It was replaced by the R1 King George Blvd RapidBus service.\n*[[97 B-Line]]: From [[Coquitlam Central station]] to [[Lougheed Town Centre station]]. It was replaced by the [[Millennium Line]]'s [[Evergreen Extension]].\n* [[98 B-Line]]: Granville Street and No. 3 Road between Burrard station and [[Richmond Centre (mall)|Richmond Centre]]. It was replaced by the [[Canada Line]].\n\n===RapidBus===\n{{main|RapidBus (TransLink)}}\nOn January 6, 2020, two of the existing B-Line routes (the 95 and the 96) were rebranded as RapidBus routes (routes [[R5 Hastings Street|R5]] and [[R1 King George RapidBus|R1]] respectively), and the following routes began service:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.translink.ca/Plans-and-Projects/RapidBus-Program.aspx |title=RapidBus Program |website=www.translink.ca |access-date=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n*[[R3 Lougheed Hwy]]: Lougheed Highway between Coquitlam Central station in [[Coquitlam]] and [[Haney Place Exchange]] in [[Maple Ridge, British Columbia|Maple Ridge]]. It complements the existing 701 route servicing local stops.\n*[[R4 41st Ave]]: 41st Avenue between UBC Exchange and [[Joyce\u2013Collingwood station]], entirely within Vancouver. It replaced the 43 Express.\n\nA third new RapidBus route began service in the second quarter of 2020:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/translink-rapidbus-routes |title=TransLink's 4 new RapidBus routes to launch January 2020 |website=[[Daily Hive]] |access-date=December 19, 2019}}</ref>\n*[[R2 Marine Dr]]: Marine Drive, 3rd Street and Main Street between [[Park Royal Exchange]] in West Vancouver and [[Phibbs Exchange]] in [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver]].\n\n==Fare Paid Zones==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}\nA Fare Paid Zone is a clearly marked territory on which passengers must have valid [[proof-of-payment|proof of payment]] and present it for inspection upon request of a transit security officer. Initially, these were only in effect in [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] and SeaBus stations and vehicles until June 25, 2007, when the law was changed. Now, all buses, including West Vancouver buses, are designated Fare Paid Zones. The reason for implementing Fare Paid Zones on buses was to remove the responsibility of fare enforcement from bus drivers, as too many of them were being assaulted in disputes over fare payment. Fare enforcement on all buses are now the responsibility of the Transit Police and Transit Security Department. Officers may board a bus at any time and conduct a fare inspection. Those who fail to pay the fare and retain proof of payment could be removed from the bus and/or fined $173.\n\n==Facilities==\n===Current facilities===\n* Burnaby Transit Centre: Located at 3855 Kitchener Street, Burnaby, it was built in 1986. This transit centre is split into two facilities separated by Kitchener Street. Serving parts of Burnaby and New Westminster, as well the North Shore and east Vancouver, Burnaby Transit Centre is also home to many support services such as Environmental Services, Trolley Overhead, Facilities Maintenance, Fire Prevention, and Non-Revenue Vehicle Maintenance. Beginning in September 2016, North Shore transit routes operate out of this transit centre. Fleet Overhaul at this location is where the majority of body repair and repainting is carried out, as well as engine and component overhaul, while minor repair is most likely carried out at the bus's home garage. Fleet Overhaul is in the process of having a new facility built within the Maple Ridge area.\n* Hamilton Transit Centre: Located at 4111 Boundary Road, Richmond, this facility opened in September 2016, and took over operations of various South Delta, Richmond, Burnaby and New Westminster routes. It is the second transit centre to have abilities to house CNG buses.\n* Port Coquitlam Transit Centre: Located at 2061 Kingsway Avenue, Port Coquitlam, it opened in August 1978. It was the first garage to support Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles. Serves the Tri-Cities, New Westminster, Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows areas.\n* Richmond Transit Centre: Located at 11133 Coppersmith Way, Richmond, it opened on September 4, 2000. It is the main base for the suburban routes served by Orion V highway coaches and local routes in Richmond, White Rock, Delta, and some Burnaby, Surrey and Vancouver routes. \n* Surrey Transit Centre: Located at 7740 132nd Street, Surrey, it opened in May 1975. It is the base for most Surrey, Langley, and North Delta services and some White Rock and Ladner services. As of May 2018, it is the third transit centre to have abilities to house CNG buses.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://buzzer.translink.ca/2018/05/106-new-cng-buses-roll-into-surrey/ |title=106 new CNG buses roll into Surrey |date=2018-05-15 |work=The Buzzer blog |access-date=2018-05-18}}</ref>\n* Vancouver Transit Centre: Located at 9149 Hudson Street, Vancouver, it opened on September 2, 2006. It is the garage for Vancouver bus services. This garage serves the trolley routes, as well as most of Vancouver's buses.\n\n===Former facilities===\n* North Vancouver Transit Centre (1946\u20132016): This depot, built in 1945, was located at 536 East 3rd Street, North Vancouver. It was the base for most North Shore services not operated by West Vancouver Municipal Transit. It closed in September 2016, and all North Vancouver routes now operate from Burnaby Transit Centre.\n* Oakridge Transit Centre (1948\u20132016): Located at 949 West 41st Avenue, it opened in 1948. Oakridge was to be decommissioned and likely sold for re-development beginning in 2007. However, with the arrival of several New Flyer and Nova Bus orders starting in 2006, it remained an active support facility, conducting retrofitting on these vehicles in preparation for revenue service. Additionally, the Oakridge yard was home to many retired coaches, including E901/902 trolleys, New Flyer D40s, and other vehicles. In the second quarter of 2008, as part of a re-organization and expansion at Burnaby Transit Centre, Oakridge took over many of the tasks formerly located at the other facilities. The Community Shuttle service was one of the groups moved, making Oakridge an active transit centre once again. However, in September 2016, the shuttle operations were shifted to the new Hamilton Transit Centre. The property has since been sold for $440{{nbsp}}million to a developer.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/vancouver/2016/12/21/translink-sells-oakridge-transit-centre-for-440-m.html |title=TransLink sells Oakridge Transit Centre for $440 M {{!}} Metro Vancouver|work=metronews.ca |access-date=2017-07-12}}</ref>\n\n==Management and personnel==\n===Employees===\n\nCMBC's 4300+ employees are spread across [[Metro Vancouver Regional District|Metro Vancouver]].\n* The 3700 bus operators, represented by [[Unifor Local 111]], and the 1100 maintenance employees, represented by [[Unifor Local 2200]], work out of the six regional depots.\n* The [[SeaBus]] staff of 80, including marine attendants, deck officers, engineers, coordinators (also represented by Unifor Local 2200), and office staff work from their North Vancouver location.\n* The 600 staff involved in scheduling, training, operational planning, and administrative services are spread throughout the system, as well as at CMBC's head office in [[New Westminster, British Columbia|New Westminster]] are represented by the Canadian Office and Professional Employees Union, Local 378.\n* In October 2008, CMBC was named one of [[BC's Top Employers]] by Mediacorp Canada Inc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-coast-mountain-bus-company |title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 BC's Top Employers competition}}</ref>\n* Coast Mountain Bus Company operates the Transit Security Department for TransLink.

Transit security officers are also authorized to enforce ''Transit Conduct and Safety Regulations'', as well as the Transit Tariff Bylaw.\n\n===Labour disputes===\nIn 2001, over 3,400 workers rallied in a strike and disrupted transit service for 123 days, from April 1, 2001, to August 1, 2001.

For example, bus number 12001 would have been ordered in 2012, is part of that year's \"000\" series (denoting New Flyer XDE60 articulated buses), and the first bus received. The order year may not reflect a bus' production year; bus number 12024 is the 24th bus in the same order placed in 2012 but was not produced until 2013. Series numbers vary by year and are often not reused on the same models each year. Community Shuttles since 2016 are always numbered in the \"500\" series. Prior to 2012, buses followed a legacy numbering system adopted from the former BC Transit Vancouver Regional Transit System, where buses would be numbered by series. Bus number 3334, for example, would be bus number 134 of the New Flyer C40LF/C40LFR 3200/3300 series. Unlike the current numbering system, all bus numbers ending in \u221200 would be skipped due to BC Transit policy. This was abolished when the new system was implemented in 2012. Exceptions to this are trolley buses, which follow a numbering scheme dating back to the [[British Columbia Electric Railway]] era, and older Community Shuttles, which followed either a three-digit system or the four-digit system of [[West Vancouver Municipal Transit|West Vancouver]]. These Community Shuttles carried \"S\" prefixes to denote \"Shuttle\" and their numbering systems did not skip bus numbers ending in \u221200.\n\n====Additional fleet notes====\nThe first prototype {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} [[New Flyer Industries|New Flyer]]/[[Vossloh Kiepe]] [[low-floor]] trolley bus arrived at the Oakridge Transit Centre on July 2, 2005.<ref>''Trolleybus Magazine'' No. 263 (September\u2013October 2005), p. 117.

The first {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} articulated trolley coach (#2501) arrived at the Oakridge Transit Centre in January 2007.

All of them have been replaced with a modified \"V2W\" rack.\n\n===Retired fleet===\n\nThe following fleet were owned by [[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]] and operated and maintained by CMBC or demonstrated with CMBC.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
