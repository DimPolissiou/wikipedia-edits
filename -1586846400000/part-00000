{"title_page": "Tenseness", "text_new": "{{about|a contrast in vowels|other uses|Tension (disambiguation)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2018}}\n{{IPA notice}}\n\nIn [[phonology]], '''tenseness''' or '''tensing''' is, most broadly, the pronunciation of a sound with greater muscular effort or constriction than is typical.<ref>Matthews, Peter Hugoe (2014). ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics''. Oxford University PRess. p. 403.</ref> More specifically, tenseness is the pronunciation of a [[vowel]] with less [[centralization (phonetics)|centralization]] (i.e. either more fronting or more backing), longer [[Vowel length|duration]], and narrower mouth width (with the tongue being perhaps more [[raising (phonology)|raised]]) compared with another vowel.<ref>Halle, Morris (1977). \"Tenseness, Vowel Shift, and the Phonology of the Back Vowels in Modern English.\" ''Linguistic Inquiry'' 8.4. p. 611.</ref> The opposite quality to tenseness is known as '''laxness''' or '''laxing''': the pronunciation of a vowel with relatively more centralization, shorter duration, and more widening (perhaps even lowering).\n\nContrasts between two vowels on the basis of tenseness, and even [[phonemic contrast]]s, are common in many languages, including [[English language|English]]. For example, in most English dialects, ''beet'' and ''bit'' are contrasted by the vowel sound being tense in the first word but not the second; i.e., {{IPAc-en|i\u02d0}} (as in ''beet'') is the tense counterpart to the lax {{IPAc-en|\u026a}} (as in ''bit''); the same is true of {{IPAc-en|u\u02d0}} (as in ''kook'') versus {{IPAc-en|\u028a}} (as in ''cook''). Unlike most [[distinctive features]], the feature [tense] can be interpreted only relatively, often with a perception of greater tension or pressure in the mouth, which, in a language like English, contrasts between two corresponding vowel types: a '''tense vowel''' and a '''lax vowel'''. An example in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] is the letters ''\u0103'' and ''\u00e2'' representing lax vowels, and the letters ''a'' and ''\u01a1'' representing the corresponding tense vowels. Some languages like Spanish are often considered as having only tense vowels, but since the quality of tenseness is not a phonemic feature in this language, it cannot be applied to describe its vowels in any meaningful way. The term has also occasionally been used to describe contrasts in [[consonant]]s.\n\n==Vowels==\nIn general, tense vowels are more close (and correspondingly have lower first [[formants]]) than their lax counterparts. Tense vowels are sometimes claimed to be articulated with a more [[advanced and retracted tongue root|advanced tongue root]] than lax vowels, but this varies, and in some languages, it is the lax vowels that are more advanced, or a single language may be inconsistent between front and back or high and mid vowels (Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996, 302\u20134). The traditional definition, that tense vowels are produced with more \"muscular tension\" than lax vowels, has not been confirmed by phonetic experiments. Another hypothesis is that lax vowels are more centralized than tense vowels. There are also linguists (Lass 1976, 1-39) who believe that there is no phonetic correlation to the tense\u2013lax opposition.\n\nIn many [[Germanic language]]s, such as [[Received Pronunciation|RP English]], [[Standard German]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], tense vowels are longer in duration than lax vowels, but in [[Scots language|Scots]], [[Scottish English]], and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], there is no such correlation.\n\nGermanic languages have lax vowels generally only in closed [[syllable]]s and so they are also called ''[[checked vowel]]s''. The tense vowels are called ''[[free vowel]]s'', as they often occur at the end of a syllable.\n\n==Consonants==\nOccasionally, tenseness has been used to distinguish pairs of contrasting consonants in languages. [[Korean language|Korean]], for example, has a three-way contrast among stops and affricates; the three series are often transcribed as {{IPA|[p t t\u0255 k]}} - {{IPA|[p\u02b0 t\u02b0 t\u0255\u02b0 k\u02b0]}} - {{IPA|[p\u0348 t\u0348 t\u0348\u0255 k\u0348]}}. The contrast between the {{IPA|[p]}} series and the {{IPA|[p\u0348]}} series is sometimes said to be a function of tenseness: the former are lax and the latter tense. In this case the definition of \"tense\" would have to include greater glottal tension; see [[Korean phonology]].\n\nIn [[Ewe language|Ewe]], {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} are articulated with a strong articulation, {{IPA|[f\u0348]}} and {{IPA|[v\u0348]}}, to better distinguish them from weaker {{IPA|/\u0278/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}.\n\nIn some dialects of [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], there is a contrast between {{IPA|[l, l\u02b2, n, n\u02b2]}} and {{IPA|[\u026b\u02d1, \u028e\u02d1, n\u02e0\u02d1, \u0272\u02d1]}}. Again, the former set have sometimes been described as lax and the latter set as tense. It is not clear what phonetic characteristics other than greater duration would then be associated with tenseness.\n\nSome researchers have argued that the contrast in [[German language|German]], traditionally described as [[voice (phonetics)|voice]] ({{IPA|[p t k]}} vs. {{IPA|[b d \u0261]}}), is in fact better analyzed as tenseness since the latter set is voiceless in Southern German. German linguists call the distinction [[fortis and lenis]] rather than tense and lax. Tenseness is especially used to explain [[stop consonant]]s of the [[Alemannic German]] dialects because they have two series of them that are identically voiceless and unaspirated. However, it is debated whether the distinction is really a result of different muscular tension and not of [[gemination]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[[Checked and free vowels]]\n*[[Vowel reduction]]\n*[[Fortis and lenis]]\n*[[Trisyllabic laxing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Giegerich |first=Heinz J. |title=English Phonology: An Introduction |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-521-33603-1}}\n*{{cite book|last=Jessen |first=Michael |title=Phonetics and Phonology of Tense and Lax Obstruents in German |location=Amsterdam |publisher=John Benjamins |year=1998 |isbn=90-272-1553-7}}\n*{{cite book|last=Kim |first=Nam-Kil |chapter=Korean |title=The World's Major Languages |url=https://archive.org/details/worldsmajorlangu00comr |url-access=registration |editor=[[Bernard Comrie]] |pages=[https://archive.org/details/worldsmajorlangu00comr/page/881 881\u201398] |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-415-60902-X}}\n*{{SOWL}}\n*{{cite book|last=Lass |first=Roger |title=English Phonology and Phonological Theory |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1976 |isbn=0-521-21039-9}}\n*{{cite book|authorlink=M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Siadhail |last=\u00d3 Siadhail |first=M\u00edche\u00e1l |title=Modern Irish: Grammatical Structure and Dialectal Variation |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1989 |isbn=0-521-42519-0}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Phonetics]]\n[[Category:Phonology]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|a contrast in vowels|other uses|Tension (disambiguation)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2018}}\n{{IPA notice}}\n\nIn [[phonology]], '''tenseness''' or '''tensing''' is, most broadly, the pronunciation of a sound with greater muscular effort or constriction than is typical.<ref>Matthews, Peter Hugoe (2014).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
