Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, though he later pleaded guilty to robbery with hurt, and sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Abdul Nasir was eventually found guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. However, it was not the end of Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two officers before being abducted. Abdul Nasir was later convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane in January 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray ordered Abdul Nasir's life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

He seized Lim's family valuables before tying up Lim, his wife, his daughter and Lim's maid. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Lim, where five of the six bullets hit Lim. He managed to flee the country with the help of his accomplice, Ho Yueh Keong. He was nabbed by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]] 10 days later at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur before being extradited back to Singapore on 1 March 2006. Initially charged with murder, his charge was amended to discharging of firearm. During the trial, Tan choose to be unrepresented. In one of his defence, he claimed that Lim was about to hit him with a chair and thus shot Lim in self-defence. But his defence fell flat when the prosecution noted that Lim was tied up and could not have lifted the chair. On 22 May 2007, he was found guilty and sentenced to hang.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, though he later pleaded guilty to robbery with hurt, and sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Abdul Nasir was eventually found guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. However, it was not the end of Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two officers before being abducted. Abdul Nasir was later convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane in January 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray ordered Abdul Nasir's life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for a convict's remaining natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

He seized Lim's family valuables before tying up Lim, his wife, his daughter and Lim's maid. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Lim, where five of the six bullets hit Lim. He managed to flee the country with the help of his accomplice, Ho Yueh Keong. He was nabbed by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]] 10 days later at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur before being extradited back to Singapore on 1 March 2006. Initially charged with murder, his charge was amended to discharging of firearm. During the trial, Tan choose to be unrepresented. In one of his defence, he claimed that Lim was about to hit him with a chair and thus shot Lim in self-defence. But his defence fell flat when the prosecution noted that Lim was tied up and could not have lifted the chair. On 22 May 2007, he was found guilty and sentenced to hang.

These describe how God calls the world into existence through the power of speech (\"And God said, Let there be light,\" etc.) in six days, calls all the animals and plants into existence, and molds the first man from clay and the first woman from a rib taken from the man's side; a worldwide flood destroys all life except for [[Noah]] and his family and representatives of the animals, and Noah becomes the ancestor of the 70 \"nations\" of the world; the nations live together until the incident of the [[Tower of Babel]], when God disperses them and gives them their different languages. Creation science attempts to explain history and science within the span of [[Chronology of the Bible|Biblical chronology]], which places the initial act of creation some six thousand years ago.\n\n===Modern religious affiliations===\nMost creation science proponents hold fundamentalist or Evangelical Christian beliefs in Biblical literalism or Biblical inerrancy, as opposed to the [[Historical criticism|higher criticism]] supported by [[liberal Christianity]] in the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]].

The book, originally titled ''Biology and Creation'' but renamed ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', was released in 1989 and became the first published work to promote the [[anti-evolutionist]] design argument under the name intelligent design. The contents of the book later became a focus of evidence in the federal court case, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', when a group of parents filed suit to halt the teaching of intelligent design in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], public schools. School board officials there had attempted to include ''Of Pandas and People'' in their biology classrooms and testimony given during the trial revealed the book was originally written as a creationist text but following the adverse decision in the Supreme Court it underwent simple cosmetic editing to remove the explicit allusions to \"creation\" or \"creator,\" and replace them instead with references to \"design\" or \"designer.\"<ref name=\"numbers\">{{harvnb|Numbers|2006}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1990s, intelligent design had become a separate movement.<ref name=\"numbers\"/> The creation science movement is distinguished from the intelligent design movement, or [[neo-creationism]], because most advocates of creation science accept scripture as a literal and inerrant historical account, and their primary goal is to corroborate the scriptural account through the use of science. In contrast, as a matter of principle, neo-creationism eschews references to scripture altogether in its [[polemic]]s and stated goals (see [[Wedge strategy]]).

Christian creation science holds that the description of creation is given in the Bible, that the Bible is inerrant in this description (and elsewhere), and therefore empirical scientific evidence must correspond with that description. Creationists also view the preclusion of all supernatural explanations within the sciences as a doctrinaire commitment to exclude the supreme being and miracles. They claim this to be the motivating factor in science's acceptance of Darwinism, a term used in creation science to refer to evolutionary biology which is also often used as a disparagement. Critics argue that creation science is religious rather than scientific because it stems from [[faith]] in a religious text rather than by the application of the [[scientific method]].<ref name=\"McLean_vs_Arkansas\" /> The United States [[National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) has stated unequivocally, \"Evolution pervades all biological phenomena.

The constancy of the decay rates is also governed by first principles in [[quantum mechanics]], wherein any deviation in the rate would require a change in the fundamental constants.

Another case is material inside of stars, which is in a plasma state where electrons are not bound to atoms. In the extremely hot stellar environment, a completely different kind of decay can occur.

These describe how God calls the world into existence through the power of speech (\"And God said, Let there be light,\" etc.) in six days, calls all the animals and plants into existence, and molds the first man from clay and the first woman from a rib taken from the man's side; a worldwide flood destroys all life except for [[Noah]] and his family and representatives of the animals, and Noah becomes the ancestor of the 70 \"nations\" of the world; the nations live together until the incident of the [[Tower of Babel]], when God disperses them and gives them their different languages. Creation science attempts to explain history and science within the span of [[Chronology of the Bible|Biblical chronology]], which places the initial act of creation some six thousand years ago.\n\n===Modern religious affiliations===\nMost creation science proponents hold fundamentalist or Evangelical Christian beliefs in Biblical literalism or Biblical inerrancy, as opposed to the [[Historical criticism|higher criticism]] supported by [[liberal Christianity]] in the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]].

The book, originally titled ''Biology and Creation'' but renamed ''[[Of Pandas and People]]'', was released in 1989 and became the first published work to promote the [[anti-evolutionist]] design argument under the name intelligent design. The contents of the book later became a focus of evidence in the federal court case, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District'', when a group of parents filed suit to halt the teaching of intelligent design in [[Dover, Pennsylvania]], public schools. School board officials there had attempted to include ''Of Pandas and People'' in their biology classrooms and testimony given during the trial revealed the book was originally written as a creationist text but following the adverse decision in the Supreme Court it underwent simple cosmetic editing to remove the explicit allusions to \"creation\" or \"creator,\" and replace them instead with references to \"design\" or \"designer.\"<ref name=\"numbers\">{{harvnb|Numbers|2006}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1990s, intelligent design had become a separate movement.<ref name=\"numbers\"/> The creation science movement is distinguished from the intelligent design movement, or [[neo-creationism]], because most advocates of creation science accept scripture as a literal and inerrant historical account, and their primary goal is to corroborate the scriptural account through the use of science. In contrast, as a matter of principle, neo-creationism eschews references to scripture altogether in its [[polemic]]s and stated goals (see [[Wedge strategy]]). By so doing, intelligent design proponents have attempted to succeed where creation science has failed in securing a place in public school science curricula.

Christian creation science holds that the description of creation is given in the Bible, that the Bible is inerrant in this description (and elsewhere), and therefore empirical scientific evidence must correspond with that description. Creationists also view the preclusion of all supernatural explanations within the sciences as a doctrinaire commitment to exclude the supreme being and miracles. They claim this to be the motivating factor in science's acceptance of Darwinism, a term used in creation science to refer to evolutionary biology which is also often used as a disparagement.

After Spain abandoned its former policy of neutrality resulting on a British declaration of war on Spain in January 1762, the British government decided to mount an attack on the important Spanish fortress and naval base of [[Havana]], with the intention of weakening the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] presence in the [[Caribbean]] and improving the security of its own [[British America|North American colonies]]. A strong British naval force consisting of squadrons from Britain and the [[West Indies]], and the military force of British and North American troops it convoyed, were able to approach Havana from a direction that neither the Spanish governor and Admiral expected and were able to trap the Spanish fleet in Havana harbour and land its troops with relatively little resistance.\n\nThe Spanish authorities decided on a strategy of delaying the British attack until the strength of the city's defences and the onset of seasonal rains bringing tropical diseases would significantly reduce the size if the attacking force, and the start of hurricane season would force the British fleet to seek a safe anchorage. However, the city's main fortress, the [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) was overlooked by a hill that the governor had neglected to fortify: its capture lead to the eventual fall of the Morro Castle after fierce fighting and to the surrender of the city and the Spanish squadron before the hurricane season began.\n\nThe surrender of Havana led to substantial rewards for the British naval and military leaders and smaller amounts of [[prize money]] for other officers and men. The Spanish governor, Admiral and other military and civil office holders were tried in their return to Spain and punished for their failures to conduct a better defence and allowing the intact Spanish warships to fall intact into the hands of the British. Havana remained under British occupation until February 1763, when it was returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\nHavana in the late 18th century was a major port and naval base, and also the strongest fortress in Spanish America. Its royal shipyard with access to abundant supplies of resistant hardwoods was capable of building [[first-rate]] ships of the line and had been developed by the Bourbon monarchy as the most important of its three naval shipyards.<ref name=\"Roger50\">Roger p. 50</ref><ref name=\"Schneider72-73\">Schneider pp. 72-73</ref> There had been several previous plans to attack Havana, including one proposed to [[Edward Vernon|Vernon]] in 1739, which he rejected in favour of an attack on  [[Battle of Porto Bello|Porto Bello]],<ref name=\"Bradley201\">Bradley p. 201</ref> but no successful attack since it was comprehensively fortified,<ref name=\"Schneider21\">Schneider p. 21</ref> and the strength of its fortifications and difficulty that large sailing warships would have in making an undetected approach from the north convinced the Spanish commanders it would be virtually impossible to capture, if its fortifications were in good order and it was properly garrisoned. Its wealth and ability to feed its population also suggested that it could resist being starved into surrender.<ref name=\"Roger50-51\">Roger pp. 50-51</ref><ref name=\"Schneider61,106\">Schneider pp. 61,106</ref>\n\nBritain had been formally at war with France since May 1756, but Spain under  [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]] remained neutral. After Ferdinand's death in 1759, his half-brother  [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], reversed Ferdinand's policy and, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1761)]], re-established the so-called  [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compact]] between France and Spain. This treaty involved an offensive alliance directed against Britain, and in December 1761, Spain placed an [[Economic sanctions|embargo]] on British trade, seized British goods in Spain and expelled British merchants. In response to this, Britain declared war on Spain in January 1762.<ref>Danley and Speelman pp. 431-432</ref>\n\n===Spanish preparations===\nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, Charles III made provisions to defend the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]] against the [[Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as Captain General of Cuba, which was an administrative rather than a military position. De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began construction efforts to improve the fortifications of the city, although the work was incomplete at the time of the siege.<ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two infantry regiments of regulars (the Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n regiments) totalling 996 men, bringing up the number of the Havana garrison to 2,400 regulars. There were also 6,300 sailors and marines aboard the ships.<ref>Greentree p. 15</ref> However, [[yellow fever]] had reduced the effective defending forces of the city by the time the siege began to 1,900 regulars, 750 marines, around 5,000 sailors and 2,000 to 3,000 [[militia]], besides several thousand more without muskets or training to operate them.<ref>Greentree p. 20</ref> The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481 men)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265 men)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856 men)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150 men)\n* Army gunners (104 men)\n* Navy gunners and marines (750 men )\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]] with a 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel giving access to the harbour. Two strong [[fortress|fortresses]] defended the entrance channel. On the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 artillery pieces and was garrisoned by 700 men. However, it had been noted that most of its guns faced Havana's port and bay, and that it was overlooked by the unfortified hill of La Cabana. Although it had been proposed to fortify La Cabana, the project had been delayed and no guns had been installed there by the start of the siege.<ref>Greentree p. 30</ref>The south side was defended by the older ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider68\">Schneider p. 68</ref> The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long.<ref name=\"Schneider54\">Schneider p. 54</ref>\n\n===British preparations===\nTwo days after the declaration of war with Spain, on the advice of  [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|Lord Anson]], the British cabinet chose Havana as a major objective in its attack on Spain because of its strategic importance, believing that its permanent loss would weaken Spanish influence in the Caribbean. Detailed plans were made for a combined naval and military attack on Havana, relying on the Royal Navy's superiority in numbers and effectiveness over the Spanish fleet. Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], with seven ships-of-the-line and a frigate and [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppelas]] his second-in-command, was to transport a military force under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]] to the [[West Indies]], to join the West Indies naval squadron, then under the command of  [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rear-Admiral Rodney]], who was undertaking operations against [[Martinique]], taking on additional troops there. The fleet was then to proceed to the northwest of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]) to embark 4,000 men from the British colonies in North America, commanded by [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]], and be further reinforced by a squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]], commanded by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]. It was to keep its final destination in doubt until it launched its amphibious attack on Havana.<ref name=\"Bradley223-224\">Bradley pp. 223-224</ref>\n\nThese plans were modified to meet circumstances, as Rodney and [[Robert Monckton]] commanding the troops had captured Martinique before Pocock sailed, 3,000 British and American troops from New York did not arrive at Havana until late July, and the plan to take up to 2,000 slaves from [[Jamaica]] to act as [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]] only produced 600 slaves, as many owners were reluctant to part with them without a scheme for compensation.<ref>Poccock p. 197</ref><ref name=\"Schneider128\">Schneider p. 128</ref> A plan by Amherst to assemble a force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]] was dismissed by Albemarle as impractical as it would have left too few troops in the North American colonies.<ref>Danley and Speelman p.320</ref>\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* 72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot<ref>Fortescue p. 541</ref>\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports and shops carrying supplies and artillery.<ref>Thomas p. 2</ref>  The fleet arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.<ref>Pocock pp. 208-209</ref><ref name=\"Bradley224-225\">Bradley pp. 224-225</ref>  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of Martinique where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral Rodney's squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15. There was some friction between Rodney and Pocock, as the latter had been preferred for the naval command of this important expedition.<ref>Pocock pp. 210-211</ref> On 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue, was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]].<ref>Poccock p. 212</ref> The combined force now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nThe  normal approach to Havana, on the north coast of Cuba, was to sail west parallel to the south coast of the island on the prevailing south-easterly wind, then to round its western tip and sail east towards Havana, against the wind. This last section, more than 200 [[mile]]s long, would take a large squadron at least one week, and probably several, to complete, giving ample warning for Havana to prepare. To the north of Havana, reaching as far as [[the Bahamas]], is a wide expanse of shallow water, [[reef]]s and small islands or [[cay]]s], accessible only to small boats except for one deep water channel, the [[Old Bahama Channel]] which is only some 10 miles wide at its narrowest. Although the Spanish navigators that charted it thought too dangerous for large warships, it was surveyed by a British frigate, whose captain left parties of his men in the cays to mark the extremities of the channel, allowing the whole fleet to pass through it, safely and undetected.<ref name=\"Bradley225\">Bradley p. 225</ref><ref name=\"Roger50-52\">Roger pp. 50-52</ref> \n\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet.<ref>Poccock pp. 217-218</ref> After surveying the city's defences, the British planned to begin the operations with the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender.<ref>Poccock pp. 223-224</ref> However, the initial survey had underestimated the strength of the Morro fortress, which was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.<ref>Poccock p. 210</ref>\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nAlthough Prado had received information of the presence of English ships two days before its arrival from a frigate that had escaped from the port of [[Matanzas]], he did not believe that major warships could navigate the Old Bahama Channel.<ref>Thomas p. 3</ref> Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy. Prado wrote to the French in Saint-Domingue and to Spain for relief forces to be sent.<ref name=\"Schneider120\">Schneider p. 120</ref> He also requested reinforcements from [[Santiago de Cuba]], which had the second strongest military force on the island, and although two relief forces set out from the [[Oriente Province]] in July, both were delayed by food shortages and high levels of sickness. One turned back and the other was still one day's march from Havana when the city surrendered.<ref>Johnson pp. 52-53</ref> Besides hope of a relief force, Prado and the Havana garrison had several advantages. Firstly, the [[hurricane]] season would begin in late August, putting the British fleet in danger: the wet weather starting earlier in that month would probably also initiate an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers.<ref name=\"Schneider126-127\">Schneider pp. 126-127</ref> Secondly, despite some losses from tropical diseases Prado had 1,500 Spanish regular soldiers and some 2,300 colonial [[militiamen]], as well as sailors from the fleet.<ref name=\"Schneider121, 126-127\">Schneider pp. 121, 126-127</ref>\n\nThere were initially 12 Spanish ships of the line in the harbour,<ref>Thomas p. 1</ref> besides two others newly constructed but not manned, and also several smaller warships and around 100 merchant ships. The presence of so many merchant ships dissuaded the council from ordering the Spanish fleet to disrupt the British landings, which was also in accordance with the instructions that Admiral Hevia had received when he left Spain to protect Cuba's commerce<ref>Thomas pp. 3-4</ref> The fleet's gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref> Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city. Prado also ordered all women, children and the old and infirm to leave the city, leaving only men able to bear arms.<ref name=\"Schneider135\">Schneider p. 135</ref>\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Additionally, three ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected on account of their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Although this made the remaining Spanish warships unable to leave the harbour, they were clearly outnumbered by the English fleet, and this move made the sailors available to defend the city. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.<ref name=\"Schneider122\">Schneider p. 122</ref>\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day.<ref>Guiteras pp. 79-80</ref> They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana.<ref>Pockock p. 221</ref>  The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref>\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the La Cabana heights.<ref>Guiteras p. 84</ref> Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref> With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance.<ref>Pockock p. 227</ref> Charles III of Spain had earlier instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent of those relating to the fortifications. The task had been started but no guns had been installed.<ref name=\"Bradley226-227\">Bradley pp. 226-227</ref><ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]], on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro.<ref>Pockock pp. 223-224</ref> Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead.<ref name=\"Bradley227-228\">Bradley pp. 227-228</ref> He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.<ref>Pockock p. 229</ref>  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.<ref>Pockock pp. 230-231</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']].<ref>Guiteras pp. 95-96</ref> The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high.<ref>Pockock pp. 231-232</ref>  Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June.<ref>Pockock p. 237</ref> Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 97</ref>\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength.<ref>Poccock p. 230</ref> Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 104</ref> Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress.\nWith the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras pp. 104-105</ref> Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.<ref>Guiteras pp. 107-108</ref>\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived.<ref>Guiteras pp. 116-117</ref><ref>Pockock p. 222</ref> These reinforcements, who had been attacked by the French during their journey, with the loss through capture of some 500 men, consisted of:<ref>Fortescue p. 543</ref>\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\nBy 25th July 5,000 soldiers and 3,000 sailors were sick.<ref>Thomas p. 5</ref>\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 239</ref> At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref> Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort.<ref>Guiteras pp. 124-125</ref> Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider116,124\">Schneider pp. 116, 124</ref>\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay.<ref>Pockock pp. 226-227</ref> Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.<ref>Guiteras p. 142</ref>\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana.<ref>Guiteras p. 144</ref> A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m.

They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized nine ships of the line in Havana harbour, representing one-fifth of the strength of the Spanish Navy,<ref>Cobbett p. 282</ref> namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with a ship of 78 guns belonging  to the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana, a number of smaller armed vessels belonging to it and the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas and nearly 100 merchant ships.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Navy Records Society |title=Publications of the Navy Records Society, Volume 114 |date=1970 |publisher=Navy Records Society |page=289 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EKSmla8zHzIC&dq=}}</ref> Two new almost-completed ships of the line in the dockyard, the ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (80), were burnt.<ref>Clowes p. 247</ref><ref>Cobbett pp. 280-282</ref> In addition, two small frigates or [[corvettes]] and two 18-gun sloops, including the ''Marte'' commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]], and several smaller vessels were captured either along the Cuban coast or in Havana harbour.<ref>Clowes p. 247</ref><ref>Cobbett p. 282</ref>\n\nAfter the capture, [[Prize money]] payments of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother.

Prado, Hevia and nine other military and civil officials were accused of treason and their trial was, in effect, a court martial, although it examined their actions actions during Prado's governorship as well as tactical decisions taken during the siege and although Prado and several officials were not military officers. The commission placed most of the blame on Prado and Hevia, finding them to have failed to fortify the Cabana hill properly and to have abandoned it too easily; to have crippled the Spanish fleet by sinking blockships that prevented the remainder taking action against the British and surrendered them intact rather than burning them; they had not mounted any significant counterattacks and, finally, had not removed the royal treasury before the surrender. After a lengthy trial, Pado was found guilty and sentenced to death, but was reprieved and died in prison. Hevia was sentenced to 10 years' house arrest and the loss of his office and titles, but was later pardoned and reinstated: a leading official, Juli\u00e1n de Arriaga, was dismissed from office.<ref name=\"Schneider224,227-229\">Schneider pp. 224, 227-229</ref> Velasco's family was ennobled and his son was created Marqu\u00e9s de Velasco del Morro, and Charles III decreed that there should thereafter be a ship named ''Velasco'' in the Spanish fleet.<ref>Cobbett p. 283</ref>\n\nThe loss of Havana and Western Cuba was a serious blow to Spain. Not only were the financial losses considerable; the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> These events confirmed British [[naval supremacy]] and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process. The invasions of Havana and Manilla were the catalyst for profound political and military reforms in the Spanish overseas empire.<ref name=\"Schneider222\">Schneider p. 222</ref>\n\nIt was clear to the Spanish authorities that their regular army in Cuba could not match the strength that the British army in America could concentrate against it. It was therefore necessary to form a disciplined colonial militia, with adequate weapons and training, supervised by experienced officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s,  with an organisation and uniforms similar to the regulars. The regular garrison of about 3,200 would be backed by a disciplined militia of eight infantry battalions and one regiment each of cavalry and dragoons, totaling 7,500 soldiers, with many of the officers from prominent Cuban families.<ref>Kuethe pp. 696-697, 700</ref>\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed  [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule.

After Spain abandoned its former policy of neutrality resulting on a British declaration of war in January 1762, the British government decided to mount an attack on the important Spanish fortress and naval base of [[Havana]], with the intention of weakening the [[Spanish Empire]] in the [[Caribbean]] and improving the security of its own North American colonies. A strong British naval force consisting of squadrons from Britain and the [[West Indies]], and the military force of British and North American troops it convoyed, were able to approach Havana from a direction that neither the Spanish governor and Admiral expected and were able to trap the Spanish fleet in Havana harbour and land its troops with relatively little resistance.\n\nThe Spanish authorities decided on a strategy of delaying the British attack until the strength of the city's defences and the onset of seasonal rains bringing tropical diseases would significantly reduce the size if the attacking force, and the start of hurricane season would force the British fleet to seek a safe anchorage. However, the city's main fortress, the [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) was overlooked by a hill that the governor had neglected to fortify: its capture lead to the eventual fall of the Morro Castle after fierce fighting and to the surrender of the city and the Spanish squadron before the hurricane season began.\n\nThe surrender of Havana led to substantial rewards for the British naval and military leaders and smaller amounts of [[prize money]] for other officers and men. The Spanish governor, Admiral and other military and civil office holders were tried in their return to Spain and punished for their failures to conduct a better defence and allowing the surrender if Spanish warships intact. Havana remained under British occupation until February 1763, when it was returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\nHavana in the late 18th century was a major port and naval base, and also the strongest fortress in Spanish America. Its royal shipyard with access to abundant supplies of resistant hardwoods was capable of building [[first-rate]] warships and had been developed by the Bourbon monarchy as the most important of its three naval shipyards.<ref name=\"Roger50\">Roger p. 50</ref><ref name=\"Schneider72-73\">Schneider pp. 72-73</ref> There had been several previous plans to attack Havana, including one proposed to [[Edward Vernon|Vernon]] in 1739, which he rejected in favour of an attack on  [[Battle of Porto Bello|Portobello]],<ref name=\"Bradley201\">Bradley p. 201</ref> but no successful attack since it was comprehensively fortified,<ref name=\"Schneider21\">Schneider p. 21</ref> and the strength of its fortifications and difficulty that large sailing warships would have in making an undetected approach from the north convinced the Spanish commanders it would be virtually impossible to capture, if its fortifications were in good order and it was properly garrisoned. Its wealth and ability to feed its population also suggested that it could resist being starved into surrender.<ref name=\"Roger50-51\">Roger pp. 50-51</ref><ref name=\"Schneider61,106\">Schneider pp. 61,106</ref>\n\nBritain had been formally at war with France since May 1756, but Spain under  [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]] remained neutral. After Ferdinand's death in 1759, his half-brother  [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], reversed Ferdinand's policy and, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1761)]], re-established the so-called  [[Pacte de Famille|Family Compact]] between France and Spain. This treaty involved an offensive alliance directed against Britain, and in December 1761, Spain placed an [[Economic sanctions|embargo]] on British trade, seized British goods in Spain and expelled British merchants. In response to this, Britain declared war on Spain in January 1762.<ref>Danley and Speelman pp. 431-432</ref>\n\n===Spanish preparations===\nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, Charles III made provisions to defend the [[Spanish colonies]] against the [[British Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as Captain General of Cuba, which was an administrative rather than a military post. De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city, although the work was incomplete at the time of the siege.<ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling 996 men, bringing the Havana garrison to 2,400 regular infantry. There were also 6,300 sailors and marines aboard the ships.<ref>Greentree p. 15</ref> However, [[yellow fever]] had reduced the defending forces of the city by the time the siege began to 1,900 regular infantry, 750 marines, around 5,000 sailors and 2,000 to 3,000 armed militia, besides several thousand more without firearms or training.<ref>Greentree p. 20</ref> The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]] with a 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel giving access to the harbour. Two strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel. On the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. However, it had been noted that most of its guns faced Havana's port and bay, and that it was overlooked by the unfortified hill of La Cabana. Although it had been proposed to fortify La Cabana, the project had been delayed and no guns had been installed there.<ref>Greentree p. 30</ref>The south side was defended by the older ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider68\">Schneider p. 68</ref> The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long.<ref name=\"Schneider54\">Schneider p. 54</ref>\n\n===British preparations===\nTwo days after the declaration of war with Spain, on the advice of  [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|Lord Anson]], the British cabinet chose Havana as a major objective in its attack on Spain because of its strategic importance, believing that its permanent loss would weaken Spanish influence in the Caribbean. Detailed plans were made for a combined naval and military attack on Havana, relying on the Royal Navy's superiority in numbers and effectiveness over the Spanish fleet. Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], with seven ships-of-the-line and a frigate and [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppelas]] his second-in-command, was to transport a military force under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]] to the [[West Indies]], to join the West Indies naval squadron, then under the command of  [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rear-Admiral Rodney]], who was undertaking operations against [[Martinique]], taking on additional troops there. The fleet was then to proceed to the northwest of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]) to embark 4,000 men from the British colonies in North America, commanded by [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]], and be further reinforced by a squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]], commanded by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]. It was to keep its final destination in doubt until it launched its amphibious attack on Havana.<ref name=\"Bradley223-224\">Bradley pp. 223-224</ref>\n\nThese plans were modified to meet circumstances, as Rodney and [[Robert Monckton| General ]Monckton] commanding the troops had captured Martinique before Pocock sailed, 3,000 British and American troops from New York did not arrive at Havana until late July, and the plan to take up to 2,000 slaves from [[Jamaica]] to act as [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]] only produced 600 slaves, as many owners were reluctant to part with them without a scheme for compensation.<ref>Poccock p. 197</ref><ref name=\"Schneider128\">Schneider p. 128</ref> A plan by Amherst to assemble a force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]] was dismissed by Albemarle as impractical as it would have left too few troops in the North American colonies.<ref>Danley and Speelman p.320</ref>\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]<ref>Fortescue p. 541</ref>\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports and shops carrying supplies and artillery.<ref>Thomas p. 2</ref>  The fleet arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.<ref>Pocock pp. 208-209</ref><ref name=\"Bradley224-225\">Bradley pp. 224-225</ref>  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of Martinique where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral Rodney's squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15. There was some friction between Rodney and Pocock, as the latter had been preferred for the naval command of this important expedition.<ref>Pocock pp. 210-211</ref> On 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue, was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]].<ref>Poccock p. 212</ref> The combined force now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nThe  normal approach to Havana, on the north coast of Cuba, was to sail west parallel to the south coast of the island on the prevailing south-easterly wind, then to round its western tip and sail east towards Havana, against the wind. This last section, more than 200 [[mile]]s long, would take a large squadron at least one week, and probably several, to complete, giving ample warning for Havana to prepare. To the north of Havana, reaching as far as [[the Bahamas]], is a wide expanse of shallow water, [[reef]]s and small islands or [[cay]]s], accessible only to small boats except for one deep water channel, the [[Old Bahama Channel]] which is only some 10 miles wide at its narrowest. Although the Spanish navigators that charted it thought too dangerous for large warships, it was surveyed by a British frigate, whose captain left parties of his men in the cays to mark the extremities of the channel, allowing the whole fleet to pass through it, safely and undetected.<ref name=\"Bradley225\">Bradley p. 225</ref><ref name=\"Roger50-52\">Roger pp. 50-52</ref> \n\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet.<ref>Poccock pp. 217-218</ref> After surveying the city's defences, the British planned to begin the operations with the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender.<ref>Poccock pp. 223-224</ref> However, the initial survey had underestimated the strength of the Morro fortress, which was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.<ref>Poccock p. 210</ref>\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nAlthough Prado had received information of the presence of English ships two days before its arrival from a frigate that had escaped from the port of [[Matanzas]], he did not believe that major warships could navigate the Old Bahama Channel.<ref>Thomas p. 3</ref> Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy. Prado wrote to the French in Saint-Domingue and to Spain for relief forces to be sent.<ref name=\"Schneider120\">Schneider p. 120</ref> He also requested reinforcements from [[Santiago de Cuba]], which had the second strongest military force on the island, and although two relief forces set out from the [[Oriente Province]] in July, both were delayed by food shortages and high levels of sickness. One turned back and the other was still one day's march from Havana when the city surrendered.<ref>Johnson pp. 52-53</ref> Besides hope of a relief force, Prado and the Havana garrison had several advantages. Firstly, the [[hurricane]] season would begin in late August, putting the British fleet in danger: the wet weather starting earlier in that month would probably also initiate an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers.<ref name=\"Schneider126-127\">Schneider pp. 126-127</ref> Secondly, despite some losses from tropical diseases Prado had 1,500 Spanish regular soldiers and some 2,300 colonial [[militiamen]], as well as sailors from the fleet.<ref name=\"Schneider121, 126-127\">Schneider pp. 121, 126-127</ref>\n\nThere were initially 12 Spanish ships of the line in the harbour,<ref>Thomas p. 1</ref> besides two others newly constructed but not manned, and also several smaller warships and around 100 merchant ships. The presence of so many merchant ships dissuaded the council from ordering the Spanish fleet to disrupt the British landings, which was also in accordance with the instructions that Admiral Hevia had received when he left Spain to protect Cuba's commerce<ref>Thomas pp. 3-4</ref> The fleet's gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref> Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city. Prado also ordered all women, children and the old and infirm to leave the city, leaving only men able to bear arms.<ref name=\"Schneider135\">Schneider p. 135</ref>\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Additionally, three ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected on account of their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Although this made the remaining Spanish warships unable to leave the harbour, they were clearly outnumbered by the English fleet, and this move made the sailors available to defend the city. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.<ref name=\"Schneider122\">Schneider p. 122</ref>\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day.<ref>Guiteras pp. 79-80</ref> They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana.<ref>Pockock p. 221</ref>  The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref>\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the La Cabana heights.<ref>Guiteras p. 84</ref> Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref> With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance.<ref>Pockock p. 227</ref> Charles III of Spain had earlier instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent of those relating to the fortifications. The task had been started but no guns had been installed.<ref name=\"Bradley226-227\">Bradley pp. 226-227</ref><ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]], on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro.<ref>Pockock pp. 223-224</ref> Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead.<ref name=\"Bradley227-228\">Bradley pp. 227-228</ref> He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.<ref>Pockock p. 229</ref>  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.<ref>Pockock pp. 230-231</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']].<ref>Guiteras pp. 95-96</ref> The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high.<ref>Pockock pp. 231-232</ref>  Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June.<ref>Pockock p. 237</ref> Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 97</ref>\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength.<ref>Poccock p. 230</ref> Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro.<ref>Guiteras p. 104</ref> Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress.\nWith the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro.<ref>Guiteras pp. 104-105</ref> Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.<ref>Guiteras pp. 107-108</ref>\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived.<ref>Guiteras pp. 116-117</ref><ref>Pockock p. 222</ref> These reinforcements, who had been attacked by the French during their journey, with the loss through capture of some 500 men, consisted of:<ref>Fortescue p. 543</ref>\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\nBy 25th July 5,000 soldiers and 3,000 sailors were sick.<ref>Thomas p. 5</ref>\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 239</ref> At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref> Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort.<ref>Guiteras pp. 124-125</ref> Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider116,124\">Schneider pp. 116, 124</ref>\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay.<ref>Pockock pp. 226-227</ref> Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.<ref>Guiteras p. 142</ref>\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana.<ref>Guiteras p. 144</ref> A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m.

They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized nine ships of the line in Havana harbour, representing one-fifth of the strength of the Spanish Navy,<ref>Cobbett p. 282</ref> namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with a ship of 78 guns belonging  to the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana, a number of smaller armed vessels belonging to it and the Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas and nearly 100 merchant ships.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Navy Records Society |title=Publications of the Navy Records Society, Volume 114 |date=1970 |publisher=Navy Records Society |page=289 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EKSmla8zHzIC&dq=}}</ref> Two new almost-completed ships of the line in the dockyard, the ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (80), were burnt.<ref>Clowes p. 247</ref><ref>Cobbett pp. 280-282</ref> In addition, two small frigates or [[corvettes]] and two 18-gun sloops, including the ''Marte'' commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]], and several smaller vessels were captured either along the Cuban coast or in Havana harbour.<ref>Clowes p. 247</ref><ref>Cobbett p. 282</ref>\n\nAfter the capture, [[Prize money]] payments of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref> The military second-in-command,  [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lieutenant-General Eliott]], received the same amount as Commodore Keppel, as the two shared a fifteenth part of the prize pool, as against the third shared by their commanders.<ref>Pockock p. 216</ref> Elliot was able to buy [[Heathfield Park|Bayley Park]] in [[East Sussex]] which he altered and enlarged.<ref name=\"Schneider179\">Schneider p. 179</ref> Privates in the army received just over \u00a34 and ordinary seamen rather less than \u00a34 each.<ref>Cobbett p. 283</ref>\n\n[[File:The Piazza at Havana RMG BHC0418.tiff|thumb|British troops at the [[Plaza Vieja, Havana|Plaza Vieja]] during their occupation of Havana]]\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf&Dorsey\">Diefendorf & Dorsey p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival.

Prado, Hevia and nine other military and civil officials were accused of treason and their trial was, in effect, a court martial, although it examined their actions actions during Prado's governorship as well as tactical decisions taken during the siege and although Prado and several officials were not military officers. The commission placed most of the blame on Prado and Hevia, finding them to have failed to fortify the Cabana hill properly and to have abandoned it too easily; to have crippled the Spanish fleet by sinking blockships that prevented the remainder taking action against the British and surrendered them intact rather than burning them; they had not mounted any significant counterattacks and, finally, had not removed the royal treasury before the surrender. After a lengthy trial, Pado was found guilty and sentenced to death, but was reprieved and died in prison. Hevia was sentenced to 10 years' house arrest and the loss of his office and titles, but was later pardoned and reinstated: a leading official, Juli\u00e1n de Arriaga, was dismissed from office.<ref name=\"Schneider224,227-229\">Schneider pp. 224, 227-229</ref> Velasco's family was ennobled and his son was created Marqu\u00e9s de Velasco del Morro, and Charles III decreed that there should thereafter be a ship named ''Velasco'' in the Spanish fleet.<ref>Cobbett p. 283</ref>\n\nThe loss of Havana and Western Cuba was a serious blow to Spain. Not only were the financial losses considerable; the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> These events confirmed British [[naval supremacy]] and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process. The invasions of Havana and Manilla were the catalyst for profound political and military reforms in the Spanish overseas empire.<ref name=\"Schneider222\">Schneider p. 222</ref>\n\nIt was clear to the Spanish authorities that their regular army in Cuba could not match the strength that the British army in America could concentrate against it. It was therefore necessary to form a disciplined colonial militia, with adequate weapons and training, supervised by experienced officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s,  with an organisation and uniforms similar to the regulars. The regular garrison of about 3,200 would be backed by a disciplined militia of eight infantry battalions and one regiment each of cavalry and dragoons, totaling 7,500 soldiers, with many of the officers from prominent Cuban families.<ref>Kuethe pp. 696-697, 700</ref>\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed  [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule.

The company produces visual effects for feature films, television and commercials. As of 2019, Pixomondo employs over 655 people worldwide.\n\n== History ==\n\nPixomondo was founded in [[Pfungstadt]], [[Germany]] as a design studio in 2001 by Thilo Kuther. The company began its work creating [[video installation]]s and 3D-animations for high-end corporate clients such as [[Porsche]] and [[Bertelsmann]]. By the end of 2003, Pixomondo consisted of its one office in Pfungstadt and 40 employees. In 2005, the company first began working in the entertainment business by producing the visual effects for the German television film ''Atlantropa - Der Traum vom neuen Kontinent''. In 2005, a second location, specializing in feature films, opened in [[Ludwigsburg]], [[Germany]]. At this location, the company produced nearly all the visual effects for the international feature film ''[[The Red Baron (2008 film)|The Red Baron]]'', which was released in 2008, and earned Pixomondo first international recognition. In the same year, the first studio abroad opened in London. In 2007 and 2008, studios were opened in [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Los Angeles]], respectively. Also in 2008, Pixomondo was commissioned by director [[Roland Emmerich]] to produce over 100 complete [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]]-environments for his feature film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]''. Pixomondo's first offices in Asia, specifically in [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]], were opened in 2009. In 2011, the company expanded its London office and added two studios in [[Munich]] and [[Hamburg]], as well as one in [[Toronto]] in 2011.\n\nOn February 26, 2012, Pixomondo won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] for its work on the film ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]''. The award was presented to [[Alex Henning]] and [[Ben Grossmann]], who were the supervisors of the project. With 854 scenes that have a running time of about 62 minutes in the final film, Pixomondo produced about 94% of the films visual effects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/oscars/nominations/|title=Oscars Guide|website=IMDb|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\nPixomondo closed its London office in February 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roxborough|first=Scott|title=VFX Group Pixomondo Shuts Down Offices in London|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vfx-group-pixomondo-closes-offices-424559|work=Variety|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2013-11-26}}</ref> In 2013, Pixomondo closed its Shanghai and Berlin offices, naming restructuring processes as a reason for the closures.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lang|first=Brett|title=Pixomondo, VFX Company for \u2018Oblivion,\u2019 Closes Berlin Office|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/pixomondo-closes-berlin-office-88231|work=The Wrap|date=2013-04-29|accessdate=2013-11-26}}</ref>  In 2014, the office in Shanghai reopened.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Locations/Pixomondo|url=http://www.pixomondo.com/losangeles/|publisher=Pixomondo|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> In 2018, Mayfair Equity Partners completed a majority investment in Pixomondo.

Los Angeles, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Vancouver, Beijing, Toronto, Montreal and Shanghai. The company produces visual effects for feature films, television and commercials. As of 2019, Pixomondo employs over 655 people worldwide.\n\n== History ==\n\nPixomondo was founded in [[Pfungstadt]], [[Germany]] as a design studio in 2001 by Thilo Kuther. The company began its work creating [[video installation]]s and 3D-animations for high-end corporate clients such as [[Porsche]] and [[Bertelsmann]]. By the end of 2003, Pixomondo consisted of its one office in Pfungstadt and 40 employees. In 2005, the company first began working in the entertainment business by producing the visual effects for the German television film ''Atlantropa - Der Traum vom neuen Kontinent''. In 2005, a second location, specializing in feature films, opened in [[Ludwigsburg]], [[Germany]]. At this location, the company produced nearly all the visual effects for the international feature film ''[[The Red Baron (2008 film)|The Red Baron]]'', which was released in 2008, and earned Pixomondo first international recognition. In the same year, the first studio abroad opened in London. In 2007 and 2008, studios were opened in [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Los Angeles]], respectively. Also in 2008, Pixomondo was commissioned by director [[Roland Emmerich]] to produce over 100 complete [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]]-environments for his feature film ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]''. Pixomondo's first offices in Asia, specifically in [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing]], were opened in 2009. In 2011, the company expanded its London office and added two studios in [[Munich]] and [[Hamburg]], as well as one in [[Toronto]] in 2011.\n\nOn February 26, 2012, Pixomondo won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] for its work on the film ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]''. The award was presented to [[Alex Henning]] and [[Ben Grossmann]], who were the supervisors of the project. With 854 scenes that have a running time of about 62 minutes in the final film, Pixomondo produced about 94% of the films visual effects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/oscars/nominations/|title=Oscars Guide|website=IMDb|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\nPixomondo closed its London office in February 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Roxborough|first=Scott|title=VFX Group Pixomondo Shuts Down Offices in London|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vfx-group-pixomondo-closes-offices-424559|work=Variety|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2013-11-26}}</ref> In 2013, Pixomondo closed its Shanghai and Berlin offices, naming restructuring processes as a reason for the closures.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lang|first=Brett|title=Pixomondo, VFX Company for \u2018Oblivion,\u2019 Closes Berlin Office|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/pixomondo-closes-berlin-office-88231|work=The Wrap|date=2013-04-29|accessdate=2013-11-26}}</ref>  In 2014, the office in Shanghai reopened.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Locations/Pixomondo|url=http://www.pixomondo.com/losangeles/|publisher=Pixomondo|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> In 2018, Mayfair Equity Partners completed a majority investment in Pixomondo.
