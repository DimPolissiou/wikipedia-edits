[[Gautama Buddha]], who founded Buddhism, was born to the [[Shakya]] clan just before [[Magadha]] (which lasted from 546\u2013324 BCE) rose to power. His family was native to the plains of [[Lumbini]], in what is now southern [[Nepal]]. [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] peaked during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]], who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.<ref name=\"Heehs_2002_106\">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=106}}.</ref> [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the [[Kushan Empire]] and such kingdoms as [[Magadha]] and [[Kosala]].\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under [[Sankaracharya]], the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and [[ahimsa]], etc. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the [[Bhakti]] tradition, Vaishnavism and the [[Baul]]s of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] period.\n\n=== Bhakti Movement ===\nDuring the 14th\u201317th centuries, when North India was under Muslim rule, the [[Bhakti movement|'' Bhakti'' movement]] swept through Central and Northern India. The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth-century in south India (present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and gradually spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabhacharya]], [[Surdas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdeo]], [[Eknath]], [[Ramdas]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}, [[Tukaram]] and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a [[Chamar]] of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a [[Chuhra|Chura]]{{dubious|date=April 2020}} of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a [[Bhangi]] of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Sikhism in India}}\n[[File:Darshani_Deori_27_September_2018.jpg|thumb|Sikh pilgrims at the causeway to the sanctum of the [[Harmandir Sahib]], the holiest Sikh [[Gurdwara]]]]\n[[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] (1469\u20131539) was the founder of [[Sikhism]].

Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population. Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and is a significant religion in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Ladakh]], [[Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]] and the Lahaul and [[Spiti]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in [[Maharashtra]]. They are the Neo-Buddhists or [[Navayana]] Buddhists who, under the influence of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of [[Chittagong]] behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzing Gyatso]] to India fleeing Chinese occupation of [[Tibet]] in 1959 and the setting up of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] at [[Dharamshala]] in [[Mcleodganj]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in [[Sikkim]], which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n[[Jainism]] is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in [[Iron Age India]]. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of [[Gujarat]], Karnataka, [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], and [[Rajasthan]].<ref name=web123/>\n\n[[Sikhism]] began in fifteenth-century [[North India]] with the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]] and nine successive human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]]. As of 2011, there were 20.8 million [[Sikhism in India|Sikhs in India]]. [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] is the spiritual home of Sikhs, and is the only state in India where Sikhs form a majority.

The [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]] compose the smaller ''[[Chota Char Dham]]'' (''mini four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit. The [[Kumbh Mela]] (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated amongst Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]]. The [[Swamithope pathi|Thalaimaippathi]] at [[Swamithope]] is the leading pilgrim center for the [[Ayyavazhi]]s.\n\nAmongst the [[Buddhist pilgrimage#The Eight Great Places|Eight Great Places]] of Buddhism, seven are in India. [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinagar]] are the places where important events in the life of Gautama Buddha took place. [[Sanchi]] hosts a Buddhist [[stupa]] erected by the emperor [[Ashoka]]. Many Buddhist monasteries dot the Himalayan foothills of India, where [[Buddhism]] remains a major presence. These include the [[Rumtek Monastery]], [[Enchey Monastery]] and [[Pemayangtse Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], the [[Tawang Monastery]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the [[Kye Monastery]] and [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Spiti]], the [[Ghum Monastery]] in [[Darjeeling]],  and [[Durpin Dara]] Monastery in Kalimpong, the [[Thikse Monastery]] in [[Leh]], the [[Namgyal Monastery]] in [[Dharamsala|Dharamshala]], among many others.\n\nFor Muslims, the ''Dargah Shareef'' of Khwaza [[Moinuddin Chishti]] in [[Ajmer]] is a major pilgrimage site.

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the ''Prajapatis'' for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Blake Michael \u2013 The Origins of Virasaiva Sects, 1992 \u2013 Motilal Banarsidass Pub</ref> This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of [[Rahukaalam]], in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrojyotish.com/rahu-kalam/|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset.

The British Library Archives, London.</ref>]]\n\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody [[Partition of India]]. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of [[Hindu nationalism]] versus [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his ''Shanti sainiks'' (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in [[Bengal]], including riots in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now in [[West Bengal]]) and [[Noakhali District]] (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[Direct Action Day]], which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|1987|pp=45\u201346}}.</ref>\n\nMajor post-independence communal conflicts include the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]], which followed [[Operation Blue Star]] by the [[Indian Army]]; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the [[Khalistan movement|Sikh partisans]] inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest [[Gurdwara]].

[[Gautama Buddha]], who founded Buddhism, was born to the [[Shakya]] clan just before [[Magadha]] (which lasted from 546\u2013324 BCE) rose to power. His family was native to the plains of [[Lumbini]], in what is now southern [[Nepal]]. [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] peaked during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]], who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.<ref name=\"Heehs_2002_106\">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=106}}.</ref> [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the [[Kushan Empire]] and such kingdoms as [[Magadha]] and [[Kosala]].\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under [[Sankaracharya]], the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and [[ahimsa]], etc. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the [[Bhakti]] tradition, Vaishnavism and the [[Baul]]s of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] period.\n\n=== Bhakti Movement ===\nDuring the 14th\u201317th centuries, when North India was under Muslim rule, the [[Bhakti movement|'' Bhakti'' movement]] swept through Central and Northern India. The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth-century in south India (present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and gradually spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabhacharya]], [[Surdas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdeo]], [[Eknath]], [[Ramdas]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}, [[Tukaram]] and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a [[Chamar]] of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a [[Chuhra|Chura]]{{dubious|date=April 2020}} of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a [[Bhangi]] of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Sikhism in India}}\n[[File:Darshani_Deori_27_September_2018.jpg|thumb|Sikh pilgrims at the causeway to the sanctum of the [[Harmandir Sahib]], the holiest Sikh [[Gurdwara]]]]\n[[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] (1469\u20131539) was the founder of [[Sikhism]].

Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population. Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and is a significant religion in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Ladakh]], [[Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]] and the Lahaul and [[Spiti]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in [[Maharashtra]]. They are the Neo-Buddhists or [[Navayana]] Buddhists who, under the influence of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of [[Chittagong]] behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzing Gyatso]] to India fleeing Chinese occupation of [[Tibet]] in 1959 and the setting up of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] at [[Dharamshala]] in [[Mcleodganj]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in [[Sikkim]], which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n[[Jainism]] is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in [[Iron Age India]]. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of [[Gujarat]], Karnataka, [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], and [[Rajasthan]].<ref name=web123/>\n\n[[Sikhism]] began in fifteenth-century [[North India]] with the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]] and nine successive human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]].

Hindus worldwide recognise several Indian holy cities, including [[Allahabad]] (officially known as Prayagraj), [[Haridwar]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ujjain]], [[Rameshwaram]] and [[Vrindavan]]. Notable temple cities include [[Puri]], which hosts a major [[Jagannath]] temple and [[Rath Yatra]] celebration; [[Tirumala - Tirupati]], home to the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]]; and [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]], home to the [[Vaishno Devi]] temple.\n\n[[Badrinath]], [[Puri]], [[Dwarka]] and [[Rameswaram]] compose the main pilgrimage circuit of ''[[Char Dham]]'' (''four abodes'') hosting the four holiest [[Hindu]] temples:  [[Badrinath Temple]], [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]], [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarkadheesh Temple]] and [[Ramanathaswamy Temple]] respectively. The [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]] compose the smaller ''[[Chota Char Dham]]'' (''mini four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit. The [[Kumbh Mela]] (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated amongst Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]]. The [[Swamithope pathi|Thalaimaippathi]] at [[Swamithope]] is the leading pilgrim center for the [[Ayyavazhi]]s.\n\nAmongst the [[Buddhist pilgrimage#The Eight Great Places|Eight Great Places]] of Buddhism, seven are in India. [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinagar]] are the places where important events in the life of Gautama Buddha took place. [[Sanchi]] hosts a Buddhist [[stupa]] erected by the emperor [[Ashoka]]. Many Buddhist monasteries dot the Himalayan foothills of India, where [[Buddhism]] remains a major presence. These include the [[Rumtek Monastery]], [[Enchey Monastery]] and [[Pemayangtse Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], the [[Tawang Monastery]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the [[Kye Monastery]] and [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Spiti]], the [[Ghum Monastery]] in [[Darjeeling]],  and [[Durpin Dara]] Monastery in Kalimpong, the [[Thikse Monastery]] in [[Leh]], the [[Namgyal Monastery]] in [[Dharamsala|Dharamshala]], among many others.\n\nFor Muslims, the ''Dargah Shareef'' of Khwaza [[Moinuddin Chishti]] in [[Ajmer]] is a major pilgrimage site. Other Islamic pilgrimages include those to the Tomb of Sheikh [[Salim Chishti]] in [[Fatehpur Sikri]], [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] in Delhi, and to [[Haji Ali Dargah]] in Mumbai. [[Dilwara Temples]] in [[Mount Abu]], [[Palitana]], [[Pawapuri|Pavapuri]], [[Girnar]] and [[Shravanabelagola]] are notable pilgrimage sites ([[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]) in Jainism.\n\nThe [[Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]] is the most sacred [[gurdwara]] of Sikhism, while the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed House of Worship#Delhi, India|Lotus Temple]] in Delhi is a prominent house of worship of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith.\n\nRelatively new pilgrimage sites include the [[samadhi]] of [[Meher Baba]] in [[Meherabad]], which is visited by his followers from around the world <ref>[http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf \"In His Service: A Newsletter From Meherabad\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073059/http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}.

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the ''Prajapatis'' for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Blake Michael \u2013 The Origins of Virasaiva Sects, 1992 \u2013 Motilal Banarsidass Pub</ref> This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of [[Rahukaalam]], in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrojyotish.com/rahu-kalam/|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include ''Gudivada'', ''Padalapalli'', ''Pantham'', and ''[[Kashyap]]''.<ref name=\"reference\"/>\n\n== Religion and politics ==\n{{Main|Indian Mujahideen|Jamaat-e-Islami Hind|List of organizations banned by the Government of India}}\n{{See also|Status of religious freedom in India}}\n\n[[File: Takht Shri Hazoor Sahib Gurudwara Nanded.JPG|right|250px|thumb|[[Takht Sri Hazur Sahib]], [[Nanded]], built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh Ji was cremated in 1708, the inner chamber is still called ''Angitha Sahib''.]]\n\n=== Politics ===\nReligious politics, particularly that expressed by the [[Hindutva]] movement, has strongly influenced [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] in the last quarter of the 20th century.

The British Library Archives, London.</ref>]]\n\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody [[Partition of India]]. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of [[Hindu nationalism]] versus [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his ''Shanti sainiks'' (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in [[Bengal]], including riots in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now in [[West Bengal]]) and [[Noakhali District]] (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[Direct Action Day]], which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|1987|pp=45\u201346}}.</ref>\n\nMajor post-independence communal conflicts include the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]], which followed [[Operation Blue Star]] by the [[Indian Army]]; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the [[Khalistan movement|Sikh partisans]] inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest [[Gurdwara]].

His father Francis was known by his middle name Robert and was born about 1799 in Dublin. Initially Robert was a singer and songwriter. He turned to scene painting when his voice failed him. His ditty \u2018The literary Dustman\u2019 was published in 1832 and he financed the Colosseum Diorama and Exhibition Space, Regents Park. He was responsible for the enormous diorama \u201cLondon by Night\u201d, the Colosseum's opening attraction. Robert was married twice, first in 1820 to Mary Ann Adams who died in 1827 and then to Sarah Harris in 1829. Sarah died in 1849 so Robert was left to bring up his children alone. The Colosseum closed in 1864 just 2 years before Robert's death in 1866. He was buried at Kensal Green London.\n\nIn 1871, a year before Henry began exhibiting at the Royal Academy he was living with his uncle Frederick Young and aunt Sarah in Kentish Town.\n\nHenry is listed as a landscape painter. No doubt Henry leaned some of his skills from his grandfather, helping him paint scenes in the theatre. Ten years later Henry is married to Ruth, living in Chelsea and has a six-month-old daughter Esther.\n\nAt the turn of the century Henry moved to Chadwell Heath, in 1901 he was living at The Studio, Mill Lane, later buying the New Villa on Whalebone Lane with his wife and daughter, now a school teacher, his mother in law Ann Wheeler, sister in law Harriet Cave and niece Alice Cave.\n\nHenry Gillard Glindoni R.B.A., A.R.W.S  died on 20 November 1913.

He also tried his hand at [[porcelain painting]]. Encouraged to study art, he attended [[Frederick Denison Maurice|Maurice]]'s [[Working Men's College]] and the Castle Street School of Art after encouragement from fellow actors to study art.\n\nGlindoni's speciality was that of 17th and 18th century costume and he was noted for his paintings of Cardinals.

Possibly originating in [[Scandinavia]], the Heruli are first mentioned by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors as one of several \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" groups raiding Roman provinces in the Balkans and Aegean, attacking by land, and notably also by sea. During this time they reportedly lived near the [[Sea of Azov]]. \n\nFrom the 4th century AD the Heruli were one of the peoples dominated by the empire of [[Attila]] the Hun. By 454, after the death of [[Attila]], they established their own kingdom on the [[Middle Danube]], and Heruli also participated in successive conquests of [[Italy]] by [[Odoacer]], [[Theoderic the Great]], [[Narses]] and probably also the [[Lombards]].

The Sarmatians had in the 1st century AD replaced the [[Bastarnae]], who are believed to have been a Germanic people. The arrival of the Heruli has been seen as part of a bigger cultural shift in this region, involving the migration from the northwest of Germanic peoples, who replaced the Sarmatians as the dominant power in the region.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=116}}\n\nThe first relatively clear mention of the Heruli by Graeco-Roman writers concerns two major campaigns into the Balkans of 267/268 and 269/270.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=124}} Goths, Heruli (sometimes referred to as \"Eluri\", \u1f1c\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, in this context), and other \"Scythian\" peoples from the region of the Sea of Azov, took control of [[Black Sea]] Greek cities, and gained a fleet that they used to launch raids along the northern [[Black Sea]] and as far as Greece and [[Asia Minor]]. These invasions began in the reign of [[Gallienus]] (260-268 AD), and continued until at least 269 during the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus|Marcus Aurelius Claudius]], who subsequently took up the title \"Gothicus\" due to his victory.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=55-66}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=322-327}}\n\nIn 267, Heruli (\u0391\u1f34\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9) commanded a naval attack from the Sea of Azov, past the Danube delta, and into the straits of the [[Bosphorus]] where they took control of [[Byzantion]] and [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Chrysopolis]], both near Constantinople itself. They then retreated to the Black sea, before returning, raiding [[Cyzicus]] and then entering the Aegean sea where they troubled [[Lemnos]], [[Skyros]] and [[Imbros]], before landing near [[Sparta]] and plundering the [[Peloponnese]], including not only Sparta, but also [[Corinth]], [[Argos]], and the sanctuary of Zeus at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Still within 267 they reached [[Athens]], where local militias had to defend the city. It seems to have been the Heruli specifically who [[Sack of Athens (267 AD)|sacked]] Athens despite the construction of a new wall, during [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]\u2019s reign only a generation earlier.

A Herulian chieftain named Andonnoballus is said to have switched to the Roman side, and this was once again a case where Heruli appear to have joined the Roman military.

This question arises because of the evidence of Heruli activity in the western Roman empire. The existence of this western kingdom is increasingly doubted.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=328}} \n\nHeruli were already seen in western Europe before the empire of Attila, at the time of their first ambitious campaigns in the east. In 268 [[Claudius Mamertinus]] reported the victory of [[Maximian]] over a group of Heruli and Chaibones (known only from this one report{{efn|The Chaibones may have been [[Aviones]], according to Neumann, ''Namenstudien zum Altgermanischen'', p. 316.}}) attacking Gaul. \n\nIt is believed that it was from this time that the Romans instituted a Herulian auxiliary unit, the ''Heruli seniores'', who were stationed in northern Italy. This ''numerus Erulorum'' was a lightly-equipped unit often associated with the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an ''Batavi seniores''. In 366 the Batavians and Heruli fought against [[Alamanni]] near the Rhine, under the leadership of [[Charietto]] who died in the battle, and then against [[Picts]] and [[Scoti]] in Britain. They were subsequently sent to fight [[Parthia]]ns in the east.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=67}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nIn 405 or 406, a large number of barbarian groups [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed the Rhine]], entering the Roman empire, and the Heruli appear in the list of peoples given by the historian [[Jerome]]. However this list is sometimes thought to have drawn on historical lists for literary effect. \n\nLater mentions of Heruli in western incidents where they were not clearly connected to the Roman military include two sea raids in northern Spain in the 450s, and the presence of Heruli at the Visigothic court of [[Euric]] in about 475.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}} The raids were reported by [[Hydatius]]. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] mentions Heruli at the Visigothic court in 476, although this is in a poetic letter. Recent scholars such as Steinacher and Halsall have pointed out that this type of evidence is consistent with the internal military conflicts that were happening in the Roman empire during this period. Halsall for example writes that it \"must at least be a possibility that their raid constituted part of a Romano-Visigothic offensive against the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Sueves]]\" who had been part of an invasion of the same area.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=260}} Steinacher demonstrates using examples from the period, including Charietto's life story, that barbarian soldiers could switch from being Roman soldier, to pirate, and back to soldier.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=69-73}} \n\nThe Greek poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] specifically imagined the Heruli he saw at Euric's court as Oceanic sea-farers, but Steinacher argues that this raiding by sea was simply a logical strategy for Visigothic campaigns against the Iberian Suevi, and difficult to use as a proof that the Heruli had a coastal kingdom somewhere in the north.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=74}}<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/sidonius_letters_08book8.htm Letters 8.9]</ref>\n{{quote|In reality, there is nothing special about attacks from the sea: various marauders employed such tactics at various points in history.

During this period, the Huns and their allies begin to be found in this same area instead, having crossed the [[Carpathians]] from the east.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=Ch.5}} By 450 AD, the Heruli were firmly part of the Hunnic empire of [[Attila]]. The Gepids, Rugi, [[Scirii]] and many Goths, Alans and Sarmatians were also part of Attila's empire.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=208}} They were among the peoples who are reported as having fought for Attila at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]].\n\nAfter the death of Attila, his sons lost power over the various peoples of his empire at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454. The centre of this alliance was now settled upon the Roman border north of the [[Middle Danube]]. Heruli who were possibly on the winning side with the [[Gepids]], were subsequently among the several peoples now able to form a kingdom in that area. The Herulian kingdom, was established north of modern [[Vienna]] and [[Bratislava]], near the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] river, and possibly extending as far east as the [[Little Carpathians]]. They ruled over a mixed population including Suevi, Huns and Alans.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=340}} Compared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms in this period, Peter Heather has described this Heruli kingdom as \"middle-sized\", similar to the [[Rugii|Rugian]] one, but \"clearly not as militarily powerful, say, as the Gothic, Lombard, or Gepid confederations which generated much longer-lived political entities, and into which elements of the Rugi and Heruli were eventually absorbed\".{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=242}}\n\nFrom this region the life story of [[Severinus of Noricum]] reports that the Heruli attacked Ioviaco near [[Passau]] in 480.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=340}}  The Heruli do not appear in early lists of Odoacer's allies after Nedao, but benefited from the downfall of his people the Scirii. They established control on the Roman (south) side of the Danube, north of [[Lake Balaton]] in modern Hungary when they were apparently able to take over the kingdoms of the Suevi and Scirii, who had been under pressure from the Ostrogoths, who continued to press their old allies from the south.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=341}}\n\n[[Odoacer]], the commander of the Imperial ''[[foederati]]'' troops who deposed the last [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] in 476 AD came to be seen as king over several of the Danubian peoples including the Heruli, and the Heruli were strongly associated with his Italian kingdom. The Heruli on the Danube also took control of the Rugian territories, who had become competitors to Odoacer and been defeated by him in 488. However Heruli suffered badly in Italy, as loyalists of Odoacer, when he was defeated by the Ostrogoth [[Theoderic]]. \n\nBy 500 the Herulian kingdom on the Danube, apparently by now under a king named [[Rodulf_(petty_king)#King_of_the_Heruls|Rodulph]], had made peace with Theoderic and become his allies.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=338-345}} [[Paul the Deacon]] also mentions Heruli living in Italy under Ostrogothic rule.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=347}} Peter Heather estimates that the Herulian kingdom could muster an army of 5,000-10,000 men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=251}}\n\n[[File:Southeastern Europe in 520, showing the Byzantine Empire under Justin I and the Ostrogothic kingdom.png|thumb|Polities in southeastern Europe c.500 AD before the Lombard destruction of the Herulian kingdom]]\nTheoderic's efforts to build a system of alliances in Western Europe were made difficult both by counter diplomacy, for example between [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] [[Franks]] and the [[Byzantine empire]], and also the arrival of a new Germanic people into the Danubian region, the [[Lombards]] who were initially under Herule hegemony.

Here they suffered famine. They sought refuge among the Gepids, but wanting to avoid being mistreated by them crossed the Danube came under East Roman authority.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=350}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=144-145}} \n\n[[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius Caesar]] allowed them to resettle depopulated \"lands and cities\" in the empire in 512.

Under his encouragement, the Herule king Grepes converted to Orthodox Christianity in 528 together with some nobles and twelve relatives.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=351-352}} Procopius who felt that this made them somewhat gentler, also showed in his account of the wars against the African Vandals, that some of them were [[Arianism|Arian]] christians.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}}\n\nThe Heruli were often mentioned during the times of [[Justinian]], who used them in his extensive military campaigns in many countries including [[Italy]], [[Syria]], and North [[Africa]]. [[Pharas the Herulian|Pharas]] was a notable Herulian commander during this period. Several thousand Heruli served in the personal guard of [[Belisarius]] throughout the campaigns, and [[Narses]] also recruited from them. They were a participant in the [[Byzantine-Sasanian wars]], such as the [[Battle of Anglon]].\n\nGrepes and most of his family had apparently died by the early 540s, possibly in the [[Plague of Justinian]] (541-542).{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=147}} [[Procopius]] related that in the 540s the Heruli who had been settled in the Roman Balkans killed their own king Ochus and, not wanting the one assigned by the emperor, Suartuas, they made contact with the Heruli who had gone to Thule decades earlier, seeking a new king. Their first choice fell sick and died when they had come to the country of the Dani, and a second choice was made. The new king Datius arrived with his brother Aordus and 200 young men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=225}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}} The Heruli who were sent against Suartuas defected with him and were supported by the empire. The supporters of Datius, two thirds of the Heruli, submitted to the Gepids.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}} This period of rebellion against Rome lasted approximately 545-548, the period immediately before conflict between their larger neighbours the Gepids and Lombards broke out, but this rebellion was repressed by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|pp=393-397}}\n \nIn 549, when the Gepids fought the Romans, and Heruli fought on both sides.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=394}} In any case after one generation in the Belgrade area, the Herulian federate polity in the Balkans disappears from the surviving historical records, apparently replaced by the incoming [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]].{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}}\n\nPeter Heather has written that: \n{{quote|by c.540 being a Herule had ceased to be the main determinant of individual behaviour; the Heruli had ceased to operate together on the basis of that shared heritage, and different Heruli were adopting different strategies for survival in the new political conditions which even caused them to fight on opposing sides. After c.540, we still find small groups called Heruli fighting for the East Romans in Italy, and it is noticeable that the Roman commanders were careful to appoint for them leaders of their own race. Thus some sense of identity probably remained. That said, we are clearly dealing with a few fragments of the original group, and, in the prevailing circumstances, Herule identity had no future.{{sfn|Heather|1998|p=109}}}}\n\nSarantis however shows that the Belgrade-region Heruli continued to be recruited, and to play a role in local conflicts involving the Gepids and Lombards, into the 550s. Suartas, a Herule general for the Romans, led Herule forces against the Gepids in 552 for example.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=385}} However it appears that by this period the semi-independent Heruli near Belgrade became Roman provincials.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=402}}\n\nIn 566, Sinduald, a Herule military leader under Narses, was declared a king of Heruli in [[Trentino]] in northern Italy, but he was executed by Narses. Sinduald was said to be a descendant of the Herules who had already entered Italy under Odoacer.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=355}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=159}}\n\n[[Paul the Deacon]] writes that many Heruli joined the Lombard king [[Alboin]] in their eventual conquest of Italy from the empire in the late 6th century AD.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=240}}\n\nAlong with the Rugii and Scirii, the Heruli may have contributed to the formation of the [[Bavarii]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=321}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Religion===\nThe early religion of the Heruli is vividly described by Procopius in his ''[[:wikisource:History of the Wars|History of the Wars]]''. He describes them as a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] society known to practice [[human sacrifice]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book VI#XIV|Book VI, XIV]]</ref> The Heruli appears to have been worshippers of [[Odin]], and might have been responsible for the spread of such worship to [[Northern Europe]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}} \n\nBy the time of Justinian, Procopius reports that many Heruli had become [[Arian]] Christians. In any case, Justinian appears to have pursued a policy of attempting to convert them to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]].{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}} \n\n===Society===\nProcopius writes that the Heruli practiced a form of [[senicide]], having a non-relative kill the sick and elderly and burning the remains on a wooden [[pyre]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> Following the death of their husbands, Herulian women were expected to commit suicide by hanging.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> \n\nProcopius also claims that the Heruli practiced [[homosexuality]].<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/>{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} It appears that Procopius disliked the Heruli and wanted to present them in an as negative light as possible. His description of homosexuality among the Heruli might therefore be untrue.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}}\n\n===Warfare===\nDescribed the Heruli were famous for the quality of their infantry, who were recruited as mercenaries by all other peoples.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (117-118)}} They were known particularly for their speed, and were perhaps used for the stabbing cavalry.{{sfn|Speidel|2004|p=136}} Procopius described the Heruli in battle against Persians, carrying no protective armor save a shield and thick jacket.{{sfn|Steinacher|p=353}}{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_II_XXV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book II#XXV|Book II, XXV]]</ref> This form of warfare has been compared to that of the [[berserker]]s of the [[Viking Age]].{{sfn|Speidel|2004|pp=58-61}}\n\nHerulian slaves are known to have accompanied them into combat. Slaves were forbidden from donning a shield until having proven themselves brave on the battlefield. This practice might be a relic of ancient [[Indo-European culture|Indo-European]] tradition.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} Steinacher has pointed out, that while this remark has reasonably been seen as evidence of an \"initiation rite\", initiation rites are so common that caution is required:\n{{quote|It is of course far from clear exactly what Procopius had in mind when writing about Herul 'slaves'. But he surely provided plenty of evidence that any gens was open to newcomers. As in any other human community, both in the past and in the present, such newcomers had to prove themselves worthy before receiving full membership in that community. This must have been even truer for a community geared towards warfare.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=360}}}}\n\n===Material culture===\nThe [[tumuli]] of the Heruli on the Middle Danube in the early 6th century are very similar to contemporary tumuli built in southern [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}} At this time, the Heruli appears to have had close trade relations with peoples living near the [[Baltic Sea]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}}\n\n===Possible connection to Runic===\nThe Heruli have sometimes been credited with inventing the [[Runic]] script.{{sfn|Murdoch|Read|2004|p=138}} It has been suggested that the Heruli brought the Runic script to Northern Europe.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\nIn ''[[Getica]]'', Jordanes writes that the Heruli claimed to be the [[human height|tallest]] people of [[Scandza]]. Jordanes further writes that all the peoples of Scandza \"surpassed the Germans in size and spirit\".{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=III (23)}} [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] wrote that the Heruli had [[blue eyes|blue]]-[[grey eyes|grey]] eyes.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=423}}\n\n==The negative excursus of Procopius==\nScholars remark that the historian Procopius had a notable fascination with the Herules, which colors his descriptions of them. As Steinacher remarks \"Procopius's Herul excursus [...] is full of stereotypes and negative attitudes towards this primitive people and its archaic conventions\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=349}} This means that caution is required when using his descriptions as evidence. In the words of [[Walter Goffart]]:\n{{quote|Though appreciative of their military qualities, he goes out of his way to blacken their character - \"they are the basest of all men and utterly abandoned rascals,\" \"no men in the world are less bound by convention or more unstable.\" His low opinion may result from the \"special relationship\" the Herules appear to have had with Justinian's eunuch general, [[Narses]], who Procopius disliked.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=206-207}}</ref>}}\nAlthough Procopius praised the Herule named Pharas who brought about the surrender of the north African Vandal king [[Gelimer]], he noted that ''despite'' being born a Herule, he did not drink excessively and was not unreliable.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=168}}\n{{quote|Procopius was not mollified. The Herules were part of the panorama of an entire \"West\" that, owing to Justinian's neglect, had come into the possession of the barbarians by the late 540s. [...] The crowning irony, in the historian's view, was that, because some Herules served as Roman ''foederati'', they both plundered Roman subjects and collected pay from the Roman emperor.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|p=208}}</ref>}}\n\n==Cities sacked by the Heruli==\n*[[Athens]]\n*[[Byzantium]]\n*[[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]]\n*[[Lemnos]]\n*[[Skyros]]\n*[[Sparta]]\n*[[Corinth]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[J\u00e4rsberg Runestone]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Ancient sources==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Jordanes |author-link=Jordanes |translator-last1=Mierow |translator-first1=Charles C. |translator-link1=Charles Christopher Mierow |year=1908 |chapter= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |title=The Origins and Deeds of the Goths |url=https://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html |series= |language= |volume= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |page= |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |subscription= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Procopius |author-link=Procopius |translator-last1=Dewing |translator-first1=Henry Bronson |translator-link1= |year=1914 |chapter= |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |title=History of the Wars |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_the_Wars |series= |language= |volume= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] |page= |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date= |via= |registration= |subscription= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Modern sources==\n{{Refbegin|3}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Angelov |first1=Alexander |author-link1= |date=2018 |year= |orig-year= |chapter=Heruli |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001/acref-9780198662778-e-2225 |editor1-last=Nicholson |editor1-first=Oliver |editor1-link= |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A09WDwAAQBAJ |url-status= |format= |type= |series= |language= |volume= |issue= |edition= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=678 |pages= |doi=10.1093/acref/9780198662778.001.0001 |isbn=9780191744457 |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=January 25, 2020 |via= |subscription= |quote= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bremmer |first=Jan |author-link=Jan N.

Possibly originating in [[Scandinavia]], the Heruli are first mentioned by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors as one of several \"[[Scythians|Scythian]]\" groups raiding Roman provinces in the Balkans and Aegean, attacking by land, and notably also by sea. During this time they reportedly lived near the [[Sea of Azov]]. \n\nFrom the 4th century AD the Heruli were one of the peoples dominated by the empire of [[Attila]] the Hun. After the death of [[Attila]] in 454, they established their own kingdom on the [[Middle Danube]], and participated in successive conquests of [[Italy]] by [[Odoacer]], [[Theoderic the Great]], [[Narses]] and probably also the [[Lombards]]. Their independent kingdom was however destroyed by the [[Lombards]] in the early 6th century AD. A part of this population subsequently became established inside the Roman empire near [[Belgrade]], and continued contributing fighting men to the [[Eastern Roman empire]], and participating in Balkan and Italian conflicts.\n\nWith their last kingdom eventually dominated by Rome, and smaller groups integrated into larger political entities, the Heruli disappeared from history around the time of the conquest of Italy by the Lombards.\n\n==Name==\nThe name of the Heruli is sometimes spelled as Heruls, Herules, Herulians or Eruli.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=388}}\n\nThe name Heruli was often written in Greek and Latin with no \"h\", and is sometimes thought to be Germanic and related to the English word ''[[earl]]'' (see [[erilaz]]) implying that it was an honorific military title.{{sfn|Neumann|1999|p=468}} There is even speculation that the Heruli were not a normal tribal group but a brotherhood of mobile warriors, though there is no consensus for this old proposal, which is based only on the name etymology and the reputation of Heruli as soldiers.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=359-360}}\n\n==Language==\nThe Heruli are believed to have been [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]-speaking.<ref name=\"Heather_Germanic-speaking\">{{harvnb|Heather|2007|p=469}}. \"Heruli \u2013 Germanic-speaking group originally from north central Europe, some of whom migrated to regions north of the Black Sea in company with Goths and others in the third century.\"</ref> Personal names provide important evidence on the language of the Heruli.{{sfn|Taylor|1999|pp=468-469}} A large number of Heruli names are attested, and many of these are certainly [[Germanic name|Germanic]],<ref name=\"Maenchen-Helfen_837\">{{harvnb|Maenchen-Helfen|1947|pp=837-838}}. \"[[:de:Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld|Sch\u00f6nfeld]]... offers Germanic etymologies not only for Faras and Alvith but also for Fanotheus, Filimuth, Hariso, Sindval, Svartva, Uligangus, and Visandus.

Other Germanic peoples, such as the [[Rugii]] and the Goths, are believed to have carried out a similar migration at this time. These peoples replaced the [[Sarmatians]] as the dominant power north of the Black Sea. The Sarmatians had in the 1st century AD replaced the [[Bastarnae]], who are believed to have been a Germanic people. The arrival of the Heruli has been seen as part of a bigger cultural shift in this region, involving the migration from the northwest of Germanic peoples, who replaced the Sarmatians as the dominant power in the region.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=116}}\n\nThe first relatively clear mention of the Heruli by Graeco-Roman writers concerns two major campaigns into the Balkans of 267/268 and 269/270.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=124}} Goths, Heruli (sometimes referred to as \"Eluri\", \u1f1c\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, in this context), and other \"Scythian\" peoples from the region of the Sea of Azov, took control of [[Black Sea]] Greek cities, and gained a fleet that they used to launch raids along the northern [[Black Sea]] and as far as Greece and [[Asia Minor]]. These invasions began in the reign of [[Gallienus]] (260-268 AD), and continued until at least 269 during the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus|Marcus Aurelius Claudius]], who subsequently took up the title \"Gothicus\" due to his victory.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=55-66}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=322-327}}\n\nIn 267, Heruli (\u0391\u1f34\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9) commanded a naval attack from the Sea of Azov, past the Danube delta, and into the straits of the [[Bosphorus]] where they took control of [[Byzantion]] and [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Chrysopolis]], both near Constantinople itself. They then retreated to the Black sea, before returning, raiding [[Cyzicus]] and then entering the Aegean sea where they troubled [[Lemnos]], [[Skyros]] and [[Imbros]], before landing near [[Sparta]] and plundering the [[Peloponnese]], including not only Sparta, but also [[Corinth]], [[Argos]], and the sanctuary of Zeus at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Still within 267 they reached [[Athens]], where local militias had to defend the city. It seems to have been the Heruli specifically who [[Sack of Athens (267 AD)|sacked]] Athens despite the construction of a new wall, during [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]]\u2019s reign only a generation earlier. This was the occasion for a famous defense made by [[Dexippus]], whose writings were a source for later historians.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=58-60}}\n\nFurther north, in 268, Gallienus defeated Heruli at the [[Nestos (river)|river Nestos]] using a new mobile cavalry, but as part of the surrender a Herulian chief named Naulobatus became the first barbarian known from written records to receive [[imperial insignia]] from the Romans, gaining the rank of a [[Roman consul]]. It is highly likely that these defeated Heruli were then made part of the Roman military.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=324}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=62}}\n\nRecent researchers such as Steinacher now have increased confidence that there was a distinct second campaign which began in 269, and ended in 270.<ref>Also see {{harvtxt|Zahariade|2010}}.</ref> Later Roman writers reported that thousands of ships left from the mouth of the [[Dnieper]], manned by a large force of various different Scythian peoples, including [[Peucini|Peuci]], [[Greutungi]], [[Ostrogoths|Austrogothi]], [[Tervingi]], [[Vesi]], [[Gepids]], [[Celts]], and Heruli. These forces divided into two parts in the [[Hellespont]]. One force attacked [[Thessaloniki]], and against this group the Romans, led by Claudius now, had a major victory at the [[Battle of Naissus]] ([[Ni\u0161]], [[Serbia]]) in 269. This was apparently a distinct battle from that at the Nessos. A Herulian chieftain named Andonnoballus is said to have switched to the Roman side, and this was once again a case where Heruli appear to have joined the Roman military. The second group sailed south and raided [[Rhodes]], [[Crete]], and [[Cyprus]] and many Goths and Heruli managed to return safely to harbor in the [[Crimea]]. Lesser attacks continued until 276.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=63-65}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nThe Heruli are believed to have formed part of the [[Chernyakhov culture]],{{sfn|Green|2000|p=1}} which, although dominated the Goths and other Germanic peoples,<ref name=\"Heather_Chernyakhov\">{{harvnb|Heather|1994|p=87}}. \"[S]ome of the territory covered by the S\u00eentana de Mure\u015f\u2013\u010cernjachov culture may have been controlled not by Goths but by related Germanic peoples, such as the Heruli.\"</ref> also included [[Bastarnae]], [[Dacians]] and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=137}} The Heruli are thus archaeologically indistinguishable from the Goths.{{sfn|Green|2000|p=1}}{{sfn|Heather|1994|p=87}}\n\nJordanes reports that the Heruli in the late 4th century AD were conquered by [[Ermanaric]], king of the [[Greuthungi]]an Goths.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=77-80}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|331-333}}{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (116)}} Ermanaric's realm may also have included [[Baltic Finns|Finns]], [[Slavs]], [[Alans]] and [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=137}} Before being conquered by Ermanaric, Jordanes says that the Heruli were lead by their king Alaric.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (116)}} [[Herwig Wolfram]] has suggested that the future [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]] may have been named after this Herulian king.{{sfn|Heather|1994|p=33}}\n\n===The \"western\" Heruli, soldiers and pirates===\n\n[[File:Heruli seniores shield pattern.svg|right|thumb|The shield pattern of the ''[[Heruli seniores]]'', a [[Late Roman military]] unit composed of Heruli.]]\nThe proposal that there may have been a Western kingdom of Heruli has posed a problem for scholars. This question arises because of the evidence of Heruli activity in the western Roman empire. The existence of this western kingdom is increasingly doubted.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=328}} \n\nHeruli were already seen in western Europe before the empire of Attila, at the time of their first ambitious campaigns in the east. In 268 [[Claudius Mamertinus]] reported the victory of [[Maximian]] over a group of Heruli and Chaibones (known only from this one report{{efn|The Chaibones may have been [[Aviones]], according to Neumann, ''Namenstudien zum Altgermanischen'', p. 316.}}) attacking Gaul. \n\nIt is believed that it was from this time that the Romans instituted a Herulian auxiliary unit, the ''Heruli seniores'', who were stationed in northern Italy. This ''numerus Erulorum'' was a lightly-equipped unit often associated with the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]]an ''Batavi seniores''. In 366 the Batavians and Heruli fought against [[Alamanni]] near the Rhine, under the leadership of [[Charietto]] who died in the battle, and then against [[Picts]] and [[Scoti]] in Britain. They were subsequently sent to fight [[Parthia]]ns in the east.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=67}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=326-327}}\n\nIn 405 or 406, a large number of barbarian groups [[Crossing of the Rhine|crossed the Rhine]], entering the Roman empire, and the Heruli appear in the list of peoples given by the historian [[Jerome]]. However this list is sometimes thought to have drawn on historical lists for literary effect. \n\nLater mentions of Heruli in western incidents where they were not clearly connected to the Roman military include two sea raids in northern Spain in the 450s, and the presence of Heruli at the Visigothic court of [[Euric]] in about 475.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=206}} The raids were reported by [[Hydatius]]. [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] mentions Heruli at the Visigothic court in 476, although this is in a poetic letter. Recent scholars such as Steinacher and Halsall have pointed out that this type of evidence is consistent with the internal military conflicts that were happening in the Roman empire during this period. Halsall for example writes that it \"must at least be a possibility that their raid constituted part of a Romano-Visigothic offensive against the [[Kingdom of the Suebi|Sueves]]\" who had been part of an invasion of the same area.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=260}} Steinacher demonstrates using examples from the period, including Charietto's life story, that barbarian soldiers could switch from being Roman soldier, to pirate, and back to soldier.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=69-73}} \n\nThe Greek poet [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] specifically imagined the Heruli he saw at Euric's court as Oceanic sea-farers, but Steinacher argues that this raiding by sea was simply a logical strategy for Visigothic campaigns against the Iberian Suevi, and difficult to use as a proof that the Heruli had a coastal kingdom somewhere in the north.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=74}}<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/sidonius_letters_08book8.htm Letters 8.9]</ref>\n{{quote|In reality, there is nothing special about attacks from the sea: various marauders employed such tactics at various points in history. It is just easier and not too dangerous.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=330}}}}\nGiven the writing style of Sidonius this reference could also be \"nothing more than a bookish reference to third-century accounts of Herules attacking from the sea\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=329}}\n\n===Kingdom on the Middle Danube===\n[[File:Huns450.png|thumb|upright=1|Approximate territory under Hunnic control in 450 AD]]\n\nIn the early 5th century AD, large groups of peoples left the [[Middle Danube]] region, including the groups who crossed the Rhine in 405, many of eventually reached Iberia, and also the forces of [[Radagaisus]] who invaded Italy. During this period, the Huns and their allies begin to be found in this same area instead, having crossed the [[Carpathians]] from the east.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|loc=Ch.5}} By 450 AD, the Heruli were firmly part of the Hunnic empire of [[Attila]]. The Gepids, Rugi, [[Scirii]] and many Goths, Alans and Sarmatians were also part of Attila's empire.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=208}} They were among the peoples who are reported as having fought for Attila at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]].\n\nAfter the death of Attila, his sons lost power over the various peoples of his empire at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454. The centre of this alliance was now settled upon the Roman border north of the [[Middle Danube]]. Heruli who were possibly on the winning side with the [[Gepids]], were subsequently among the several peoples now able to form a kingdom in that area. The Herulian kingdom, was established north of modern [[Vienna]] and [[Bratislava]], near the [[Morava (river)|Morava]] river, and possibly extending as far east as the [[Little Carpathians]]. They ruled over a mixed population including Suevi, Huns and Alans.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=340}} Compared to other Middle Danubian kingdoms in this period, Peter Heather has described this Heruli kingdom as \"middle-sized\", similar to the [[Rugii|Rugian]] one, but \"clearly not as militarily powerful, say, as the Gothic, Lombard, or Gepid confederations which generated much longer-lived political entities, and into which elements of the Rugi and Heruli were eventually absorbed\".{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=242}}\n\nFrom this region the life story of [[Severinus of Noricum]] reports that the Heruli attacked Ioviaco near [[Passau]] in 480.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=340}}  The Heruli do not appear in early lists of Odoacer's allies after Nedao, but benefited from the downfall of his people the Scirii. They established control on the Roman (south) side of the Danube, north of [[Lake Balaton]] in modern Hungary when they were apparently able to take over the kingdoms of the Suevi and Scirii, who had been under pressure from the Ostrogoths, who continued to press their old allies from the south.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=341}}\n\n[[Odoacer]], the commander of the Imperial ''[[foederati]]'' troops who deposed the last [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman]] Emperor [[Romulus Augustus]] in 476 AD came to be seen as king over several of the Danubian peoples including the Heruli, and the Heruli were strongly associated with his Italian kingdom. The Heruli on the Danube also took control of the Rugian territories, who had become competitors to Odoacer and been defeated by him in 488. However Heruli suffered badly in Italy, as loyalists of Odoacer, when he was defeated by the Ostrogoth [[Theoderic]]. \n\nBy 500 the Herulian kingdom on the Danube, apparently by now under a king named [[Rodulf_(petty_king)#King_of_the_Heruls|Rodulph]], had made peace with Theoderic and become his allies.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=338-345}} [[Paul the Deacon]] also mentions Heruli living in Italy under Ostrogothic rule.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=347}} Peter Heather estimates that the Herulian kingdom could muster an army of 5,000-10,000 men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=251}}\n\n[[File:Southeastern Europe in 520, showing the Byzantine Empire under Justin I and the Ostrogothic kingdom.png|thumb|Polities in southeastern Europe c.500 AD before the Lombard destruction of the Herulian kingdom]]\nTheoderic's efforts to build a system of alliances in Western Europe were made difficult both by counter diplomacy, for example between [[Merovingians|Merovingian]] [[Franks]] and the [[Byzantine empire]], and also the arrival of a new Germanic people into the Danubian region, the [[Lombards]] who were initially under Herule hegemony. The Herulian king Rodulph lost his kingdom to the Lombards at some point between 494 and 508.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=366}}\n\n===Later history===\nAfter the Middle Danubian Herulian kingdom was destroyed by the [[Lombards]] in or before 508, Herulian fortunes waned. According to [[Procopius]], in 512 a group including royalty went north and settled in [[Thule]], which for Procopius meant Scandinavia.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|pp=205-209}} Procopius noted that these Heruli first traversed the lands of the [[Slavs]], then empty lands, and then the lands of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], until finally settling down nearby the [[Geats]].{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=430}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book VI#XV|Book VI, XV]]</ref> Peter Heather considers this account to be \"entirely plausible\" although he notes that others have labelled it a \"fairy story\", and given that it only appears in one source it is possible to deny its validity.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=242}} \n\nAnother Heruli group were assigned civil and military offices by [[Theoderic the Great]] in [[Pavia]] in north Italy.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=144}}\n\nWhat happened to the main part of the Danubian Heruli has been difficult to reconstruct from Procopius, but according to Steinacher they first moved downstream on the Danube to an area where the Rugii had sought refuge in 488. Here they suffered famine. They sought refuge among the Gepids, but wanting to avoid being mistreated by them crossed the Danube came under East Roman authority.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=350}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|pp=144-145}} \n\n[[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius Caesar]] allowed them to resettle depopulated \"lands and cities\" in the empire in 512. Modern scholars debate whether they were moved then to [[Singidunum]] (modern [[Belgrade]]), or first to [[Bassianae]], and to Singidunum some decades later, by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=369}} This area had been re-acquired by the empire from the Goths, who now ruled Italy from Ravenna.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=350-351}} Justinian integrated them into the empire as a buffer between the Romans and the more independent Lombards and Gepids to the north. Under his encouragement, the Herule king Grepes converted to Orthodox Christianity in 528 together with some nobles and twelve relatives.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=351-352}} Procopius who felt that this made them somewhat gentler, also showed in his account of the wars against the African Vandals, that some of them were [[Arianism|Arian]] christians.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}}\n\nThe Heruli were often mentioned during the times of [[Justinian]], who used them in his extensive military campaigns in many countries including [[Italy]], [[Syria]], and North [[Africa]]. [[Pharas the Herulian|Pharas]] was a notable Herulian commander during this period. Several thousand Heruli served in the personal guard of [[Belisarius]] throughout the campaigns, and [[Narses]] also recruited from them. They were a participant in the [[Byzantine-Sasanian wars]], such as the [[Battle of Anglon]].\n\nGrepes and most of his family had apparently died by the early 540s, possibly in the [[Plague of Justinian]] (541-542).{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=147}} [[Procopius]] related that in the 540s the Heruli who had been settled in the Roman Balkans killed their own king Ochus and, not wanting the one assigned by the emperor, Suartuas, they made contact with the Heruli who had gone to Thule decades earlier, seeking a new king. Their first choice fell sick and died when they had come to the country of the Dani, and a second choice was made. The new king Datius arrived with his brother Aordus and 200 young men.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=225}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}} The Heruli who were sent against Suartuas defected with him and were supported by the empire. The supporters of Datius, two thirds of the Heruli, submitted to the Gepids.{{sfn|Goffart|2006|p=209}} This period of rebellion against Rome lasted approximately 545-548, the period immediately before conflict between their larger neighbours the Gepids and Lombards broke out, but this rebellion was repressed by Justinian.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|pp=393-397}}\n \nIn 549, when the Gepids fought the Romans, and Heruli fought on both sides.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=394}} In any case after one generation in the Belgrade area, the Herulian federate polity in the Balkans disappears from the surviving historical records, apparently replaced by the incoming [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]].{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|pp=354-355}}\n\nPeter Heather has written that: \n{{quote|by c.540 being a Herule had ceased to be the main determinant of individual behaviour; the Heruli had ceased to operate together on the basis of that shared heritage, and different Heruli were adopting different strategies for survival in the new political conditions which even caused them to fight on opposing sides. After c.540, we still find small groups called Heruli fighting for the East Romans in Italy, and it is noticeable that the Roman commanders were careful to appoint for them leaders of their own race. Thus some sense of identity probably remained. That said, we are clearly dealing with a few fragments of the original group, and, in the prevailing circumstances, Herule identity had no future.{{sfn|Heather|1998|p=109}}}}\n\nSarantis however shows that the Belgrade-region Heruli continued to be recruited, and to play a role in local conflicts involving the Gepids and Lombards, into the 550s. Suartas, a Herule general for the Romans, led Herule forces against the Gepids in 552 for example.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=385}} However it appears that by this period the semi-independent Heruli near Belgrade became Roman provincials.{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=402}}\n\nIn 566, Sinduald, a Herule military leader under Narses, was declared a king of Heruli in [[Trentino]] in northern Italy, but he was executed by Narses. Sinduald was said to be a descendant of the Herules who had already entered Italy under Odoacer.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=355}}{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=159}}\n\n[[Paul the Deacon]] writes that many Heruli joined the Lombard king [[Alboin]] in their eventual conquest of Italy from the empire in the late 6th century AD.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=240}}\n\nAlong with the Rugii and Scirii, the Heruli may have contributed to the formation of the [[Bavarii]].{{sfn|Green|2000|p=321}}\n\n==Culture==\n===Religion===\nThe early religion of the Heruli is vividly described by Procopius in his ''[[:wikisource:History of the Wars|History of the Wars]]''. He describes them as a [[polytheism|polytheistic]] society known to practice [[human sacrifice]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book VI#XIV|Book VI, XIV]]</ref> The Heruli appears to have been worshippers of [[Odin]], and might have been responsible for the spread of such worship to [[Northern Europe]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}} \n\nBy the time of Justinian, Procopius reports that many Heruli had become [[Arian]] Christians. In any case, Justinian appears to have pursued a policy of attempting to convert them to [[Chalcedonian Christianity]].{{sfn|Sarantis|2010|p=372}} \n\n===Society===\nProcopius writes that the Heruli practiced a form of [[senicide]], having a non-relative kill the sick and elderly and burning the remains on a wooden [[pyre]].{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=54}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> Following the death of their husbands, Herulian women were expected to commit suicide by hanging.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/> \n\nProcopius also claims that the Heruli practiced [[homosexuality]].<ref name=\"Procopius_VI_XIV\"/>{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} It appears that Procopius disliked the Heruli and wanted to present them in an as negative light as possible. His description of homosexuality among the Heruli might therefore be untrue.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}}\n\n===Warfare===\nDescribed the Heruli were famous for the quality of their infantry, who were recruited as mercenaries by all other peoples.{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=XXIII (117-118)}} They were known particularly for their speed, and were perhaps used for the stabbing cavalry.{{sfn|Speidel|2004|p=136}} Procopius described the Heruli in battle against Persians, carrying no protective armor save a shield and thick jacket.{{sfn|Steinacher|p=353}}{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=67}}<ref name=\"Procopius_II_XXV\">{{harvnb|Procopius|1914|p=}}, [[:Wikisource:History of the Wars/Book II#XXV|Book II, XXV]]</ref> This form of warfare has been compared to that of the [[berserker]]s of the [[Viking Age]].{{sfn|Speidel|2004|pp=58-61}}\n\nHerulian slaves are known to have accompanied them into combat. Slaves were forbidden from donning a shield until having proven themselves brave on the battlefield. This practice might be a relic of ancient [[Indo-European culture|Indo-European]] tradition.{{sfn|Bremmer|1992|pp=58-59}} Steinacher has pointed out, that while this remark has reasonably been seen as evidence of an \"initiation rite\", initiation rites are so common that caution is required:\n{{quote|It is of course far from clear exactly what Procopius had in mind when writing about Herul 'slaves'. But he surely provided plenty of evidence that any gens was open to newcomers. As in any other human community, both in the past and in the present, such newcomers had to prove themselves worthy before receiving full membership in that community. This must have been even truer for a community geared towards warfare.{{sfn|Steinacher|2010|p=360}}}}\n\n===Material culture===\nThe [[tumuli]] of the Heruli on the Middle Danube in the early 6th century are very similar to contemporary tumuli built in southern [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}} At this time, the Heruli appears to have had close trade relations with peoples living near the [[Baltic Sea]].{{sfn|Christie|1995|p=29}}\n\n===Possible connection to Runic===\nThe Heruli have sometimes been credited with inventing the [[Runic]] script.{{sfn|Murdoch|Read|2004|p=138}} It has been suggested that the Heruli brought the Runic script to Northern Europe.{{sfn|Davidson|1990|p=148}}\n\n==Physical appearance==\nIn ''[[Getica]]'', Jordanes writes that the Heruli claimed to be the [[human height|tallest]] people of [[Scandza]]. Jordanes further writes that all the peoples of Scandza \"surpassed the Germans in size and spirit\".{{sfn|Jordanes|1908|p=III (23)}} [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] wrote that the Heruli had [[blue eyes|blue]]-[[grey eyes|grey]] eyes.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=423}}\n\n==The negative excursus of Procopius==\nScholars remark that the historian Procopius had a notable fascination with the Herules, which colors his descriptions of them. As Steinacher remarks \"Procopius's Herul excursus [...] is full of stereotypes and negative attitudes towards this primitive people and its archaic conventions\".{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=349}} This means that caution is required when using his descriptions as evidence. In the words of [[Walter Goffart]]:\n{{quote|Though appreciative of their military qualities, he goes out of his way to blacken their character - \"they are the basest of all men and utterly abandoned rascals,\" \"no men in the world are less bound by convention or more unstable.\" His low opinion may result from the \"special relationship\" the Herules appear to have had with Justinian's eunuch general, [[Narses]], who Procopius disliked.<ref>{{harvtxt|Goffart|2006|pp=206-207}}</ref>}}\nAlthough Procopius praised the Herule named Pharas who brought about the surrender of the north African Vandal king [[Gelimer]], he noted that ''despite'' being born a Herule, he did not drink excessively and was not unreliable.{{sfn|Steinacher|2017|p=168}}\n{{quote|Procopius was not mollified. The Herules were part of the panorama of an entire \"West\" that, owing to Justinian's neglect, had come into the possession of the barbarians by the late 540s.

He pursued a foreign policy of neutrality between China and India.\n\n===Rule in Panchayat System (1960\u201372)===\nIn 1960, King Mahendra used his emergency powers and took charge of the State once again claiming that the Congress government had fostered corruption, promoted party above national interest, failed to maintain law and order and ''\u2018encouraged anti-national elements\u2019''. Political parties were outlawed and all prominent political figures, including the [[Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala|Prime Minister]] were put behind bars. Civil liberties were curtailed and press freedom muzzled. King Mahendra, then, through an ''\u2018exercise of the sovereign power and prerogatives inherent in us\u2019'' promulgated a new constitution on December, 1962 introducing a party-less Panchayat system. The political system (Panchayat System) was a party-less \"guided\" democracy in which the people could elect their representatives, while real power remained in the hands of the monarch.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+np0030) |title= The Panchayat System under King Mahendra |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= Library of Congress Country Studies |publisher= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> Dissenters were called anti-national elements.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/printable_news.php?news_id=56307 |title= The Koirala Complex |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=  |website= Republica |publisher=  |accessdate= 31 October 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131101234015/http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/printable_news.php?news_id=56307 |archive-date= 1 November 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Panchayat System was formulated by King Mahendra after overthrowing the first democratically elected government and dissolving the parliament in 1960. On 26 December 1961, King Mahendra appointed a council of 5 ministers to help run the administration. Several weeks later, political parties were declared illegal. At first, the [[Nepali Congress]] leadership propounded a non-violent struggle against the new order and formed alliances with several political parties, including the [[Gorkha Parishad]] and the [[United Democratic Party (Nepal)|United Democratic Party]]. Early in 1961, however, the king had set up a committee of 4 officials from the Central Secretariat to recommend changes in the constitution that would abolish political parties and substitute a ''\"National Guidance\" system'' based on local panchayat led directly by the king.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://geeta-conflict.blogspot.com/2011/06/panchayat-regime.html | title = conflict Tuesday, June 7, 2011| date = 2011-06-07}}</ref>\n\nMahendra implemented a land reform policy, which provided land to many landless people. The [[Mahendra Highway]] (also called East-West Highway) that runs along the entire Terai belt in southern Nepal was constructed during his reign. He launched the [[Back to the Village National Campaign]] in 1967 which was one of his largest rural development efforts. He also played a key role in making Nepal a member of the [[United Nations]] in 1955.\n\n===British Field Marshal===\nKing Mahendra was appointed as a [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|British Field Marshal]] in 1960.\n\n===King Mahendra and Queen's visit to USA in 1967===\nKing Mahendra and the Queen Ratna were greeted by the then President of USA, [[Lyndon B Johnson]] and Mrs. Johnson in Washington DC in 1967.

He pursued a foreign policy of neutrality between China and India.\n\n===Rule in Panchayat System (1960\u201372)===\nIn 1960, King Mahendra used his emergency powers and took charge of the State once again claiming that the Congress government had fostered corruption, promoted party above national interest, failed to maintain law and order and ''\u2018encouraged anti-national elements\u2019''. Political parties were outlawed and all prominent political figures, including the [[Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala|Prime Minister]] were put behind bars. Civil liberties were curtailed and press freedom muzzled. King Mahendra, then, through an ''\u2018exercise of the sovereign power and prerogatives inherent in us\u2019'' promulgated a new constitution on December, 1962 introducing a party-less Panchayat system. The political system (Panchayat System) was a party-less \"guided\" democracy in which the people could elect their representatives, while real power remained in the hands of the monarch.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+np0030) |title= The Panchayat System under King Mahendra |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= Library of Congress Country Studies |publisher= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> Dissenters were called anti-national elements.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/printable_news.php?news_id=56307 |title= The Koirala Complex |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=  |website= Republica |publisher=  |accessdate= 31 October 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131101234015/http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/printable_news.php?news_id=56307 |archive-date= 1 November 2013 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Panchayat System was formulated by King Mahendra after overthrowing the first democratically elected government and dissolving the parliament in 1960. On 26 December 1961, King Mahendra appointed a council of 5 ministers to help run the administration. Several weeks later, political parties were declared illegal. At first, the [[Nepali Congress]] leadership propounded a non-violent struggle against the new order and formed alliances with several political parties, including the [[Gorkha Parishad]] and the [[United Democratic Party (Nepal)|United Democratic Party]]. Early in 1961, however, the king had set up a committee of 4 officials from the Central Secretariat to recommend changes in the constitution that would abolish political parties and substitute a ''\"National Guidance\" system'' based on local panchayat led directly by the king.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://geeta-conflict.blogspot.com/2011/06/panchayat-regime.html | title = conflict Tuesday, June 7, 2011| date = 2011-06-07}}</ref>\n\nMahendra implemented a land reform policy, which provided land to many landless people. The [[Mahendra Highway]] (also called East-West Highway) that runs along the entire Terai belt in southern Nepal was constructed during his reign. He launched the [[Back to the Village National Campaign]] in 1967 which was one of his largest rural development efforts. He also played a key role in making Nepal a member of the [[United Nations]] in 1955.\n\n===British Field Marshal===\nKing Mahendra was appointed as a [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|British Field Marshal]] in 1960.\n\n===King Mahendra and Queen's visit to USA in 1967===\nKing Mahendra and the Queen Ratna were greeted by the then President of USA, [[Lyndon B Johnson]] and Mrs. Johnson in Washington DC in 1967.
