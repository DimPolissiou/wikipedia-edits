'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen lived in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire for several years before his death in 1993. The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was [[The Beggar's Opera|''The Beggar's Opera'']], for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref>.

'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen lived in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire for several years before his death in 1993. The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was [[The Beggar's Opera|''The Beggar's Opera'']], for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref>. The action alternates between a crashed aircraft in the African jungle near [[Benguela]] and the radio control room at [[Kakonda]] Airfield. Jeremy Rundall in ''The Sunday Times'' said it \"has an Ancient Mariner-ish ring, and should be heard again\".<ref>''Sunday Times'', 12 December 1965, p 40</ref> \n\nThe specifically commissioned television opera ''Some Place of Darkness'' used an original libretto by the experienced television writer [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. The BBC insisted on realism, and the result was \" a sombre domestic drama set in the present, it exemplified all that television promoted\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6fwSLslWOjsC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=%22Some+place+of+darkness%22+%22television+opera%22&source=bl&ots=b_k28mFrbb&sig=ACfU3U2uiIHxXAQHFjddkSSblEjGXMLm6g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwji-7CJovfoAhUNQRUIHeqrACcQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Some%20place%20of%20darkness%22%20%22television%20opera%22&f=false Barnes, Jennifer.

The piece, he said \"was the result of a BBC edict - crisp and clear - 'contemporary plot and modern dress'. The words smacked like a damp cloth on the operatic table.\"<ref>Whelen, Christopher. 'Thoughts on Television Opera' in ''Composer'' 24 (1967), p 17</ref>\n\nBy 1969 for ''Incident at Owl Creek'' Whelen had dispensed with a librettist, adapting the source material (based on the short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]]) himself. This led to him writing a text based on an original idea for ''The Findings'' (1972), concerning the excavation of an [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] tomb.<ref>[[Rodney Milnes|Milnes, Rodney]]: \u2018The Findings\u2019 in ''Opera'' 23 (1972), p 945\u20138</ref> Creating his own plot and characters presented through his own words and music, Whelen was attempting to create a more personal form of \"total musical theatre\".<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e648c51cd2774f2083924651d29f021c ''Radio Times'', Issue 2540, 13 July 1972 p 20]</ref> Christopher Palmer identified ''The Findings'' and ''Incident at Owl Creek'' as \"outstanding\".<ref name=grove/> The music drama ''The Restorer'', produced and directed by [[Martin Esslin]], is an example of Whelen's experimentation with the close combination of words and music. It concerns a picture in a Dutch museum and its fascination on visitors. \n\nAnother strand of Whelen's work was in film. He composed the score for [[The Valiant (1962 film)|''The Valiant'']] (1962), [[The Face of Fu Manchu]] (1965) and ''[[Coast of Skeletons]]'' (1965).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924083/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm IMDb biography]</ref> There was also a ballet, ''Cul de Sac'', choreographed by [[Norman Morrice]] and staged by [[Ballet Rambert]] on 13 July 1964 at [[Sadler's Wells]].<ref>[https://www.rambert.org.uk/performance-database/works/cul-de-sac/ Ballet Rambert performance archive]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/20/archives/problem-ballet-shown-in-london-rambert-troupe-performs-morrices-cul.html '\u2018Problem\u2019 Ballet Shown in London; Rambert Troupe Performs Morrice's \u2018Cul de Sac\u2019' in ''The New York Times'', 20 July 1964]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Television and radio operas===\n* ''The Cancelling Dark'', radio opera, libretto by Vernon Scannell (1964)\n* ''Some Place of Darkness'', television opera, libretto by John Hopkins (1967)\n* ''Incident at Owl Creek'', radio opera, libretto Whelen after [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1969)\n* ''The Findings'', radio opera, libretto Whelen (1972)\n\n===Radio drama, words and music by Whelen===\n* ''The Restorer'' (1976)\n*  ''Marius Goring in Bridges'', a play with music written for stereo (1976)\n* ''To the Office and Back'', notes towards a portrait of [[Wallace Stevens]] (1978)\n* ''Cumulus'', a weather fantasy (1980)\n* ''The Jigsaw Must Fit'', 'musico-dramatic' work (1983)\n* ''Ed e Subito Sera'', a portrait of [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] (1984)\n* ''Broad Daylight'', a love story in words and music (1986)\n\n===Selected incidental music for theatre, radio and television===\n* ''Murder in the Cathedral'' by [[T S Eliot]] (1953, Old Vic Company, recording available)<ref>[https://naxosaudiobooks.com/murder-in-the-cathedral-unabridged/ Naxos Audio Books.

With [[Ryan Dungey]]'s 2015, 2016 and 2017 victories in the [[AMA Supercross Championship|supercross world championship]], KTM gained a successful presence in supercross racing as well. In 1994, a KTM factory team debuted at the [[Dakar Rally]]. In 1998, KTM riders won second to twelfth place. With consecutive wins from 2001 to 2019, the manufacturer has dominated the rally for 18 years now. KTM teams successfully compete in other [[rally raid]] events like the Atlas Rally or the Rallye du Maroc. KTM has won 37 [[FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship|cross country rallies]] world titles since 2003 and has won the [[FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship]] 15 times, most recently in 2015.\n\nIn 2003, KTM started sponsoring and supporting [[road racing]] in various capacities, with the most successful results stemming from their [[supermoto]] efforts. From 2003 to 2009, a KTM factory team competed in the 125&nbsp;cc class of the motorcycle [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grands Prix]], and between 2005 and 2008 in the 250&nbsp;cc class.

Since the first Rookies Cup season in 2007, KTM has supplied the bike for the [[Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup]]. In 2009, KTM announced their withdrawal from Grand Prix motorcycle racing in all classes, and did not return until 2012 in the new [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing#Moto3 class|Moto3]] class.\n\nIn 2012, KTM won the [[2012 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season#Manufacturers.27 championship 3|Moto3 manufacturers' championship]]. During the [[2013 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season#Riders.27 standings 3|next season]], KTM riders prevailed in every race of the Moto3 class and won the world title as well as second and third place, making KTM the obvious victor of the manufacturers' standing. KTM won the manufacturer title in the [[2014 Moto3 season#Manufacturers.27 standings|2014]] and [[2016 Moto3 season#Manufacturers.27 standings|2016]] as well as the world title in 2016 in the Moto3 class. Starting in 2017, KTM fields bikes in both MotoGP and Moto2 classes as well. The main class team features [[Bradley Smith (motorcyclist)|Bradley Smith]] and [[Pol Espargar\u00f3]] as full-season riders, and [[Mika Kallio]] as wildcard rider.

Starting in 2017, all newly registered motorcycles must conform with the Euro 4 regulations for emission management. In May 2017, KTM will unveil a new two-stroke engine with [[gasoline direct injection|direct fuel injection]]. By pressure-injecting an electronically controlled amount of fuel into the transfer port of the cylinder, the new TPI (transfer port injection) engines will be more fuel efficient and cleaner than classic [[carburetor]] two-stroke engines, albeit more complex and expensive.

The two-stroke XC machines except the 150&nbsp;cc model are available with either [[Close-ratio transmission|wide-ratio or close-ratio transmission]] (when switching gears, there is a more or less pronounced [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] change).

However, with newer advances in technology, two-strokes have begun to burn cleaner and pass stricter green standards. Starting in 2017, all newly registered motorcycles must conform with the Euro 4 regulations for emission management. In May 2017, KTM will unveil a new two-stroke engine with [[gasoline direct injection|direct fuel injection]]. By pressure-injecting an electronically controlled amount of fuel into the transfer port of the cylinder, the new TPI (transfer port injection) engines will be more fuel efficient and cleaner than classic [[carburetor]] two-stroke engines, albeit more complex and expensive.

This was the third annual Wrestlethon and had been a successful fundraiser in past years. The first show raised an estimated $10,000 and helped save the life of teenager Deloris Wadsworth who needed a [[liver transplant]].

According to Hudson in a later interview, both men had been fans of his show and they persuaded Pedicino to hire them for free after a poor performance given by the regular announcer at a show in [[Carrollton, Georgia]]. As Hudson and Prazak had prior experience in radio and television, they soon became valuable members of the promotion.
