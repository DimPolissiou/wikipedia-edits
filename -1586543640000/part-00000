Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

A feasibility report to Line 6\u2014the second Hankou-Hanyang connection\u2014was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the [[Optics Valley of China|Optics Valley]].\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Yangtze River Bridge]] corridor. Construction began in June 2013 and was completed in December 2017.\n\n===Timeline of service expansion===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Segment description\n!Date opened\n!Station(s)\n!# of new stations\n!Length (km)\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 1\n|{{date|2004-7-28}}\n|Zongguan \u2014 Huangpu Road\n|10{{NoteTag|in which Taipingyang Station was postponed to open on {{date|2006-4-8}}.}}\n|9.769\n|-\n|Phase \u2161 of Line 1\n|{{date|2010-7-29}}\n| Dongwu Boulevard \u2014 Zongguan;<br> Huangpu Road \u2014 Dijiao\n|16{{NoteTag|in which Zhuyehai Station was postponed to open on {{date|2014-9-17}}.<ref>[http://qzgh.qiaokou.gov.cn/qkxw/bmdt/201409/t20140917_139172.shtml \u8f7b\u8f68\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9\u5b9c\u5bb6\u8054\u5eca\u6865\u6295\u5165\u4f7f\u7528 (Zhuyehai station opened)]</ref>}}\n|18.494\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 2\n|{{date|2012-12-28}}\n| Jinyintan \u2014 Optics Valley Square\n|21\n|27.152\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 4<ref>[http://cjweek.cjn.cn/html/2013-12/27/content_5269051.htm Section one of Metro Line 4 opens]</ref>\n|{{date|2013-12-28}}\n| Wuchang Railway Station \u2014 Wuhan Railway Station\n|15\n|17.974\n|-\n|Hankou North extension of Line 1\n|{{date|2014-5-28}}\n|  Dijiao \u2014 Hankou North\n|3\n|5.555 \n|-\n|Phase \u2161 of Line 4\n|{{date|2014-12-28}}\n| Huangjinkou \u2014 Wuchang Railway Station\n|13\n|15.429\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 3<ref name=\"Line 3\">{{cite news|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u5373\u5c06\u5730\u94c1\u6210\u73af \"\u73af\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3\"\u91cd\u6784\u5546\u4e1a\u5730\u7406  |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/house/wh/2015-12/24/c_1117562445.htm |work=\u957f\u6c5f\u65e5\u62a5 |language=Chinese |date=2015-12-24 |accessdate=2015-12-24 }}</ref>\n|{{date|2015-12-28}}\n|Zhuanyang Boulevard \u2014 Hongtu Boulevard\t\n|24\n|29.660\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 6\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{date|2016-12-28}}<ref name=\"\u6b66\u6c49\u5730\u94c1\u673a\u573a\u7ebf\u53ca6\u53f7\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a \u6e56\u5317\u79fb\u52a8\u5168\u9762\u5e03\u5c40\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\">[http://tech.cnr.cn/techgd/20161228/t20161228_523405232.shtml  \u6b66\u6c49\u5730\u94c1\u673a\u573a\u7ebf\u53ca6\u53f7\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a \u6e56\u5317\u79fb\u52a8\u5168\u9762\u5e03\u5c40\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6]</ref>\n|Jinyinhu Park \u2014 Dongfeng Motor Corporation\t\n|27\n|35.512\n|-\n|Northern extension of Line 2{{NoteTag|also known as Airport Line }}\n|Tianhe International Airport \u2014 Jinyintan\t\n|7\n|19.957\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 8\n| rowspan=\"3\"|{{date|2017-12-26}}\n|Jintan Road \u2014 Liyuan\t\n|12\n|16.204\n|-\n|Yangluo Line\n|Houhu Boulevard \u2014 Jintai\n|16\n|34.575\n|-\n|Jinghe extension of Line 1\n|Dongwu Boulevard \u2014 Jinghe\n|3\n|4.118\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 7\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{date|2018-10-1}}<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20181001/003195.htm#p=1|website=www.xinhuanet.com|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u957f\u6c5f\u516c\u94c1\u96a7\u9053\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a 7\u53f7\u7ebf\u300111\u53f7\u7ebf\u8bd5\u8fd0\u8425|access-date=2017-12-26}}</ref>\n|Garden Expo North \u2014 Yezhihu\n|19\n|30.413\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 11\n|Optics Valley Railway Station \u2014 Zuoling\n|13\n|18.744\n|-\n|Southern extension of Line 7\n|{{date|2018-12-28}}\n|Yezhihu \u2014 Qinglongshan Ditiexiaozhen\n|7\n|16.550\n|-\n|Southern extension of Line 2\n|{{date|2019-2-19}}\n|Optics Valley Square \u2014 Fozuling\n|10\n|13.195\n|-\n|Wsetern extension of Line 4<ref name=cjn201909>{{cite web|url=http://news.cjn.cn/sywh/201909/t3460424.htm|title=\u5b9a\u4e86\uff01\u5730\u94c1\u8521\u7538\u7ebf25\u65e5\u4e0a\u53489\u65f6\u5f00\u901a|date=2019-09-23}}</ref>\n|{{date|2019-9-25}}\n|  Bailin \u2014 Huangjinkou\n|9\n|16.288\n|-\n|Phase \u2162 of Line 8<ref name=Wuhan8-3>{{cite web|url=https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3LnB6Rl_lBp71IWU5fBITA|title=\u660e\u65e59\u70b9\uff0c\u6b66\u6c49\u8f68\u9053\u4ea4\u901a8\u53f7\u7ebf\u4e09\u671f\u5de5\u7a0b\u5f00\u901a\u8bd5\u8fd0\u8425|work=Wuhan Metro Operation|date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n|{{date|2019-11-6}}\n|Yezhihu \u2014 Military Athletes' Village\n|3\n|4.832\n|}\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==Lines==\n{{center|[[File:Wuhan Metro System Map.svg|750px]]}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;text-align:center\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"100\" style=\"width:450px; \"|Current system\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"text\"|Line Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"2\"|Termini\n!
