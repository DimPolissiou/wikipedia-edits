A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an [[earthquake]] that causes a [[tsunami]], resulting in coastal [[flooding]]. Some manufactured disasters have been ascribed to nature.<ref name=China.NYT/>\n\nSome researchers also differentiate between recurring events such as seasonal flooding, and those considered unpredictable.<ref>{{Cite journal  |journal=Environment and Urbanization\n|author1=L.

However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[landform]]s, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]].\n[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]\n\n===Human-made disasters===\n{{Main|Anthropogenic hazard}}\nHuman-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological or human hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, [[industrial accident]]s, [[oil spills]], [[terrorist attacks]], \n[[nuclear explosion]]s/[[nuclear radiation]]. [[War]] and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category.\n\nOther types of induced disasters include the more cosmic scenarios of catastrophic [[global warming]], [[nuclear war]], and [[bioterrorism]].\n\nOne opinion argues that all disasters can be seen as human-made, due to human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.<ref name=atrisk>Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis & Ben Wisner.

However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[landform]]s, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]].\n[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]\n\n===Human-made disasters===\n{{Main|Anthropogenic hazard}}\nHuman-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological or human hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, [[industrial accident]]s, [[oil spills]], [[terrorist attacks]], \n[[nuclear explosion]]s/[[nuclear radiation]]. [[War]] and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category.\n\nOther types of induced disasters include the more cosmic scenarios of catastrophic [[global warming]], [[nuclear war]], and [[bioterrorism]].\n\nOne opinion argues that all disasters can be seen as human-made, due to human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.<ref name=atrisk>Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis & Ben Wisner.

Commonwealth of Australia {{ISBN|0-642-04793-6}}</ref> The original design is thought to have been inspired by the 1805 [[Bowman Flag]], which showed the rose, shamrock and thistle supported by a kangaroo and emu.<ref>Letter from [[William Gullick]] to Atlee Hunt, 10 July 1908</ref> <!--The design of the 1908 arms was prepared by E. Wilson Dobbs according to specifications from [[Alfred Deakin]] and the [[College of Arms]]. -->\n\nIt consisted of a shield in the centre, the seven pointed star on a wreath as the crest above it, and a [[kangaroo]] and an [[emu]] using its foot to help the kangaroo to support the shield, all on a bed of green grass with a scroll containing the motto \"Advance Australia\". The selection of the kangaroo, the emu and the words, \"Advance Australia\" was tied together symbolically. The shield had a white background, with a red [[St George's Cross|cross of Saint George]], blue lines outside the cross, and a blue border containing six [[inescutcheon]]s featuring a red chevron on white, representing the six states. The Scottish Patriotic Association was vocally opposed to the shield's design, noting that it should display the [[Union Jack]] to represent British and Irish settlers. These arms were used by the government and appeared on the sixpence coin from 1910 until 1963, and the threepence, shilling and florin from 1910 to 1936.\n\nThe 1908 arms were redesigned in 1911, and officially granted by George V on 19 September 1912. The redesign spurred much debate in Parliament. The Member for [[Division of Wentworth|Wentworth]], [[Willie Kelly (politician)|Willie Kelly]], said:\n<blockquote>\"The emu and kangaroo are so built that they hardly fit into the heraldic atmosphere, and I think we make ourselves ridiculous when we endeavour to carry on the traditions of the Old World with some of the wild creations of our Australian fauna.\"<ref>Hansard, House of Representatives, 31 October 1912</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite objections, the kangaroo and emu now not having its leg up remained the shield bearers in the new coat of arms and were modified to appear more realistic. The principal reason for the redesign was the concern that [[States and territories of Australia|Australia's states]] were not individually represented; that was achieved by showing each state's [[heraldic badge]] on the shield. The new coat of arms removed the bed of grass beneath the shield and changed the scroll to read simply \"Australia\". The colours in the wreath were also changed from blue and white to blue and gold. A background of two sprays of golden wattle was added, but it has never been an official part of the armorial bearings,<ref name=dfat/> even though the golden wattle was proclaimed Australia's national flower on 19 August 1988 by the Governor-General [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Floral Emblems of Australia|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/emblems/ac.pyc.gaz.html|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe use of each state's badge had been a feature of the first [[Great Seal of Australia]], introduced on 21 January 1904, where they surrounded [[Royal arms of the United Kingdom|the UK Royal Arms]]; according to Charles R.

Commonwealth of Australia {{ISBN|0-642-04793-6}}</ref> The original design is thought to have been inspired by the 1805 [[Bowman Flag]], which showed the rose, shamrock and thistle supported by a kangaroo and emu.<ref>Letter from [[William Gullick]] to Atlee Hunt, 10 July 1908</ref> <!--The design of the 1908 arms was prepared by E. Wilson Dobbs according to specifications from [[Alfred Deakin]] and the [[College of Arms]]. -->\n\nIt consisted of a shield in the centre, the seven pointed star on a wreath as the crest above it, and a [[kangaroo]] and an [[emu]] using its foot to help the kangaroo to support the shield, all on a bed of green grass with a scroll containing the motto \"Advance Australia\". The selection of the kangaroo, the emu and the words, \"Advance Australia\" was tied together symbolically. The shield had a white background, with a red [[St George's Cross|cross of Saint George]], blue lines outside the cross, and a blue border containing six [[inescutcheon]]s featuring a red chevron on white, representing the six states. The Scottish Patriotic Association was vocally opposed to the shield's design, noting that it should display the [[Union Jack]] to represent British and Irish settlers. These arms were used by the government and appeared on the sixpence coin from 1910 until 1963, and the threepence, shilling and florin from 1910 to 1936.\n\nThe 1908 arms were redesigned in 1911, and officially granted by George V on 19 September 1912. The redesign spurred much debate in Parliament. The Member for [[Division of Wentworth|Wentworth]], [[Willie Kelly (politician)|Willie Kelly]], said:\n<blockquote>\"The emu and kangaroo are so built that they hardly fit into the heraldic atmosphere, and I think we make ourselves ridiculous when we endeavour to carry on the traditions of the Old World with some of the wild creations of our Australian fauna.\"<ref>Hansard, House of Representatives, 31 October 1912</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite objections, the kangaroo and emu now not having its leg up remained the shield bearers in the new coat of arms and were modified to appear more realistic. The principal reason for the redesign was the concern that [[States and territories of Australia|Australia's states]] were not individually represented; that was achieved by showing each state's [[heraldic badge]] on the shield. The new coat of arms removed the bed of grass beneath the shield and changed the scroll to read simply \"Australia\". The colours in the wreath were also changed from blue and white to blue and gold. A background of two sprays of golden wattle was added, but it has never been an official part of the armorial bearings,<ref name=dfat/> even though the golden wattle was proclaimed Australia's national flower on 19 August 1988 by the Governor-General [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Floral Emblems of Australia|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/emblems/ac.pyc.gaz.html|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens|accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe use of each state's badge had been a feature of the first [[Great Seal of Australia]], introduced on 21 January 1904, where they surrounded [[Royal arms of the United Kingdom|the UK Royal Arms]]; according to Charles R.

The city is known for its coal-mining in the surrounding region.\n\n== History ==\neMalahleni was founded as Witbank in 1890 and early attempts to exploit the [[coal]] deposits failed until the [[railway]] from [[Pretoria]] reached the area in 1894. It was proclaimed a town in 1903 and became a [[municipality]] in 1914.\n\nThere are many stories about the city and its origination but the top story would be the arrival of [[Winston Churchill]] at the nearby [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and [[Delagoa Bay Colliery]] during his escape from Boer imprisonment in [[Pretoria]], on his way to [[Delagoa Bay]] (later Louren\u00e7o Marques, and then [[Maputo]], in [[Mozambique]]). Some local residents, loyal to the Crown, assisted  him in hiding and making the final leg of his escape, thus gaining Witbank the consequent credit once the details of these events could be made known. The town has grown since then from a farming community into a business destination where companies such as [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]], [[BHP Billiton]], [[Evraz]], [[Eskom]], [[Exxaro]], Joy, [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]], the [[Renova Group]], [[SAB Miller]], [[SAMANCOR]], [[Shanduka Beverages]], [[Www.tmissp.co.za|TMISSP]] and [[Xstrata]] amongst many others have found substantial returns on their investments.\n\nOn March 3, 2006, Witbank was officially renamed to eMalahleni, meaning 'place of coal', in reference to the area's coal-mining heritage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Witbank|url=http://www.mpumalanga.com/discover/regions/cultural-heartland/witbank|website=Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency |accessdate=30 January 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202091916/http://www.mpumalanga.com/discover/regions/cultural-heartland/witbank |archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Name change ===\n\nOn 3 March 2006,<ref name=\"sagnsOldPlaceNames\">[http://sagns.dac.gov.za/Public/OldPlaceNames.aspx?Contains=W South African Geographical Names System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208231544/http://sagns.dac.gov.za/Public/OldPlaceNames.aspx?Contains=W |date=2010-02-08 }}</ref> Witbank was officially renamed to '''eMalahleni''', meaning \"place of coal\"<ref name=\"nextInLinePretoriaNews\">{{Citation | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = Witbank may be next in line for name change\n  | newspaper = Pretoria News  | pages = 7  | year =  | date = September 22, 2005  | url = http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20050922073217459C204192  | accessdate =}}</ref> matching the name of the [[Emalahleni Local Municipality, Mpumalanga|municipality that contains it]]. A large number of signs to the town have already changed, but many still remain. Some landmarks bearing the name Witbank have remained, while others (such as the Witbank/eMalahleni dam) have been renamed.\n\nDespite attempts by governing bodies to establish the use of the name, eMalahleni, for the city as well as for the district, locals still tend to call the city by its original name. Similarly to the anglicised pronunciation of [[Johannesburg]], [[South African English|English-speaking residents]] pronounce the name as \u201cwit\u2022bank\u201d and not as \u201cvit\u2022bunk\u201d as in the original Afrikaans pronunciation, nor as \u201cvit\u2022bank\u201d as English-speaking visitors are prone to say.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Station Witbank.JPG|thumb|right|eMalahleni \n railway station]]\n[[File:Reyno Ridge, voorstad van Witbank, Mpumalanga, a.jpg|thumb|right|View of Reyno Ridge, a suburb in eastern eMalahleni]]\neMalahleni is located along the [[Pretoria\u2013Maputo railway|railway line linking Pretoria to Maputo]]<ref name=\"Atlassian\">[https://dlca.logcluster.org/display/public/DLCA/2.4+Mozambique+Railway+Assessment Mozambique Logistics Infrastructure: Mozambique Railway Assessment].

In recent years, this line has been under frequent threat of collapse due to underground coal fires in disused mines in the area.\n\nTwo national highways, the N4 from Pretoria and the N12 from Johannesburg, converge at eMalahleni and then continue to Komatipoort, on  the border of Mozambique. Together, these routes form the Maputo Corridor, a strategically important alternative to the South African ports of Richards Bay and Durban on the Indian Ocean shores of the country.\n\n== Economy ==\n\neMalahleni is in a [[coal mining]] area with more than 22 collieries in the municipal radius. There are a number of [[Fossil fuel power plant|power stations]] (such as the [[Duvha Power Station]]), as well as a steel mill (Evraz Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited) nearby which all require coal. The farm land surrounding eMalahleni is fast being bought by investors, coal mining companies and real estate developers to accommodate the rapid growth of the city which is good for local businesses and residents. The region has the dirtiest air in the world due to the coal mining and plant power stations.<ref>[https://witbanknews.co.za/116572/dirtiest-air-world/]</ref>\n\nLikewise, the sustained growth of the commercial areas and suburbs has presented significant challenges to the municipal government. Potable water supplies, sewage treatment, electricity distribution, refuse collection and road maintenance are particularly affected, arousing sustained ire amongst the local residents. Relatively high summer rainfall since 2008 has caused significant damage to municipal roads, creating large numbers of potholes and leaving large amounts of debris on the road surfaces.\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe 2001 census<ref>[http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/80948 2001 census information about eMalahleni, including ethnic groups, languages and population]</ref> found that eMalahleni had a population of 61,093, of which 50.6% were female and 49.4% male.\n\nAs of 2011 ([[Statistics South Africa]]) the city's population stood at 108,674 people.\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nAccording to the 2011 census the largest ethnic groups in eMalahleni were [[Black African]] at 48.1%, [[White people|Whites]] at 46.8% and the remainder consisting of [[Coloureds]] (2.0%) and [[Asian South African|Asians]] (2.5%).\n{{bar box\n|title=Ethnic groups in Witbank/eMalahleni\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Ethnic group\n|right1=Percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|White|yellow|54.2}}\n{{bar percent|Black|black|40.3}}\n{{bar percent|Coloured|orange|4.8}}\n{{bar percent|Asian|brown|0.7}}\n}}\n\n=== Language ===\nAmong the white population, eMalahleni (like the rest of [[Mpumalanga]]) is mainly Afrikaans speaking. The Black population speak mostly Zulu, the Coloureds speak Afrikaans and Asians mostly English. According to the 2001 census the largest languages in eMalahleni were as followed: [[Afrikaans]] (48.8%), [[Zulu language|Zulu]] (23.1%), [[English language|English]] (11.7%), [[Northern Sotho]] (5.2%) and [[Swazi language|Swazi]] (3.0%).\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages in Witbank/eMalahleni\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Language\n|right1=Percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]|orange|48.8}}\n{{bar percent|[[Zulu language|Zulu]]|yellow|23.1}}\n{{bar percent|English|red|11.7}}\n{{bar percent|N.

While many of these residents aspire to relocate to the more spacious suburbs around the city center, generally this has only been affordable to a few thousand, due to the prices of the suburban real estate. There are now communities on the northwest side of the city that have been established at Pine Ridge (consisting predominantly of Indian residents), Klarinet and Siyanqoba. Pressure to develop the city's suburbs has been exacerbated by the gradual de-population of the surrounding colliery villages as well as the continued development of new coal-fired power stations in the area.\n\n== Tourism ==\nAs eMalahleni is en route to travellers  from the [[Gauteng]] province to the [[Kruger National Park]], attempts have been made to capture some of the potential tourist spend. Apart from a few hotels, there are many guest houses. These vary from the utilitarian to the luxurious, and also cater for many of the business travellers visiting eMalahleni as well as those travelling to [[Nelspruit|Mbombela]], [[Swaziland|eSwatini]] and [[Mozambique]].

The city is known for its coal-mining in the surrounding region.\n\n== History ==\neMalahleni was founded as Witbank in 1890 and early attempts to exploit the [[coal]] deposits failed until the [[railway]] from [[Pretoria]] reached the area in 1894. It was proclaimed a town in 1903 and became a [[municipality]] in 1914.\n\nThere are many stories about the city and its origination but the top story would be the arrival of [[Winston Churchill]] at the nearby [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and [[Delagoa Bay Colliery]] during his escape from Boer imprisonment in [[Pretoria]], on his way to [[Delagoa Bay]] (later Louren\u00e7o Marques, and then [[Maputo]], in [[Mozambique]]). Some local residents, loyal to the Crown, assisted  him in hiding and making the final leg of his escape, thus gaining Witbank the consequent credit once the details of these events could be made known. The town has grown since then from a farming community into a business destination where companies such as [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]], [[BHP Billiton]], [[Evraz]], [[Eskom]], [[Exxaro]], Joy, [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]], the [[Renova Group]], [[SAB Miller]], [[SAMANCOR]], [[Shanduka Beverages]], [[Www.tmissp.co.za|TMISSP]] and [[Xstrata]] amongst many others have found substantial returns on their investments.\n\nOn March 3, 2006, Witbank was officially renamed to eMalahleni, meaning 'place of coal', in reference to the area's coal-mining heritage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Witbank|url=http://www.mpumalanga.com/discover/regions/cultural-heartland/witbank|website=Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency |accessdate=30 January 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170202091916/http://www.mpumalanga.com/discover/regions/cultural-heartland/witbank |archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Name change ===\n\nOn 3 March 2006,<ref name=\"sagnsOldPlaceNames\">[http://sagns.dac.gov.za/Public/OldPlaceNames.aspx?Contains=W South African Geographical Names System] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208231544/http://sagns.dac.gov.za/Public/OldPlaceNames.aspx?Contains=W |date=2010-02-08 }}</ref> Witbank was officially renamed to '''eMalahleni''', meaning \"place of coal\"<ref name=\"nextInLinePretoriaNews\">{{Citation | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = Witbank may be next in line for name change\n  | newspaper = Pretoria News  | pages = 7  | year =  | date = September 22, 2005  | url = http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20050922073217459C204192  | accessdate =}}</ref> matching the name of the [[Emalahleni Local Municipality, Mpumalanga|municipality that contains it]]. A large number of signs to the town have already changed, but many still remain. Some landmarks bearing the name Witbank have remained, while others (such as the Witbank/eMalahleni dam) have been renamed.\n\nDespite attempts by governing bodies to establish the use of the name, eMalahleni, for the city as well as for the district, locals still tend to call the city by its original name. Similarly to the anglicised pronunciation of [[Johannesburg]], [[South African English|English-speaking residents]] pronounce the name as \u201cwit\u2022bank\u201d and not as \u201cvit\u2022bunk\u201d as in the original Afrikaans pronunciation, nor as \u201cvit\u2022bank\u201d as English-speaking visitors are prone to say.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Station Witbank.JPG|thumb|right|eMalahleni \n railway station]]\n[[File:Reyno Ridge, voorstad van Witbank, Mpumalanga, a.jpg|thumb|right|View of Reyno Ridge, a suburb in eastern eMalahleni]]\neMalahleni is located along the [[Pretoria\u2013Maputo railway|railway line linking Pretoria to Maputo]]<ref name=\"Atlassian\">[https://dlca.logcluster.org/display/public/DLCA/2.4+Mozambique+Railway+Assessment Mozambique Logistics Infrastructure: Mozambique Railway Assessment].

In recent years, this line has been under frequent threat of collapse due to underground coal fires in disused mines in the area.\n\nTwo national highways, the N4 from Pretoria and the N12 from Johannesburg, converge at eMalahleni and then continue to Komatipoort, on  the border of Mozambique. Together, these routes form the Maputo Corridor, a strategically important alternative to the South African ports of Richards Bay and Durban on the Indian Ocean shores of the country.\n\n== Economy ==\n\neMalahleni is in a [[coal mining]] area with more than 22 collieries in the municipal radius. There are a number of [[Fossil fuel power plant|power stations]] (such as the [[Duvha Power Station]]), as well as a steel mill (Evraz Highveld Steel and Vanadium Limited) nearby which all require coal. The farm land surrounding eMalahleni is fast being bought by investors, coal mining companies and real estate developers to accommodate the rapid growth of the city which is good for local businesses and residents. The region has the dirtiest air in the world due to the coal mining and plant power stations.<ref>[https://witbanknews.co.za/116572/dirtiest-air-world/]</ref>\n\nLikewise, the sustained growth of the commercial areas and suburbs has presented significant challenges to the municipal government. Potable water supplies, sewage treatment, electricity distribution, refuse collection and road maintenance are particularly affected, arousing sustained ire amongst the local residents. Relatively high summer rainfall since 2008 has caused significant damage to municipal roads, creating large numbers of potholes and leaving large amounts of debris on the road surfaces.\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe 2001 census<ref>[http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/80948 2001 census information about eMalahleni, including ethnic groups, languages and population]</ref> found that eMalahleni had a population of 61,093, of which 50.6% were female and 49.4% male.\n\nAs of 2011 ([[Statistics South Africa]]) the city's population stood at 108,674 people.\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nAccording to the 2011 census the largest ethnic groups in eMalahleni were [[Black African]] at 48.1%, [[White people|Whites]] at 46.8% and the remainder consisting of [[Coloureds]] (2.0%) and [[Asian South African|Asians]] (2.5%).\n{{bar box\n|title=Ethnic groups in Witbank/eMalahleni\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Ethnic group\n|right1=Percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|White|yellow|54.2}}\n{{bar percent|Black|black|40.3}}\n{{bar percent|Coloured|orange|4.8}}\n{{bar percent|Asian|brown|0.7}}\n}}\n\n=== Language ===\nAmong the white population, eMalahleni (like the rest of [[Mpumalanga]]) is mainly Afrikaans speaking. The Black population speak mostly Zulu, the Coloureds speak Afrikaans and Asians mostly English. According to the 2001 census the largest languages in eMalahleni were as followed: [[Afrikaans]] (48.8%), [[Zulu language|Zulu]] (23.1%), [[English language|English]] (11.7%), [[Northern Sotho]] (5.2%) and [[Swazi language|Swazi]] (3.0%).\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages in Witbank/eMalahleni\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Language\n|right1=Percent\n|float=right\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]|orange|48.8}}\n{{bar percent|[[Zulu language|Zulu]]|yellow|23.1}}\n{{bar percent|English|red|11.7}}\n{{bar percent|N.

While many of these residents aspire to relocate to the more spacious suburbs around the city center, generally this has only been affordable to a few thousand, due to the prices of the suburban real estate. There are now communities on the northwest side of the city that have been established at Pine Ridge (consisting predominantly of Indian residents), Klarinet and Siyanqoba. Pressure to develop the city's suburbs has been exacerbated by the gradual de-population of the surrounding colliery villages as well as the continued development of new coal-fired power stations in the area.\n\n== Tourism ==\nAs eMalahleni is en route to travellers  from the [[Gauteng]] province to the [[Kruger National Park]], attempts have been made to capture some of the potential tourist spend. Apart from a few hotels, there are many guest houses. These vary from the utilitarian to the luxurious, and also cater for many of the business travellers visiting eMalahleni as well as those travelling to [[Nelspruit|Mbombela]], [[Swaziland|eSwatini]] and [[Mozambique]]. A casino complex is accessible within a few hundred meters from the [[N4 (South Africa)|N4 highway]], providing two hotels, cinemas, ten-pin bowling and restaurants as well as the traditional gambling facilities. The Highveld Mall is built immediately next to the casino and is a retail hub for locals as well as for many residents of towns in the vicinity.\n\n=== Witbank dam ===\nThe Witbank dam is reputed to be the largest municipal dam in South Africa.
