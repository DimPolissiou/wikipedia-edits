It has been known that mismatch between expected and actual reward (also called \"negative prediction error\"), can lead to a state of frustration.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThis \"frustrative nonreward\" was first described by [[Abram Amsel]] in the 1950s and demonstrated in animal experiments by [[Nathan Azrin]] in 1966.<ref name=\"jama\"/> It is thought to be an evolutionarily conserved behavior linking prediction error and aggression.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nNegative prediction errors cause decreases in [[dopamine]] neuron firing. On the one hand this reduces the valuation of a stimulus, and thus helps learning, on the other hand it could increase the likelihood of aggression. Neurobiologically irritability can be adaptive and productive, motivating the living organism to overcome barriers or to dominate the environment. It can be non-productive, resulting in maladaptive behavior when prolonged or disproportionate.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThere appear to be different brain mechanisms associated irritability in children: First, irritability diminishes from toddlerhood through school age with increasing maturity of [[prefrontal cortex]]. Also, brain signatures of children with [[disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]] (DMDD), anxiety disorders, and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] are similar, while they differ from those with childhood bipolar disorder.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\n== Causes ==\nCauses may range from physiological causes like sleep deprivation, hormone imbalance maladaptation to stress and poor lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} \nIrritability is a symptom in mental disorders throughout the life span, including depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], dementia, [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]], traumatic brain injury and borderline personality disorder.<ref name=\"jama\" />\n\n== Treatments ==\nThe only US [[Food and Drug Administration]]\u2013approved medications for irritability are [[risperidone]] and [[aripiprazole]] in the context of autism.

These states can coincide with social lives and daily routines, making it more difficult to maintain. Someone is considered for to be irritable when they have a short temper and easily become frustrated in their situation and do not know how to stay calm in a pressured situation. Irritability is considered an emotion and can affect the mood in a negative way.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIrritability is associated with anxiety disorders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms/irritability.shtml|title=Irritability Anxiety Symptom|last=anxietycentre.com|website=anxietycentre.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref> The fight or flight responses triggered in the brain can make irritability easily developed and result in severe grouchiness and aggravation towards other people.

It has been known that mismatch between expected and actual reward (also called \"negative prediction error\"), can lead to a state of frustration.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThis \"frustrative nonreward\" was first described by [[Abram Amsel]] in the 1950s and demonstrated in animal experiments by [[Nathan Azrin]] in 1966.<ref name=\"jama\"/> It is thought to be an evolutionarily conserved behavior linking prediction error and aggression.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nNegative prediction errors cause decreases in [[dopamine]] neuron firing. On the one hand this reduces the valuation of a stimulus, and thus helps learning, on the other hand it could increase the likelihood of aggression. Neurobiologically irritability can be adaptive and productive, motivating the living organism to overcome barriers or to dominate the environment. It can be non-productive, resulting in maladaptive behavior when prolonged or disproportionate.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nThere appear to be different brain mechanisms associated irritability in children: First, irritability diminishes from toddlerhood through school age with increasing maturity of [[prefrontal cortex]]. Also, brain signatures of children with [[disruptive mood dysregulation disorder]] (DMDD), anxiety disorders, and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] are similar, while they differ from those with childhood bipolar disorder.<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\n== Causes ==\nCauses may range from physiological causes like sleep deprivation, hormone imbalance maladaptation to stress and poor lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} \nIrritability is a symptom in mental disorders throughout the life span, including depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], dementia, [[premenstrual dysphoric disorder]], traumatic brain injury and borderline personality disorder.<ref name=\"jama\" />\n\n== Treatments ==\nThe only US [[Food and Drug Administration]]\u2013approved medications for irritability are [[risperidone]] and [[aripiprazole]] in the context of autism. Stimulants and [[serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] are used, as well as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[parent management training]].<ref name=\"jama\"/>\n\nA change of lifestyle habits can assist in relieving the condition of irritability. Recommendations include reducing dietary intake of sodium and sugar.
