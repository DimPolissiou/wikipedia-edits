It is subordinate to the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] (''Bundesministerium des Innern (BMI)'').<ref>OSCE Entry on BPOL http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=17#Country_Profile_Section_211 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524060329/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=17 |date=2009-05-24 }}</ref> Ordinary police forces, meanwhile, are under the administration of the individual German states (''[[States of Germany|Bundesl\u00e4nder]]'') and are known as the ''[[Landespolizei]]''.\n\nThe ''Bundespolizei'' was formed from the ''[[Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (BGS) (\"Federal Border Guard\"), which had a more restricted role, the West German Railway Police (''[[Bahnpolizei]]''), formerly an independent force; and the East German ''[[Transportpolizei]]'' in 1990. \n\nPrior to 1994 BGS members also had military combatant status due to their historical foundation and [[border-guard]] role in West Germany. In July 2005 the law renaming the BGS as the BPOL was enacted.\n\n==Missions==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nThe BPOL has the following missions:\n\n* Border security (''Grenzpolizei'' or [[Grepo]]), to include passport control (only at borders with non-EU member countries prior to September 2015) and the provision of [[German Federal Coast Guard|coast guard]] services along Germany's {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline.\n* Providing transportation security at [[international airport]]s and on German railways.\n* Providing [[Air Marshal (civil aviation)|air (or sky) marshals]].\n* Providing counter-[[terrorism]] forces ([[GSG 9]]).\n* Providing the federal government's [[Bereitschaftspolizei|mobile response force]] for internal security events.\n* Protection of [[federal government|federal]] buildings such as Schloss Bellevue, the residence of the German [[President of Germany|Bundespr\u00e4sident]]; they also protect the two highest German courts, both in [[Karlsruhe]]:\n** The [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') and\n** The [[Federal Court of Justice]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'')\n* Supporting international police missions for the [[United Nations]] and EU in [[Kosovo]], [[Sudan]], [[Liberia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Gaza Strip]], [[Moldova]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\n* Providing in-house security for some German embassies.\n* Providing rescue [[helicopter]] service.\n[[File:Kontrolle der Bundespolizei.JPG|thumbnail|Stop and search on a motorway: BPOL inspecting a [[Coach (bus)|bus]] at a [[rest stop]] off [[Bundesautobahn 9]].]]\nThe ''Bundespolizei'' can also be used to reinforce [[landespolizei|state police]] if requested  by a state ''(Land)'' government. The BPOL maintains these reserve forces to deal with major demonstrations, disturbances or emergencies, supplementing the capabilities of the [[Bereitschaftspolizei|State Operational Support Units]].  Several highly trained detachments are available for crisis situations requiring [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s, [[water cannon]] or other special equipment.\n\nBPOL investigators conduct criminal investigations only within its jurisdiction; otherwise the cases are referred to the appropriate state police force or to the federal criminal investigative agency, the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police]] (''Bundeskriminalamt'', BKA).\n\nIn addition, the ''Bundespolizei'' cooperates closely with German state executive authorities, such as prosecutor's offices (''[[Staatsanwaltschaft]]'') in pursuing criminal investigations.\n\n===Restoration of border control tasking on all borders (2015)===\n\nOn the night of 13 September 2015 Germany unilaterally reintroduced [[border controls]], under emergency provisions of the [[Schengen Agreement]], due to the [[European migrant crisis|2015 European migrant crisis]] overwhelming Germany's available resources, law enforcement and otherwise. The nominally temporary border controls were initially put in place just on the border with Austria, but by the following day (Monday 14 September 2015) they were being put in place at all borders with fellow EU members. The same day, Austria and other EU members who were part of the [[Schengen Area]] began to put in place their own border controls (again meant to be temporary) in response to Germany's actions.\n\nThe new German border controls are to be primarily enforced both by the various ''[[Landespolizei]]'' of those German states that adjoin external borders, and in particular by the ''Bundespolizei''.\n\n==Strength==\nThe ''Bundespolizei'' consists of 48,686 personnel:\n*33,084 are fully trained police officers.\n**21,000 provide border, railway and aviation security.\n**6,000 serve in the [[Bereitschaftspolizei|Alert Police]].\n**3,000 serve in the following special units:\n*** The Central Office for Communications and Information.\n*** [[GSG 9]].\n*** The Aviation Wing.\n*7,528 candidates\n*8,074 salaried civilian (unarmed) support personnel, including:\n**6,800 [[civil service|civil servants]] who perform administrative and support services.\n**2,000 [[Immigration to Germany|Immigration]] inspectors (called the Individual Service) who perform operational duty handling border protection and immigration matters and airline passenger checks.\n\n==Organization==\n[[Image:Bundespolizei-Standortkarte.pdf|thumb|''Bundespolizei'' districts of Germany]]\n[[Image:Federal Police Patch.svg|thumb|130px|''Bundespolizei'' patch]]\n\nThe BPOL national headquarters (BPOL-''Pr\u00e4sidium'') in [[Potsdam]] performs all central control functions. Eight regional headquarters (BPOL-''Direktion'') control the BPOL stations conduct rail police and border protection missions. These areas of responsibility conform to the federal state boundaries which they did not do prior to 1 March 2008.\n\nThe regional headquarters are as follows:\n* [[Bad Bramstedt]] covering [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].\n* [[Hanover]] covering [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Lower Saxony]].\n* [[Sankt Augustin]] covering [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n* [[Koblenz]] covering [[Saarland]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Hesse]].\n* [[Stuttgart]] covering [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]].\n* [[Munich]] covering [[Bavaria]].\n* [[Pirna]] covering [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]].\n* [[Berlin]] covering [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]].\n\nThese regional headquarters each have an investigation department and a mobile inspection and observation unit. Moreover, they control the 67 BPOL stations (BPOL-''Inspektion'') which in turn control the ''Bundespolizeireviere'' or precincts located in places that require a 24-hour presence by BPOL officers.\n\nA special ''Direktion'' is responsible for [[Frankfurt International Airport]].\n\nThe central school for advanced and vocational training is in L\u00fcbeck and controls the six basic training schools in [[Swisttal]], [[Neustrelitz]], [[Oerlenbach]], [[Walsrode]], [[Eschwege]] and [[Bamberg]]. It is also in charge of the Federal Police Sport School in [[Bad Endorf]] and a competitive sport project in Kienbaum near Berlin. The sport school specialises in winter sport events and has trained many of Germany's top skiers and skaters such as [[Claudia Pechstein]].\n\nThe ''Zentrale Direktion Bundesbereitschaftspolizei'' controls the mobile support and rapid reaction battalions located in [[Bayreuth]], [[Deggendorf]], Blumberg (near Berlin), [[H\u00fcnfeld]], [[Uelzen]], [[Duderstadt]], [[Sankt Augustin]], [[Bad Bergzabern]], [[Bad D\u00fcben]] and [[Ratzeburg]]. The number of ''[[Bereitschaftspolizei]]'' companies increased in March 2008 from 28 to 29 comprising approx. 25 percent of Germany\u2019s police support units.<ref>[https://www.bundespolizei.de/cln_049/nn_249932/DE/Home/__Startseite/Neuorganisation/070426__konzept__neuorganisation,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/070426_konzept_neuorganisation.pdf Official BPOL news release on reorganisation (in German)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175600/http://www.bundespolizei.de/cln_049/nn_249932/DE/Home/__Startseite/Neuorganisation/070426__konzept__neuorganisation%2CtemplateId%3Draw%2Cproperty%3DpublicationFile.pdf/070426_konzept_neuorganisation.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}</ref>\n\n===BPOL Special Units===\nThe following special units also exist:\n\n* The BPOL Aviation Group is directly subordinate to the BPOL HQ in Potsdam. It controls the five aviation squadrons around the country that operate the force's helicopters. These are located in [[Fuhlendorf, Schleswig-Holstein|Fuhlendorf]] (north, with satellite airfield in [[Gifhorn]]), Blumberg (east), Fuldatal (centre), [[Oberschlei\u00dfheim]] (south) and Sankt Augustin (west). Its duties include;  border surveillance, monitoring installations belonging to German Rail, helping in serious accidents and disasters in Germany and abroad, searching for missing persons, searching for criminals on the run, supporting the [[Landespolizei|police forces of the federal states]], providing transportation for persons whose security is endangered, providing transportation for guests of the Federal government, supporting federal and state authorities, and providing air search and rescue services in coordination with the 12 air rescue centers throughout Germany.\n* The BFE+ Units (abbreviated from ''Securing of Evidences and Arrest of Suspects'') are a specialized division of regular BPOL [[Arrest unit|arresting units]], for quick response of terrorist attacks. The units where subsequently battled 2015 after the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|Charlie Hebdo attacks]] in France, due to respond faster and with higher firepower to massive terrorist attacks. BFE+ are decentralized and work as a first responder until the more specialized and centralized GSG9 arrive at the scene. The personal equipment is likely the same as [[Spezialeinsatzkommando|SEK]] officers are wearing ([[HK G36]] etc).\n* The [[GSG 9]] [[counter-terrorism]] group is directly subordinate to the BPOL HQ.\n* The BPOL Information and Communications Center is now a department of the BPOL HQ in Potsdam.\n\n[[File:2019-10-03_-_TDE_-_BP_81_-_Potsdam.jpg|right|thumb|New large offshore patrol vessel BP 81 ''Potsdam'']]\n* The [[water police]] stations with 16 patrol craft<ref name=vessels>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/06Die-Bundespolizei/Ausstattung/Boote/boote_node.html |title=Einsatzschiffe sowie Kontroll- und Streifenboote |trans-title=Cruise and patrol vessels |publisher=Bundespolizei |language=German |accessdate=18 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724140040/http://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/06Die-Bundespolizei/Ausstattung/Boote/boote_node.html |archivedate=24 July 2012 }}</ref> and helicopters are part of the [[German Federal Coast Guard]] and assigned to coastal BPOL stations. The watercraft include six offshore patrol vessels, e.g. those of the [[Bad Bramstedt class patrol vessel|''Bad Bramstedt'' class]], and the large ''Potsdam class'' as well as a number of fast inshore vessels and one [[tugboat]].<ref name=vessels/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Bundesadler.bgs.JPG|thumb|120px|''Bundesgrenzschutz'' patch (1952 to 1976)]]\n\nIn 1951 the West German government established a Federal Border Protection Force (''Bundesgrenzschutz'' or BGS) composed of 10,000 men under the Federal Interior Ministry\u2019s jurisdiction.  The force replaced allied military organisations such as the [[U.S. Constabulary]] then patrolling West Germany\u2019s borders.  The BGS was described as a mobile, lightly armed police force for border and internal security despite fears that it would be the nucleus of a new German army.  When West Germany did establish an army, the [[Bundeswehr]], BGS personnel were given the choice of staying in the BGS or joining the army.  Most decided to join the army.\n\nIn 1953, the BGS took control of the German Passport Control Service. In 1972 the  [[Compulsory Border Guard Service]] was enacted by the parliament, which - in theory - is still in force, but suspended, similar to the conscription for the [[Bundeswehr]].<ref>http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/brd/1994/D840+94.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=RcPPBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=Grenzschutzdienstpflicht#v=onepage&q=Grenzschutzdienstpflicht&f=false |title = Rechtskunde \u2014 leicht verst\u00e4ndlich|isbn = 9783663130871|last1 = Verheyen|first1 = Josef|date = 2013-11-11}}</ref> In 1976, the state police grades replaced the military rank structure and BGS training was modified to closely match that of the state police forces (''[[Landespolizei]]''). The West German Railway Police (''[[Bahnpolizei]]''), formerly an independent force, and the East German ''[[Transportpolizei]]'' were restructured under the BGS in 1990.\n\nIn July 2005, the BGS was renamed the ''Bundespolizei'' or BPOL (Federal Police) to reflect its transition to a multi-faceted federal police agency.  The change also involved a shift to blue uniforms and livery for vehicles and helicopters. The German Interior Ministry reviewed the structure of the BPOL in 2007 and in March 2008 made the structure leaner to get more officers out of offices and onto patrol.\n\n==Vehicles==\n[[Image:BPOL-BMW-blau-silber.JPG|thumb|right|BMW standard patrol car]]\n[[Image:BG34-71.JPG|right|thumb|A ''Bundespolizei'' van]]\n\n''Bundespolizei'' vehicles have number plates that are based on the BP XX-YYY system. BP stands for ''Bundespolizei.'' Older vehicles may still have the BGS \"BG\" plates.\n\nXX is a number from 10 to 55 indicating the type of vehicle:\n\n*10 to 12: Motorcycle\n*15 to 19: Car\n*20 to 24: Four wheel drive car\n*25 to 29: Car\n*30 to 39: Medium four wheel drive vehicle\n*40 to 49: Trucks and buses\n*50 to 54: Armoured cars.\n*55: Trailers\n\nYYY is a combination of up to three numbers.\n\nThe ''Bundespolizei'' have favoured, and in some cases still favor (where the model is still in production), the following types of car:\n\n* [[BMW]] [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series sedans and station wagons]]\n* [[Volkswagen Passat]] sedans and Variant station wagons\n* [[Volkswagen Golf]]\n* [[Volkswagen Transporter]] vans\n\n[[Image:2006-08 Frankfurt (Oder) 11.jpg|thumb|right|BMW R 1150 RT motorcycle]]\n\n==Weaponry== \nThis is some of the weaponry utilized by the Federal Police: \n* [[H&K G36]]\n* [[H&K MP5]]\n* [[H&K P30]]\n\n==Aircraft inventory==\nThe Federal Police now has been reduced to three flight amenities pattern of 94 helicopters.

Most of the dogs are [[German shepherd]]s. Other dog breeds are also used such as [[Belgian Shepherd Dog (Malinois)|malinois]], [[Dutch shepherd]], [[German wirehaired pointer]], [[giant schnauzer]], and [[rottweiler]]. They accompany their handlers on daily missions in railway facilities, at airports, at the border or in physical security. Most working dogs live with the families of their handlers. Basic and advanced training is performed under the supervision of the Federal Police Academy at the Federal Police canine schools in [[Bleckede]] (Lower Saxony) and [[Neuendettelsau]] (Bavaria) where dogs and handlers go through patrol dog and explosive detection courses.\n\n==Ranks==\n[[File:2019-10-03_-_TDE_-_BP_81_-_Potsdam.jpg|right|thumb|New large offshore patrol vessel BP 81 ''Potsdam'']]\n'''Junior ranks (''Mittlerer Dienst'')'''\n{| class=\"prettytable\" align=\"center\"\n!bgcolor=\"silver\"|Rank\n!bgcolor=\"silver\"|Translation\n!bgcolor=\"silver\"|Rank insignia\n!bgcolor=\"silver\"|Equivalent rank<br> in the<br> [[Bundeswehr]]\n|-\n|Polizeimeisteranw\u00e4rter (PMA)\n|align=\"center\"|''Probationary Constable''\n|align=\"center\"| [[File:Deutsche Bundespolizei -

It is subordinate to the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Federal Ministry of the Interior]] (''Bundesministerium des Innern (BMI)'').<ref>OSCE Entry on BPOL http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=17#Country_Profile_Section_211 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524060329/http://polis.osce.org/countries/details.php?item_id=17 |date=2009-05-24 }}</ref> Ordinary police forces, meanwhile, are under the administration of the individual German states (''[[States of Germany|Bundesl\u00e4nder]]'') and are known as the ''[[Landespolizei]]''.\n\nThe ''Bundespolizei'' was formed from the ''[[Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (BGS) (\"Federal Border Guard\"), which had a more restricted role, the West German Railway Police (''[[Bahnpolizei]]''), formerly an independent force; and the East German ''[[Transportpolizei]]'' in 1990. \n\nPrior to 1994 BGS members also had military combatant status due to their historical foundation and [[border-guard]] role in West Germany. In July 2005 the law renaming the BGS as the BPOL was enacted.\n\n==Missions==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nThe BPOL has the following missions:\n\n* Border security (''Grenzpolizei'' or [[Grepo]]), to include passport control (only at borders with non-EU member countries prior to September 2015) and the provision of [[German Federal Coast Guard|coast guard]] services along Germany's {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline.\n* Providing transportation security at [[international airport]]s and on German railways.\n* Providing [[Air Marshal (civil aviation)|air (or sky) marshals]].\n* Providing counter-[[terrorism]] forces ([[GSG 9]]).\n* Providing the federal government's [[Bereitschaftspolizei|mobile response force]] for internal security events.\n* Protection of [[federal government|federal]] buildings such as Schloss Bellevue, the residence of the German [[President of Germany|Bundespr\u00e4sident]]; they also protect the two highest German courts, both in [[Karlsruhe]]:\n** The [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (''Bundesverfassungsgericht'') and\n** The [[Federal Court of Justice]] (''Bundesgerichtshof'')\n* Supporting international police missions for the [[United Nations]] and EU in [[Kosovo]], [[Sudan]], [[Liberia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Gaza Strip]], [[Moldova]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].\n* Providing in-house security for some German embassies.\n* Providing rescue [[helicopter]] service.\n[[File:Kontrolle der Bundespolizei.JPG|thumbnail|Stop and search on a motorway: BPOL inspecting a [[Coach (bus)|bus]] at a [[rest stop]] off [[Bundesautobahn 9]].]]\nThe ''Bundespolizei'' can also be used to reinforce [[landespolizei|state police]] if requested  by a state ''(Land)'' government. The BPOL maintains these reserve forces to deal with major demonstrations, disturbances or emergencies, supplementing the capabilities of the [[Bereitschaftspolizei|State Operational Support Units]].  Several highly trained detachments are available for crisis situations requiring [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s, [[water cannon]] or other special equipment.\n\nBPOL investigators conduct criminal investigations only within its jurisdiction; otherwise the cases are referred to the appropriate state police force or to the federal criminal investigative agency, the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|Federal Criminal Police]] (''Bundeskriminalamt'', BKA).\n\nIn addition, the ''Bundespolizei'' cooperates closely with German state executive authorities, such as prosecutor's offices (''[[Staatsanwaltschaft]]'') in pursuing criminal investigations.\n\n===Restoration of border control tasking on all borders (2015)===\n\nOn the night of 13 September 2015 Germany unilaterally reintroduced [[border controls]], under emergency provisions of the [[Schengen Agreement]], due to the [[European migrant crisis|2015 European migrant crisis]] overwhelming Germany's available resources, law enforcement and otherwise. The nominally temporary border controls were initially put in place just on the border with Austria, but by the following day (Monday 14 September 2015) they were being put in place at all borders with fellow EU members. The same day, Austria and other EU members who were part of the [[Schengen Area]] began to put in place their own border controls (again meant to be temporary) in response to Germany's actions.\n\nThe new German border controls are to be primarily enforced both by the various ''[[Landespolizei]]'' of those German states that adjoin external borders, and in particular by the ''Bundespolizei''.\n\n==Strength==\nThe ''Bundespolizei'' consists of 48,686 personnel:\n*33,084 are fully trained police officers.\n**21,000 provide border, railway and aviation security.\n**6,000 serve in the [[Bereitschaftspolizei|Alert Police]].\n**3,000 serve in the following special units:\n*** The Central Office for Communications and Information.\n*** [[GSG 9]].\n*** The Aviation Wing.\n*7,528 candidates\n*8,074 salaried civilian (unarmed) support personnel, including:\n**6,800 [[civil service|civil servants]] who perform administrative and support services.\n**2,000 [[Immigration to Germany|Immigration]] inspectors (called the Individual Service) who perform operational duty handling border protection and immigration matters and airline passenger checks.\n\n==Organization==\n[[Image:Bundespolizei-Standortkarte.pdf|thumb|''Bundespolizei'' districts of Germany]]\n[[Image:Federal Police Patch.svg|thumb|130px|''Bundespolizei'' patch]]\n\nThe BPOL national headquarters (BPOL-''Pr\u00e4sidium'') in [[Potsdam]] performs all central control functions. Eight regional headquarters (BPOL-''Direktion'') control the BPOL stations conduct rail police and border protection missions. These areas of responsibility conform to the federal state boundaries which they did not do prior to 1 March 2008.\n\nThe regional headquarters are as follows:\n* [[Bad Bramstedt]] covering [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]].\n* [[Hanover]] covering [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Lower Saxony]].\n* [[Sankt Augustin]] covering [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n* [[Koblenz]] covering [[Saarland]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Hesse]].\n* [[Stuttgart]] covering [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]].\n* [[Munich]] covering [[Bavaria]].\n* [[Pirna]] covering [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]].\n* [[Berlin]] covering [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]].\n\nThese regional headquarters each have an investigation department and a mobile inspection and observation unit. Moreover, they control the 67 BPOL stations (BPOL-''Inspektion'') which in turn control the ''Bundespolizeireviere'' or precincts located in places that require a 24-hour presence by BPOL officers.\n\nA special ''Direktion'' is responsible for [[Frankfurt International Airport]].\n\nThe central school for advanced and vocational training is in L\u00fcbeck and controls the six basic training schools in [[Swisttal]], [[Neustrelitz]], [[Oerlenbach]], [[Walsrode]], [[Eschwege]] and [[Bamberg]]. It is also in charge of the Federal Police Sport School in [[Bad Endorf]] and a competitive sport project in Kienbaum near Berlin. The sport school specialises in winter sport events and has trained many of Germany's top skiers and skaters such as [[Claudia Pechstein]].\n\nThe ''Zentrale Direktion Bundesbereitschaftspolizei'' controls the mobile support and rapid reaction battalions located in [[Bayreuth]], [[Deggendorf]], Blumberg (near Berlin), [[H\u00fcnfeld]], [[Uelzen]], [[Duderstadt]], [[Sankt Augustin]], [[Bad Bergzabern]], [[Bad D\u00fcben]] and [[Ratzeburg]]. The number of ''[[Bereitschaftspolizei]]'' companies increased in March 2008 from 28 to 29 comprising approx. 25 percent of Germany\u2019s police support units.<ref>[https://www.bundespolizei.de/cln_049/nn_249932/DE/Home/__Startseite/Neuorganisation/070426__konzept__neuorganisation,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/070426_konzept_neuorganisation.pdf Official BPOL news release on reorganisation (in German)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175600/http://www.bundespolizei.de/cln_049/nn_249932/DE/Home/__Startseite/Neuorganisation/070426__konzept__neuorganisation%2CtemplateId%3Draw%2Cproperty%3DpublicationFile.pdf/070426_konzept_neuorganisation.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}</ref>\n\n===BPOL Special Units===\nThe following special units also exist:\n\n* The BPOL Aviation Group is directly subordinate to the BPOL HQ in Potsdam. It controls the five aviation squadrons around the country that operate the force's helicopters. These are located in [[Fuhlendorf, Schleswig-Holstein|Fuhlendorf]] (north, with satellite airfield in [[Gifhorn]]), Blumberg (east), Fuldatal (centre), [[Oberschlei\u00dfheim]] (south) and Sankt Augustin (west). Its duties include;  border surveillance, monitoring installations belonging to German Rail, helping in serious accidents and disasters in Germany and abroad, searching for missing persons, searching for criminals on the run, supporting the [[Landespolizei|police forces of the federal states]], providing transportation for persons whose security is endangered, providing transportation for guests of the Federal government, supporting federal and state authorities, and providing air search and rescue services in coordination with the 12 air rescue centers throughout Germany.\n* The BFE+ Units (abbreviated from ''Securing of Evidences and Arrest of Suspects'') are a specialized division of regular BPOL [[Arrest unit|arresting units]], for quick response of terrorist attacks. The units where subsequently battled 2015 after the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|Charlie Hebdo attacks]] in France, due to respond faster and with higher firepower to massive terrorist attacks. BFE+ are decentralized and work as a first responder until the more specialized and centralized GSG9 arrive at the scene. The personal equipment is likely the same as [[Spezialeinsatzkommando|SEK]] officers are wearing ([[HK G36]] etc).\n* The [[GSG 9]] [[counter-terrorism]] group is directly subordinate to the BPOL HQ.\n* The BPOL Information and Communications Center is now a department of the BPOL HQ in Potsdam.\n\n[[File:2019-10-03_-_TDE_-_BP_81_-_Potsdam.jpg|right|thumb|New large offshore patrol vessel BP 81 ''Potsdam'']]\n* The [[water police]] stations with 16 patrol craft<ref name=vessels>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/06Die-Bundespolizei/Ausstattung/Boote/boote_node.html |title=Einsatzschiffe sowie Kontroll- und Streifenboote |trans-title=Cruise and patrol vessels |publisher=Bundespolizei |language=German |accessdate=18 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724140040/http://www.bundespolizei.de/DE/06Die-Bundespolizei/Ausstattung/Boote/boote_node.html |archivedate=24 July 2012 }}</ref> and helicopters are part of the [[German Federal Coast Guard]] and assigned to coastal BPOL stations.

The force replaced allied military organisations such as the [[U.S. Constabulary]] then patrolling West Germany\u2019s borders.  The BGS was described as a mobile, lightly armed police force for border and internal security despite fears that it would be the nucleus of a new German army.  When West Germany did establish an army, the [[Bundeswehr]], BGS personnel were given the choice of staying in the BGS or joining the army.  Most decided to join the army.\n\nIn 1953, the BGS took control of the German Passport Control Service. In 1972 the  [[Compulsory Border Guard Service]] was enacted by the parliament, which - in theory - is still in force, but suspended, similar to the conscription for the [[Bundeswehr]].<ref>http://dipbt.bundestag.de/doc/brd/1994/D840+94.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=RcPPBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=Grenzschutzdienstpflicht#v=onepage&q=Grenzschutzdienstpflicht&f=false |title = Rechtskunde \u2014 leicht verst\u00e4ndlich|isbn = 9783663130871|last1 = Verheyen|first1 = Josef|date = 2013-11-11}}</ref> In 1976, the state police grades replaced the military rank structure and BGS training was modified to closely match that of the state police forces (''[[Landespolizei]]''). The West German Railway Police (''[[Bahnpolizei]]''), formerly an independent force, and the East German ''[[Transportpolizei]]'' were restructured under the BGS in 1990.\n\nIn July 2005, the BGS was renamed the ''Bundespolizei'' or BPOL (Federal Police) to reflect its transition to a multi-faceted federal police agency.  The change also involved a shift to blue uniforms and livery for vehicles and helicopters. The German Interior Ministry reviewed the structure of the BPOL in 2007 and in March 2008 made the structure leaner to get more officers out of offices and onto patrol.\n\n==Vehicles==\n[[Image:BPOL-BMW-blau-silber.JPG|thumb|right|BMW standard patrol car]]\n[[Image:BG34-71.JPG|right|thumb|A ''Bundespolizei'' van]]\n\n''Bundespolizei'' vehicles have number plates that are based on the BP XX-YYY system. BP stands for ''Bundespolizei.'' Older vehicles may still have the BGS \"BG\" plates.\n\nXX is a number from 10 to 55 indicating the type of vehicle:\n\n*10 to 12: Motorcycle\n*15 to 19: Car\n*20 to 24: Four wheel drive car\n*25 to 29: Car\n*30 to 39: Medium four wheel drive vehicle\n*40 to 49: Trucks and buses\n*50 to 54: Armoured cars.\n*55: Trailers\n\nYYY is a combination of up to three numbers.\n\nThe ''Bundespolizei'' have favoured, and in some cases still favor (where the model is still in production), the following types of car:\n\n* [[BMW]] [[BMW 5 Series|5 Series sedans and station wagons]]\n* [[Volkswagen Passat]] sedans and Variant station wagons\n* [[Volkswagen Golf]]\n* [[Volkswagen Transporter]] vans\n\n[[Image:2006-08 Frankfurt (Oder) 11.jpg|thumb|right|BMW R 1150 RT motorcycle]]\n\n==Weaponry== \nThis is some of the weaponry utilized by the Federal Police: \n* [[H&K G36]]\n* [[H&K MP5]]\n* [[H&K P30]]\n\n==Aircraft inventory==\nThe Federal Police now has been reduced to three flight amenities pattern of 94 helicopters.

In the English anime adaptations he is known as '''Sanosuke Sagara''' and nicknamed '''Sano'''. Watsuki, being a fan of the [[Shinsengumi]], created Sanosuke by basing his name and characteristics on that of a real Shinsengumi member named [[Harada Sanosuke]].\n\nSet during a fictional version of Japan in the pre-[[Meiji period]], Sanosuke is a former member of the [[Sekih\u014dtai|Sekih\u014d Army]]. When the group is destroyed by the [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji Government]], he becomes a fighter-for-hire to calm his anger by fighting. During his introduction in the series, he encounters the wanderer [[Himura Kenshin]], who easily defeats him and is able to convince him to stop his mercenary work and instead start protecting people. After that encounter, Sanosuke becomes Kenshin's best friend as well as his partner in most of their fights.\n\nSanosuke appears in the featured films of the series and in other media relating to the ''Rurouni Kenshin'' franchise, including a plethora of electronic games and [[original video animation]]s (OVAs). Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Sanosuke's character. Mania Entertainment praised his character development, noting that he becomes more trustworthy and reliable as the series progresses.<ref name=\"friend\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mania.com/rurouni-kenshin-vol06_article_81696.html |title= Mania.com Review: Rurouni Kenshin volume 6 |date= 2002-01-22 |accessdate= 2008-01-25 | publisher= Mania Entertainment | author=Lavey, Megan | archivedate=2009-07-18 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718203407/http://www.mania.com/rurouni-kenshin-vol06_article_81696.html}}</ref> [[Syfy#Website|SciFi.com]] referred to him as a \"video-game icon\", and noted how he is portrayed  as a \"tragic figure\".<ref name=\"human\">{{cite web|url= http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue181/anime.html|title=Rurouni Kenshin TV The first steps down a very popular road|author=Robinson, Tasha|publisher=[[Syfy#Website|SciFi.com]] |accessdate= 2008-05-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418060250/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue181/anime.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-18}}</ref> Sanosuke has been  popular with the ''Rurouni Kenshin'' reader base, placing second in every popularity poll.

Watsuki created him to be Kenshin's best friend, who is willing to punch him when he is sad to make him \"wake up\" from his sadness. Although Sanosuke is a main character in the series, Watsuki felt that he could not write everything he wanted about him, and thought that making him the title character of a series would prove interesting.<ref name=\"WatsukiInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animeondvd.com/conitem.php?item=190 |title=Anime Expo 2002: Friday Report |first=Andrew |last=Tei |date= |publisher=Mania Entertainment |access-date=2008-05-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215165012/http://www.animeondvd.com/conitem.php?item=190 |archive-date=2004-12-15 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe character is based on [[Shinsengumi]] member [[Harada Sanosuke]]. Watsuki describes Sanosuke's visual motif by referring to his design model, Lamp, the main character of Susumu Sendo and [[Takeshi Obata]]'s ''[[Mashin B\u014dken Tan Lamp-Lamp]]''. Watsuki, working as an assistant on Obata's manga, formed the character by doodling in sketchbooks, adding and subtracting elements from the proposed character \"with blessings from the original artist, of course.\"<ref name=\"form\">{{cite book |title= Rurouni Kenshin, Volume 2 |last= Watsuki |first= Nobuhiro |publisher= [[Viz Media]] |chapter= The Secret Life of Characters (6) Sagara Sanosuke |year= 2003 |page= [https://archive.org/details/rurounikenshinme00wats_1/page/48 48] |isbn= 1-59116-249-1 |url= https://archive.org/details/rurounikenshinme00wats_1 |url-access= registration }}</ref> An elder Sanosuke was drafted by Watsuki to appear in the manga's finale but this idea was scrapped.

In the fifth ''kanzenban'', Watsuki redesigned the character of Sanosuke in a draft version. To emphasize his hate of the Meiji Government, Watsuki drew the Japanese [[kanji]] for {{nihongo4|\"evil\"|\u60e1|aku}} on the back of Sanosuke's jacket in the original series, but on the kanzenban redesign, the tattoo is located inside his clothes. Unlike in the manga where Sanosuke uses an oversized [[zanbat\u014d]] as a weapon, Watsuki gave him a more historically authentic zanbat\u014d; a sword notably thinner and longer in design. He also gave him an armor-like cloth to make him look more as a warrior.<ref>{{cite book |title= Rurouni Kenshin Kanzenban, Volume 5 |year= 2006|last= Watsuki |first= Nobuhiro |publisher= [[Shueisha]] |page=2|isbn=4-08-874154-4 }}</ref>\n\nThe fact that the CD book voice actors, especially [[Tomokazu Seki]] and [[Megumi Ogata]], who portrayed Sanosuke and Kenshin in the CD books, respectively, did not get their corresponding roles in the anime disappointed Watsuki.<ref name=\"Watsuki 2005 99\">{{cite book |title= Rurouni Kenshin, Volume 10 |last= Watsuki |first= Nobuhiro |year= 2005 |isbn= 978-1-59116-703-7 |publisher= [[Viz Media]] |page= [https://archive.org/details/rurounikenshinme00wats_0/page/99 99] |url= https://archive.org/details/rurounikenshinme00wats_0 |url-access= registration }}</ref> Ueda, Sanosuke's voice actor in the Japanese anime, commented that voicing Sanosuke in the original video animations was very complicated because his character was notably older and he has not acted in the role for a long period. He also said that he would have liked to see more fights involving Sanosuke in the original video animations, but was happy to see that Sanosuke had matured as a character.<ref>{{cite video | people=Ueda, Y\u016bji |date=2002|title=Rurouni Kenshin Seisouhen 1| medium=DVD|publisher=[[Sony]]}}</ref> Lex Lang, the voice actor of Sanosuke in the English adaptation of the anime, commented that his first impression of Sanosuke was as a fight-driven character motivated by anger, but as the story continued Sanosuke became friendly and more likable. Because his voice is noticeably different from Ueda's, Lang tries to create his own interpretation of Sanosuke's character. Lang has noted that the scene of the episode 22 of the anime, in which Sanosuke is afraid of a train because he believes it is a demon, was the most enjoyable scene for him to record; he added \"I recently saw it and had some big laughs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dubreview.com/ki_ll.php|title=Interview with Lex Lang|publisher=Dubreview.com|accessdate= 2008-05-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513102504/http://www.dubreview.com/ki_ll.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-13}}</ref>\n\nIn producing the English dub version of the series, [[Media Blasters]] chose [[Lex Lang]] as Sanosuke's [[Voice acting|voice actor]]. When writing Sanosuke's dialogue, Clark Cheng, the writer of the English dub script, noted that the character was smarter than he would have liked in the first few episodes, so Cheng tried slowly to change the character's dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent so he would be more similar to the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series.<ref name=\"ChengInterview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dubreview.com/ki_cc.php |title=Interview with Clark Cheng |publisher=Dub Review |date=November 2003 |accessdate=2008-05-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501044258/http://www.dubreview.com/ki_cc.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-01}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In ''Rurouni Kenshin''===\nBorn February 1860 in [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], Sanosuke is a former member of the [[Sekih\u014dtai|Sekih\u014d Army]].<ref name=\"Profiles\">{{cite book|title=Rurouni Kenshin Profiles|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|year=2005|isbn=978-1-4215-0160-4}}</ref> Having admired his captain [[List of Rurouni Kenshin characters#Sagara S\u014dz\u014d|Sagara S\u014dz\u014d]], he takes the [[family name]] Sagara from him.<ref name=\"Profiles\"/> But when the revolutionary government encounters financial problems, it labels the Sekih\u014d Army as frauds in order to \"bury their promises\".

In the English anime adaptations he is known as '''Sanosuke Sagara''' and nicknamed '''Sano'''. Watsuki, being a fan of the [[Shinsengumi]], created Sanosuke by basing his name and characteristics on that of a real Shinsengumi member named [[Harada Sanosuke]].\n\nSet during a fictional version of Japan in the pre-[[Meiji period]], Sanosuke is a former member of the [[Sekih\u014dtai|Sekih\u014d Army]]. When the group is destroyed by the [[Government of Meiji Japan|Meiji Government]], he becomes a fighter-for-hire to calm his anger by fighting. During his introduction in the series, he encounters the wanderer [[Himura Kenshin]], who easily defeats him and is able to convince him to stop his mercenary work and instead start protecting people. After that encounter, Sanosuke becomes Kenshin's best friend as well as his partner in most of their fights.\n\nSanosuke appears in the featured films of the series and in other media relating to the ''Rurouni Kenshin'' franchise, including a plethora of electronic games and [[original video animation]]s (OVAs). Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on Sanosuke's character. Mania Entertainment praised his character development, noting that he becomes more trustworthy and reliable as the series progresses.<ref name=\"friend\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mania.com/rurouni-kenshin-vol06_article_81696.html |title= Mania.com Review: Rurouni Kenshin volume 6 |date= 2002-01-22 |accessdate= 2008-01-25 | publisher= Mania Entertainment | author=Lavey, Megan | archivedate=2009-07-18 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718203407/http://www.mania.com/rurouni-kenshin-vol06_article_81696.html}}</ref> [[Syfy#Website|SciFi.com]] referred to him as a \"video-game icon\", and noted how he is portrayed  as a \"tragic figure\".<ref name=\"human\">{{cite web|url= http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue181/anime.html|title=Rurouni Kenshin TV The first steps down a very popular road|author=Robinson, Tasha|publisher=[[Syfy#Website|SciFi.com]] |accessdate= 2008-05-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080418060250/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue181/anime.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-04-18}}</ref> Sanosuke has been  popular with the ''Rurouni Kenshin'' reader base, placing second in every popularity poll.

In the fifth ''kanzenban'', Watsuki redesigned the character of Sanosuke in a draft version.

Unlike in the manga where Sanosuke uses an oversized [[zanbat\u014d]] as a weapon, Watsuki gave him a more historically authentic zanbat\u014d; a sword notably thinner and longer in design.

He served as principal of [[Alexis I. duPont High School]] (1894\u20131903) in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], superintendent of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] Public Schools (1903\u20131913) in Delaware, superintendent of [[Dorchester County Public Schools]] (1913\u20131917) in Maryland, and [[Delaware Department of Education|Delaware State commissioner of Education]] (1917\u20131921).\n\nBorn in West Virginia, Spaid began his career in education as a schoolteacher in Virginia and as a school administrator in Ohio. He became principal of Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1894, and superintendent of Delaware's New Castle County Public Schools in 1903. Throughout his tenure as superintendent, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools, he instituted pay raises for teachers to mitigate a teacher shortage, and he served on a committee to revise the state public school system's curriculum.\n\nSpaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from [[Columbia University]] in 1917, and became the Delaware State Commissioner of Education that same year. As state commissioner, Spaid worked to bring efficiency to the state's public school system and his efforts resulted in the Delaware State Board of Education's adoption of a new school code in 1919. In 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education advocated for the observation of [[Memorial Day]] in the state's public schools. He left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in [[Chautauqua]]-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at [[Salem University]] in [[Salem, West Virginia]], from 1926 to 1936.\n\nSpaid was a [[Natural history|naturalist]] by hobby and took hundreds of photographs, using them to illustrate his nature study articles and lecture slides. Throughout his career as a school administrator, he served as an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple courses, institutes, and organizations. Spaid was also an avid writer, and he published articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Country Life in America]]''. He had planned to author a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens; however, his home and notebooks were destroyed in a fire in 1917. Spaid died at the home of his daughter in [[Winchester, Virginia]], in 1936.

Throughout his tenure as superintendent, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools, he instituted pay raises for teachers to mitigate a teacher shortage, and he served on a committee to revise the state public school system's curriculum.\n\nSpaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from [[Columbia University]] in 1917, and became the Delaware State Commissioner of Education that same year. As state commissioner, Spaid worked to bring efficiency to the state's public school system and led to the Delaware State Board of Education's adoption of a new school code in 1919. In 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education advocated for the observation of [[Memorial Day]] in the state's public schools. He left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in [[Chautauqua]]-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at [[Salem University]] in [[Salem, West Virginia]], from 1926 to 1936.\n\nSpaid was a [[Natural history|naturalist]] by hobby and took hundreds of photographs, using them to illustrate his nature study articles and lecture slides. Throughout his career as a school administrator, Spaid also served as an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple courses, institutes, and organizations. Spaid was also an avid writer, and he published articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Country Life in America]]''. Spaid had planned to author a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens; however, his home and notebooks were destroyed in a fire in 1917. Spaid died at the home of his daughter in [[Winchester, Virginia]], in 1936.

The bridge carries the {{NSWcity|Hornsby}} to {{NSWcity|Kariong}} section of highway, while the adjacent [[Brooklyn Bridge (Sydney)|Brooklyn Bridge]] carries the [[Pacific Motorway (Sydney\u2013Newcastle)|Pacific Motorway]] (M1).\n\nThe Peats Ferry Bridge is a single [[carriageway]] with one lane in each direction in [[Highways in Australia|state highway]] conditions; and permits the carriage of [[motor vehicle]]s, [[pedestrian]]s and [[bicycle]]s. The adjacent Brooklyn Bridge is a [[dual carriageway]] with three lanes in each direction of [[motorway]] [[grade separation|grade-separated]] conditions. Both bridges are maintained by [[Roads & Maritime Services|NSW Roads & Maritime Services]].\n\n==History==\nPeats Ferry, a [[ferry]] operated by George Peat from 1847 until the 1890s, provided a local crossing of the Hawkesbury River: at that time there was no direct road between Sydney and Newcastle. The ferry service was made redundant by the completion of the [[Central Coast & Newcastle Line|Sydney-Newcastle railway]] in 1889 with the opening of the first Hawkesbury River railway bridge. Between 1925 and 1930 the New South Wales Public Works Department, and subsequently the Main Roads Board, undertook construction of the road between Hornsby and Gosford, in order to provide a direct road route between Sydney and Newcastle. Upon completion of the roadworks in 1930 Peats Ferry was reinstated between Kangaroo Point and Mooney Mooney Point, pending construction of the bridge.\n\nConstruction of the bridge commenced in 1938 but it was not completed until May 1945.<ref name=rmsheritage>{{Cite NSW HD|4309666|Peats Ferry Road Bridge over Hawkesbury River|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite NSW HD|1780040|Peats Ferry Road Bridge |access-date=}}</ref> Prior to construction of the Hornsby-Gosford road via Peats ferry the most direct road route between Sydney and Newcastle was via the Old Northern Road via Wisemans Ferry and Cessnock, built in the 1820s.\n\nThe Sydney-Hornsby-Gosford-Newcastle route was named as part of the Great Northern Highway in 1928, and renamed as part of the Pacific Highway in 1931.\n\n==Description==\nThe two main bridge spans are K-trusses of welded steel construction. Each truss span measures {{convert|130|m|ft}} long and these were the longest welded truss spans in the world when built. The deck of the truss spans in concrete, cast [[in situ]] around the truss members. The truss spans were fabricated off site and floated into position on barges, requiring a high degree of accuracy and coordination in fabrication and bridge pier setting out. To the north of the truss spans, the bridge has eight long and eight short steel girder spans. The bridge deck to these spans is also cast in situ concrete but is believed not to act compositely with steel, as might be used in more modern construction.<ref name=rmsheritage/>\n\nNorth of the bridge itself a causeway some {{convert|220|m|ft|0}} long was built in shallow water to complete the link to the northern bank.\n\nThe Pier supporting the main bridge spans is founded on a concrete caisson. The cutting foot of the caisson was cast on a barge in sheltered water and then floated out and sunk to the river bed within its own cofferdam. Jetting with compressed air and the addition of further sections of caisson then further sank the caisson. At one point the caisson accidentally slid under its own weight to below the water line. To recover this situation a further section had to be added by divers and the caisson pumped out, which took nine months to complete. The final caisson extends {{convert|73.56|m|ft}} below low water level, just {{convert|20|cm|in|}} short of the world record depth for a bridge foundation at that time, held by the [[San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge]].<ref name=rmsheritage/>\n\nThe bridge abutments are cast in situ concrete bearing to rock. Each abutment has concrete walls and parapets (balustrades).<ref name=rmsheritage/>\n\nThe original railings to the east and west sides of the bridge spans were tubular top and bottom rails supported to steel angle standards with crimped wire mesh infill panels. These original rails still exist to the girder spans of the bridge. The rails to the two truss spans of the bridge were modified in 1966 by the removal of the tubular rails and crimped wire mesh and substitution with Armco type barriers bolted to the original steel angle standards. This was done in conjunction with the reconfiguration of the lanes to provide a third lane for tidal flow arrangements.\n\nThe bridge has two plaques at its south abutment commemorating the opening of the bridge in 1945 and the \"energy and skill of its builders\".<ref name=rmsheritage/> A [[toll road|toll]] was levied on crossing the bridge, payable at the Mooney Mooney Point end of the bridge.<ref>{{cite web |format=photo |author= |url=https://hornsbyshire.recollect.net.au/nodes/view/1624 |title=Toll barriers at Mooney Mooney Point, Hawkesbury River Road Bridge |work=Recollects |publisher=[[Hornsby Shire Council]] |date=1949 |access-date=6 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe bridge was superseded as the main crossing of the Hawkesbury River at this point by the opening of the adjacent six-lane [[motorway]] bridge as part of the fourth stage of the Pacific Motorway in 1973.
