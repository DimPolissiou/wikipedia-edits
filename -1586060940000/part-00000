Types of simple channels observed on Venus include ''sinuous rilles'', ''simple channels with flow margins'', and ''canali''. Sinuous rilles are like those seen on the Moon; narrow erosive channels that originate from regions of volcanic collapse, such as coronae. Simple channels with flow margin are located in obvious flow fields, have an undefined source and end, and are believed to feed into large flows from surrounding volcanics. Canali, like the Baltis Vallis, are long flows with constant width and depth that may contain abandoned channels, bends, and levees, indicating they are sourced from large amounts of thick lavas.<ref name=\"Baker etal 1992\" /><ref name=\"Baker etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n*'''Complex channels''' are channels that can be braided, anastomosing, or in distributary patterns. They commonly form on lava flow deposits, but also occur elsewhere. Complex channels without flow margins may form part of a larger flow system, and form as channels of lava flows erode into the crust. Complex channels with flow margins appear as non-erosional, and their individual channels are separated by islands of crust of differing radar qualities.<ref name=\"Baker etal 1992\" /><ref name=\"Baker etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n*'''Compound channels''' show simple and complex channel structures. These channels usually begin as simple channels and bifurcate and meander as flow energy decreases on its distal reaches.<ref name=\"Baker etal 1992\" /><ref name=\"Baker etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n\n==Volcanism==\n\n===Volcanic centers===\n[[File:Maat Mons on Venus.jpg|thumb|[[Maat Mons]] with a vertical exaggeration of 22.5. Maat Mons is the second-highest mountain on Venus, and is a recently active shield volcano.]]\n\nOver 1100 volcanic structures over 20&nbsp;km in diameter have been identified on Venus, and it is assumed that smaller structures probably number many times these. These structures include large volcanic edifices, shield volcano fields, and individual calderas. Each of these structures represents a center of extrusive magma eruption and differences in amount of magma released, depth of the magma chamber, and rate of magma replenishment effect volcano morphology. When compared to Earth, the number of preserved volcanic zones is staggering, and this is based on Venus' strong crust due to a lack of water. Volcanic centers on Venus are not distributed evenly, as over half of the centers are found in and around the Beta-Atla-Themis region, which covers <30% of the planet's surface. These tend to occur in mid to upper altitudes, where rifting and extension are common, and they signal mantle upwellings to the surface.<ref name= \"Stofan and Smrekar 2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Stofan|first1=E.R.|last2=Smrekar|first2=S.E.|title=Large topographic rises, coronae, large flow fields, and large volcanoes on Venus: Evidence for mantle plumes?|journal=Geological Society of America Special Paper|date=2005|volume=388|pages=841\u2013861|doi=10.1130/2005.2388(47)}}</ref> Volcanic centers on Venus are characterized in two main categories based on the ability or inability to create a shallow magma reservoir: Large flows originating from a single edifice or extensive regions with many small eruption sites clustered together.<ref name=\"Crumpler etal 1997 Venus II\">{{cite book|last1=Crumpler|first1=L.S.|last2=Aubele|first2=J.C.|last3=Senske|first3=D.A.|last4=Keddie|first4=S.T.|last5=Magee|first5=K.P.|last6=Head|first6=J.W.|title=Volcanoes and centers of volcanism on Venus (in Venus II, eds.

Volcanoes of this type include ''large volcanoes'' (>100&nbsp;km in diameter, often named ''mons'', examples: [[Theia Mons]] and [[Maat Mons]]), ''intermediate volcanoes'' (20\u2013100&nbsp;km in diameter), and ''calderas''. These single-eruption-center volcanoes are sustained by a shallow magma chamber in the crust. The magma chamber is replenished by magma from mantle upwelling and decompression melting, causing pooling and trapping of a reservoir. The trapping of a magma chamber allows long-term eruption, and results in magma flows that may create large volcanic domes and flow deposits. The extrusion of magma to the surface is often linked to rifting or extensional tectonics in the region, and the shape of the dome or magma flow field is determined by the chemistry and viscosity of the magma. Each of these types of volcanoes can further be described based on the shape of the dome created, number of edifices present, presence of rifting along the dome, radial fracturing, or collapse of the magma chamber. Intermediate volcanoes with domical surface cones are named ''tholus'', and pancake-shaped volcanoes are named ''farrum''.<ref name=\"Tanaka etal, Venus II\" /> Calderas are circular depressions on the surface believed to have formed by deformation above a cooling magma chamber. Calderas on Venus are characterized as simple, single depressions, called ''coronae'', and complex, radially fractured zones, called ''[[Arachnoid (astrogeology)|arachnoids]]''. Some caldera are named ''patera''.<ref name=\"Crumpler etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n*'''Shield field''' are regions 100\u2013200&nbsp;km in diameter that contain many small, mostly [[shield volcano|shield]], volcanoes (<20&nbsp;km). Such fields may have tens to hundreds of shield volcanoes. Rarely, individual shield volcanoes will be named ''colles''.<ref name=\"Tanaka etal, Venus II\" /> These fields form in areas where the magma replenishment rate is too low to produce a magma reservoir in the crust, resulting in several small eruptions on a regional scale. The dominance of shield-type volcanoes in these regions has led to the name shield fields.<ref name=\"Crumpler etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n\n===Coronae===\n{{main|Corona (planetary geology)}}\n[[Corona (planetary geology)|Coronae]] are large, circular structures with concentric fractures around them that result from mantle upwelling followed by extensional collapse. Since many sequences of upwelling and collapse have been observed as structurally different coronae on Venus' surface, all coronae appear to share a sequence of heavy volcanism as a result of upwelling, topographic rise, tectonic deformation, subsidence due to gravitational collapse, and continued volcanism. Coronae on Venus differ in the location of topographic uplift, and have been characterized as such. Topographic uplift may occur in the depression, the rim, the outer rim, or a combination of these locations. A collapsing coronae coupled with extensional stressing may result in rifting, creating a ''chasmata'' region.<ref name=\"Stofan and Smrekar 2005\" /><ref name=\"Stofan etal 1997 Venus II\">{{cite book|last1=Stofan|first1=E.R.|last2=Hamilton|first2=V.E.|last3=Janes|first3=D.M|last4=Smrekar|first4=S.E.|title=Coronae on Venus: Morphology and origin (in Venus II, eds.

These are regions flooded with many low-viscosity volcanic flows from a single source that covers the area in a continuous flow field. Some flows may be radially distributed around a volcano of coronae as an apron, be fan-shaped, or sub-parallel in their orientation. Large flow fields may be sourced from large volcanoes, calderas, rift structures, or shield volcano fields and they are often associated with extensional environments.<ref name=\"Stofan and Smrekar 2005\" /><ref name=\"Crumpler etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n\n===Topographic rises===\nTopographic rises are domal-shaped areas of high topography that result from both volcanic and tectonic processes. These areas range from 1\u20134&nbsp;km above the datum and 1000\u20133000&nbsp;km across.<ref name=\"Stofan and Smrekar 2005\" /><ref name=\"Crumpler etal 1997 Venus II\" /> These rises are associated with high-density anomalies, which indicate a source from mantle plumes beneath the crust that warp and uplift the region. Of the topographic rises on Venus, three types have been identified based on their dominating tectonic or volcanic morphology: volcano dominated, rift dominated, and corona dominated. Volcano-dominated rises, such as the [[Bell Regio]], have volcanoes atop the topographic rise. Rift-dominated rises are uplifted by rifting and thinning of the lithosphere and include the [[Beta Regio]] and the overlying [[Theia Mons]]. In a coronae-dominated rise, uplift is caused by the gravitational collapse and extension of a magma chamber, and include the [[Themis Regio]].<ref name=\"Stofan and Smrekar 2005\" />\n\n==Tesserae==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Leda Planitia.jpeg|thumb|Leda Planitia highland. A tessera feature that shows extreme deformation from several tectonic events.]] -->\n[[Tessera (Venus)|Tesserae]] are a feature unique to Venus and are characterized as continent-sized regions of high topography (1 to >5&nbsp;km above the datum) that are heavily deformed, often with complex patterns of ridges.

Along the equatorial and southern latitudes, tesserae are labeled ''regiones'', while those in northern latitudes are labeled ''tessera''.<ref name=\"Tanaka etal, Venus II\" />\n\n==Impact craters==\n[[File:PIA00103 Venus - 3-D Perspective View of Lavinia Planitia.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Impact crater]]s on the surface of Venus (image reconstructed from radar data)]]\n[[File:Crater breakup.jpeg|thumb|upright|left|Mechanism for meteor breakup. As an object enters the atmosphere, it weakens due to frictional heating and can fracture into smaller pieces, creating linear arrangements of craters.]]\n\n[[Impact craters]] are roughly circular shaped depressions in the surface of a planet due to high velocity impacts with extraterrestrial bodies. The surface of Venus contains almost 1000 impact craters. However, unlike some planets in our system, Venus' thick atmosphere creates a strong shield that decelerates, flattens, and can fracture incoming projectiles. The Venusian surface is devoid of small craters (\u226430\u201350&nbsp;km in size) because of the effect the atmosphere has on small bodies. Depending on the angle of impact, velocity, size, and strength of the approaching body, the atmosphere may tear and crush the projectile, essentially melting it in the air. This is an important observation for studies of the surface of Venus, as crater are used to determine relative ages and to approximate absolute ages of surface features.<ref name=\"McKinnon etal 1997 Venus II\">{{cite book|last1=McKinnon|first1=W.B.|last2=Zahnle|first2=K.J.|last3=Ivanov|first3=B.A.|last4=Melosh|first4=H.J.|title=Cratering on Venus: Models and observations (in Venus II, eds.

Small projectiles burn up in the atmosphere, and those that make it to the surface break into smaller pieces, creating clusters of impact craters similar in appearance to circular lunar craters. As crater size increases, the chance of breakup in the atmosphere decreases and the impact craters become more circular with central peaks from isostatic rebound of the crust. The atmosphere can flatten and slow larger meteoroids to terminal velocity and cause them to explode on impact or near the surface, showering the region in debris. The shockwave from these explosions can flatten the surrounding area for several kilometers. Large impacts create parabolic excavation cones and flows of lava-like debris.<ref name=\"Herrick etal 1997 Venus II\">{{cite book|last1=Herrick|first1=R.R.|last2=Sharpton|first2=V.L.|last3=Malin|first3=M.C.|last4=Lyons|first4=S.N.|last5=Feely|first5=K.|title=Morphology and morphometry of impact craters (in Venus II, eds.

This is also suggested by the evidence of cooled lava flows filling the valles.<ref name=\"Baker etal 1992\">{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=V.R.|last2=Komatsu|first2=G.|last3=Parker|first3=T.J.|last4=Gulick|first4=V.C.|last5=Kargel|first5=J.S.|last6=Lewis|first6=J.S.|title=Channels and Valleys on Venus: Preliminary Analysis of Magellan Data|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=Aug 25, 1992|volume=97|issue=E8|pages=13,421-13,444|doi=10.1029/92JE00927|bibcode=1992JGR....9713421B}}</ref> Channels  likely formed in very short timescales (1\u2013100 years), indicating very fast movement and erosion of lavas.<ref name=\"Basilevsky and Head 1996\" /> Venusian channels are classified by [[Geomorphology|morphology]] and include three types: simple, complex, and compound.<ref name=\"Baker etal 1997 Venus II\">{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=V.R.|last2=Komatsu|first2=G.|last3=Gulick|first3=V.C.|last4=Parker|first4=T.M.|title=Channels and Valleys (in Venus II, eds.

Types of simple channels observed on Venus include ''sinuous rilles'', ''simple channels with flow margins'', and ''canali''. Sinuous rilles are like those seen on the Moon; narrow erosive channels that originate from regions of volcanic collapse, such as coronae. Simple channels with flow margin are located in obvious flow fields, have an undefined source and end, and are believed to feed into large flows from surrounding volcanics. Canali, like the Baltis Vallis, are long flows with constant width and depth that may contain abandoned channels, bends, and levees, indicating they are sourced from large amounts of thick lavas.<ref name=\"Baker etal 1992\" /><ref name=\"Baker etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n*'''Complex channels''' are channels that can be braided, anastomosing, or in distributary patterns. They commonly form on lava flow deposits, but also occur elsewhere. Complex channels without flow margins may form part of a larger flow system, and form as channels of lava flows erode into the crust. Complex channels with flow margins appear as non-erosional, and their individual channels are separated by islands of crust of differing radar qualities.<ref name=\"Baker etal 1992\" /><ref name=\"Baker etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n*'''Compound channels''' show simple and complex channel structures. These channels usually begin as simple channels and bifurcate and meander as flow energy decreases on its distal reaches.<ref name=\"Baker etal 1992\" /><ref name=\"Baker etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n\n==Volcanism==\n\n===Volcanic centers===\n[[File:Maat Mons on Venus.jpg|thumb|[[Maat Mons]] with a vertical exaggeration of 22.5. Maat Mons is the second-highest mountain on Venus, and is a recently active shield volcano.]]\n\nOver 1100 volcanic structures over 20&nbsp;km in diameter have been identified on Venus, and it is assumed that smaller structures probably number many times these. These structures include large volcanic edifices, shield volcano fields, and individual calderas. Each of these structures represents a center of extrusive magma eruption and differences in amount of magma released, depth of the magma chamber, and rate of magma replenishment effect volcano morphology. When compared to Earth, the number of preserved volcanic zones is staggering, and this is based on Venus' strong crust due to a lack of water. Volcanic centers on Venus are not distributed evenly, as over half of the centers are found in and around the Beta-Atla-Themis region, which covers <30% of the planet's surface. These tend to occur in mid to upper altitudes, where rifting and extension are common, and they signal mantle upwellings to the surface.<ref name= \"Stofan and Smrekar 2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Stofan|first1=E.R.|last2=Smrekar|first2=S.E.|title=Large topographic rises, coronae, large flow fields, and large volcanoes on Venus: Evidence for mantle plumes?|journal=Geological Society of America Special Paper|date=2005|volume=388|pages=841\u2013861|doi=10.1130/2005.2388(47)}}</ref> Volcanic centers on Venus are characterized in two main categories based on the ability or inability to create a shallow magma reservoir: Large flows originating from a single edifice or extensive regions with many small eruption sites clustered together.<ref name=\"Crumpler etal 1997 Venus II\">{{cite book|last1=Crumpler|first1=L.S.|last2=Aubele|first2=J.C.|last3=Senske|first3=D.A.|last4=Keddie|first4=S.T.|last5=Magee|first5=K.P.|last6=Head|first6=J.W.|title=Volcanoes and centers of volcanism on Venus (in Venus II, eds.

Volcanoes of this type include ''large volcanoes'' (>100&nbsp;km in diameter, often named ''mons'', examples: [[Theia Mons]] and [[Maat Mons]]), ''intermediate volcanoes'' (20\u2013100&nbsp;km in diameter), and ''calderas''. These single-eruption-center volcanoes are sustained by a shallow magma chamber in the crust. The magma chamber is replenished by magma from mantle upwelling and decompression melting, causing pooling and trapping of a reservoir. The trapping of a magma chamber allows long-term eruption, and results in magma flows that may create large volcanic domes and flow deposits. The extrusion of magma to the surface is often linked to rifting or extensional tectonics in the region, and the shape of the dome or magma flow field is determined by the chemistry and viscosity of the magma. Each of these types of volcanoes can further be described based on the shape of the dome created, number of edifices present, presence of rifting along the dome, radial fracturing, or collapse of the magma chamber. Intermediate volcanoes with domical surface cones are named ''tholus'', and pancake-shaped volcanoes are named ''farrum''.<ref name=\"Tanaka etal, Venus II\" /> Calderas are circular depressions on the surface believed to have formed by deformation above a cooling magma chamber. Calderas on Venus are characterized as simple, single depressions, called ''coronae'', and complex, radially fractured zones, called ''[[Arachnoid (astrogeology)|arachnoids]]''. Some caldera are named ''patera''.<ref name=\"Crumpler etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n*'''Shield field''' are regions 100\u2013200&nbsp;km in diameter that contain many small, mostly [[shield volcano|shield]], volcanoes (<20&nbsp;km). Such fields may have tens to hundreds of shield volcanoes. Rarely, individual shield volcanoes will be named ''colles''.<ref name=\"Tanaka etal, Venus II\" /> These fields form in areas where the magma replenishment rate is too low to produce a magma reservoir in the crust, resulting in several small eruptions on a regional scale. The dominance of shield-type volcanoes in these regions has led to the name shield fields.<ref name=\"Crumpler etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n\n===Coronae===\n{{main|Corona (planetary geology)}}\n[[Corona (planetary geology)|Corona]] are large, circular structures with concentric fractures around them that result from mantle upwelling followed by extensional collapse. Since many sequences of upwelling and collapse have been observed as structurally different coronae on Venus' surface, all coronae appear to share a sequence of heavy volcanism as a result of upwelling, topographic rise, tectonic deformation, subsidence due to gravitational collapse, and continued volcanism. Coronae on Venus differ in the location of topographic uplift, and have been characterized as such. Topographic uplift may occur in the depression, the rim, the outer rim, or a combination of these locations. A collapsing coronae coupled with extensional stressing may result in rifting, creating a ''chasmata'' region.<ref name=\"Stofan and Smrekar 2005\" /><ref name=\"Stofan etal 1997 Venus II\">{{cite book|last1=Stofan|first1=E.R.|last2=Hamilton|first2=V.E.|last3=Janes|first3=D.M|last4=Smrekar|first4=S.E.|title=Coronae on Venus: Morphology and origin (in Venus II, eds.

These are regions flooded with many low-viscosity volcanic flows from a single source that covers the area in a continuous flow field. Some flows may be radially distributed around a volcano of coronae as an apron, be fan-shaped, or sub-parallel in their orientation. Large flow fields may be sourced from large volcanoes, calderas, rift structures, or shield volcano fields and they are often associated with extensional environments.<ref name=\"Stofan and Smrekar 2005\" /><ref name=\"Crumpler etal 1997 Venus II\" />\n\n===Topographic rises===\nTopographic rises are domal-shaped areas of high topography that result from both volcanic and tectonic processes. These areas range from 1\u20134&nbsp;km above the datum and 1000\u20133000&nbsp;km across.<ref name=\"Stofan and Smrekar 2005\" /><ref name=\"Crumpler etal 1997 Venus II\" /> These rises are associated with high-density anomalies, which indicate a source from mantle plumes beneath the crust that warp and uplift the region. Of the topographic rises on Venus, three types have been identified based on their dominating tectonic or volcanic morphology: volcano dominated, rift dominated, and corona dominated. Volcano-dominated rises, such as the [[Bell Regio]], have volcanoes atop the topographic rise. Rift-dominated rises are uplifted by rifting and thinning of the lithosphere and include the [[Beta Regio]] and the overlying [[Theia Mons]]. In a coronae-dominated rise, uplift is caused by the gravitational collapse and extension of a magma chamber, and include the [[Themis Regio]].<ref name=\"Stofan and Smrekar 2005\" />\n\n==Tesserae==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Leda Planitia.jpeg|thumb|Leda Planitia highland.

As an object enters the atmosphere, it weakens due to frictional heating and can fracture into smaller pieces, creating linear arrangements of craters.]]\n\n[[Impact craters]] are roughly circular shaped depressions in the surface of a planet due to high velocity impacts with extraterrestrial bodies. The surface of Venus contains almost 1000 impact craters. However, unlike some planets in our system, Venus' thick atmosphere creates a strong shield that decelerates, flattens, and can fracture incoming projectiles. The Venusian surface is devoid of small craters (\u226430\u201350&nbsp;km in size) because of the effect the atmosphere has on small bodies. Depending on the angle of impact, velocity, size, and strength of the approaching body, the atmosphere may tear and crush the projectile, essentially melting it in the air. This is an important observation for studies of the surface of Venus, as crater are used to determine relative ages and to approximate absolute ages of surface features.<ref name=\"McKinnon etal 1997 Venus II\">{{cite book|last1=McKinnon|first1=W.B.|last2=Zahnle|first2=K.J.|last3=Ivanov|first3=B.A.|last4=Melosh|first4=H.J.|title=Cratering on Venus: Models and observations (in Venus II, eds.

Small projectiles burn up in the atmosphere, and those that make it to the surface break into smaller pieces, creating clusters of impact craters similar in appearance to circular lunar craters. As crater size increases, the chance of breakup in the atmosphere decreases and the impact craters become more circular with central peaks from isostatic rebound of the crust. The atmosphere can flatten and slow larger meteoroids to terminal velocity and cause them to explode on impact or near the surface, showering the region in debris. The shockwave from these explosions can flatten the surrounding area for several kilometers. Large impacts create parabolic excavation cones and flows of lava-like debris.<ref name=\"Herrick etal 1997 Venus II\">{{cite book|last1=Herrick|first1=R.R.|last2=Sharpton|first2=V.L.|last3=Malin|first3=M.C.|last4=Lyons|first4=S.N.|last5=Feely|first5=K.|title=Morphology and morphometry of impact craters (in Venus II, eds.

{"title_page": "Disposal of human corpses", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2019}}\n'''Disposal of human corpses''', also called '''final disposition''', is the practice and process of dealing with the remains of a [[death|deceased]] [[human being]]. Disposal methods may need to account for the fact that [[soft tissue]] will decompose relatively rapidly, while the [[skeleton]] will remain intact for thousands of years under certain conditions.\n\nSeveral methods for disposal are practiced. A [[funeral]] is a ceremony that may accompany the final disposition. Regardless, the manner of disposal is often dominated by spirituality with a desire to hold vigil for the dead and may be highly ritualized. In cases of mass death, such as war and natural disaster, or in which the means of disposal are limited, practical concerns may be of greater priority. Ancient methods of disposing of dead bodies include [[cremation]] practised by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greeks]], and [[Hindus]]; [[burial]] practised by the [[Jews]], [[Christians]], and [[Muslims]]; [[mummification]] practised by the [[Ancient Egyptians]]; and the [[sky burial]] and a similar method of disposal called [[Towers of Silence]] practiced by [[Tibetan Buddhists]] and [[Zoroastrians]].\n\n== Commonly practiced legal methods ==\n\nSome cultures place the dead in tombs of various sorts, either individually, or in specially designated tracts of land that house tombs. Burial in a [[graveyard]] is one common form of tomb. In some places, burials are impractical because the [[groundwater]] is too high; therefore tombs are placed above ground, as is the case in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], US. Elsewhere, a separate building for a tomb is usually reserved for the socially prominent and wealthy; grand, above-ground tombs are called [[mausoleum]]s. The socially prominent sometimes had the privilege of having their corpses stored in church crypts. In more recent times, however, this has often been forbidden by hygiene laws.\nBurial was not always permanent. In some areas, burial grounds needed to be reused due to limited space. In these areas, once the dead have decomposed to skeletons, the bones are removed; after their removal they can be placed in an [[ossuary]].\n\n===Ground burial===\n{{Main|Burial}}\nA [[burial]] is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. Humans have been burying their dead since shortly after the origin of the species.  Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead.  It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones.\n\n===Cremation===\n{{main article|Cremation}}\nCremation is also an old custom; it was the usual mode of disposing of a corpse in [[ancient Rome]] (along with graves covered with heaped mounds, also found in Greece, particularly at the Karameikos graveyard in [[Monastiraki]]). [[Vikings]] were occasionally cremated in their [[longship]]s, and afterwards the location of the site was marked with [[standing stones]].\n\nSince the latter part of the twentieth century, despite the objections of some religious groups, cremation has become increasingly popular. Jewish law (''[[Halakha]]'') forbids cremation, believing that the soul of a cremated person will be unable to find its final repose. The Roman Catholic Church forbade it for many years, but since 1963 the church has allowed it, as long as it is not done to express disbelief in bodily [[resurrection]]. The church specifies that cremated remains are either buried or entombed; they do not allow cremated remains to be scattered or kept at home. Many Catholic cemeteries now have columbarium niches for cremated remains, or specific sections for those remains. Some denominations of [[Protestantism]] allow cremation; the more conservative denominations generally do not. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and Islam also forbid cremation.<ref>[http://www.cremationassociation.org/?page=WhatIsCremation What is Cremation, ''Cremation Association of North America.'']</ref>\n\nAmong Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some sects of Buddhists such as those found in Japan, cremation is common.\n\n===Immurement===\n{{See|Tomb|Mausoleum}}\nImmurement of corpses is the permanent storage in an above-ground [[tomb]] or [[mausoleum]]. A tomb is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes. A mausoleum may be considered a type of [[tomb]], or the tomb may be considered to be within the mausoleum.\n\n==Less common legal methods==\n\n===Burial at sea===\n\"[[Burial at sea]]\" in past generations has meant the deliberate disposal of a corpse into the ocean, wrapped and tied with weights to make sure it sinks. It has been a common practice in navies and seafaring nations; in the [[Church of England]], special forms of funeral service were added to the [[Book of Common Prayer]] to cover it. In today's generation, \"burial at sea\" may also refer to the scattering of ashes in the ocean, while \"whole body burial at sea\" refers to the entire uncremated body being placed in the ocean at great depths.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Laws vary by jurisdictions.\n\nThe concept may also include [[ship burial]], a form of burial at sea in which the corpse is set adrift on a boat.  \n\n===Exposure===\n{{see also|Sky burial}}\nRarer forms of disposal of the dead include exposure to the elements and to scavenger animals. This includes various forms of excarnation, where the corpse is stripped of the flesh, leaving only the bones, which are then either buried or stored elsewhere, in ossuaries or tombs for example. This was done by some groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in protohistoric times.

This practice is controversial (See [[NAGPRA]]).  In the cases of [[Native Americans in the United States]], possession of remains and related objects is regulated by the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|NAGPRA Act of 1990]].\n\n==Preparation for disposal==\n\nDifferent [[religion]]s and [[culture]]s have various [[funeral|funeral rites]] that accompany the disposal of a body. Some require that all parts of the body are buried together. If an [[autopsy]] has occurred, removed parts of the body are sewn back into the body so that they may be buried with the rest of the corpse.\n\nWhen it is not possible for a body to be disposed of promptly, it is generally stored at a [[morgue]].

This is intended to temporarily preserve the corpse throughout the [[funeral]] process.\n\n==Legal regulation==\n\nMany [[jurisdiction]]s have enacted [[regulation]]s relating to the disposal of human bodies. Although it may be entirely legal to bury a deceased family member, the law may restrict the locations in which this activity is allowed, in some cases expressly limiting burials to property controlled by specific, licensed institutions. Furthermore, in many places, failure to properly dispose of a body is a crime. In some places, it is also a crime to fail to report a death, and to fail to report the disposal of the body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stimmel-law.com/en/articles/rights-and-obligations-human-remains-and-burial|title=Rights and Obligations As To Human Remains and Burial {{!}} Stimmel Law|website=www.stimmel-law.com|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==Body parts==\n\nCertain conditions such as [[necrosis]] can cause parts of the body such as limbs or internal organs to die without causing the death of the individual.  In such cases the body parts are usually not given a funeral.  Surgical removal of dead tissue is usually necessary to prevent [[gangrene|gangrenous]] [[infection]]. Surgically removed body parts are typically disposed of as [[medical waste]], unless they need to be preserved for cultural reasons, as described above.\n\nConversely, [[organ donation|donated organs]] or tissue may live on long after the death of an individual.\n\n==Criminal disposal==\n\nIn some cases, a body is disposed of in such a way as to prevent, hinder, or delay discovery of the body, to prevent [[Body identification|identification]] of the body, or to prevent [[autopsy]].  In such cases, the deceased is considered a [[missing person]] as long as a body is not identified, unless death is so likely that the person is declared [[legal death|legally dead]].\n\t \nThis often occurs as part of a [[murder]] or [[voluntary manslaughter]].  In other cases, an individual who did not intend to cause death may still feel [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] about a death (e.g. by [[involuntary manslaughter]] or an [[accident]]) and may attempt to prevent discovery of the body.  This can exacerbate any legal consequences associated with the death.\n\t \nOther [[Base motive|motives]] for concealing death or the cause of death include [[insurance fraud]] or the desire to collect the [[pension]] of the deceased.  An individual may commit [[suicide]] in such a way as to obscure the cause of death, allowing beneficiaries of a [[life insurance]] policy to collect on the policy.\n\nCriminal methods encountered in fiction and actual cases include:\n* Illegal use of conventional methods, commonly burial in a place unlikely to draw attention, or water disposal (e.g. [[Cleveland Torso Murderer]])\n* Dissolution was used by [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], smashing or dissolving the skeleton\n* Cannibalism (e.g. Jeffrey Dahmer)\n* Grinding into small pieces for disposal in nature, disposal via a sewer system, or use as fertilizer\n* Boiling (used by [[Futoshi Matsunaga]] and [[Dennis Nilsen]])\n* Encasing in [[concrete]] (e.g. [[murder of Junko Furuta]])\n* Hiding in trash or landfill (e.g. [[murder of David Stack]], [[disappearance of Natalee Holloway]])\n* Feeding to animals (e.g. pigs or flesh-eating insects; used by [[Ted Bundy]] and [[Robert Pickton]])\n* Abandonment in an area where the body can degrade significantly before being discovered, if ever, such as a remote area (e.g. [[West Mesa murders]]), cave, abandoned well, abandoned mine, or a neglected or hazardous third-party property (known as a dump job); sometimes dropped in an easily discovered but out-of-the-way location to obscure the identity of the murderer (e.g. [[Fountain Avenue]], Brooklyn)\n* Dropping into a destructive or impassible natural hazard, such as a volcano, quicksand, or crevasse\n* Destruction by industrial process, such as machinery, chemical bath, molten metal, or a [[wrecking yard|junked]] [[automobile|car]]\n* Injection into the legitimate body disposal system (e.g. morgue, funeral home, cemetery, crematorium, funeral pyre, cadaver donation) or killings at a health care facility (e.g. [[Ann Arbor Hospital Murders]] and [[Dr. X killings]])\n* Burning, often in a building (e.g. possibly the [[Clinton Avenue Five]])\n* Disguising as animal flesh (e.g. abattoir, food waste, food; as [[Katherine Knight]] did)\n* Attachment to a vehicle travelling to a distant place\n* Creating false evidence of the circumstances of death and letting investigators dispose of the body, possibly obscuring identity\n* Indefinite storage (e.g. in a freezer or refrigerator, as in the murder of [[Paul Marshall Johnson, Jr.]])\n\n===Illegal disposal of bodies in water===\n\nDisposal of this type happens for various reasons, including the main difference between a [[burial at sea]] and a [[burial]] on land: the difficulty in recovering the body. Sometimes this difference is desired to dispose of bodies outside of the law.\n\n====Disposal of evidence====\nThere may be a number of reasons for this kind of crime. One common reason for this behavior is to dispose of the evidence. The body may be the victim of a homicide, as for example murder or manslaughter. In some cases, the victim may even be still alive and drowning during the process. A live victim is usually restrained to reduce the likelihood of the victim freeing themselves or fighting back, and the body is often weighted to ensure the sinking of the body. The [[American Mafia|Mafia]] is infamous for disposing of victims in oceans or lakes with their feet cast in a concrete block. Other variants tie concrete blocks or other heavy objects to the victim. The ''Chicago-style'' method involves wrapping heavy chains around the victim. In [[Venice]], barrels filled with a human body and concrete are occasionally found in the canals. It is difficult to determine if murder victims buried in a swamp are buried in water or in earth. Often, the body is also cut up to reduce the likelihood of reappearing.\n\nIn other cases, the victim may have died from an accident, and another involved party tries to destroy evidence of the accident. There are also cases where a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] infant is buried to dispose of evidence of infidelity, or problems with fertility, or the shame associated with unwed parenthood in many cultures.\n\n====Problems====\nWhile a corpse properly buried at sea is unlikely to reappear, many criminals are unable to ensure the permanent disposals of a body, and evidence of the body may reappear. This is rarely as spectacular as the freshly caught shark in the Sydney [[Coogee, New South Wales#Coogee Palace Aquarium .281887-1986.29|Coogee Aquarium]] that vomited up a surgically separated human arm, leading to a [[The Shark Arm Case|murder investigation]]. That victim was determined to be James Smith, but the three murder suspects were acquitted.\n\nMany criminals dispose of bodies in a river, hoping that the body is carried away. However, this method will most likely lead to a quick detection of the body, because the body gets entangled at the side of the river, or stopped at a dam, or is simply seen floating by others. A disposal in large lakes or oceans is more likely to hide the body, but a decomposing body can develop a strong positive buoyancy due to the decomposing gases being trapped underneath the skin. This may bring the body up to the surface, or at least increase the movement across the ocean floor due to wave actions. Many bodies have washed up at the shore. Bodies have also been discovered in the nets or lines of fishermen, and occasionally, bodies are also discovered by divers.\n\nVery cold water with little oxygen may even preserve bodies, allowing for an easier identification, as for example [[Margaret Hogg]], the ''Wasdale Lady in the Lake'' in [[Wast Water]] lake in the [[Wasdale]] area (see [[National Trust Properties in England]]). She was found after 8 years, with her body preserved like wax.\n\n====Cases====\n* [[Gary Ridgway]] (born 1949), the Green River Killer, disposed most of his bodies in or near the [[Green River (Duwamish River)|Green River]].\n* In [[the Shark Arm Case]], James Smith's murder was discovered when a shark in the [[Sydney]] Coogee Aquarium vomited up his severed arm in 1935.\n* [[Thomas Capano|Anne Marie Fahey]], scheduling secretary for then [[Governor of Delaware|Delaware Governor]] [[Thomas Carper]], was killed by prominent Delaware attorney Thomas Capano, and her body was dumped inside of a large \"Igloo\" cooler into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the [[New Jersey]] coast with the help of his brother, Jerry. However, because the cooler would not sink, despite Capano repeatedly shooting holes into it with a shotgun, the body was removed and weighted down with an anchor to make it sink into deeper water. The body was never recovered, but the cooler was later found washed up onshore by fishermen, and remains today in the evidence locker of the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, DE.\n* [[Emmett Till]]'s body was dumped in the [[Tallahatchie River]] in [[Mississippi]] in 1955.\n* [[Margaret Hogg]], the ''Wasdale Lady in the Lake'', was murdered 1976, and found 1984.\n* [[Laci Peterson]], the wife of [[Scott Peterson]], murdered 2002 and found on the shore of the [[San Francisco Bay]].\n* Quang Lu, a [[Thornhill, Ontario]] [[loan shark]] was found entombed in a rusty steel barrel full of concrete in [[Lake Ontario]] after police received an anonymous tip.<ref>{{cite news |title=Murdered Asian loan shark in barrel |author=Rob Lamberti |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2010/05/25/14086526.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529024524/http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2010/05/25/14086526.html |archive-date=May 29, 2010 |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n* Serial killers [[John  Wayne Gacy]] and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] disposed their victims' bodies in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n* The 1990s film ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', depicts a group of slaves being chained and then thrown alive into the sea to die by drowning.

Disposal methods may need to account for the fact that [[soft tissue]] will decompose relatively rapidly, while the [[skeleton]] will remain intact for thousands of years under certain conditions.\n\nSeveral methods for disposal are practiced. A [[funeral]] is a ceremony that may accompany the final disposition. Regardless, the manner of disposal is often dominated by spirituality with a desire to hold vigil for the dead and may be highly ritualized. In cases of mass death, such as war and natural disaster, or in which the means of disposal are limited, practical concerns may be of greater priority. Ancient methods of disposing of dead bodies include [[cremation]] practised by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greeks]], and [[Hindus]]; [[burial]] practised by the [[Jews]], [[Christians]], and [[Muslims]]; [[mummification]] practised by the [[Ancient Egyptians]]; and the [[sky burial]] and a similar method of disposal called [[Towers of Silence]] practiced by [[Tibetan Buddhists]] and [[Zoroastrians]].\n\n== Commonly practiced legal methods ==\n\nSome cultures place the dead in tombs of various sorts, either individually, or in specially designated tracts of land that house tombs. Burial in a [[graveyard]] is one common form of tomb. In some places, burials are impractical because the [[groundwater]] is too high; therefore tombs are placed above ground, as is the case in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], US. Elsewhere, a separate building for a tomb is usually reserved for the socially prominent and wealthy; grand, above-ground tombs are called [[mausoleum]]s. The socially prominent sometimes had the privilege of having their corpses stored in church crypts. In more recent times, however, this has often been forbidden by hygiene laws.\nBurial was not always permanent. In some areas, burial grounds needed to be reused due to limited space. In these areas, once the dead have decomposed to skeletons, the bones are removed; after their removal they can be placed in an [[ossuary]].\n\n===Ground burial===\n{{Main|Burial}}\nA [[burial]] is usually accomplished by excavating a pit or trench, placing the deceased and objects in it, and covering it over. Humans have been burying their dead since shortly after the origin of the species.  Burial is often seen as indicating respect for the dead.  It has been used to prevent the odor of decay, to give family members closure and prevent them from witnessing the decomposition of their loved ones.\n\n===Cremation===\n{{main article|Cremation}}\nCremation is also an old custom; it was the usual mode of disposing of a corpse in [[ancient Rome]] (along with graves covered with heaped mounds, also found in Greece, particularly at the Karameikos graveyard in [[Monastiraki]]). [[Vikings]] were occasionally cremated in their [[longship]]s, and afterwards the location of the site was marked with [[standing stones]].\n\nSince the latter part of the twentieth century, despite the objections of some religious groups, cremation has become increasingly popular. Jewish law (''[[Halakha]]'') forbids cremation, believing that the soul of a cremated person will be unable to find its final repose. The Roman Catholic Church forbade it for many years, but since 1963 the church has allowed it, as long as it is not done to express disbelief in bodily [[resurrection]]. The church specifies that cremated remains are either buried or entombed; they do not allow cremated remains to be scattered or kept at home. Many Catholic cemeteries now have columbarium niches for cremated remains, or specific sections for those remains. Some denominations of [[Protestantism]] allow cremation; the more conservative denominations generally do not. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and Islam also forbid cremation.<ref>[http://www.cremationassociation.org/?page=WhatIsCremation What is Cremation, ''Cremation Association of North America.'']</ref>\n\nAmong Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and some sects of Buddhists such as those found in Japan, cremation is common.\n\n===Immurement===\n{{See|Tomb|Mausoleum}}\nImmurement of corpses is the permanent storage in an above-ground [[tomb]] or [[mausoleum]]. A tomb is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes. A mausoleum may be considered a type of [[tomb]], or the tomb may be considered to be within the mausoleum.\n\n==Less common legal methods==\n\n===Burial at sea===\n\"[[Burial at sea]]\" in past generations has meant the deliberate disposal of a corpse into the ocean, wrapped and tied with weights to make sure it sinks. It has been a common practice in navies and seafaring nations; in the [[Church of England]], special forms of funeral service were added to the [[Book of Common Prayer]] to cover it. In today's generation, \"burial at sea\" may also refer to the scattering of ashes in the ocean, while \"whole body burial at sea\" refers to the entire uncremated body being placed in the ocean at great depths.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Laws vary by jurisdictions.\n\nThe concept may also include [[ship burial]], a form of burial at sea in which the corpse is set adrift on a boat.  \n\n===Exposure===\n{{see also|Sky burial}}\nRarer forms of disposal of the dead include exposure to the elements and to scavenger animals. This includes various forms of excarnation, where the corpse is stripped of the flesh, leaving only the bones, which are then either buried or stored elsewhere, in ossuaries or tombs for example. This was done by some groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in protohistoric times. Ritual exposure of the dead (without preservation of the bones) is practiced by [[Zoroastrian]]s in [[Mumbai]] and [[Karachi]], where bodies are placed in \"[[Towers of Silence]]\", where [[vulture]]s and other carrion-eating birds dispose of the corpses. In the present-day structures, the bones are collected in a central pit where, assisted by lime, they, too, eventually decompose. Exposure to scavenger birds (with preservation of some, but not all bones) is also practiced by some [[Effects of high altitude on humans|high-altitude]] [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]], where practical considerations such as the lack of firewood and a shallow active layer seem to have led to the practice known as ''jhator'' or \"giving alms to the birds\".\n\nA [[body farm]] involves a similar method of disposal as an object of scientific study.\n\nIn some traditions, for example that practiced by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish royal family]], the soft tissues are permitted to rot over a period of decades, after which the bones are entombed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Mummification===\n[[File:Takabuti.JPG|thumb|[[Takabuti]], an Egyptian mummy from the 7th century BC]]\nMummification is the drying of bodies to preserve them.

An individual may commit [[suicide]] in such a way as to obscure the cause of death, allowing beneficiaries of a [[life insurance]] policy to collect on the policy.\n\nCriminal methods encountered in fiction and actual cases include:\n* Illegal use of conventional methods, commonly burial in a place unlikely to draw attention, or water disposal (e.g. [[Cleveland Torso Murderer]])\n* Dissolution was used by [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], smashing or dissolving the skeleton\n* Cannibalism (e.g. Jeffrey Dahmer)\n* Grinding into small pieces for disposal in nature, disposal via a sewer system, or use as fertilizer\n* Boiling (used by [[Futoshi Matsunaga]] and [[Dennis Nilsen]])\n* Encasing in [[concrete]] (e.g. [[murder of Junko Furuta]])\n* Hiding in trash or landfill (e.g. [[murder of David Stack]], [[disappearance of Natalee Holloway]])\n* Feeding to animals (e.g. pigs or flesh-eating insects; used by [[Ted Bundy]] and [[Robert Pickton]])\n* Abandonment in an area where the body can degrade significantly before being discovered, if ever, such as a remote area (e.g. [[West Mesa murders]]), cave, abandoned well, abandoned mine, or a neglected or hazardous third-party property (known as a dump job); sometimes dropped in an easily discovered but out-of-the-way location to obscure the identity of the murderer (e.g. [[Fountain Avenue]], Brooklyn)\n* Dropping into a destructive or impassible natural hazard, such as a volcano, quicksand, or crevasse\n* Destruction by industrial process, such as machinery, chemical bath, molten metal, or a [[wrecking yard|junked]] [[automobile|car]]\n* Injection into the legitimate body disposal system (e.g. morgue, funeral home, cemetery, crematorium, funeral pyre, cadaver donation) or killings at a health care facility (e.g. [[Ann Arbor Hospital Murders]] and [[Dr. X killings]])\n* Burning, often in a building (e.g. possibly the [[Clinton Avenue Five]])\n* Disguising as animal flesh (e.g. abattoir, food waste, food; as [[Katherine Knight]] did)\n* Attachment to a vehicle travelling to a distant place\n* Creating false evidence of the circumstances of death and letting investigators dispose of the body, possibly obscuring identity\n* Indefinite storage (e.g. in a freezer or refrigerator, as in the murder of [[Paul Marshall Johnson, Jr.]])\n\n===Illegal disposal of bodies in water===\n\nDisposal of this type happens for various reasons, including the main difference between a [[burial at sea]] and a [[burial]] on land: the difficulty in recovering the body. Sometimes this difference is desired to dispose of bodies outside of the law.\n\n====Disposal of evidence====\nThere may be a number of reasons for this kind of crime. One common reason for this behavior is to dispose of the evidence. The body may be the victim of a homicide, as for example murder or manslaughter. In some cases, the victim may even be still alive and drowning during the process. A live victim is usually restrained to reduce the likelihood of the victim freeing themselves or fighting back, and the body is often weighted to ensure the sinking of the body. The [[American Mafia|Mafia]] is infamous for disposing of victims in oceans or lakes with their feet cast in a concrete block. Other variants tie concrete blocks or other heavy objects to the victim. The ''Chicago-style'' method involves wrapping heavy chains around the victim. In [[Venice]], barrels filled with a human body and concrete are occasionally found in the canals. It is difficult to determine if murder victims buried in a swamp are buried in water or in earth. Often, the body is also cut up to reduce the likelihood of reappearing.\n\nIn other cases, the victim may have died from an accident, and another involved party tries to destroy evidence of the accident. There are also cases where a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] infant is buried to dispose of evidence of infidelity, or problems with fertility, or the shame associated with unwed parenthood in many cultures.\n\n====Problems====\nWhile a corpse properly buried at sea is unlikely to reappear, many criminals are unable to ensure the permanent disposals of a body, and evidence of the body may reappear. This is rarely as spectacular as the freshly caught shark in the Sydney [[Coogee, New South Wales#Coogee Palace Aquarium .281887-1986.29|Coogee Aquarium]] that vomited up a surgically separated human arm, leading to a [[The Shark Arm Case|murder investigation]]. That victim was determined to be James Smith, but the three murder suspects were acquitted.\n\nMany criminals dispose of bodies in a river, hoping that the body is carried away. However, this method will most likely lead to a quick detection of the body, because the body gets entangled at the side of the river, or stopped at a dam, or is simply seen floating by others. A disposal in large lakes or oceans is more likely to hide the body, but a decomposing body can develop a strong positive buoyancy due to the decomposing gases being trapped underneath the skin. This may bring the body up to the surface, or at least increase the movement across the ocean floor due to wave actions. Many bodies have washed up at the shore. Bodies have also been discovered in the nets or lines of fishermen, and occasionally, bodies are also discovered by divers.\n\nVery cold water with little oxygen may even preserve bodies, allowing for an easier identification, as for example [[Margaret Hogg]], the ''Wasdale Lady in the Lake'' in [[Wast Water]] lake in the [[Wasdale]] area (see [[National Trust Properties in England]]). She was found after 8 years, with her body preserved like wax.\n\n====Cases====\n* [[Gary Ridgway]] (born 1949), the Green River Killer, disposed most of his bodies in or near the [[Green River (Duwamish River)|Green River]].\n* In [[the Shark Arm Case]], James Smith's murder was discovered when a shark in the [[Sydney]] Coogee Aquarium vomited up his severed arm in 1935.\n* [[Thomas Capano|Anne Marie Fahey]], scheduling secretary for then [[Governor of Delaware|Delaware Governor]] [[Thomas Carper]], was killed by prominent Delaware attorney Thomas Capano, and her body was dumped inside of a large \"Igloo\" cooler into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off the [[New Jersey]] coast with the help of his brother, Jerry. However, because the cooler would not sink, despite Capano repeatedly shooting holes into it with a shotgun, the body was removed and weighted down with an anchor to make it sink into deeper water. The body was never recovered, but the cooler was later found washed up onshore by fishermen, and remains today in the evidence locker of the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington, DE.\n* [[Emmett Till]]'s body was dumped in the [[Tallahatchie River]] in [[Mississippi]] in 1955.\n* [[Margaret Hogg]], the ''Wasdale Lady in the Lake'', was murdered 1976, and found 1984.\n* [[Laci Peterson]], the wife of [[Scott Peterson]], murdered 2002 and found on the shore of the [[San Francisco Bay]].\n* Quang Lu, a [[Thornhill, Ontario]] [[loan shark]] was found entombed in a rusty steel barrel full of concrete in [[Lake Ontario]] after police received an anonymous tip.<ref>{{cite news |title=Murdered Asian loan shark in barrel |author=Rob Lamberti |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2010/05/25/14086526.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529024524/http://www.torontosun.com/news/torontoandgta/2010/05/25/14086526.html |archive-date=May 29, 2010 |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=August 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n* Serial killers [[John  Wayne Gacy]] and [[Jeffrey Dahmer]] disposed their victims' bodies in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n* The 1990s film ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', depicts a group of slaves being chained and then thrown alive into the sea to die by drowning.

The forty-seven minute film centres on the staging of the decommissioned waterworks and laundry facilities of Bohnice, another post-revolutionary institution and the largest psychiatric clinic in the [[Czech Republic]]. It consists of filmic documentation of the Bohnice psychiatric hospital performance as a reenactment of [[Peter Weiss]]\u2019 1963 play ''[[Marat/Sade]]'', as well as documentation of Thauberger's interviews with Bohnice patients and staff. As Thauberger brings various threads together\u2014particularly as she includes hospital staff and residents in the work\u2014she inserts a raw humanism into her deep-time inquiry of mental illness, pointedly linking Marat's revolutionary apprehension to growing contemporary cynicism about institutions. ''Marat Sade Bohnice'' approaches philosophical and art histories, questions art's agency and its role within therapy, as well as troubles the systems of human (un)freedom.<ref name=\":0\"

Hamer's GNM claims to explain every disease and treatment according to those premises, and to thereby obviate traditional medicine. The cure is always the resolving of the conflict.

However, a dearth of studies is not the same thing as evidence which conclusively proves that NAET is either ineffective or dangerous. Organizations that do rigorous clinical trials would have little interest in studying NAET because it is non-drug based. Funding is not usually available for assessing any alternative healing modalities. Defenders of alternative and holistic healing point out that most family doctors treat patients who have a wide range of underlying emotional issues that impair the patient's health. This could happen, for example, through elevated cortisone or adrenaline levels from prolonged stress. NAET testing is carried out through [[applied kinesiology]] while a person is holding small vials that are said to contain the energetic essences of various substances. Once the allergies are identified, treatment is carried out through stimulation of points along the spine. These vials contain substances prepared in a process similar to that of homeopathic preparation.

However, a dearth of studies is not the same thing as evidence which conclusively proves that NAET is either ineffective or dangerous. Organizations that do rigorous clinical trials would have little interest in studying NAET because it is non-drug based. Funding is not usually available for assessing any alternative healing modalities. Defenders of alternative and holistic healing point out that most family doctors treat patients who have a wide range of underlying emotional issues that impair the patient's health. This could happen, for example, through elevated cortisone or adrenaline levels from prolonged stress. NAET testing is carried out through [[applied kinesiology]] while a person is holding small vials that are said to contain the energetic essences of various substances. Once the allergies are identified, treatment is carried out through stimulation of points along the spine. These vials contain substances prepared in a process similar to that of homeopathic preparation.

The term has been applied to any tactic, psychological or otherwise, which can be seen as subverting an individual's sense of control over their own thinking, behavior, emotions or decision making. In 1983, the American Psychological Association (APA) asked [[Margaret Singer]] to chair a taskforce called the [[APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control]] (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or \"coercive persuasion\" did indeed play a role in \"cult\" recruitment.

It also features the promotion's former third brand [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]. It is also the last game to feature ECW in its title. Similar to previous games in the series, ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010'' involves players competing in various [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], either as one of the in-game characters based on WWE's roster or as a character created in the Create-a-Superstar mode. ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010'' adds several new features that primarily enable customization, such as a Story Designer allowing players to create their own playable WWE [[Narrative thread|storylines]], Road to Wrestlemania, an expansion on the Create-a-Finisher mode to include [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial techniques]] and for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, the customization of attire colors in a mode called Superstar Threads, a revamped Create-a-Superstar mode and a Paint Tool for creating logos to use on their created characters.\n\nThis game became the first of the series to be available as an [[iPhone]] App. It was released on December 23, 2009. As of June 2010, the game had since been removed from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Gameplaypawan==\n\n===Create modes===\n[[File:WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 - Design-A-Story mode.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A screenshot of the game's new WWE Story Designer mode, here demonstrating the mode's scenario design function]]\nThe game features revamped create modes, which have received a complete overhaul compared to past years' editions. In addition to the original create-a-superstar and create-an-entrance modes, the game introduces the WWE Story Designer mode, where the player can now design storylines featuring WWE's weekly shows (''Raw'', ''SmackDown'', or ''ECW'') and [[pay-per-view]]s with [[Narrative thread|storylines]], scenarios, and [[Professional wrestling match types|matches]] of their creations using a variety of preset options, with over 100 different animations and 25 different locations to design each scene.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/smackdown-vs-raw-2010-creation-is-king/1100-6233683/ |first=Brian |last=Ekberg |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010: Creation is King |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=August 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"IGN-Story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/12/wwe-svr-2010-story-designer-hands-on |first=Greg |last=Miller |title=WWE SVR 2010: Story Designer Hands-on |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> Subtitles can be written in through a controller or through a USB keyboard.<ref name=\"IGN-Review\">{{cite web |first=Greg |last=Miller |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/15/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-review-2 |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Review |publisher=IGN |date=October 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> Similar to previous editions in the series, the player can create storylines; however, the player can now control how long the storylines goes on, how many superstars or [[WWE Diva|Divas]] are involved, and what takes place in the storylines. The match-making feature allows the player to set a match type, set a stipulation, and set any winning conditions. In addition to using created superstars, the player may also integrate actual WWE superstars and Divas into their created storylines, scenarios, or matches.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\" /> On the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, each storyline can feature up to 500 segments including 450 matches and 50 scenarios, while the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions have a limit of 55 segments.<ref name=\"IGN-Story\" /><ref name=\"WWEUniverse\">{{cite web |url=http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php/option=com_altcaster/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=04f1109172/width=643/height=700/template=wwe |title=SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Live Chat with THQ |publisher=WWE Universe |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> Created wrestlers are limited in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions to ten appearances in the mode.<ref name=\"IGN-Story\" />\n\nThe create-a-superstar feature has also been retooled since ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009'' in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. The game now features three-dimensional apparel, unlike in previous games where it appeared as \"painted on\". The apparel moves realistically; for example, a robe moves with each of the superstar's movements. Another improvement to the create-a-superstar mode is the shortened loading time of the menus in comparison to previous iterations.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/><ref name=\"SvR-Features\">[http://www.smackdownvsraw.com/#/features] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602042138/http://www.smackdownvsraw.com/#/features |date=June 2, 2009 }}</ref> A new point system has been implemented into the create-a-superstar mode where each item is given a point value and the player is able to attach up to 48 points of items.<ref name=\"IGN-First\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/08/23/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-explosion |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Explosion |first=Greg |last=Miller| publisher=IGN |date=August 22, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> For each created wrestler, the player can create up to three alternate attires for them.<ref name=\"IGN-Create\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/09/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-hands-on |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Hands-on |first=Greg |last=Miller |publisher=IGN |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> The mode also features an additional Paint Tool in which players can create their own design that they can use as to use as a logo or a tattoo for their created wrestler.<ref name=\"SvR-Features\" /> In addition to the create-a-superstar mode, the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 versions of ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010'' introduces a new mode called Superstar Threads, in which the player can create three alternate attires for existing wrestlers in the game by customizing the colors of their attire. This mode however is not available for the Wii version of the game.<ref name=\"GamesMaster\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/><ref name=\"SvR-Features\" /> However, the PlayStation 2 version has undergone only a few minor changes from the previous game. A few additional attire items are added, but almost everything else is as it was before.\n\nUnlocking abilities for a created superstar has been made easier, as players no longer have to assign points or take the created superstar into a career mode specifically to improve their attributes. Instead, attributes can be increased in all modes of the game, including regular exhibition matches as well as the create-a-superstar story in the Road to Wrestlemania mode. The maximum threshold is extended by 5 points in one or two categories, depending on how the player performed in the match. And available attribute points are determined by what happens in each match. There are 21 unlockable abilities, which are easier to unlock that in previous years. This time, players are required to build up certain attributes to unlock the option of certain skills. They can be assigned in Create-A-Moveset mode.

If a superstar is set as an enemy, then that enemy may appear during the peak of a match. The enemy has a number of choices including standing by the ring and breaking up pinfalls, using his or her finisher, or coming in with a weapon. Allies work in a similar fashion. The intensity of the rivalry or alliance can be changed by changing the position of where the certain superstars are slotted.<ref name=\"IGN-Rivals\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/30/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-rivals-hands-on |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Rivals Hands-on |first=Greg |last=Miller |publisher=IGN |date=September 30, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Match gameplay===\n''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010'' also features new additions to match gameplay.

Similar to previous games in the series, ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010'' involves players competing in various [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], either as one of the in-game characters based on WWE's roster or as a character created in the Create-a-Superstar mode. ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010'' adds several new features that primarily enable customization, such as a Story Designer allowing players to create their own playable WWE [[Narrative thread|storylines]], Road to Wrestlemania, an expansion on the Create-a-Finisher mode to include [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial techniques]] and for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, the customization of attire colors in a mode called Superstar Threads, a revamped Create-a-Superstar mode and a Paint Tool for creating logos to use on their created characters.\n\nThis game became the first of the series to be available as an [[iPhone]] App. It was released on December 23, 2009. As of June 2010, the game had since been removed from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Create modes===\n[[File:WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 - Design-A-Story mode.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A screenshot of the game's new WWE Story Designer mode, here demonstrating the mode's scenario design function]]\nThe game features revamped create modes, which have received a complete overhaul compared to past years' editions. In addition to the original create-a-superstar and create-an-entrance modes, the game introduces the WWE Story Designer mode, where the player can now design storylines featuring WWE's weekly shows (''Raw'', ''SmackDown'', or ''ECW'') and [[pay-per-view]]s with [[Narrative thread|storylines]], scenarios, and [[Professional wrestling match types|matches]] of their creations using a variety of preset options, with over 100 different animations and 25 different locations to design each scene.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/smackdown-vs-raw-2010-creation-is-king/1100-6233683/ |first=Brian |last=Ekberg |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010: Creation is King |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=August 20, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"IGN-Story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/12/wwe-svr-2010-story-designer-hands-on |first=Greg |last=Miller |title=WWE SVR 2010: Story Designer Hands-on |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> Subtitles can be written in through a controller or through a USB keyboard.<ref name=\"IGN-Review\">{{cite web |first=Greg |last=Miller |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/15/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-review-2 |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Review |publisher=IGN |date=October 15, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> Similar to previous editions in the series, the player can create storylines; however, the player can now control how long the storylines goes on, how many superstars or [[WWE Diva|Divas]] are involved, and what takes place in the storylines. The match-making feature allows the player to set a match type, set a stipulation, and set any winning conditions. In addition to using created superstars, the player may also integrate actual WWE superstars and Divas into their created storylines, scenarios, or matches.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\" /> On the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, each storyline can feature up to 500 segments including 450 matches and 50 scenarios, while the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable versions have a limit of 55 segments.<ref name=\"IGN-Story\" /><ref name=\"WWEUniverse\">{{cite web |url=http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php/option=com_altcaster/task=viewaltcast/altcast_code=04f1109172/width=643/height=700/template=wwe |title=SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Live Chat with THQ |publisher=WWE Universe |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref> Created wrestlers are limited in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions to ten appearances in the mode.<ref name=\"IGN-Story\" />\n\nThe create-a-superstar feature has also been retooled since ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009'' in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions. The game now features three-dimensional apparel, unlike in previous games where it appeared as \"painted on\". The apparel moves realistically; for example, a robe moves with each of the superstar's movements. Another improvement to the create-a-superstar mode is the shortened loading time of the menus in comparison to previous iterations.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/><ref name=\"SvR-Features\">[http://www.smackdownvsraw.com/#/features] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602042138/http://www.smackdownvsraw.com/#/features |date=June 2, 2009 }}</ref> A new point system has been implemented into the create-a-superstar mode where each item is given a point value and the player is able to attach up to 48 points of items.<ref name=\"IGN-First\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/08/23/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-explosion |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Explosion |first=Greg |last=Miller| publisher=IGN |date=August 22, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> For each created wrestler, the player can create up to three alternate attires for them.<ref name=\"IGN-Create\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/09/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-hands-on |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Hands-on |first=Greg |last=Miller |publisher=IGN |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> The mode also features an additional Paint Tool in which players can create their own design that they can use as to use as a logo or a tattoo for their created wrestler.<ref name=\"SvR-Features\" /> In addition to the create-a-superstar mode, the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 versions of ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010'' introduces a new mode called Superstar Threads, in which the player can create three alternate attires for existing wrestlers in the game by customizing the colors of their attire. This mode however is not available for the Wii version of the game.<ref name=\"GamesMaster\" /><ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/><ref name=\"SvR-Features\" /> However, the PlayStation 2 version has undergone only a few minor changes from the previous game. A few additional attire items are added, but almost everything else is as it was before.\n\nUnlocking abilities for a created superstar has been made easier, as players no longer have to assign points or take the created superstar into a career mode specifically to improve their attributes. Instead, attributes can be increased in all modes of the game, including regular exhibition matches as well as the create-a-superstar story in the Road to Wrestlemania mode. The maximum threshold is extended by 5 points in one or two categories, depending on how the player performed in the match. And available attribute points are determined by what happens in each match. There are 21 unlockable abilities, which are easier to unlock that in previous years. This time, players are required to build up certain attributes to unlock the option of certain skills. They can be assigned in Create-A-Moveset mode. They include new ones such as Fired Up, Pull Back Attacks, Exploder Turnbuckle Attack, and others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/09/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-nerd-alert |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Nerd Alert |first=Greg |last=Miller |publisher=IGN |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe create-a-finisher option has also been reworked, with the addition of 30 percent more content. Introduced in the previous game, the player was able to create a finisher in the front grapple position. In ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010'', the mode has been expanded to include [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial techniques]]. The player is also able to adjust the jumping trajectory and speed of the maneuver.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/>\n\nAlong with these new customization features, players for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions are able to share their created wrestlers, moves and shows online with other players. The player can also rate other creations online in terms of quality.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/><ref name=\"SvR-Features\" /> Evolving from the previous year's Highlight Reel mode, a compilation of the match's highlights will be listed after each match. The player can subsequently choose to watch or save any of these highlights.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/> Players are also able to convert their created Highlight Reels into entrance movies for their created wrestlers. Players of the PlayStation 3 version are able to upload their highlight reel videos directly onto [[YouTube]].<ref name=\"IGN-Review\" />\n\nA new addition to the game this year is the WWE Rivals feature. This option allows the player to set superstars' allies and enemies which can be used to their advantage or disadvantage in exhibition matches with the interference option on. If a superstar is set as an enemy, then that enemy may appear during the peak of a match. The enemy has a number of choices including standing by the ring and breaking up pinfalls, using his or her finisher, or coming in with a weapon. Allies work in a similar fashion. The intensity of the rivalry or alliance can be changed by changing the position of where the certain superstars are slotted.<ref name=\"IGN-Rivals\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/09/30/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-rivals-hands-on |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Rivals Hands-on |first=Greg |last=Miller |publisher=IGN |date=September 30, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Match gameplay===\n''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010'' also features new additions to match gameplay. A new feature that has been added is the THQ Training Facility, a tutorial option for players who may be unaware of the gameplay of the series. The player is able to choose a superstar, their [[non-player character]] opponent (or they may choose to play with another player), the match type, and the game or match settings. During the match, various pop-ups will appear with different instructions on how to perform actions, such as the grapples or maneuvers available to be performed. There are over 100 training tips available to the player.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/>\n\nFor the first time since ''[[WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007]]'', the game features four strong grapples, with players now also able to switch between each grapples.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/> Other new move positions include moves involving superstars standing on the ring's apron and a change in ground grapples with side grapple moves and separate moves for opponents depending whether they are on their stomach or back. All diving attacks were reanimated to look more realistic.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/><ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/videogames/news/story?id=4437838 |first=Jon |last=Robinson |title=The Gamer Blog: Tell your own story |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2009-09-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906180247/http://sports.espn.go.com/videogames/news/story?id=4437838 |archivedate=September 6, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe game also features a revamped [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]], cutting down on the on-screen information seen in the previous year. The momentum meter now appears as a small halo underneath each superstar, while HUD icons and information relevant to the match are displayed around the superstar.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/><ref name=\"IGN-First\" /> On-screen body damage meters are now replaced by visual cues from superstars indicating where they are damaged. The game also adopts the \"pinfall kickout mechanism\" used in the THQ video game ''[[WWE Legends of WrestleMania]]'', in which the player can either hold a face button or button mash to fill up a meter for kicking out of a pinfall attempt.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/> A new reversal system replaces the old two-button system from previous games. The new single-button reversal system makes timing a competitive skill, with the player given only one chance to press the reversal key when the icon appears.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/><ref name=\"IGN-First\" />\n\n[[File:WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 - Royal Rumble.jpg|thumb|200px|One of the new minigames in the revamped [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]], featuring [[Randy Orton]] and [[John Cena]]]]\nThis year's game features several new match stipulations.

As well as eliminating opponents off the apron like in the previous games, the player can now eliminate other wrestlers in the match by using the ring ropes and the turnbuckles. Eliminations in the match are done either by mini-games in these areas or by the player using finishing moves to eliminate other wrestlers. Finishing moves can also save wrestlers from elimination.<ref name=\"GameSpot-Matches\"/> On the home consoles version, the number of different backstage areas in the Backstage Brawl match has been increased from two to five areas.<ref name=\"IGN-Review\" /> The match also makes its debut on the DS version, where it has 14 backstage areas instead.<ref name=\"SvR-Features\" /> With the exception of the [[Professional wrestling match types#First Blood match|First Blood match]], the [[Hell in a Cell]] match, the [[Elimination Chamber]] match and the Royal Rumble match, Divas are now able to participate in all of the match types<ref name=\"GameRev\">{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Tan |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010 |title=WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2010 Review |publisher=[[Game Revolution]] |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> However, apart from the mixed tag team match, intergender match-ups are no longer allowed.<ref name=\"IGN-Review\" />\n\nThe Wii version of the game has also been reworked, primarily the motion gameplay and control scheme having been modified similar to that of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. With these improvements, the player now has more control options, including the use of the [[Nintendo GameCube controller|GameCube controller]], [[Wii Remote]], and the [[Classic Controller|Wii Classic Controller]]. The Wii version features many of the features found on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, allowing it to be comparable to the other versions.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/> While the Wii version features the create-a-finisher mode for the first time, it will not feature online support like the previous year's edition.<ref name=\"GamesMaster\" />\n\n[[TOSE]] developed the Nintendo DS version of ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010''.<ref name=\"GamesMaster\" /> The gameplay can now be seen from an elevated camera, in addition, the maneuvers are now also controlled by using the device's buttons instead of touch screen. Unlike past games, the DS version of this game features an increase in speed. A new feature to the DS version is a collectible card system. The player is able to collect cards that feature power-ups that may be activated in the ring such as calling in a wrestler to interfere in the match, or that feature unlockables such as create-a-superstar parts and match types.<ref name=\"GameSpot-First\"/>\n\n===Game modes===\nThe ''Road to WrestleMania'' mode returns from ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009'' with six new stories based on various WWE wrestlers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/community/2010/08/31/for-what-its-worth-smackdown-vs-raw-2010/ |first=Ryan|last=Conway|title=For What it\u2019s Worth: Smackdown vs Raw 2010 |website=[[VentureBeat]]|date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 30, 2019}}</ref> Unlike the previous year, ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010'' features a Diva-based story involving [[Mickie James]] and a story specifically for one of the player's created wrestlers.<ref name=\"RoadToWM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/smackdown-vs-raw-2010-road-to-wrestlemania-mode-spotlight/1100-6233581/ |first=Brian |last=Ekberg |title=SmackDown vs. Raw 2010: Road to WrestleMania Mode Spotlight |website=GameSpot |date=October 7, 2009 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> This year's co-operative storyline, titled \"Brand Warfare\", features [[Triple H]] and [[John Cena]].<ref name=\"RoadToWM\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xboxachievements.com/game/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010/achievements/ |title=WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 Achievements |publisher=Xbox Achievements |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}</ref> The remaining three stories involve [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Shawn Michaels]], and [[Randy Orton]] respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/sns-gamereview-wwe-smackdown-story.html |first=James|last=Fudge|title=Review: ' WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010' - Xbox 360 |website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=December 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2019}}</ref> This year's ''Road to WrestleMania'' mode also includes storylines that branch out through interactive cutscenes before and during [[WrestleMania XXV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-features-customization-1.461112 |first=Curtis|last=Withers|title='WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2010' features customization |website=[[CTV News]]|date=December 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe DS version also features a revamped story mode in which the player will participate in various storylines.
