Eighteen years of war resulted in the nominally joint-rule state of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] (1899-1956), a ''[[de jure]]'' [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] of the [[British Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] in which Britain had ''[[de facto]]'' control over the Sudan. The Sudanese launched several unsuccessful invasions of their neighbours, expanding the scale of the conflict to include not only Britain and Egypt but the [[Italian Empire]], the [[Congo Free State|Belgian Congo]] and the [[Ethiopian Empire]].\n\nThe British participation in the war is called the '''Sudan campaign'''. Other names for this war include the \"'''Mahdist Revolt'''\", the \"'''Anglo\u2013Sudan War'''\" and the \"'''Sudanese Mahdist Revolt'''\".\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the invasion by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in 1819, Sudan was governed by an [[Turkiyah|Egyptian administration]]. Because of the heavy taxes it imposed and because of the bloody start of the Turkish-Egyptian rule in Sudan, this [[colonialism|colonial]] system was resented by the Sudanese people.\n\nThroughout the period of Turco-Egyptian rule, many segments of the Sudanese population suffered extreme hardship because of the system of taxation imposed by the central government. Under this system, a flat tax was imposed on farmers and small traders and collected by government-appointed tax collectors from the [[Sha'iqiyya]] tribe of northern Sudan. In bad years, and especially during times of drought and famine, farmers were unable to pay the high taxes. Fearing the brutal and unjust methods of the Sha'iqiyya, many farmers fled their villages in the fertile [[Nile Valley]] to the remote areas of [[Kordofan]] and [[Darfur]]. These migrants, known as \"jallaba\" after their loose-fitting style of dress, began to function as small traders and middlemen for the foreign trading companies that had established themselves in the cities and towns of central Sudan.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The jallaba were also known to be slave trading tribes.\n\nBy the middle 19th century the Ottoman Imperial subject administration in Egypt was in the hands of [[Khedive Ismail]]. Khedive Ismail's spending had put Egypt into huge debt, and when his financing of the [[Suez Canal]] started to crumble, the United Kingdom stepped in and repaid his loans in return for controlling shares in the canal. As the most direct route to India, the jewel in the British Crown, control over the Suez Canal was of paramount strategic importance, and British commercial and imperial interests dictated the need to seize or otherwise control it. Thus an ever-increasing British role in Egyptian affairs seemed necessary. With Khedive Ismail's spending and corruption causing instability, in 1873 the British government supported a program whereby an Anglo-French debt commission assumed responsibility for managing Egypt's fiscal affairs. This commission eventually forced [[Khedive Ismail]] to abdicate in favor of his son Tawfiq in 1877, leading to a period of political turmoil.\n\nAlso in 1873, Ismail had appointed [[Charles George Gordon|General Charles \"Chinese\" Gordon]] Governor of the Equatorial Provinces of Sudan. For the next three years, General Gordon fought against a native chieftain of [[Darfur]], [[Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur]].\n\nUpon Ismail's abdication in 1877, Gordon found himself with dramatically decreased support. Exhausted by years of work, he resigned his post in 1880 and left early the next year. His policies were soon abandoned by the new governors, but the anger and discontent of the dominant Arab minority was left unaddressed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nAlthough the Egyptians were fearful of the deteriorating conditions, the British refused to get involved, \"Her Majesty\u2019s Government are in no way responsible for operations in the Sudan,\" the Foreign Secretary [[Earl Granville]] noted.\n\n==Conflict==\n===Mahdi uprising===\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad al-Mahdi 1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Muhammad Ahmad, the self-proclaimed Mahdi]]\n[[File:Banner, declaration of faith and allegiance to Allah.

Given by Miss Victoria MacBean, 1929.]]\nAmong the forces historians see as the causes of the uprising are [[ethnic]] Sudanese anger at the foreign Turkish Ottoman rulers, Muslim revivalist anger at the Turks' lax religious standards and willingness to appoint non-Muslims such as the Christian Charles Gordon to high positions, and Sudanese [[Sufi]] resistance to \"dry, scholastic Islam of Egyptian officialdom.\"<ref name=mortimer>Mortimer, Edward, ''Faith and Power'', Vintage, 1982, p. 77.</ref> Another widely reported potential source of frustration was the Turco-Egyptian abolition of the slave trade, one of the main sources of income in Sudan at the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Mahdist State in the Sudan 1881 - 1898: A Study of Its Origin, Development, and Overthrow|last=Holt|first=P.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1958|isbn=|location=Clarendon|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1870s, a Muslim cleric named [[Muhammad Ahmad]] preached renewal of the faith and liberation of the land, and began attracting followers. Soon in open revolt against the Egyptians, Muhammad Ahmad proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]], the promised redeemer of the Islamic world. In August 1881 the then-governor of the Sudan, [[Raouf Pasha]], sent two companies of infantry each with one [[machine gun]] to arrest him. The captains of the two companies were each promised promotion if their soldiers were the ones to return the Mahdi to the governor. Both companies disembarked from the steamer that had brought them up the [[Nile]] to [[Aba Island]] and approached the Mahdi's village from separate directions. Arriving simultaneously, each force began to fire blindly on the other, allowing the Mahdi's scant followers to attack and destroy each force in turn at the [[Battle of Aba]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Winston | last = Churchill | title = The River War | year = 1902 | publisher = Kessinger | page= 28}}</ref>\n\nThe Mahdi then began a strategic retreat to [[Kordofan]], where he was at a distance from the seat of government in [[Khartoum]]. This movement, couched as a triumphal progress, incited many of the Arab tribes to rise in support of the [[Jihad]] the Mahdi had declared against the \"Turkish oppressors.\" Another Egyptian expedition dispatched from [[Fashoda]] was ambushed and slaughtered on the night of 9 December 1881.<ref>Churchill p. 29</ref>\n\nThe Mahdi also legitimized his movement by drawing deliberate parallels to the life of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]]. He called his followers [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]], after the people who greeted the Prophet in [[Medina]], and he called his flight from the British, the [[Hegira|hijrah]], after the Prophet's flight from the [[Quraysh]]. The Mahdi also appointed commanders to represent three of the four [[Rashidun|Righteous Caliphs]];<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fire and Sword in the Sudan; a Personal Narrative of Fighting and Serving the Dervishes. 1879-1895|last=Slatin|first=Rudolf Carl|publisher=E.

This force approached the Mahdist gathering, whose members were poorly clothed, half starving, and armed only with sticks and stones. However, supreme overconfidence led the Egyptian army into camping within sight of the Mahdist 'army' without posting sentries. The Mahdi led a dawn assault on 7 June 1882, which slaughtered the army to a man. The rebels gained vast stores of arms and ammunition, military clothing and other supplies.<ref>Churchill p. 30</ref>\n\n===Hicks expedition===\nWith the Egyptian government now passing largely under British control (see: [[History of modern Egypt#British administration|History of modern Egypt]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)]]), the European powers became increasingly aware of the troubles in the Sudan. The British advisers to the Egyptian government gave tacit consent for another expedition. Throughout the summer of 1883, Egyptian troops were concentrated at Khartoum, eventually reaching the strength of 7,000 [[infantry]], 1,000 [[cavalry]], 20 machine guns, and [[artillery]]. This force was placed under the command of a retired British [[British India|Indian Staff Corps]] officer [[William Hicks (British soldier)|William Hicks]] and twelve European officers. The force was, in the words of [[Winston Churchill]], \"perhaps the worst army that has ever marched to war\"<ref>{{cite book | first = Winston | last = Churchill | title = The River War | publisher = Kessinger | year = 1902 | page = 31}}</ref>\u2014unpaid, untrained, and undisciplined, its soldiers having more in common with their enemies than with their officers.\n\n[[Al-Ubayyid|El Obeid]], the city whose siege Hicks had intended to relieve, had already fallen by the time the expedition left Khartoum, but Hicks continued anyway, although not confident of his chances of success. Upon his approach, the Mahdi assembled an army of about 40,000 men and drilled them rigorously in the [[military tactics|art of war]], equipping them with the arms and ammunition captured in previous battles. On 3 and 4 November 1883, when Hicks' forces actually offered battle, the Mahdist army was a credible military force, which utterly defeated Hicks' army\u2014only about 500 Egyptians survived\u2014at the [[Battle of El Obeid]].<ref>Churchill p. 33</ref>\n\n===Egyptian evacuation===\nAt this time, the British Empire was increasingly entrenching itself in the workings of the Egyptian government. Egypt was groaning under a barely maintainable debt repayment structure for her enormous European debt.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Milner  | first = Alfred  | title = England in Egypt  | publisher =Macmillan  | year = 1898  | id = | page = 60  }}</ref> For the Egyptian government to avoid further interference from its European [[creditor]]s, it had to ensure that the debt [[interest]] was paid on time, every time. To this end, the Egyptian treasury, initially crippled by [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[bureaucracy]], was placed by the British almost entirely under the control of a 'Financial Advisor', who exercised the power of [[veto]] over all matters of financial policy.  The holders of this office\u2014first Sir [[Auckland Colvin]], and later Sir [[Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon|Edgar Vincent]]<ref>Milner p. 86</ref>\u2014were instructed to exercise the greatest possible parsimony in Egypt's financial affairs. Maintaining the [[garrison]]s in the Sudan was costing the Egyptian government over 100,000 [[Egyptian pound]]s a year,<ref>{{cite book | last = Cromer | first = Earl of | title = Modern Egypt | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 354}}</ref> an unmaintainable expense.\n\n[[File:Charles Gordon Pasha.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Charles Gordon as Governor of the Sudan]]\nIt was therefore decided by the Egyptian government, under some coercion by their British controllers, that the Egyptian presence in the Sudan should be withdrawn and the country left to some form of self-government, likely headed by the Mahdi. The withdrawal of the Egyptian garrisons stationed throughout the country, such as those at [[Sennar]], [[Tokar, Sudan|Tokar]] and Sinkat, was therefore threatened unless it was conducted in an orderly fashion. The Egyptian government asked for a British officer to be sent to the Sudan to co-ordinate the withdrawal of the garrisons. It was hoped that Mahdist forces would judge an attack on a [[British subject]] to be too great a risk, and hence allow the withdrawal to proceed without incident. It was proposed to send [[Charles George Gordon|Charles 'Chinese' Gordon]]. Gordon was a gifted officer, who had distinguished himself in several campaigns in the [[Far East]], particularly [[China]] (See the [[Second Opium War]]). However, he was also renowned for his [[aggression]] and rigid personal [[honour]],<ref>{{cite book  | last = Cromer| first = Earl of | title = Modern Egypt  | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 564 }}</ref> which, in the eyes of several prominent British officials in Egypt, made him unsuitable for the task. Sir [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Evelyn Baring]] (later the [[Earl of Cromer]]), the British [[Consul (representative)|Consul-general]] in Egypt, was particularly opposed to Gordon's appointment, only reluctantly being won over by the British [[Print media|press]] and [[General public|public]]. Gordon was eventually given the mission, but he was to be accompanied by the much more level-headed and reliable Colonel [[John Donald Hamill Stewart|John Stewart]]. It was intended that Stewart, while nominally Gordon's subordinate, would act as a brake on the latter and ensure that the Sudan was evacuated quickly and peacefully.\n\nGordon left [[England]] on 18 January 1884<ref>[[Lytton Strachey|Strachey, Lytton]] (1918), ''Eminent Victorians''[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2447], pp. 194 & 199; see also, Churchill, p. 39</ref> and arrived in [[Cairo]] on the evening of 24 January.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cromer | first = Earl of | title = Modern Egypt | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 441}}</ref> Gordon was largely responsible for drafting his own orders,<ref>{{cite book  | last = Cromer| first = Earl of | title = Modern Egypt  | publisher = Macmillan| year = 1907 | pages = 442\u201345}}</ref> along with proclamations from the [[Khedive]] announcing Egypt's intentions to leave the Sudan.  Gordon's orders, by his own request, were unequivocal and left little room for misinterpretation.\n\n[[File:Battle of Abu Klea, William Barnes Wollen.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Battle of Abu Klea]], which took place during the desert expedition to bring relief to Gordon, besieged in [[Khartoum]], 1885]]\nGordon arrived in Khartoum on 18 February,<ref>{{cite book  | last = Cromer| first = Earl of | title = Modern Egypt  | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 475}}</ref> and immediately became apprised of the vast difficulty of the task. Egypt's garrisons were scattered widely across the country; three\u2014[[Sennar]], [[Tokar, Sudan|Tokar]] and Sinkat\u2014were under siege,<ref>{{cite book | last = Churchill | first = Winston | title = The River War| publisher = Kessinger | year = 1902 | page = 37}}</ref> and the majority of the territory between them was under the control of the Mahdi. There was no guarantee that, if the garrisons were to [[sortie]], even with the clear intention of withdrawing, they would not be cut to pieces by the Mahdist forces. Khartoum's Egyptian and European population was greater than all the other garrisons combined, including 7,000 Egyptian troops<ref name=\"Churchill 1902 29\">{{cite book | last = Churchill | first = Winston | title = The River War| publisher = Kessinger | year = 1902 | page = 29}}</ref> and 27,000 civilians<ref>{{cite book | last = Gordon | first = Charles|title=Journals at Khartoum|year=1885|page=8}} (34,000 total population, including soldiers)</ref> and the staffs of several embassies. Although the pragmatic approach would have been to secure the safety of the Khartoum garrison and abandon the outlying fortifications and their troops to the Mahdi, Gordon became increasingly reluctant to leave the Sudan until \"every one who wants to go down [the Nile] is given the chance to do so,\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Cromer | first = Earl of | publisher = Macmillan | title = Modern Egypt| year = 1907 | page = 564}}</ref> feeling it would be a slight on his honour to abandon any Egyptian soldiers to the Mahdi. He also became increasingly fearful of the Mahdi's potential to cause trouble in Egypt if allowed control of the Sudan, leading to a conviction that the Mahdi must be \"crushed,\" by British troops if necessary, to assure the stability of the region. It is debated<ref>Cromer p. 567</ref> whether or not Gordon deliberately remained in Khartoum longer than strategically sensible, seemingly intent on becoming besieged within the town. Gordon's brother, H. W. Gordon, was of the opinion that the British officers could easily have escaped from Khartoum up until 14 December 1884.<ref>''Journals'' lx</ref>\n\nWhether or not it was the Mahdi's intention, in March 1884, the Sudanese tribes to the north of Khartoum, who had previously been sympathetic or at least neutral towards the Egyptian authorities, rose in support of the Mahdi. The [[telegraph line]]s between Khartoum and [[Cairo]] were cut on 15 March,<ref>Churchill p. 50</ref> severing communication between Khartoum and the outside world.\n\n===Siege of Khartoum===\n{{Main|Siege of Khartoum}}\n[[File:Khartoum 32.53706E 15.60754N.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An aerial view of the confluence of the [[Nile]] rivers. Khartoum lies between the two rivers, with [[Omdurman]] on the west bank slightly downstream.]]\nGordon's position in Khartoum was very strong, as the city was bordered to the north and east by the [[Blue Nile]], to the west by the [[White Nile]], and to the south by ancient fortifications looking on to a vast expanse of desert. Gordon had food for an estimated six months,<ref>{{cite book | title = Modern Egypt | first = Earl of | last = Cromer | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1902 | page = 537}}</ref> several million rounds of [[ammunition]] in store,<ref>''Journals at Khartoum'', p. 73 (2,242,000 in store, 3,240,770 expended to 12/03/84\u201322/09/84)</ref> with the capacity to produce a further 50,000 rounds per week,<ref>''Journals at Khartoum'', p. 44</ref> and 7,000 Egyptian soldiers.<ref>{{cite book | title = The River War | first = Winston | last = Churchill | publisher = Kessinger | year = 1902 | page = 50}}</ref> But outside the walls, the Mahdi had mustered about 50,000 [[Dervish]] soldiers, and as time went on, the chances of a successful [[Sortie|breakout]] became slim. Gordon had enthusiastically supported the idea of recalling the notorious former [[Slaves|slaver]] Pasha [[Al-Zubayr Rahma|Zobeir]] from exile in Egypt to organize and lead a popular uprising against the Mahdi.<ref>{{cite book |title = Modern Egypt | last = Cromer | first = Earl of | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 489}}</ref> When this idea was vetoed by the British government, Gordon proposed a number of alternative means to salvage his situation successively to his British superiors. All were similarly vetoed. Among them were:\n* Making a breakout ''southwards'' along the Blue Nile towards Abyssinia (now [[Ethiopia]]), which would have enabled him to collect the garrisons stationed along that route. The window for navigation of the upper reaches of that river was very narrow.<ref>{{cite book |title = Modern Egypt | last = Cromer | first = Earl of | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 572}}</ref>\n* Requesting Mohammedan regiments from India.<ref name=\"Churchill p. 46\">Churchill p. 46</ref>\n* Requesting several thousand [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] troops be sent to quell the uprising.<ref>{{cite book |title = The River War | first = Winston | last = Churchill | publisher = Kessinger | year = 1902 | page = 46}}</ref>\n* Visiting the Mahdi himself to explore a possible solution.<ref name=\"Churchill p. 46\"/>\nEventually it became impossible for Gordon to be relieved without British troops. An expedition was duly dispatched under Sir [[Garnet Wolseley]], but as the level of the White Nile fell through the winter, muddy 'beaches' at the foot of the walls were exposed. With starvation and [[cholera]] rampant in the city and the Egyptian troops' morale shattered, Gordon's position became untenable and the city fell on 26 January 1885, after a siege of 313 days.\n\n===Nile campaign===\n{{Main|Nile Expedition}}\n[[File:The Mahdist State, 1881-98, modern Sudan.png|thumb|upright|The maximum extent of the Mahdist state, shown within the pre-2011 borders of the Sudan]]\nThe British Government, reluctantly and late, but under strong pressure from public opinion, sent a relief column under Sir Garnet Wolseley to relieve the Khartoum garrison. This was described in some British papers as the 'Gordon Relief Expedition', a term Gordon strongly objected to. After defeating the Mahdists at the [[Battle of Abu Klea]], the column arrived within sight of Khartoum only to find they were too late: the city had fallen two days earlier, and Gordon and the garrison had been massacred.\n\n===Suakin Expedition===\n{{main|Suakin Expedition}}\nThe British also sent an expeditionary force under Lieutenant-General Sir [[Gerald Graham]], including an Indian contingent, to [[Suakin]] in March 1885. Though successful in the two actions it fought, it failed to change the military situation and was withdrawn.<ref>[[Ernest Gambier-Parry]], ''Suakin, 1885 : being a sketch of the campaign of this year (1885)'', (London : K. Paul, Trench & Co.)</ref> These events temporarily ended British and Egyptian involvement in Sudan, which passed completely under the control of the Mahdists.\n\nMuhammad Ahmad died soon after his victory, on 22 June 1885, and was succeeded by the [[Caliph|Khalifa]] [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], who proved to be an able, albeit ruthless, ruler of the [[History of Mahdist Sudan#Mahdiyah|Mahdiyah]] (the Mahdist state).\n\n===Equatoria expedition===\n{{main|Emin Pasha Relief Expedition}}\nBetween 1886 and 1889 a British expedition to relieve the Egyptian governor of [[Equatoria]] made its way through central Africa. The governor, [[Emin Pasha]], was rescued, but the expedition was not without its failures, such as the disaster that befell the rear column.\n\n===Ethiopian campaigns===\nAccording to the [[Hewett Treaty]] of 3 June 1884, Ethiopia agreed to facilitate the evacuation of Egyptian garrisons in southern Sudan. In September 1884, Ethiopia reoccupied the province of [[Bogos]], which had been occupied by Egypt, and began a long campaign to relieve the Egyptian garrisons besieged by the Mahdists. The bitter campaigning was led by the Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] and Ras [[Ras Alula|Alula]]. The Ethiopians under Ras Alula achieved a final victory in the [[Battle of Kufit]] on 23 September 1885.<ref name=Henze>{{citation |ref=harv |first=Paul B. |last=Henze |title=Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave |year=2000 |pages=155\u201358}}</ref>\n\nBetween November 1885 and February 1886, Yohannes IV was putting down a revolt in [[Wollo]]. In January 1886, a Mahdist army invaded Ethiopia, seized [[Dembea]], burned the [[Mahbere Selassie monastery]] and advanced on [[Chilga]]. King [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam]] led a successful counteroffensive as far as [[Gallabat]] in the Sudan in January 1887. A year later, in January 1888, the Mahdists returned, defeating Tekle Haymanot at [[Battle of Sar Weha|Sar Weha]] and sacking [[Gondar]].<ref name=Henze/>\n\n===Italian campaign and Anglo-Egyptian reconquest===\n{{Main|Battle of Serobeti|First Battle of Agordat|Second Battle of Agordat|Battle of Kassala|Anglo-Egyptian conquest of Sudan}}\n[[File:Redjaf 1897.jpg|thumb|left|Troops from the [[Congo Free State]] defeating Mahdist troops at the [[Battle of Rejaf]]]]\nIn the intervening years, Egypt had not renounced her claims over Sudan, and the British authorities considered that claim legitimate. Under strict control by British administrators, Egypt's economy had been rebuilt, and the Egyptian army reformed, this time trained and led by British officers and [[non-commissioned officer]]s. The situation evolved in a way that allowed Egypt, both politically and militarily, to reconquer Sudan.<ref>Churchill, pp. 89\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[File:Tucruf.jpg|thumb|Italian [[Askari#Italian colonies|Askari]]s defeating Mahdist troops in Tucruf.]]\n\nSince 1890, [[Italian Empire|Italian]] troops defeated Mahdist troops in the [[Battle of Serobeti]] and the [[First Battle of Agordat]].

The Mahdists threatened to retake [[Kassala]], which they had lost to the Italians in 1894. The British government judged it politic to assist the Italians by making a military demonstration in northern Sudan. This coincided with the increased threat of French encroachment on the [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]] regions. Lord Cromer, judging that the [[Unionist government, 1895\u20131905|Conservative-Unionist]] government in power would favour taking the offensive, managed to extend the demonstration into a full-fledged invasion.<ref>Churchill, p. 101</ref> In 1897, the Italians gave back to the British the control of Kassala, returning in Italian Eritrea, in order to get international recognition of their colony.\n\n[[File:Battle of Omdurman.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Omdurman]]\n[[Herbert Kitchener]], the new ''[[Sirdar (Egypt)|Sirdar]]'' (commander) of the Anglo-Egyptian Army, received his marching orders on 12 March, and his forces entered Sudan on the 18th.

An expedition commanded by Kitchener was organised in Egypt. It was composed of 8,200 British soldiers and 17,600 Egyptian and Sudanese soldiers commanded by British officers. The Mahdist forces (sometimes called the Dervishes) were more numerous, numbering more than 60,000 warriors, but lacked modern weapons.\n\nAfter defeating a Mahdist force in the [[Battle of Atbara]] in April 1898, the Anglo-Egyptians reached [[Battle of Omdurman|Omdurman]], the Mahdist capital, in September. The bulk of the Mahdist army [[Battle of Omdurman|attacked]], but was cut down by British machine-guns and rifle fire.\n\nThe remnant, with the Khalifa Abdullah, fled to southern Sudan. During the pursuit, Kitchener's forces met a French force under Major [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] at [[Fashoda]], resulting in the [[Fashoda Incident]]. They finally caught up with Abdullah at [[Battle of Umm Diwaykarat|Umm Diwaykarat]], where he was killed, effectively ending the Mahdist regime.\n\nThe casualties for this campaign were:\n\n:Sudan: 30,000 dead, wounded, or captured\n:Britain: 700+ British, Egyptian and Sudanese dead, wounded, or captured.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|Wad Hubaba Revolt}}\nThe British set up a new colonial system, the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian administration]], which effectively established British domination over Sudan.

State|Mahdist Sudanese]] of the religious leader [[Muhammad Ahmad|Muhammad Ahmad bin Abd Allah]], who had proclaimed himself the \"[[Mahdi]]\" of [[Islam]] (the \"Guided One\"), and the forces of the [[Khedivate of Egypt]], initially, and later the forces of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Eighteen years of war resulted in the nominally joint-rule state of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] (1899-1956), a ''[[de jure]]'' [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] of the [[British Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] in which Britain had ''[[de facto]]'' control over the Sudan. The Sudanese launched several unsuccessful invasions of their neighbours, expanding the scale of the conflict to include not only Britain and Egypt but the [[Italian Empire]], the [[Congo Free State|Belgian Congo]] and the [[Ethiopian Empire]].\n\nThe British participation in the war is called the '''Sudan campaign'''. Other names for this war include the \"'''Mahdist Revolt'''\", the \"'''Anglo\u2013Sudan War'''\" and the \"'''Sudanese Mahdist Revolt'''\".\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the invasion by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] in 1819, Sudan was governed by an [[Turkiyah|Egyptian administration]]. Because of the heavy taxes it imposed and because of the bloody start of the Turkish-Egyptian rule in Sudan, this [[colonialism|colonial]] system was resented by the Sudanese people.\n\nThroughout the period of Turco-Egyptian rule, many segments of the Sudanese population suffered extreme hardship because of the system of taxation imposed by the central government. Under this system, a flat tax was imposed on farmers and small traders and collected by government-appointed tax collectors from the [[Sha'iqiyya]] tribe of northern Sudan. In bad years, and especially during times of drought and famine, farmers were unable to pay the high taxes. Fearing the brutal and unjust methods of the Sha'iqiyya, many farmers fled their villages in the fertile [[Nile Valley]] to the remote areas of [[Kordofan]] and [[Darfur]]. These migrants, known as \"jallaba\" after their loose-fitting style of dress, began to function as small traders and middlemen for the foreign trading companies that had established themselves in the cities and towns of central Sudan.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The jallaba were also known to be slave trading tribes.\n\nBy the middle 19th century the Ottoman Imperial subject administration in Egypt was in the hands of [[Khedive Ismail]]. Khedive Ismail's spending had put Egypt into huge debt, and when his financing of the [[Suez Canal]] started to crumble, the United Kingdom stepped in and repaid his loans in return for controlling shares in the canal. As the most direct route to India, the jewel in the British Crown, control over the Suez Canal was of paramount strategic importance, and British commercial and imperial interests dictated the need to seize or otherwise control it. Thus an ever-increasing British role in Egyptian affairs seemed necessary. With Khedive Ismail's spending and corruption causing instability, in 1873 the British government supported a program whereby an Anglo-French debt commission assumed responsibility for managing Egypt's fiscal affairs. This commission eventually forced [[Khedive Ismail]] to abdicate in favor of his son Tawfiq in 1877, leading to a period of political turmoil.\n\nAlso in 1873, Ismail had appointed [[Charles George Gordon|General Charles \"Chinese\" Gordon]] Governor of the Equatorial Provinces of Sudan. For the next three years, General Gordon fought against a native chieftain of [[Darfur]], [[Al-Zubayr Rahma Mansur]].\n\nUpon Ismail's abdication in 1877, Gordon found himself with dramatically decreased support. Exhausted by years of work, he resigned his post in 1880 and left early the next year. His policies were soon abandoned by the new governors, but the anger and discontent of the dominant Arab minority was left unaddressed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\nAlthough the Egyptians were fearful of the deteriorating conditions, the British refused to get involved, \"Her Majesty\u2019s Government are in no way responsible for operations in the Sudan,\" the Foreign Secretary [[Earl Granville]] noted.\n\n==Conflict==\n===Mahdi uprising===\n[[File:Muhammad Ahmad al-Mahdi 1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Muhammad Ahmad, the self-proclaimed Mahdi]]\n[[File:Banner, declaration of faith and allegiance to Allah.

Soon in open revolt against the Egyptians, Muhammad Ahmad proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]], the promised redeemer of the Islamic world. In August 1881 the then-governor of the Sudan, [[Raouf Pasha]], sent two companies of infantry each with one [[machine gun]] to arrest him. The captains of the two companies were each promised promotion if their soldiers were the ones to return the Mahdi to the governor. Both companies disembarked from the steamer that had brought them up the [[Nile]] to [[Aba Island]] and approached the Mahdi's village from separate directions. Arriving simultaneously, each force began to fire blindly on the other, allowing the Mahdi's scant followers to attack and destroy each force in turn at the [[Battle of Aba]].<ref>{{cite book | first = Winston | last = Churchill | title = The River War | year = 1902 | publisher = Kessinger | page= 28}}</ref>\n\nThe Mahdi then began a strategic retreat to [[Kordofan]], where he was at a distance from the seat of government in [[Khartoum]]. This movement, couched as a triumphal progress, incited many of the Arab tribes to rise in support of the [[Jihad]] the Mahdi had declared against the \"Turkish oppressors.\" Another Egyptian expedition dispatched from [[Fashoda]] was ambushed and slaughtered on the night of 9 December 1881.<ref>Churchill p. 29</ref>\n\nThe Mahdi also legitimized his movement by drawing deliberate parallels to the life of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]]. He called his followers [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]], after the people who greeted the Prophet in [[Medina]], and he called his flight from the British, the [[Hegira|hijrah]], after the Prophet's flight from the [[Quraysh]]. The Mahdi also appointed commanders to represent three of the four [[Rashidun|Righteous Caliphs]];<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fire and Sword in the Sudan; a Personal Narrative of Fighting and Serving the Dervishes. 1879-1895|last=Slatin|first=Rudolf Carl|publisher=E.

This force approached the Mahdist gathering, whose members were poorly clothed, half starving, and armed only with sticks and stones. However, supreme overconfidence led the Egyptian army into camping within sight of the Mahdist 'army' without posting sentries. The Mahdi led a dawn assault on 7 June 1882, which slaughtered the army to a man. The rebels gained vast stores of arms and ammunition, military clothing and other supplies.<ref>Churchill p. 30</ref>\n\n===Hicks expedition===\nWith the Egyptian government now passing largely under British control (see: [[History of modern Egypt#British administration|History of modern Egypt]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)]]), the European powers became increasingly aware of the troubles in the Sudan. The British advisers to the Egyptian government gave tacit consent for another expedition. Throughout the summer of 1883, Egyptian troops were concentrated at Khartoum, eventually reaching the strength of 7,000 [[infantry]], 1,000 [[cavalry]], 20 machine guns, and [[artillery]]. This force was placed under the command of a retired British [[British India|Indian Staff Corps]] officer [[William Hicks (British soldier)|William Hicks]] and twelve European officers. The force was, in the words of [[Winston Churchill]], \"perhaps the worst army that has ever marched to war\"<ref>{{cite book | first = Winston | last = Churchill | title = The River War | publisher = Kessinger | year = 1902 | page = 31}}</ref>\u2014unpaid, untrained, and undisciplined, its soldiers having more in common with their enemies than with their officers.\n\n[[Al-Ubayyid|El Obeid]], the city whose siege Hicks had intended to relieve, had already fallen by the time the expedition left Khartoum, but Hicks continued anyway, although not confident of his chances of success. Upon his approach, the Mahdi assembled an army of about 40,000 men and drilled them rigorously in the [[military tactics|art of war]], equipping them with the arms and ammunition captured in previous battles. On 3 and 4 November 1883, when Hicks' forces actually offered battle, the Mahdist army was a credible military force, which utterly defeated Hicks' army\u2014only about 500 Egyptians survived\u2014at the [[Battle of El Obeid]].<ref>Churchill p. 33</ref>\n\n===Egyptian evacuation===\nAt this time, the British Empire was increasingly entrenching itself in the workings of the Egyptian government. Egypt was groaning under a barely maintainable debt repayment structure for her enormous European debt.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Milner  | first = Alfred  | title = England in Egypt  | publisher =Macmillan  | year = 1898  | id = | page = 60  }}</ref> For the Egyptian government to avoid further interference from its European [[creditor]]s, it had to ensure that the debt [[interest]] was paid on time, every time. To this end, the Egyptian treasury, initially crippled by [[political corruption|corruption]] and [[bureaucracy]], was placed by the British almost entirely under the control of a 'Financial Advisor', who exercised the power of [[veto]] over all matters of financial policy.  The holders of this office\u2014first Sir [[Auckland Colvin]], and later Sir [[Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon|Edgar Vincent]]<ref>Milner p. 86</ref>\u2014were instructed to exercise the greatest possible parsimony in Egypt's financial affairs. Maintaining the [[garrison]]s in the Sudan was costing the Egyptian government over 100,000 [[Egyptian pound]]s a year,<ref>{{cite book | last = Cromer | first = Earl of | title = Modern Egypt | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 354}}</ref> an unmaintainable expense.\n\n[[File:Charles Gordon Pasha.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Charles Gordon as Governor of the Sudan]]\nIt was therefore decided by the Egyptian government, under some coercion by their British controllers, that the Egyptian presence in the Sudan should be withdrawn and the country left to some form of self-government, likely headed by the Mahdi. The withdrawal of the Egyptian garrisons stationed throughout the country, such as those at [[Sennar]], [[Tokar, Sudan|Tokar]] and Sinkat, was therefore threatened unless it was conducted in an orderly fashion. The Egyptian government asked for a British officer to be sent to the Sudan to co-ordinate the withdrawal of the garrisons. It was hoped that Mahdist forces would judge an attack on a [[British subject]] to be too great a risk, and hence allow the withdrawal to proceed without incident. It was proposed to send [[Charles George Gordon|Charles 'Chinese' Gordon]]. Gordon was a gifted officer, who had distinguished himself in several campaigns in the [[Far East]], particularly [[China]] (See the [[Second Opium War]]). However, he was also renowned for his [[aggression]] and rigid personal [[honour]],<ref>{{cite book  | last = Cromer| first = Earl of | title = Modern Egypt  | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 564 }}</ref> which, in the eyes of several prominent British officials in Egypt, made him unsuitable for the task. Sir [[Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|Evelyn Baring]] (later the [[Earl of Cromer]]), the British [[Consul (representative)|Consul-general]] in Egypt, was particularly opposed to Gordon's appointment, only reluctantly being won over by the British [[Print media|press]] and [[General public|public]]. Gordon was eventually given the mission, but he was to be accompanied by the much more level-headed and reliable Colonel [[John Donald Hamill Stewart|John Stewart]]. It was intended that Stewart, while nominally Gordon's subordinate, would act as a brake on the latter and ensure that the Sudan was evacuated quickly and peacefully.\n\nGordon left [[England]] on 18 January 1884<ref>[[Lytton Strachey|Strachey, Lytton]] (1918), ''Eminent Victorians''[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2447], pp. 194 & 199; see also, Churchill, p. 39</ref> and arrived in [[Cairo]] on the evening of 24 January.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cromer | first = Earl of | title = Modern Egypt | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 441}}</ref> Gordon was largely responsible for drafting his own orders,<ref>{{cite book  | last = Cromer| first = Earl of | title = Modern Egypt  | publisher = Macmillan| year = 1907 | pages = 442\u201345}}</ref> along with proclamations from the [[Khedive]] announcing Egypt's intentions to leave the Sudan.  Gordon's orders, by his own request, were unequivocal and left little room for misinterpretation.\n\n[[File:Battle of Abu Klea, William Barnes Wollen.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Battle of Abu Klea]], which took place during the desert expedition to bring relief to Gordon, besieged in [[Khartoum]], 1885]]\nGordon arrived in Khartoum on 18 February,<ref>{{cite book  | last = Cromer| first = Earl of | title = Modern Egypt  | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 475}}</ref> and immediately became apprised of the vast difficulty of the task. Egypt's garrisons were scattered widely across the country; three\u2014[[Sennar]], [[Tokar, Sudan|Tokar]] and Sinkat\u2014were under siege,<ref>{{cite book | last = Churchill | first = Winston | title = The River War| publisher = Kessinger | year = 1902 | page = 37}}</ref> and the majority of the territory between them was under the control of the Mahdi. There was no guarantee that, if the garrisons were to [[sortie]], even with the clear intention of withdrawing, they would not be cut to pieces by the Mahdist forces. Khartoum's Egyptian and European population was greater than all the other garrisons combined, including 7,000 Egyptian troops<ref name=\"Churchill 1902 29\">{{cite book | last = Churchill | first = Winston | title = The River War| publisher = Kessinger | year = 1902 | page = 29}}</ref> and 27,000 civilians<ref>{{cite book | last = Gordon | first = Charles|title=Journals at Khartoum|year=1885|page=8}} (34,000 total population, including soldiers)</ref> and the staffs of several embassies. Although the pragmatic approach would have been to secure the safety of the Khartoum garrison and abandon the outlying fortifications and their troops to the Mahdi, Gordon became increasingly reluctant to leave the Sudan until \"every one who wants to go down [the Nile] is given the chance to do so,\"<ref>{{cite book| last = Cromer | first = Earl of | publisher = Macmillan | title = Modern Egypt| year = 1907 | page = 564}}</ref> feeling it would be a slight on his honour to abandon any Egyptian soldiers to the Mahdi. He also became increasingly fearful of the Mahdi's potential to cause trouble in Egypt if allowed control of the Sudan, leading to a conviction that the Mahdi must be \"crushed,\" by British troops if necessary, to assure the stability of the region. It is debated<ref>Cromer p. 567</ref> whether or not Gordon deliberately remained in Khartoum longer than strategically sensible, seemingly intent on becoming besieged within the town. Gordon's brother, H. W. Gordon, was of the opinion that the British officers could easily have escaped from Khartoum up until 14 December 1884.<ref>''Journals'' lx</ref>\n\nWhether or not it was the Mahdi's intention, in March 1884, the Sudanese tribes to the north of Khartoum, who had previously been sympathetic or at least neutral towards the Egyptian authorities, rose in support of the Mahdi. The [[telegraph line]]s between Khartoum and [[Cairo]] were cut on 15 March,<ref>Churchill p. 50</ref> severing communication between Khartoum and the outside world.\n\n===Siege of Khartoum===\n{{Main|Siege of Khartoum}}\n[[File:Khartoum 32.53706E 15.60754N.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An aerial view of the confluence of the [[Nile]] rivers. Khartoum lies between the two rivers, with [[Omdurman]] on the west bank slightly downstream.]]\nGordon's position in Khartoum was very strong, as the city was bordered to the north and east by the [[Blue Nile]], to the west by the [[White Nile]], and to the south by ancient fortifications looking on to a vast expanse of desert. Gordon had food for an estimated six months,<ref>{{cite book | title = Modern Egypt | first = Earl of | last = Cromer | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1902 | page = 537}}</ref> several million rounds of [[ammunition]] in store,<ref>''Journals at Khartoum'', p. 73 (2,242,000 in store, 3,240,770 expended to 12/03/84\u201322/09/84)</ref> with the capacity to produce a further 50,000 rounds per week,<ref>''Journals at Khartoum'', p. 44</ref> and 7,000 Egyptian soldiers.<ref>{{cite book | title = The River War | first = Winston | last = Churchill | publisher = Kessinger | year = 1902 | page = 50}}</ref> But outside the walls, the Mahdi had mustered about 50,000 [[Dervish]] soldiers, and as time went on, the chances of a successful [[Sortie|breakout]] became slim. Gordon had enthusiastically supported the idea of recalling the notorious former [[Slaves|slaver]] Pasha [[Al-Zubayr Rahma|Zobeir]] from exile in Egypt to organize and lead a popular uprising against the Mahdi.<ref>{{cite book |title = Modern Egypt | last = Cromer | first = Earl of | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 489}}</ref> When this idea was vetoed by the British government, Gordon proposed a number of alternative means to salvage his situation successively to his British superiors. All were similarly vetoed. Among them were:\n* Making a breakout ''southwards'' along the Blue Nile towards Abyssinia (now [[Ethiopia]]), which would have enabled him to collect the garrisons stationed along that route. The window for navigation of the upper reaches of that river was very narrow.<ref>{{cite book |title = Modern Egypt | last = Cromer | first = Earl of | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1907 | page = 572}}</ref>\n* Requesting Mohammedan regiments from India.<ref name=\"Churchill p. 46\">Churchill p. 46</ref>\n* Requesting several thousand [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] troops be sent to quell the uprising.<ref>{{cite book |title = The River War | first = Winston | last = Churchill | publisher = Kessinger | year = 1902 | page = 46}}</ref>\n* Visiting the Mahdi himself to explore a possible solution.<ref name=\"Churchill p. 46\"/>\nEventually it became impossible for Gordon to be relieved without British troops. An expedition was duly dispatched under Sir [[Garnet Wolseley]], but as the level of the White Nile fell through the winter, muddy 'beaches' at the foot of the walls were exposed. With starvation and [[cholera]] rampant in the city and the Egyptian troops' morale shattered, Gordon's position became untenable and the city fell on 26 January 1885, after a siege of 313 days.\n\n===Nile campaign===\n{{Main|Nile Expedition}}\n[[File:The Mahdist State, 1881-98, modern Sudan.png|thumb|upright|The maximum extent of the Mahdist state, shown within the pre-2011 borders of the Sudan]]\nThe British Government, reluctantly and late, but under strong pressure from public opinion, sent a relief column under Sir Garnet Wolseley to relieve the Khartoum garrison. This was described in some British papers as the 'Gordon Relief Expedition', a term Gordon strongly objected to. After defeating the Mahdists at the [[Battle of Abu Klea]], the column arrived within sight of Khartoum only to find they were too late: the city had fallen two days earlier, and Gordon and the garrison had been massacred.\n\n===Suakin Expedition===\n{{main|Suakin Expedition}}\nThe British also sent an expeditionary force under Lieutenant-General Sir [[Gerald Graham]], including an Indian contingent, to [[Suakin]] in March 1885. Though successful in the two actions it fought, it failed to change the military situation and was withdrawn.<ref>[[Ernest Gambier-Parry]], ''Suakin, 1885 : being a sketch of the campaign of this year (1885)'', (London : K. Paul, Trench & Co.)</ref> These events temporarily ended British and Egyptian involvement in Sudan, which passed completely under the control of the Mahdists.\n\nMuhammad Ahmad died soon after his victory on 22 June 1885, and was succeeded by the [[Caliph|Khalifa]] [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], who proved to be an able, albeit ruthless, ruler of the [[History of Mahdist Sudan#Mahdiyah|Mahdiyah]] (or the Mahdist state).\n\n===Equatoria expedition===\n{{main|Emin Pasha Relief Expedition}}\nBetween 1886 and 1889 a British expedition to relieve the Egyptian governor of [[Equatoria]] made its way through central Africa. The governor, [[Emin Pasha]], was rescued, but the expedition was not without its failures, such as the disaster that befell the rear column.\n\n===Ethiopian campaigns===\nAccording to the [[Hewett Treaty]] of 3 June 1884, Ethiopia agreed to facilitate the evacuation of Egyptian garrisons in southern Sudan. In September 1884, Ethiopia reoccupied the province of [[Bogos]], which had been occupied by Egypt, and began a long campaign to relieve the Egyptian garrisons besieged by the Mahdists. The bitter campaigning was led by the Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] and Ras [[Ras Alula|Alula]]. The Ethiopians under Ras Alula achieved a final victory in the [[Battle of Kufit]] on 23 September 1885.<ref name=Henze>{{citation |ref=harv |first=Paul B. |last=Henze |title=Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave |year=2000 |pages=155\u201358}}</ref>\n\nBetween November 1885 and February 1886, Yohannes IV was putting down a revolt in [[Wollo]]. In January 1886, a Mahdist army invaded Ethiopia, seized [[Dembea]], burned the [[Mahbere Selassie monastery]] and advanced on [[Chilga]]. King [[Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam]] led a successful counteroffensive as far as [[Gallabat]] in the Sudan in January 1887.

The British government judged it politic to assist the Italians by making a military demonstration in northern Sudan. This coincided with the increased threat of French encroachment on the [[Upper Nile, Sudan|Upper Nile]] regions.

The clothing, made from a thin material, has fallen from her right breast and shows more than it covers.

Since the arms and legs have broken off and do not survive, any attributes which would have helped to identify her are lost and her exact nature cannot be determined for sure. Since the goddess is turning her head away from whatever she held in her hands, it is proposed that there was a further figure, probably a small [[Eros]], to her right. Her raised left leg encourages one to suspect that there was a column base or a larger construction like a pillar here. Her hair is gathered behind her head and is crowned by a tiara.\n\nThe front of the 37.6 cm high figure was formed in a [[Molding (process)|mold]] and then reworked, while the rear received less attention. The folds of skin on the neck were traced with a sharp edge. Her pupils are indicated by slight indentations. On the back at hip height is a large, oval hole which was added to prevent trapped air causing the statue to explode when it was [[firing|fired]] in the [[kiln]]. It is thought that the statuette was made in [[Myrina (Aeolis)|Myrina]] in [[Asia Minor]]. This place was famed for its terracotta production, along with [[Tanagra]] in [[Boeotia]]. Since the two places reached their apogees at different times, this figure is dated to the second century BC. The figure was originally coloured. There are remains of the [[slipware]] in the creases of her drapery, blue traces on the diadem and re-red on her coat.\n\nThe statue was acquired from the collection of [[Maximilian von Heyl]] in 1930 for the Antikensammlung Berlin - from which the figure received the name by which it is now known.

It is also referred to as Bad Schwalbach - Ramschied.\n\n==Location==\n\nRamschied is located in the heart of the [[Taunus]] Mountains, northwest of [[Wiesbaden]]. The aptly named [[Wisper]] River, and the forested valley which bears the same name, both begin in Ramschied. Ramschied is surrounded by the following towns; Bad Schwalbach to the east, B\u00e4rstadt (part of [[Schlangenbad]]) to the southeast, Fischbach to the south, Langenseifen to the southwest, Watzelhain (part of [[Heidenrod]]) to the west, Kemel and Heimbach to the north.<ref>Map, [https://maps.google.com/maps?q=bad+schwalbach+-+ramschied,+hessen,+germany&hnear=Ramschied,+Hesse,+Germany&gl=us&t=h&z=14 Satellite View of Ramschied]</ref> Many residents of Ramschied commute to destinations as close as a brief stroll and as far away as [[Frankfurt]]. Some of the commuters include Americans from the [[Wiesbaden Army Airfield]].\n\n==History==\n\nMany remnants of a long and memorable history can be observed in and around Ramschied. During the [[Roman era]], Ramschied constituted part of the frontier of Rome with Germania, called the [[Limes Germanicus]].

Such a crushing obligation on a relatively barren and infertile land resulted in bitter poverty. Records show that by 1200, Werner II of Bolanden, a [[County of Katzenelnbogen|Count of Katzenelnbogen]], was receiving income from Ramschied. In 1400 and 1427, the lords of Gerolstein-Oberramscheid established [[manor court]]s for their [[fiefdom]].

It is known from substrates including food, indoor air, wood, soil and carpet dust.<ref name=\"r28\"/><ref name=\"r2\"/><ref name=wendy1/> ''Paecilomyces variotii'' is the asexual state of ''[[Byssochlamys]] spectabilis'', a member of the Phylum [[Ascomycota]] (Family [[Trichocomaceae]]).<ref name=\"r6\"/> However, the ''[[Byssochlamys]]'' state is rarely observed in culture due to the [[heterothallic]] nature of this species (i.e., it requires culturing of positive and negative strains in co-culture to produce the [[teleomorph]]). ''Paecilomyces variotii'' is fast growing, producing powdery to suede-like in colonies that are yellow-brown or sand-colored.<ref name=\"r7\"/> It is distinguishable from microscopically from similar microfungi, such as the biverticillate members of the genus ''Penicillium'' (affiliated with the genus ''Talaromyces'') by its broadly [[ellipsoidal]] to lemon-shaped [[conidia]], loosely branched conidiophores and [[phialide]]s with pointed tips. Ascospores of the sexual state, ''B. spectabilis'', are strongly heat-resistant. As such, the fungus is a common contaminant of heat-treated foods and juices.<ref name=\"r6\"/> It is also known from decaying wood and creosote-treated wood utility poles.<ref name=\"r6\"/><ref name=\"r7\"/> ''Paecilomyces variotii'' has been associated with a number of infective diseases of humans and animals.<ref name=\"r21\"/> It is also an important indoor environmental contaminant.<ref name=\"r4\"/>\n\n==Morphology==\nThe colonies are usually flat, powdery to suede-like and funiculose or tufted.<ref name=\"r23\"/> The color is initially white, and becomes yellow, yellow-brown, or sand-colored as they mature. A sweet aromatic odor may be associated with older cultures.<ref name=\"r24\"/> Colonies of ''P. variotii'' are fast growing and mature within 3 days. Colonies grown on Sabouraud's dextrose agar reach about 7\u20138&nbsp;mm after one week. Colonies on CYA are flat, floccose in texture, produce brown or olive brown from conidia, and range in diameter from 30-79&nbsp;mmn in one week.<ref name=\"r25\"/>  Colonies on malt extract agar reach 70&nbsp;mm diameter or more, otherwise very similar in appearance to those on CYA. Colonies on G25N media reach 8\u201316&nbsp;mm diameter, similar to on CYA but with predominantly white mycelium.

It is known from substrates including food, indoor air, wood, soil and carpet dust.<ref name=\"r28\"/><ref name=\"r2\"/><ref name=wendy1/> ''Paecilomyces variotii'' is the asexual state of ''[[Byssochlamys]] spectabilis'', a member of the Phylum [[Ascomycota]] (Family [[Trichocomaceae]]).<ref name=\"r6\"/> However, the ''[[Byssochlamys]]'' state is rarely observed in culture due to the [[heterothallic]] nature of this species (i.e., it requires culturing of positive and negative strains in co-culture to produce the [[teleomorph]]). ''Paecilomyces variotii'' is fast growing, producing powdery to suede-like in colonies that are yellow-brown or sand-colored.<ref name=\"r7\"/> It is distinguishable from microscopically from similar microfungi, such as the biverticillate members of the genus ''Penicillium'' (affiliated with the genus ''Talaromyces'') by its broadly [[ellipsoidal]] to lemon-shaped [[conidia]], loosely branched conidiophores and [[phialide]]s with pointed tips. Ascospores of the sexual state, ''B. spectabilis'', are strongly heat-resistant. As such, the fungus is a common contaminant of heat-treated foods and juices.<ref name=\"r6\"/> It is also known from decaying wood and creosote-treated wood utility poles.<ref name=\"r6\"/><ref name=\"r7\"/> ''Paecilomyces variotii'' has been associated with a number of infective diseases of humans and animals.<ref name=\"r21\"/> It is also an important indoor environmental contaminant.<ref name=\"r4\"/>\n\n==Morphology==\nThe colonies are usually flat, powdery to suede-like and funiculose or tufted.<ref name=\"r23\"/> The color is initially white, and becomes yellow, yellow-brown, or sand-colored as they mature. A sweet aromatic odor may be associated with older cultures.<ref name=\"r24\"/> Colonies of ''P. variotii'' are fast growing and mature within 3 days. Colonies grown on Sabouraud's dextrose agar reach about 7\u20138&nbsp;mm after one week. Colonies on CYA are flat, floccose in texture, produce brown or olive brown from conidia, and range in diameter from 30-79&nbsp;mmn in one week.<ref name=\"r25\"/>  Colonies on malt extract agar reach 70&nbsp;mm diameter or more, otherwise very similar in appearance to those on CYA. Colonies on G25N media reach 8\u201316&nbsp;mm diameter, similar to on CYA but with predominantly white mycelium.

''Ebony'' highlighted the black professionals serving in [[Jimmy Carter]]'s administration in the March 1977 issue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Mia L.|date=2015-12-01|title=\"I Dig You, Chocolate City\": Ebony and Sepia Magazines' Coverage of Black Political Progress, 1971\u20131977|journal=Journal of African American Studies|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=398\u2013409|doi=10.1007/s12111-015-9309-x|issn=1936-4741}}</ref>\n\n===1985\u20132005===\nThe magazine reached unprecedented levels of popularity, with marketers estimating that ''Ebony'' reached over 40% of the African\u2013American adults in the United States during the 1980s, a feat unmatched by any other general\u2013interest magazine at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/opinion/ebony-jet-magazine.html|title=Opinion {{!}} The Radical Blackness of Ebony Magazine|last=Staples|first=Brent|date=2019-08-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Beginning in the mid\u20131970s, advertisers created ads specifically for the magazine which featured African\u2013American models using their products.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pollay|first=Richard W.|last2=Lee|first2=Jung S.|last3=M.B.A|first3=David Carter-Whitney|date=1992-03-01|title=Separate, but Not Equal: Racial Segmentation in Cigarette Advertising|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=21|issue=1|pages=45\u201357|doi=10.1080/00913367.1992.10673359|issn=0091-3367}}</ref> In 1985, ''Ebony Man'', a monthly men's magazine was created, printing the first issue in September 1985.<ref name=\"sat\" /> By the magazine's 40th anniversary in November 1985, it had a circulation of 1.7 million.<ref name=NYTS/>\n\n===2005\u2013present===\nIn December 2008, [[Google]] announced that it was scanning back issues for [[Google Book Search]]; all issues from November 1959 to December 2008 are available for free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/search-and-find-magazines-on-google.html|title=Search and find magazines on Google Book Search|author=Dave Foulser|date=December 9, 2008|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}</ref> In 2010, the [[Johnson Publishing Company]] sold its historic building at 820 S.

In the past, the magazine was persistently upbeat, much like its postwar contemporary ''Life'' magazine. However, in the 21st century, ''Ebony'' has started to feature more controversial content. \n\nThe November 2011 cover featured a pregnant [[Nia Long]], reminiscent of the iconic image of actress [[Demi Moore]] featured naked while pregnant on a major magazine cover two decades before. Some of ''Ebony''\u2032s more conservative readers disagreed with the cover choice, stating it inappropriate to feature an unwed, pregnant woman on the cover. The cover made national headlines, as it was featured in ''[[US Weekly]]'' and in a five-minute segment on [[CNN]]. Recent issues questioned whether President Obama was still right for black America and whether [[biracial]] Americans need more acknowledgement in today's society. \n\nOn May 24, 2019, Clear View Group suspended the print edition of the magazine, with Spring 2019 issue the last to be printed.<ref name=YGY>[https://www.tinshingle.com/blog/ebony-magazine-in-flux-reportedly-burns-writers-huge-photo-archive-in-play Tin Shingle, July 8, 2019, EBONY Magazine In Flux - Print Magazine Folds, Digital Seems To Continue Yvonne de Salle  Shakeups, Magazining, Media Contacts].Retrieved April 21, 2020.</ref><ref name=NYP>[https://nypost.com/2019/06/20/ebony-and-jet-magazines-laying-off-remaining-editorial-staff/ NY Post, Ebony and Jet magazines laying off remaining editorial staff, By Keith J.
