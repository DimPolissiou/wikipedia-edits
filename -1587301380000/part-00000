Larson]]. The franchise began with the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original television series]] in 1978 and was followed by a short-run sequel series (''[[Galactica 1980]]''), a line of book adaptations, original novels, comic books, a board game, and video games. A re-imagined version of ''Battlestar Galactica'' aired as a [[Battlestar Galactica (miniseries)|two-part, three-hour miniseries]] developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[David Eick]] in 2003. That miniseries led to a [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|weekly television series]], which aired until 2009. A prequel series, ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'', aired in 2010.\n\nAll ''Battlestar Galactica'' productions share the premise that in a distant part of the universe, a human civilization has extended to a group of planets known as the Twelve Colonies, to which they have migrated from their ancestral homeworld of [[Kobol]]. The Twelve Colonies have been engaged in a lengthy war with a cybernetic race known as the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]], whose goal is the extermination of the human race. The Cylons offer peace to the humans, which proves to be a ruse. With the aid of a human named [[Baltar (Battlestar Galactica)|Baltar]], the Cylons carry out a massive attack on the Twelve Colonies and on the Colonial Fleet of starships that protect them. These attacks devastate the Colonial Fleet, lay waste to the Colonies, and virtually destroy their populations. Scattered survivors flee into outer space aboard a ragtag array of available spaceships. Of the entire Colonial battle fleet, only the [[Battlestar Galactica (fictional spacecraft)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']], a gigantic battleship and spacecraft carrier, appears to have survived the Cylon attack. Under the leadership of Commander [[William Adama]], the ''Galactica'' and the pilots of \"Viper fighters\" lead a fugitive fleet of survivors in search of the fabled thirteenth colony known as [[Earth in fiction#Battlestar Galactica|Earth]].\n\n==Original series==\n\n===''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978)===\n{{Main|Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)}}\n[[Glen A. Larson]], the creator and [[executive producer]] of ''Battlestar Galactica'', claimed he had conceived of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' premise, which he called ''Adam's Ark'', during the late 1960s. As James E. Ford detailed in \u201c''Battlestar Galactica'' and Mormon Theology,\u201d a paper read at the Joint Conference of the American Culture and Popular Culture Associations on April 17, 1980 (and published as \u201cTheology in Prime Time Science Fiction: ''Battlestar Galactica'' and Mormon Doctrine,\u201d ''Journal of Popular Culture'' #17 [1983]: 83\u201387), the series incorporated many themes from [[Mormons|Mormon]] theology, such as [[Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|marriage]] for \"time and eternity\", a \"[[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|council of twelve]],\" a lost thirteenth tribe of humans, and a planet called [[Kobol]] (an anagram of [[Kolob]]), as Larson was a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1979/08/news-of-the-church/lds-scene \"LDS Scene,\"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]],'' August 1979, p. 80. In 1979, Larson received an award from the Associated Latter-day Media Artists.</ref><ref>Mormon Expression, Episode 135: Battlestar Galactica and Mormon Theology [http://mormonexpression.com/2011/05/17/135-battlestar-galactica-and-mormon-theology/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722021121/http://mormonexpression.com/2011/05/17/135-battlestar-galactica-and-mormon-theology/ |date=July 22, 2015 }}</ref> However, he was unable to find financial backing for his [[TV series]] for a number of years. ''Battlestar Galactica'' was finally produced in the wake of the success of the 1977 film [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']]. The original Cylons of Battlestar Galactica, robotic antagonists bent on destroying all humankind, owe much to [[Fred Saberhagen]]'s [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|berserker]] stories, including Saberhagen's fictional race The Builders whose \"sliding single red eye\" became the signature design element for the Cylons.\n\nLarson had envisioned ''Battlestar Galactica'' as a series of [[television film|made-for-TV movies]] (a three-hour [[television pilot|pilot program]] and two two-hour episodes) for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). A shortened version of the three-hour pilot, ''[[Saga of a Star World]]'', was screened in Canadian theaters (before the TV series was [[broadcasting|telecast]]) and in American, European and Australian theaters later on. Instead of two additional TV movies, ABC decided to commission a weekly TV series of one-hour episodes.\n\nIn 1979 at the sixth annual [[People's Choice Awards]], the TV series won in the category of \"Best New TV Drama Series\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=1979 |title=People's Choice Awards Past Winners: 1979 |publisher=pcavote.com |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2009  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102023849/http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=1979 |archivedate=January 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe first episode of the TV series (the long pilot TV movie) was broadcast on September 17, 1978. However, about 30 minutes before the end, that broadcast was interrupted by the announcement of the signing of the Egyptian\u2013Israeli [[Camp David Accords]]. After the interruption (which was nearly an hour in length), the episode picked back up where it left off.\n\nDuring the eight months after the pilot's first broadcast, 17 original episodes of the series were made (five of them two-part shows), equivalent to a standard 24-episode TV season. Citing declining ratings and cost overruns, ABC canceled ''Battlestar Galactica'' in April 1979. Its final episode \"[[The Hand of God (1978 Battlestar Galactica)|The Hand of God]]\" was telecast on April 29, 1979.\n{{further|List of Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series) and Galactica 1980 episodes{{!}}List of ''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978 TV series) and ''Galactica 1980'' episodes}}\n\n===''Galactica 1980''===\n{{Main|Galactica 1980}}\n\nDuring the autumn of 1979, ABC executives met with ''Battlestar Galactica''{{'}}s creator Glen Larson to consider restarting the series. A suitable concept was needed to draw viewers, and it was decided that the arrival of the Colonial Fleet at present-day Earth would be the storyline. A new [[TV movie]] called  ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' was produced. Again, it was decided this new version of ''Battlestar Galactica'' would be made into a weekly TV series. Despite the early success of the premiere, this program failed to achieve the popularity of the original series, and it was canceled after just ten episodes.\n\nIn this 1980 sequel series, the Colonial fleet finds the Earth, and then it covertly protects it from the Cylons. This series was a quick failure due to its low budget (e.g., recycling footage from the 1974 [[Universal Studios]] movie [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']] during a [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] attack sequence), widely panned writing, and ill-chosen time slot (Sunday evenings, a time generally reserved for family-oriented programming and, more specifically, also for the ''[[60 Minutes]]'' newsmagazine program). The TV series also had to adhere to strict content restrictions such as limiting the number of acts of violence and being required to shoehorn educational content into the script and dialogue.\n\nTo cut costs, the show was set mostly on the contemporary Earth, to the great dismay of fans. Another factor for fan apathy was the nearly complete recasting of the original series: [[Lorne Greene]] reprised his role as Adama (working unpaid),{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Herb Jefferson, Jr.]] played \"Colonel\" Boomer in about half of the episodes (with little screentime), and [[Dirk Benedict]] as Starbuck for one episode (the abrupt final episode, though his character was to have also appeared in the unfilmed episode \"Wheel of Fire\", which was a semi-sequel to \"The Return of Starbuck\"). [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]] (Apollo in the original series) was sent a script for ''Galactica 1980'', but he turned it down since he was not sure what his part in the series would be now that all the characters had changed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galactica.tv/battlestar-galactica-1978---interviews/richard-hatch-galactica.tv-interview.html |title=Richard Hatch GALACTICA.TV interview |author=Mike Egnor |publisher=www.galactica.tv |date=December 30, 2008 |accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome [[television syndication|TV syndication]] packages for ''Battlestar Galactica'' incorporate the episodes of this series.\n\n===Cinema releases===\nBesides a re-edited version of the pilot, released in Canada, Europe, parts of Latin America, and, following the broadcast of the series, in the U.S., two other ''Battlestar Galactica'' feature films were released in cinemas.

Comics]] published a 23-issue comic book series based upon the show between 1978 and 1981. Walt Simonson, who later wrote and drew ''Thor'' and had a long stint on Marvel's ''Star Wars'' comic, was the artist for the series at its conclusion. Other comics have since been published by [[Maximum Press]], Grandreams, ''[[Look-in]]'' magazine, Realm Press, and [[Dynamite Comics]].\n\n[[Dynamite Entertainment]] was the last company to publish comic books featuring both the classic and reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'' series. They also released a 4-issue ''Galactica 1980'' comic miniseries written by [[Marc Guggenheim]]. The limited miniseries was a re-imagining of the original series but at the end featured a second, smaller ''Battlestar'' (replacing the original which was destroyed) also named ''Galactica'' but strongly resembling the ship seen in the reimagined Sci-Fi Channel series.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Books==\nBoth the original and the reimagined series have had books published about the series, academically oriented analysis, novelizations, and new works based on the characters.\n\n===Original series books===\nThese ''Battlestar Galactica'' softcover novelisations were written by [[Glen A.

Larson]]. The franchise began with the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original television series]] in 1978 and was followed by a short-run sequel series (''[[Galactica 1980]]''), a line of book adaptations, original novels, comic books, a board game, and video games. A re-imagined version of ''Battlestar Galactica'' aired as a [[Battlestar Galactica (miniseries)|two-part, three-hour miniseries]] developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[David Eick]] in 2003. That miniseries led to a [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|weekly television series]], which aired until 2009. A prequel series, ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'', aired in 2010.\n\nAll ''Battlestar Galactica'' productions share the premise that in a distant part of the universe, a human civilization has extended to a group of planets known as the Twelve Colonies, to which they have migrated from their ancestral homeworld of [[Kobol]]. The Twelve Colonies have been engaged in a lengthy war with a cybernetic race known as the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]], whose goal is the extermination of the human race. The Cylons offer peace to the humans, which proves to be a ruse. With the aid of a human named [[Baltar (Battlestar Galactica)|Baltar]], the Cylons carry out a massive attack on the Twelve Colonies and on the Colonial Fleet of starships that protect them. These attacks devastate the Colonial Fleet, lay waste to the Colonies, and virtually destroy their populations. Scattered survivors flee into outer space aboard a ragtag array of available spaceships. Of the entire Colonial battle fleet, only the [[Battlestar Galactica (fictional spacecraft)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']], a gigantic battleship and spacecraft carrier, appears to have survived the Cylon attack. Under the leadership of Commander [[William Adama]], the ''Galactica'' and the pilots of \"Viper fighters\" lead a fugitive fleet of survivors in search of the fabled thirteenth colony known as [[Earth in fiction#Battlestar Galactica|Earth]].\n\n==Original series==\n\n===''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978)===\n{{Main|Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)}}\n[[Glen A.

The original Cylons of Battlestar Galactica, robotic antagonists bent on destroying all humankind, owe much to [[Fred Saberhagen]]'s [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|berserker]] stories, including Saberhagen's fictional race The Builders whose \"sliding single red eye\" became the signature design element for the Cylons.\n\nLarson had envisioned ''Battlestar Galactica'' as a series of [[television film|made-for-TV movies]] (a three-hour [[television pilot|pilot program]] and two two-hour episodes) for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). A shortened version of the three-hour pilot, ''[[Saga of a Star World]]'', was screened in Canadian theaters (before the TV series was [[broadcasting|telecast]]) and in American, European and Australian theaters later on. Instead of two additional TV movies, ABC decided to commission a weekly TV series of one-hour episodes.\n\nIn 1979 at the sixth annual [[People's Choice Awards]], the TV series won in the category of \"Best New TV Drama Series\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=1979 |title=People's Choice Awards Past Winners: 1979 |publisher=pcavote.com |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2009  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102023849/http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=1979 |archivedate=January 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe first episode of the TV series (the long pilot TV movie) was broadcast on September 17, 1978. However, about 30 minutes before the end, that broadcast was interrupted by the announcement of the signing of the Egyptian\u2013Israeli [[Camp David Accords]]. After the interruption (which was nearly an hour in length), the episode picked back up where it left off.\n\nDuring the eight months after the pilot's first broadcast, 17 original episodes of the series were made (five of them two-part shows), equivalent to a standard 24-episode TV season. Citing declining ratings and cost overruns, ABC canceled ''Battlestar Galactica'' in April 1979. Its final episode \"[[The Hand of God (1978 Battlestar Galactica)|The Hand of God]]\" was telecast on April 29, 1979.\n{{further|List of Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series) and Galactica 1980 episodes{{!}}List of ''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978 TV series) and ''Galactica 1980'' episodes}}\n\n===''Galactica 1980''===\n{{Main|Galactica 1980}}\n\nDuring the autumn of 1979, ABC executives met with ''Battlestar Galactica''{{'}}s creator Glen Larson to consider restarting the series. A suitable concept was needed to draw viewers, and it was decided that the arrival of the Colonial Fleet at present-day Earth would be the storyline. A new [[TV movie]] called  ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' was produced. Again, it was decided this new version of ''Battlestar Galactica'' would be made into a weekly TV series. Despite the early success of the premiere, this program failed to achieve the popularity of the original series, and it was canceled after just ten episodes.\n\nIn this 1980 sequel series, the Colonial fleet finds the Earth, and then it covertly protects it from the Cylons. This series was a quick failure due to its low budget (e.g., recycling footage from the 1974 [[Universal Studios]] movie [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']] during a [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] attack sequence), widely panned writing, and ill-chosen time slot (Sunday evenings, a time generally reserved for family-oriented programming and, more specifically, also for the ''[[60 Minutes]]'' newsmagazine program). The TV series also had to adhere to strict content restrictions such as limiting the number of acts of violence and being required to shoehorn educational content into the script and dialogue.\n\nTo cut costs, the show was set mostly on the contemporary Earth, to the great dismay of fans. Another factor for fan apathy was the nearly complete recasting of the original series: [[Lorne Greene]] reprised his role as Adama (working unpaid),{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Herb Jefferson, Jr.]] played \"Colonel\" Boomer in about half of the episodes (with little screentime), and [[Dirk Benedict]] as Starbuck for one episode (the abrupt final episode, though his character was to have also appeared in the unfilmed episode \"Wheel of Fire\", which was a semi-sequel to \"The Return of Starbuck\"). [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]] (Apollo in the original series) was sent a script for ''Galactica 1980'', but he turned it down since he was not sure what his part in the series would be now that all the characters had changed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galactica.tv/battlestar-galactica-1978---interviews/richard-hatch-galactica.tv-interview.html |title=Richard Hatch GALACTICA.TV interview |author=Mike Egnor |publisher=www.galactica.tv |date=December 30, 2008 |accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome [[television syndication|TV syndication]] packages for ''Battlestar Galactica'' incorporate the episodes of this series.\n\n===Cinema releases===\nBesides a re-edited version of the pilot, released in Canada, Europe, parts of Latin America, and, following the broadcast of the series, in the U.S., two other ''Battlestar Galactica'' feature films were released in cinemas.

The caller called Commissioner Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Commissioner Miller and Victoria's  Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Commissioner Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on the 15 April 1986. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria | St. Albans]] where he had carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of[[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided the house of an associate known to both Reed and the Minogue brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria |Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. The associate; Karl Zelinka had no criminal record, but was known to Reed and the Minogue brothers. Under police questioning, Zelinka denied that about his involvement in the bombing but admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive an Commodore identical to the Commodore used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. The associate also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney before the bombing with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue Brothers filling up a small  trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from the associate's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at Zelinka's home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor was well known to police, Taylor's first criminal charge occurred in 1949 when he was 12 for the theft of fresh fish from a market. In the early 1960s, Taylor committed seven bank robberies and had escaped twice. He spent 17 years in [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years. Although Minogue thus became eligible for parole in 2016, the Victorian Parliament has twice legislated to keep him in prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/new-laws-set-to-keep-russell-street-bomber-craig-minogue-behind-bars-for-life-20180723-p4zt6b.html|title=New laws set to keep Russell Street bomber Craig Minogue behind bars for life|last=Cunningham|first=Melissa|date=2018-07-23|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref> Minogue and Reed have both been recently charged with sexual assault offences that allegedly occurred just prior to the bombing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-05-23/russell-street-bomber-and-acquitted-man-charged-over-1980s-rapes/11143542|title=Police charge Russell Street bomber over cold case gang rape|last=Asher|first=Nicole|last2=staff|date=2019-05-23|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-05-31}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn 1995, police headquarters moved to the Victoria Police Centre with the old headquarters many years later redeveloped into an apartment complex.{{cn|date=August 2016}} Wylie, who was shot by Reed, later recovered from his wounds, but eventually left the police force; in July 2014, he died by suicide, aged 61.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/russell-street-bombing-claims-last-victim-20140718-3c6k4.html|title=Russell Street Bombing claims last victim|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2014-07-19|work=The Age|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n* ''[[Phoenix (TV series)|Phoenix]]'' \u2013 a 1992\u20131993 13-part Australian police drama television series loosely based on the Russell Street bombing\n* The case was covered by ''[[Casefile True Crime Podcast]]'' on 2 and 9 July 2016.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Explosions in 1986]]\n[[Category:March 1986 events in Oceania]]\n[[Category:History of Melbourne]]\n[[Category:1986 crimes in Australia]]\n[[Category:Murder in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Car and truck bombings in Australia]]\n[[Category:Organised crime events in Australia]]\n[[Category:Attacks on police stations]]\n[[Category:1980s in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:1980s murders in Australia]]\n[[Category:1986 murders in Oceania]]\n[[Category:Terrorist incidents in Australia in the 1980s]]\n[[Category:Terrorist incidents in Oceania in 1986]]\n[[Category:Murdered Australian police officers]]\n", "name_user": "Jpts1107", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInvestigations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Street_bombing"}

It developed from several local independent concerns and was incorporated in 1893. It was jointly owned by the [[Midland Railway]] and the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]], and those companies had long sponsored and operated the predecessor companies.\n\nThe area directly served was agricultural and sparsely populated, but seaside holidays had developed and the M&GNJR ran many long-distance express trains to and from the territory of the parent companies, as well as summer local trains for holidaymakers. It had the longest mileage of any joint railway in the United Kingdom.<ref name = casserley>{{cite book| first=H.C.| last=Casserley| title=Britain's Joint Lines| publisher=Ian Allan| location=London| year=1968| isbn=0-7110-0024-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAfter 1945 the profitability of the network declined steeply, worsened by the seasonality of the business. It was duplicated by other lines and the decision was taken to close it. Most of the network closed in 1959, although some limited sections continued in use. Only a short section near [[Sheringham]] is in commercial use today, but the [[North Norfolk Railway]] is active as a heritage line.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark>{{cite book| first=Ronald H.| last=Clark| title=A Short History of the Midland & Great Northern Joint Railway| publisher=Goose and Son| location=Norwich| year=1967 |ref=harv }}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes>{{cite book| first=John| last=Rhodes| title=The Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway| publisher=Ian Allan Ltd| year=1982| isbn=0-7110-1145-1 |ref=harv }}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==First railways==\nThe area eventually served by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, taken as south Lincolnshire and north Norfolk, was late to be supplied with railway connections. The Great Northern Railway, running north through [[Huntingdon]], [[Peterborough]] and on to [[Grantham]], so forming the western edge of the area, was not authorised until 1846 and not opened until 1848 between Peterborough and [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]. The [[Eastern Counties Railway]], authorised in 1836, aspired to reach Norwich and [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], but ran out of money and stopped short.\n\nIn frustration local people obtained Parliamentary authority for the [[Yarmouth & Norwich Railway|Yarmouth and Norwich Railway]] in 1842. Running via [[Reedham, Norfolk|Reedham]] it opened to the public on 1 May 1844. In 1845 the [[Railway Mania]] was under way, and a myriad of railway schemes was put before Parliament. Many of these foundered there, or were authorised but failed to generate investors' commitment.\n\nBy 1850 the Eastern Counties Railway had recovered from its financial difficulties of 1836 and had connected practically every town of importance in [[East Anglia]] into its system. For some years the Eastern Counties Railway had successfully resisted the promotion of independent railways in its area but this could not continue indefinitely, and some local lines began to obtain authorisation.\n\nThe ''East Anglian Railways'' company was an amalgamation of three earlier companies, the [[Lynn and Dereham Railway]], the Lynn and Ely Railway and the Ely and Huntingdon Railway. The company became bankrupt early in 1851 and the Great Northern Railway, operating the [[East Coast Main Line]] at Peterborough, leased the line. Using running powers between its line at Peterborough and [[March, Cambridgeshire|March]] over the Eastern Counties Railway, it intended to connect to [[King's Lynn|Lynn]] via the [[Wisbech]] line of the East Anglian Railway. However the powers acquired from Parliament did not include a short section between the two companies' stations at Wisbech, and the scheme foundered. The GNR sold the line on to the Eastern Counties Railway in 1852.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = Gordon>{{cite book| first=D.I.| last=Gordon| title=A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 5: The Eastern Counties| publisher=David & Charles| location=Newton Abbot| year=1977| isbn=0-7153-7431-1}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = moffat>{{cite book| first=High| last=Moffat| title=East Anglia's First Railways| publisher=Terence Dalton Limited| location=Lavenham| year=1987| isbn=0-86138-038-X}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe financial performance of the Eastern Counties Railway declined over the years and in 1862 it was absorbed into the new [[Great Eastern Railway]] Company.\n\n==Constituents of the M&GNJR==\n[[File:M&GN West.png|thumb|300px|The western section of the later M&GNJR]]The ultimate formation of the M&GNJR resulted from the fusion of numerous local schemes, though they did not at first aspire to form a connected railway.\n\n===Norwich and Spalding Railway===\nOn 4 August 1853 the ''Norwich and Spalding Railway'' obtained its Act for a line from [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]] to [[Sutton Bridge]], and from there to Wisbech. Notwithstanding the Company's title, reaching [[Norwich]] was an (unfulfilled) aspiration for later rather than an immediate intention. The Act stipulated that the other parts of the proposed Norwich and Spalding system could not be opened unless genuine progress was being made with the Wisbech connection.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn fact at this time the money market was particularly difficult, partly because of the [[Crimean War]], and the Company was unable to attract enough investment. It only managed to build from Spalding to [[Holbeach]], {{frac|7|1|2}} miles, opening to Holbeach for goods on 9 August 1858 and for passengers on 15 November 1858. The Wisbech stipulation appears to have been overlooked for the time being.\n\nThe line connected with the Great Northern Railway at Spalding and the GNR agreed to work the line for three years. There were four trains daily except Sundays, with one extra on Tuesdays.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[File:M&GN East.png|thumb|300px|The eastern section of the later M&GNJR]]The company obtained a further authorising Act to extend from Holbeach to Sutton Bridge, as the earlier powers had expired. Wisbech was omitted this time, but the Act stipulated that no dividend might be declared unless the company proceeded with the promotion of the Wisbech line in Parliament. This was attempted in 1860 but rejected in Parliament, and again in 1862 and 1863. The GNR agreed to extend the working arrangement to ten years from 1 November 1861 for 50% of receipts and to carry out some permanent way improvements on the original section. The Sutton Bridge station was on the site of the later goods station, west of the [[River Nene]]. The extension to Holbeach was completed and opened on 1 July 1862.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Peterborough, Wisbeach and Sutton Bridge===\nThe line connecting Wisbech{{refn|group=note|The spelling was Wisbeach until 1877.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981|page=19}}}} to Sutton Bridge was considered important because Sutton Bridge was an important inland port. Wisbech would have been reached by a southward branch of the Norwich and Spalding Railway, but now an alternative means of making the connection was brought forward. On 28 July 1863 the authorising Act for the Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton Bridge Railway was passed. Capital was to be \u00a3180,000. The Eastern Counties Railway had just been transformed into the Great Eastern Railway, and powers were to be sought by the PW&SBR to connect to the GER line at Wisbech. The Norwich and Spalding Railway was given running powers between Sutton Bridge and Wisbech. It was the Midland Railway, not the GNR, that secured the contract for operating the new railway for 50% of receipts.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway===\nThe next section of the future M&GNJR to be built was the ''Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway'', which was authorised on 6 August 1861 with capital of \u00a3100,000.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}} It was to connect with the Eastern Counties Railway (soon to be GER) at South Lynn.

This line was to make an end-on junction at [[Bourne, Lincolnshire|Bourne]] with an offshoot of the Great Northern Railway, the ''Bourne and Essendine Railway''. The line was opened on 1 August 1866. It ran through practically unpopulated terrain. The GNR worked the line.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Rivalry between the GNR and the GER==\nThe Great Eastern Railway was formed on 7 August 1862, from the Eastern Counties Railway and other concerns. The GER made it clear, not least by bitter Parliamentary struggles, to get authorisation for its own line or for running powers to get to [[Doncaster]]. Considerable quantities of coal were being brought south from the [[South Yorkshire Coalfield]] by the GNR, and the GER sought to take a share of the traffic. Fearing that this might happen, suddenly giving the GER a monopoly of the coal traffic to East Anglia, the GNR started to sponsor friendly railways in the area itself.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==PB&SBR extending to Wisbech==\nThe ''Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton Bridge Railway'' now in 1864 got authorisation to make a connecting line at Wisbech to the GER line, and to the harbour. The connection to the GER was in fact not made. On 1 August 1866 its main line opened for traffic. At Peterborough it started from the Midland Railway lines, on the west side of the GNR main line, and crossed both the Midland and GNR track by a bridge. The line was 27 miles in length, to a junction at Sutton Bridge. The Midland Railway worked the trains, working to and from the GER station at Peterborough and calling at the GNR station en route. (Those stations were later called [[Peterborough East railway station|Peterborough East]] and [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough North]] respectively.){{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Midland and Eastern Railway==\n[[File:Spalding1866.png|thumb|300px|Spalding and Sutton Bridge railways in 1866]]The Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway and the Spalding and Bourne Railway amalgamated to form the ''Midland and Eastern Railway'' in 1866; the intention was to push westward to Saxby and join the Midland Railway there. This plan was opposed by the Great Northern Railway and the compromise was that the scheme was dropped, but that the Midland Railway was given running powers from over two GNR-sponsored lines: from Bourne to [[Essendine]], and (by reversing there) from Essendine to [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]]; this was not a direct or fast route. The arrangement was agreed, and ratified by the Midland and Eastern Railway Act of 23 July 1866.<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}} The Midland and Eastern Railway was operated by the GNR and the Midland Railway jointly, authorised by Act of 1867.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe Midland and Eastern Railway leased the Norwich and Spalding line, but the N&SR remained nominally independent (until 1 July 1877).<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}} It needed to go to Parliament to plead that it had, in good faith, tried to make the Sutton to Wisbech line, but had been prevented; and that the line had in fact been built by the PB&SBR; this was accepted and the M&SR was released from the prohibition on declaring a dividend. The Midland and Eastern Railway now effectively controlled the whole of the western section of the future M&GNJR, except for the Peterborough to Sutton Bridge line, which was still controlled by the Midland Railway.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe Midland and Eastern was jointly owned by the GNR and the Midland Railway, but it operated more or less independently. The Joint Committee did not meet between 1867 and 1880; trains of the two owning companies ran their own trains on the lines. In this period the network was referred to as the ''Bourne and Lynn Joint Railway''.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==GN and GE Joint Line==\nFor several years the Great Eastern Railway had been trying to get access to northern districts, and had been frustrated by the Great Northern Railway's opposition. Nevertheless, the GER repeatedly presented bills for such lines, and the GNR calculated that it was only a matter of time until it was successful. This policy came to fruition in April 1878 during parliamentary hearings on a GER Bill, and negotiations were set in place to establish what became the ''GN and GE Joint Line'', forming a through route from Doncaster to March.\n\nThe GNR and the Midland Railway had hitherto dominated the southward flow of [[Nottinghamshire]] and Yorkshire coal, and saw that the dominance was vulnerable. This led the GNR and the MR to look favourably at further development of the Bourne and Lynn Joint Railway (Midland and Eastern Railway).{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Sutton Dock failure==\nIn 1875 Parliamentary sanction was obtained by an independent shipping company to develop [[Sutton Bridge#Dock|Sutton Dock]]. [[Wisbech]] had traditionally been used as an inland port, but a Sutton Dock, connected to the railway network, could be advantageous, saving part of the difficult navigation up the [[River Nene]]. The GNR subscribed \u00a320,000, calculating that this could be an export point for coal. The dock opened on 14 May 1881, and a short branch railway had been constructed to serve it. The day after the opening it was observed that the lock gates were not watertight, and in fact a general failure of the wall of the dock took place. Ships that had entered the dock were got away, but repairs to the dock were said to be impracticable, and the dock was not used again; the GNR had by then expended \u00a355,000 on an unusable dock system.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Great Yarmouth and Stalham Light Railway==\n[[File:Lynn-rlies-1879.png|thumb|300px|Lynn railays in 1879]]Further east it was not until 1876 that the first railway section of the future M&GNJR was approved: the ''Great Yarmouth and Stalham Light Railway''<ref group = note>This was before the era of the Light Railways Act, 1896, which obviated the securing of an Act of Parliament in some circumstances.</ref> was authorised on 27 June 1876;{{refn|group=note|Clark gives exhaustive details of enactment dates.{{sfn|Clark|1967|p=13}} Wrottesley gives 26 July 1876.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981|page=34}}}} capital was \u00a398,000. The line would run north-west for 16 miles; the Yarmouth terminal, later to be known as Yarmouth Beach, was well situated for holidaymakers, but at this stage there was no connection to other railways. The first section, to Ormesby, was opened on 7 August 1877.\n\nFrom Ormesby to [[Hemsby]] opened on 16 May 1878, but there was a legal argument about a level crossing at Hemsby, and the next section to [[Martham]] opened from a temporary station north of the level crossing, on 15 July 1878. A temporary station south of the crossing was used from October. The legal position was resolved in Parliament in July 1879 and the permanent Hemsby station opened, and the two temporary stations closed.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, on 27 May 1878 the company got powers to extend to [[North Walsham]], and to change its name to the ''Yarmouth and North Norfolk Light Railway'', with additional capital of \u00a360,000.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}} Its status as a light railway was designed to prevent the Great Eastern Railway from acquiring running powers over the line.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}} Successive openings took place: to [[Catfield]] on 17 January 1880 and on to [[Stalham]] on 3 July 1880.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Lynn and Fakenham Railway==\n[[File:Lynn-rlies-1885.png|thumb|300px|Lynn railways in 1885]]On 13 July 1876 the ''Lynn and Fakenham Railway'' was authorised by Parliament, in the face of bitter opposition by GER interests. With capital of \u00a3150,000 it was to run from GER-influenced connections near King's Lynn to near [[Fakenham]]. Surprisingly the GER made no attempt to take control of this line, in fact making obstructions to the construction process. It was opened to [[Great Massingham|Massingham]] on 16 August 1879, extending to Fakenham on 16 August 1880.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = casserley/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nOn 12 August 1880 the Lynn and Fakenham got approval to extend to Norwich, creating a much sought-after independent line to the city. The line was to pass through [[Melton Constable]], and from that place there was to be a branch to [[Blakeney, Norfolk|Blakeney]] Harbour. On 11 August 1881 the Lynn and Fakenham and the Yarmouth and North Norfolk companies together managed at last to get powers to build from [[Melton Constable]] to North Walsham, which would connect their systems. In the same Act the Lynn and Fakenham got powers to build from [[Kelling]] to [[Cromer]] (not actually built), and the Yarmouth and North Norfolk was converted from a light railway to a full system, avoiding the speed and weight restrictions imposed by light railway status. The L&FR opened from Fakenham to [[Guestwick]] on 19 January 1882, and from there to [[Lenwade]] on 1 July 1882. The final section to Norwich was opened on 2 December 1882. The Norwich station was named [[Norwich City railway station|Norwich City]] from the outset. Melton to North Walsham was opened on 5 April 1883.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Yarmouth Union Railway==\nThis short line (1 mile 2 chains) was authorised on 26 August 1880, to extend from the Yarmouth and North Norfolk station at Yarmouth to the quay, where it became effectively a tramway, joining the GE tramway there (but not facilitating any through running between the two systems.) The capital was \u00a320,000. The YUR itself was slow to start work, but with the assistance of the Yarmouth and North Norfolk the work was pushed forward and completed on 15 May 1882.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Amalgamation: the Eastern and Midlands Railway==\nNow the many railway companies that were independent of the Great Eastern Railway saw that amalgamation with one another was desirable. On 18 August 1882 the ''Eastern and Midlands Railway'' Act was passed, which arranged that on the first day of 1883 the Eastern and Midlands Railway<ref group = note>Midlands as opposed to Midland appears to be correct. Wrottesley uses Midlands consistently, as does Casserley on page 16, and Burgess in several places, and Carter on page 453. Awdry uses Midlands, page 125. Hopwood uses it However Rhodes uses Midland on page 12. Clark uses both in quick succession, quoting titles of Acts: Midlands on page 21; both spellings on page 22; Midland on page 23.</ref> was created by amalgamating the Lynn and Fakenham Railway, the Yarmouth and North Norfolk, and the Yarmouth Union Railway. Shares generally were transferred to E&MR stock, but some preference shareholders retained their rights. By the same Act a second stage arranged that the E&MR took over the Midland and Eastern Railway on 1 July 1883. The MR and GNR working arrangements were to continue on those affected routes, and the E&MR could only run trains on those section with the consent of those larger railways.<ref name = clark />{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = carter>{{cite book| first=E.F.| last=Carter| title=An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles| publisher=Cassell| location=London| year=1959}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = burgess>{{cite book| first=Neil| last=Burgess| title=Norfolk's Lost Railways| publisher=Stenlake Publishing Ltd| location=Catrine| year=2016| isbn=978-1-84033-7556}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe whole line from Bourne to Yarmouth was now under the control of the Eastern and Midlands Railway. The train service at this stage was \"lavish,\"{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}} with six trains daily on the Lynn to Melton section and seven on Melton to Norwich, with numerous short workings. On Sundays it was made possible to spend the day in Yarmouth, by running several trains throughout or connecting in to those trains.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Further openings==\nThe section from Melton to Holt was opened on 1 October 1884.\n\nKing's Lynn was an important regional centre and port, and the E&MR access to it was inconvenient, involving (from the east) reversal at King's Lynn GER station for through trains, and reliance on that company's grudging acquiescence. Thoughts had long harboured the intention of creating an independent through route and on 2 November 1885 the Lynn Loop was opened for goods traffic; passenger service followed on 1 January 1886. The line ran south of Lynn, connecting from South Lynn goods station to [[Bawsey]]. The former connection from Gaywood Road Junction, north of King's Lynn, to Bawsey was closed. The railways had referred to King's Lynn simply as \"Lynn\" but from this time \"Lynn Town\" was used instead.\n\nAfter a suspension of work, the Holt to Cromer section of line was completed by direct labour, and opened on 16 June 1887. A through Kings Cross to Cromer express started running in August 1887, and although the construction had been expensive, the boost to revenue from the new line was considerable. A second train was put on the following year, in the down direction consisting of coaches slipped at Peterborough from a GNR Manchester train. The time from Kings Cross to Cromer was typically {{frac|4|1|2}} hours, but the GER did Liverpool Street to Cromer in {{frac|3|1|2}} hours.\n\nAt this time the decision was taken not to go ahead with the Blakeney Harbour branch from Kelling.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nOn 20 June 1888 a new branch line from North Walsham to [[Mundesley]], a small seaside resort was authorised by Parliament.<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Relationships with the Midland and the GNR==\nFor some years there had been continuing friction between the E&MR (and its predecessors) and the Midland Railway over the routing for goods traffic. The E&MR contended that the Midland was obliged to route it to Norwich over the E&MR and not the GER, notwithstanding inferior transit times. The Midland repeatedly protested at Tribunals that no such obligation existed. Now at last a sudden rapprochement took place. A Bill was to be submitted to the 1888 session of Parliament to build a connecting line from the Midland Railway near [[Ashwell, Rutland|Ashwell]] (in the vicinity of [[Oakham]]) and Bourne. The E&MR was to build this with Midland financial help, and the following year the Midland would take over the entire western section. Traffic from the eastern section would be directed via the Midland.\n\nAt a stroke this would have cut the GNR out of much of the traffic, even though it had constantly been friendly and supportive of the E&MR when the Midland had treated it shabbily. This was \"extraordinary conduct\" by the E&MR. Mr R A Read was a director, friendly to the Midland but prone to \"rash and elaborate schemes\", and Wrottesley attributes these schemes to him.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nNevertheless, the new line was sanctioned on 28 June 1888, although a junction to the GNR at [[Little Bytham]] was inserted to mollify the GNR.<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn the months following the passage of the Act, wiser counsels prevailed, and the E&MR, Midland and GNR boards negotiated a more congenial arrangement. The Midland and GNR would become joint owners of the western section; the eastern section would be unaffected for the time being. The route of the Bourne connecting line to the Midland would be varied, to meet the Midland at Saxby; the connection to the GNR main line at Little Bytham would be retained; and the connecting line west of that point would be Midland property, not E&MR. Ordinary shareholders in the E&MR would get \u00a347 for every \u00a3100 worth.{{refn|group=note|Wrottesley does not make it clear whether these are face value or market prices.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981|p=65}}}} A joint committee met at Kings Cross on 5 March 1889; it was a Midland and Great Northern Joint Committee, but at this stage no such designation was applied to the railway itself.\n\n==Eastern and Midlands Railway in chancery==\nAt the moment when the future seemed satisfactory, the E&MR was plunged into crisis. For some years it had been paying only modest dividends, and profitability had not always been adequate to support outgoings. A Mr W Jones had been hiring carriages to the company and for some time had not been paid. On 27 June 1889 he obtained judgement in his favour, but the company had no money to comply. At the time there was a system established since 1867 intended to keep a railway in operation for the convenience of the public in this situation: in effect to trade out of bankruptcy.\n\nThe \"rash\" Mr R A Read was appointed receiver, and at a shareholders' meeting in November 1889 it was stated that the company had liabilities of over \u00a3108,000 on working costs as well as \u00a371,645 on unpaid debenture interest and guaranteed share dividends. At a further meeting on 2 May 1890 the debenture holders accused Read of being to blame for getting the line into this situation, and demanded his removal, as well as a declaration that their debenture payments should rank equally with the railway operating costs, contrary to normal practice when a line was in receivership. Appeals were eventually dismissed and despite the legal and financial difficulties the railway kept running. It was not until 16 August 1892 that a scheme of financial arrangement was finalised.\n\n==Improvements despite the crisis==\nWhile this was continuing, some capital improvements took place, largely funded by the Midland Railway, Signalling was modernised, some additional crossing places were established as well as some short lengths of double track, and the Bourne to Saxby line continued to be built. On 25 July 1890 an avoiding line at Spalding was authorised, enabling through running past the south of the town. It opened for goods traffic on 5 June 1893, and on the same day the Saxby to Bourne section opened, also for goods only. On 28 June 1892 the Sutton Bridge was authorised to be renewed. It opened on 18 July 1897; it was a swing bridge, and carried road and rail traffic. There were tolls on the road part of the bridge, but these were given up in 1902.\n\nThe words ''Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway'' appeared in public timetables for the first time in 1890.\n\n==The M&GNJR is formed==\n[[File:Cromer-1906.png|thumb|300px|Cromer railways in 1906]]The 1889 arrangement whereby the Midland and GNR jointly took over E&MR lines applied only to the western section. Now in 1891 the two larger companies indicated that they wished to acquire the eastern section too. This was agreed in October 1892, and a Bill was submitted to the 1893 session of Parliament. The consideration was \u00a31.2 million of Midland and GNR 3% rent stock, although there were complicated provisions for preference and debenture shareholders. Both eastern and western sections transferred to the M&GNJR.\n\nWith only minor interference from the GER, the new arrangement passed in Parliament on 9 June 1893: the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway would become an incorporated entity (rather than just a committee delegated by the two principals). 113 miles of railway were involved,{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = Maxwell>{{cite magazine| first=Alexander| last=Maxwell| title=The Midland and Great Northern Railway : I: Its Traffic| magazine=Railway Magazine| date=September 1936}}</ref><ref name = hopwood>{{cite magazine| first=H.L.| last=Hopwood| title=The Midland and Great Northern Railway| magazine=Railway Magazine| date=August 1908}}</ref> so that the M&GNJR network was the longest joint railway in the United Kingdom, by mileage.<ref name = casserley/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Saxby and the Spalding avoiding line opened to passengers==\nOn 1 May 1894 the Bourne to Saxby line was opened to passengers, with additional platforms at Saxby. The formation was made for a southward connecting curve there, but track was never laid on it. The boundary with the Joint Line was at Little Bytham as planned, and the formation of the connection to the GNR was also made, and here too track was never laid on it. the Spalding avoiding line was opened to passenger traffic on the same day, 1 May 1894.\n\n==Mundesley to Cromer==\nAn Act of 7 August 1896 authorised the M&GJR to build on from Mundesley (not yet open) to Cromer, passing south of the town and curving back to approach it from the west.\n\n==The Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway==\nBoth the GER and the M&GNJR wanted to build a direct coastal line between Yarmouth and [[Lowestoft]]; the coastal area and Lowestoft itself were developing and offered the M&GNJR much potential. At the same time the GER wished to develop its access to Mundesley. Notwithstanding the friction between the two companies, a sensible accommodation was finalised on 18 March 1897 by which the GER Bill for the Yarmouth to Lowestoft line and a Mundesley to [[Happisburgh]] line would not be opposed by the M&GNJR. The M&GNJR would simply build a connecting curve from its line swinging round the north and west of Yarmouth and connecting in to the new GER line, and have running powers to Lowestoft. A [[Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway]] company would be created, and would control the Yarmouth to Lowestoft line (from Gorleston), the North Walsham to Mundesley line, Mundesley to Cromer, and Mundesley to Happisburgh.\n\nThe M&GNJR Bill for the curve at Yarmouth passed in Parliament on 6 August 1897, and the establishment of the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway was enacted on 25 July 1898.\n\nThe Lowestoft line opened on 13 July 1903.\n \n==Opening to Mundesley==\nThe Mundesley branch opened for goods traffic on 20 June 1898, and to passengers on 1 July 1898. As a joint line (from Antingham Road Junction) it had passenger trains of both companies: nine GER and seven M&GNJR daily. Goods services alternated month by month.\n\n==From 1900==\nIn the first years of the twentieth century the M&GNJR was doing well financially. Long distance expresses were run to the area from northern English cities as well as from London. Restaurant cars were put on, as well as workers trains for example bringing fish processing women from northern Scotland for seasonal work. Fish had become an important traffic since the N&SJR connection to Lowestoft had been established.\n\nAlthough some short sections of double track had been introduced, the majority of the network was single line, and this brought challenges to timekeeping at busy times. The Midland and GNR were operating trains on the line as of right, and the GER had acquired running powers over several sections and to some terminal stations. Conversely the M&GNJR needed the co-operation of the GER for some penetrating workings, at a time when competition with the GER was still intense.\n\nIn May 1906 the Committee approved introduction of the Whitaker tablet exchange apparatus. On single line sections, head-on collision due to signalman error was prevented by a tablet system: drivers of trains entering a single line section must be in possession of a physical token, a \"tablet\" specific to that section, and one only could only be released from control equipment in the one or other of the two signalboxes controlling entry to the section. When the train had passed through the section the tablet was placed in the apparatus at that end of the section, and only now another might be released either there or at the other end of the section. When non-stopping trains passed the tablet had to be passed from the signalman to the fireman of the train, and this could not be done at speed without injury.\n\nWhitaker devised mechanical apparatus to be placed at the lineside and on locomotives to enable the exchange at a higher speed.<ref name = sekon>{{cite magazine| first=G.A.| last=Sekon| title=How Expresses Exchange Trains Staffs and Tablets| magazine=Railway Magazine| date=October 1905}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]] many of the best long-distance express passenger trains were suspended for the duration; the M&GNJR took on considerable additional goods traffic during hostilities, and many of the workforce left for the armed forces. The company maintained an [[armoured train]], constructed by the [[LNWR]] at [[Crewe Works|Crewe]],  continuously in steam from early in 1915 in case of enemy invasion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pratt |first1=Edwin A. |title=British railways and the great war |volume=2|date=1921 |publisher=Selwyn & Blount |location=London |oclc=835846426 |page=|chapter=Armoured trains for coast defence}}</ref>\n \nAfter the armistice, government control of the railways continued, and much traffic in demobilised servicemen tested the capacity of the network. There was a general railway strike in the latter months of 1919, and a coal strike in 1921, both of which caused considerable damage to the M&GNJR. The national general strike took place in 1926.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Grouping of the railways==\nWartime control of the railways ended on 15 August 1921, and the Government passed the [[Railways Act 1921]], which had the effect of transferring most of the railways of Great Britain into one or other of four new large companies, in a process referred to as the \"grouping\". The Midland Railway was transferred to the new [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS) and the GNR and also the GER were transferred to the new [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER). The M&GNJR remained unchanged, of course now jointly owned by the LMS and LNER. The rivalry with the GER was naturally at an end. The change took place formally on 1 January 1923.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe long-distance express trains were reinstated progressively, and the LNER particularly emphasised Kings Cross to Cromer traffic.\n\nHolidays at the seaside increased in popularity very considerably after the war, and as well as trains to and from the area, local services for holidaymakers staying in the area were enhanced in the season.\n\nHowever road competition, both for goods and passengers, began to take a serious toll as roads were improved. at the same time a general depression in the agricultural sector harmed M&GNJR income.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Incorporation into the LNER===\nThe Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway had retained its identity at the grouping of the railways in 1923. In the mid-1930s there was good co-operation between the LMS and the LNER and in 1935 it was agreed that the LNER should manage the operational aspects of the M&GNJR system. This took effect from 1 October 1936.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}} The system consisted of {{convert|183|mi|km|adj=pre|route}}, of which 40% was double track.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==World War II and after==\nIn 1939 [[World War II]] started, and once again most long-distance expresses were suspended; staff were called up or volunteered in the services. However the focus of defence, evacuation of children, and later the [[Normandy landings|D-day landings]] was in the south, not the east. The war ended in 1945. The railways were run down during the war and the Government passed the [[Transport Act 1947]], so that the railways became nationalised at the beginning of 1948.\n\nThe long distance and holiday trains began to be restored, and holiday camp facilities became popular, and were served by the line.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Local closures==\nThe very low usage of some parts of the M&GNJR system after nationalisation could not be ignored, and some local closures started.\n\nOn 6 April 1953 the Cromer to Mundesley section was closed,<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nOn 21 September 1953 the Yarmouth Beach to Gorleston North section closed.<ref>Passengers No More Second Edition page 110</ref>\n\nCromer High was closed on 20 September 1954, services being concentrated on the M&GNJR station, Cromer Beach, which was extended and improved for the purpose.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nEye Green, Thorney and Wryde stations closed to passengers in 1957 and North Drove closed to passengers in 1958.\n\n==Diesel trains==\nDiesel multiple unit vehicles were introduced on the M&GNJR from 18 September 1955, gradually taking over the entire passenger service except the long-distance trains.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Total closure==\nIn May 1958 a report was finalised by British Railways. It concluded that the entirety of the M&GNJR was loss-making, and was largely duplicated by routes of the former GER. Complete closure of passenger services was proposed. Widespread closure of goods services too was contemplated, with only the Spalding to Sutton Bridge, Peterborough to Wisbech, South Lynn to Gayton Road, and Melton Constable to Norwich. The Melton to Cromer branch was to be unaffected by the proposals.\n\nThe scale of the closure aroused considerable opposition, mainly focussed on the reduction in amenity to communities, although there was also widespread apathy, reflected in poor turnouts at public meetings.\n\nAfter deliberation the Transport Users Consultative Committee issued its decision in November 1958, that the majority of the proposed closures should proceed. Retained sections were Spalding to Bourne for goods, Spalding to Sutton Bridge for goods. A new spur would be built at Murrow connecting the M&GN line with the GN&GE Joint line; the Peterborough to Wisbech line would be disconnected at the Peterborough end, and served via the Murrow curve from Whitemoor, at March. Wisbech too would be retained and served from Whitemoor via Murrow.\n\nFurther east the Melton Constable to Norwich line would remain open for goods trains, as would the South Lynn to Rudham line. Passenger trains would continue to operate between Melton Constable and Cromer, and between North Walsham and Mundesley. [[Great Yarmouth railway station|Yarmouth Vauxhall]] (former GER station) would be extended to handle the additional seasonal passenger traffic.\n\nThe closures took place after the last trains on Saturday 28 February 1959. There was much greater public attention to the running of the last passenger trains than there had been to attending the public meetings, but the closure was decisive.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nNotwithstanding the dire warnings of protesters, a substitute bus service operating from [[Melton Mowbray]] to Spalding following closely the route of the railway was almost completely lacking in patronage, and was soon given up.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==More closures==\nThe Melton Constable to Sheringham line had retained its passenger services for the time being; however that too closed to passengers after 4 April 1964.

A small number of diesel multiple unit services were run in the final years, alongside the very occasional incursions of early diesel locomotives.\n\nThe M&GN mainly used designs from the MR and GNR, but included in its stock some of the older E&M engines, often much rebuilt. The famous Beyer-Peacock engines survived in this way from the early 1880s to the mid-1930s. The best contemporary designs were acquired by the Joint in the 1893 \u2013 1901 period, but as there were no more modern engines forthcoming, the light [[0-6-0]]s and [[4-4-0]]s provided much of the motive power on the line until 1936. From then on the LNER tried various designs on the line, not necessarily bigger or even more recent than the Joint's own engines, but as the M&GN's engines were scrapped, newer engines such as the K2 [[2-6-0]]s and B12 [[4-6-0]]s became common. The ex-GER \"Claud Hamilton\" 4-4-0s provided the locomotive backbone of this later period.\n\nFrom the 1950s, [[LMS Ivatt 4MT|Ivatt 4MTs]] became the dominant motive power on the system, which achieved a higher degree of standardisation than any other part of British Railways\u2014more than 50 of these \"mucky ducks\" were allocated here. But there were other types still in use, and among them the line saw [[LMS Ivatt 2MT|Ivatt 2MTs]] and occasional [[BR standard class 4 2-6-0|Standard 4MT]] and LNER B1 and B17 types.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nBritish Railways' Eastern Region was an early adopter of diesel motive power and the M&GN lines were used by [[British Rail Class 31|Brush Type 2]] locomotives and several early DMU types including [[British Rail Class 101|Class 101]] and [[British Rail Class 105|Class 105s]]. A fleet of the latter was commissioned in the mid-1950s to take over all the long-distance locomotive-hauled passenger services, but the line's closure in 1959 saw them re-allocated (especially to the Great Northern suburban commuter workings out of King's Cross, for which they were particularly unsuitable).\nOne M&GN boiler from a Hudswell Clarke 4-4-0T survives, it is hoped this will be rebuilt as a static exhibit.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Badge and livery ==\n[[File:Norfolk Green.JPG|thumb|left|[[Stagecoach in Norfolk|Norfolk Green]] bus painted in the M&GN livery]]\n\nThe M&GN device consists of images derived from the [[Coat of arms|Coats of Arms]] of the four principal cities and towns it served: (clockwise from top left) Peterborough, Norwich, Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn.\n\nFor much of the company's life the locomotives were painted a light golden brown, often referred to by paintshop staff as \"autumn leaf\" or \"golden ochre\". From 1922 the goods engines were painted dark brown, followed by the rest of the locomotives in 1929. The LNER painted the survivors black. Most of the carriages were ex-GNR and were varnished teak, but some of the older stock and rebuilds were painted and grained to look like teak. Wagon stock was generally brown oxide, the same colour as the GNR used, until 1917 when general stock under the common user agreement began to be painted grey. The number of M&GN wagons declined during the 1920s, and were eventually bought by the parent companies in 1928, leaving only service stock, which was painted red oxide.

It developed from several local independent concerns and was incorporated in 1893. It was jointly owned by the [[Midland Railway]] and the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]], and those companies had long sponsored and operated the predecessor companies.\n\nThe area directly served was agricultural and sparsely populated, but seaside holidays had developed and the M&GNJR ran many long-distance express trains to and from the territory of the parent companies, as well as summer local trains for holidaymakers. It had the longest mileage of any joint railway in the United Kingdom.<ref name = casserley>{{cite book| first=H.C.| last=Casserley| title=Britain's Joint Lines| publisher=Ian Allan| location=London| year=1968| isbn=0-7110-0024-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAfter 1945 the profitability of the network declined steeply, worsened by the seasonality of the business. It was duplicated by other lines and the decision was taken to close it. Most of the network closed in 1959, although some limited sections continued in use. Only a short section near [[Sheringham]] is in commercial use today, but the [[North Norfolk Railway]] is active as a heritage line.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark>{{cite book| first=Ronald H.| last=Clark| title=A Short History of the Midland & Great Northern Joint Railway| publisher=Goose and Son| location=Norwich| year=1967 |ref=harv }}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes>{{cite book| first=John| last=Rhodes| title=The Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway| publisher=Ian Allan Ltd| year=1982| isbn=0-7110-1145-1 |ref=harv }}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==First railways==\nThe area eventually served by the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, taken as south Lincolnshire and north Norfolk, was late to be supplied with railway connections. The Great Northern Railway, running north through [[Huntingdon]], [[Peterborough]] and on to [[Grantham]], so forming the western edge of the area, was not authorised until 1846 and not opened until 1848 between Peterborough and [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]. The [[Eastern Counties Railway]], authorised in 1836, aspired to reach Norwich and [[Great Yarmouth|Yarmouth]], but ran out of money and stopped short.\n\nIn frustration local people obtained Parliamentary authority for the [[Yarmouth & Norwich Railway|Yarmouth and Norwich Railway]] in 1842. Running via [[Reedham, Norfolk|Reedham]] it opened to the public on 1 May 1844. In 1845 the [[Railway Mania]] was under way, and a myriad of railway schemes was put before Parliament. Many of these foundered there, or were authorised but failed to generate investors' commitment.\n\nBy 1850 the Eastern Counties Railway had recovered from its financial difficulties of 1836 and had connected practically every town of importance in [[East Anglia]] into its system. For some years the Eastern Counties Railway had successfully resisted the promotion of independent railways in its area but this could not continue indefinitely, and some local lines began to obtain authorisation.\n\nThe ''East Anglian Railways'' company was an amalgamation of three earlier companies, the [[Lynn and Dereham Railway]], the Lynn and Ely Railway and the Ely and Huntingdon Railway. The company became bankrupt early in 1851 and the Great Northern Railway, operating the [[East Coast Main Line]] at Peterborough, leased the line. Using running powers between its line at Peterborough and [[March, Cambridgeshire|March]] over the Eastern Counties Railway, it intended to connect to [[King's Lynn|Lynn]] via the [[Wisbech]] line of the East Anglian Railway. However the powers acquired from Parliament did not include a short section between the two companies' stations at Wisbech, and the scheme foundered. The GNR sold the line on to the Eastern Counties Railway in 1852.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = Gordon>{{cite book| first=D.I.| last=Gordon| title=A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 5: The Eastern Counties| publisher=David & Charles| location=Newton Abbot| year=1977| isbn=0-7153-7431-1}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = moffat>{{cite book| first=High| last=Moffat| title=East Anglia's First Railways| publisher=Terence Dalton Limited| location=Lavenham| year=1987| isbn=0-86138-038-X}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe financial performance of the Eastern Counties Railway declined over the years and in 1862 it was absorbed into the new [[Great Eastern Railway]] Company.\n\n==Constituents of the M&GNJR==\n[[File:M&GN West.png|thumb|The western section of the later M&GNJR]]The ultimate formation of the M&GNJR resulted from the fusion of numerous local schemes, though they did not at first aspire to form a connected railway.\n\n===Norwich and Spalding Railway===\nOn 4 August 1853 the ''Norwich and Spalding Railway'' obtained its Act for a line from [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]] to [[Sutton Bridge]], and from there to Wisbech. Notwithstanding the Company's title, reaching [[Norwich]] was an (unfulfilled) aspiration for later rather than an immediate intention. The Act stipulated that the other parts of the proposed Norwich and Spalding system could not be opened unless genuine progress was being made with the Wisbech connection.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn fact at this time the money market was particularly difficult, partly because of the [[Crimean War]], and the Company was unable to attract enough investment. It only managed to build from Spalding to [[Holbeach]], {{frac|7|1|2}} miles, opening to Holbeach for goods on 9 August 1858 and for passengers on 15 November 1858. The Wisbech stipulation appears to have been overlooked for the time being.\n\nThe line connected with the Great Northern Railway at Spalding and the GNR agreed to work the line for three years. There were four trains daily except Sundays, with one extra on Tuesdays.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n[[File:M&GN East.png|thumb|The eastern section of the later M&GNJR]]The company obtained a further authorising Act to extend from Holbeach to Sutton Bridge, as the earlier powers had expired. Wisbech was omitted this time, but the Act stipulated that no dividend might be declared unless the company proceeded with the promotion of the Wisbech line in Parliament. This was attempted in 1860 but rejected in Parliament, and again in 1862 and 1863. The GNR agreed to extend the working arrangement to ten years from 1 November 1861 for 50% of receipts and to carry out some permanent way improvements on the original section. The Sutton Bridge station was on the site of the later goods station, west of the [[River Nene]]. The extension to Holbeach was completed and opened on 1 July 1862.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Peterborough, Wisbeach and Sutton Bridge===\nThe line connecting Wisbech{{refn|group=note|The spelling was Wisbeach until 1877.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981|page=19}}}} to Sutton Bridge was considered important because Sutton Bridge was an important inland port. Wisbech would have been reached by a southward branch of the Norwich and Spalding Railway, but now an alternative means of making the connection was brought forward. On 28 July 1863 the authorising Act for the Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton Bridge Railway was passed. Capital was to be \u00a3180,000. The Eastern Counties Railway had just been transformed into the Great Eastern Railway, and powers were to be sought by the PW&SBR to connect to the GER line at Wisbech. The Norwich and Spalding Railway was given running powers between Sutton Bridge and Wisbech. It was the Midland Railway, not the GNR, that secured the contract for operating the new railway for 50% of receipts.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway===\nThe next section of the future M&GNJR to be built was the ''Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway'', which was authorised on 6 August 1861 with capital of \u00a3100,000.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}} It was to connect with the Eastern Counties Railway (soon to be GER) at South Lynn.

This line was to make an end-on junction at [[Bourne, Lincolnshire|Bourne]] with an offshoot of the Great Northern Railway, the ''Bourne and Essendine Railway''. The line was opened on 1 August 1866. It ran through practically unpopulated terrain. The GNR worked the line.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Rivalry between the GNR and the GER==\nThe Great Eastern Railway was formed on 7 August 1862, from the Eastern Counties Railway and other concerns. The GER made it clear, not least by bitter Parliamentary struggles, to get authorisation for its own line or for running powers to get to [[Doncaster]]. Considerable quantities of coal were being brought south from the [[South Yorkshire Coalfield]] by the GNR, and the GER sought to take a share of the traffic. Fearing that this might happen, suddenly giving the GER a monopoly of the coal traffic to East Anglia, the GNR started to sponsor friendly railways in the area itself.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==PB&SBR extending to Wisbech==\nThe ''Peterborough, Wisbech and Sutton Bridge Railway'' now in 1864 got authorisation to make a connecting line at Wisbech to the GER line, and to the harbour. The connection to the GER was in fact not made. On 1 August 1866 its main line opened for traffic. At Peterborough it started from the Midland Railway lines, on the west side of the GNR main line, and crossed both the Midland and GNR track by a bridge. The line was 27 miles in length, to a junction at Sutton Bridge. The Midland Railway worked the trains, working to and from the GER station at Peterborough and calling at the GNR station en route. (Those stations were later called [[Peterborough East railway station|Peterborough East]] and [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough North]] respectively.){{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Midland and Eastern Railway==\n[[File:Spalding1866.png|thumb|Spalding and Sutton Bridge railways in 1866]]The Lynn and Sutton Bridge Railway and the Spalding and Bourne Railway amalgamated to form the ''Midland and Eastern Railway'' in 1866; the intention was to push westward to Saxby and join the Midland Railway there. This plan was opposed by the Great Northern Railway and the compromise was that the scheme was dropped, but that the Midland Railway was given running powers from over two GNR-sponsored lines: from Bourne to [[Essendine]], and (by reversing there) from Essendine to [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]]; this was not a direct or fast route. The arrangement was agreed, and ratified by the Midland and Eastern Railway Act of 23 July 1866.<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}} The Midland and Eastern Railway was operated by the GNR and the Midland Railway jointly, authorised by Act of 1867.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe Midland and Eastern Railway leased the Norwich and Spalding line, but the N&SR remained nominally independent (until 1 July 1877).<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}} It needed to go to Parliament to plead that it had, in good faith, tried to make the Sutton to Wisbech line, but had been prevented; and that the line had in fact been built by the PB&SBR; this was accepted and the M&SR was released from the prohibition on declaring a dividend. The Midland and Eastern Railway now effectively controlled the whole of the western section of the future M&GNJR, except for the Peterborough to Sutton Bridge line, which was still controlled by the Midland Railway.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe Midland and Eastern was jointly owned by the GNR and the Midland Railway, but it operated more or less independently. The Joint Committee did not meet between 1867 and 1880; trains of the two owning companies ran their own trains on the lines. In this period the network was referred to as the ''Bourne and Lynn Joint Railway''.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==GN and GE Joint Line==\nFor several years the Great Eastern Railway had been trying to get access to northern districts, and had been frustrated by the Great Northern Railway's opposition. Nevertheless, the GER repeatedly presented bills for such lines, and the GNR calculated that it was only a matter of time until it was successful. This policy came to fruition in April 1878 during parliamentary hearings on a GER Bill, and negotiations were set in place to establish what became the ''GN and GE Joint Line'', forming a through route from Doncaster to March.\n\nThe GNR and the Midland Railway had hitherto dominated the southward flow of [[Nottinghamshire]] and Yorkshire coal, and saw that the dominance was vulnerable. This led the GNR and the MR to look favourably at further development of the Bourne and Lynn Joint Railway (Midland and Eastern Railway).{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Sutton Dock failure==\nIn 1875 Parliamentary sanction was obtained by an independent shipping company to develop [[Sutton Bridge#Dock|Sutton Dock]]. [[Wisbech]] had traditionally been used as an inland port, but a Sutton Dock, connected to the railway network, could be advantageous, saving part of the difficult navigation up the [[River Nene]]. The GNR subscribed \u00a320,000, calculating that this could be an export point for coal. The dock opened on 14 May 1881, and a short branch railway had been constructed to serve it. The day after the opening it was observed that the lock gates were not watertight, and in fact a general failure of the wall of the dock took place. Ships that had entered the dock were got away, but repairs to the dock were said to be impracticable, and the dock was not used again; the GNR had by then expended \u00a355,000 on an unusable dock system.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Great Yarmouth and Stalham Light Railway==\n[[File:Lynn-rlies-1879.png|thumb|Lynn railays in 1879]]Further east it was not until 1876 that the first railway section of the future M&GNJR was approved: the ''Great Yarmouth and Stalham Light Railway''<ref group = note>This was before the era of the Light Railways Act, 1896, which obviated the securing of an Act of Parliament in some circumstances.</ref> was authorised on 27 June 1876;{{refn|group=note|Clark gives exhaustive details of enactment dates.{{sfn|Clark|1967|p=13}} Wrottesley gives 26 July 1876.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981|page=34}}}} capital was \u00a398,000. The line would run north-west for 16 miles; the Yarmouth terminal, later to be known as Yarmouth Beach, was well situated for holidaymakers, but at this stage there was no connection to other railways. The first section, to Ormesby, was opened on 7 August 1877.\n\nFrom Ormesby to [[Hemsby]] opened on 16 May 1878, but there was a legal argument about a level crossing at Hemsby, and the next section to [[Martham]] opened from a temporary station north of the level crossing, on 15 July 1878. A temporary station south of the crossing was used from October. The legal position was resolved in Parliament in July 1879 and the permanent Hemsby station opened, and the two temporary stations closed.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, on 27 May 1878 the company got powers to extend to [[North Walsham]], and to change its name to the ''Yarmouth and North Norfolk Light Railway'', with additional capital of \u00a360,000.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}} Its status as a light railway was designed to prevent the Great Eastern Railway from acquiring running powers over the line.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}} Successive openings took place: to [[Catfield]] on 17 January 1880 and on to [[Stalham]] on 3 July 1880.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Lynn and Fakenham Railway==\n[[File:Lynn-rlies-1885.png|thumb|Lynn railways in 1885]]On 13 July 1876 the ''Lynn and Fakenham Railway'' was authorised by Parliament, in the face of bitter opposition by GER interests. With capital of \u00a3150,000 it was to run from GER-influenced connections near King's Lynn to near [[Fakenham]]. Surprisingly the GER made no attempt to take control of this line, in fact making obstructions to the construction process. It was opened to [[Great Massingham|Massingham]] on 16 August 1879, extending to Fakenham on 16 August 1880.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = casserley/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nOn 12 August 1880 the Lynn and Fakenham got approval to extend to Norwich, creating a much sought-after independent line to the city. The line was to pass through [[Melton Constable]], and from that place there was to be a branch to [[Blakeney, Norfolk|Blakeney]] Harbour. On 11 August 1881 the Lynn and Fakenham and the Yarmouth and North Norfolk companies together managed at last to get powers to build from [[Melton Constable]] to North Walsham, which would connect their systems. In the same Act the Lynn and Fakenham got powers to build from [[Kelling]] to [[Cromer]] (not actually built), and the Yarmouth and North Norfolk was converted from a light railway to a full system, avoiding the speed and weight restrictions imposed by light railway status. The L&FR opened from Fakenham to [[Guestwick]] on 19 January 1882, and from there to [[Lenwade]] on 1 July 1882. The final section to Norwich was opened on 2 December 1882. The Norwich station was named [[Norwich City railway station|Norwich City]] from the outset. Melton to North Walsham was opened on 5 April 1883.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Yarmouth Union Railway==\nThis short line (1 mile 2 chains) was authorised on 26 August 1880, to extend from the Yarmouth and North Norfolk station at Yarmouth to the quay, where it became effectively a tramway, joining the GE tramway there (but not facilitating any through running between the two systems.) The capital was \u00a320,000. The YUR itself was slow to start work, but with the assistance of the Yarmouth and North Norfolk the work was pushed forward and completed on 15 May 1882.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Amalgamation: the Eastern and Midlands Railway==\nNow the many railway companies that were independent of the Great Eastern Railway saw that amalgamation with one another was desirable.

Shares generally were transferred to E&MR stock, but some preference shareholders retained their rights. By the same Act a second stage arranged that the E&MR took over the Midland and Eastern Railway on 1 July 1883. The MR and GNR working arrangements were to continue on those affected routes, and the E&MR could only run trains on those section with the consent of those larger railways.<ref name = clark />{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = carter>{{cite book| first=E.F.| last=Carter| title=An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles| publisher=Cassell| location=London| year=1959}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = burgess>{{cite book| first=Neil| last=Burgess| title=Norfolk's Lost Railways| publisher=Stenlake Publishing Ltd| location=Catrine| year=2016| isbn=978-1-84033-7556}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe whole line from Bourne to Yarmouth was now under the control of the Eastern and Midlands Railway. The train service at this stage was \"lavish,\"{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}} with six trains daily on the Lynn to Melton section and seven on Melton to Norwich, with numerous short workings. On Sundays it was made possible to spend the day in Yarmouth, by running several trains throughout or connecting in to those trains.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Further openings==\nThe section from Melton to Holt was opened on 1 October 1884.\n\nKing's Lynn was an important regional centre and port, and the E&MR access to it was inconvenient, involving (from the east) reversal at King's Lynn GER station for through trains, and reliance on that company's grudging acquiescence. Thoughts had long harboured the intention of creating an independent through route and on 2 November 1885 the Lynn Loop was opened for goods traffic; passenger service followed on 1 January 1886. The line ran south of Lynn, connecting from South Lynn goods station to [[Bawsey]]. The former connection from Gaywood Road Junction, north of King's Lynn, to Bawsey was closed. The railways had referred to King's Lynn simply as \"Lynn\" but from this time \"Lynn Town\" was used instead.\n\nAfter a suspension of work, the Holt to Cromer section of line was completed by direct labour, and opened on 16 June 1887. A through Kings Cross to Cromer express started running in August 1887, and although the construction had been expensive, the boost to revenue from the new line was considerable. A second train was put on the following year, in the down direction consisting of coaches slipped at Peterborough from a GNR Manchester train. The time from Kings Cross to Cromer was typically {{frac|4|1|2}} hours, but the GER did Liverpool Street to Cromer in {{frac|3|1|2}} hours.\n\nAt this time the decision was taken not to go ahead with the Blakeney Harbour branch from Kelling.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nOn 20 June 1888 a new branch line from North Walsham to [[Mundesley]], a small seaside resort was authorised by Parliament.<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Relationships with the Midland and the GNR==\nFor some years there had been continuing friction between the E&MR (and its predecessors) and the Midland Railway over the routing for goods traffic. The E&MR contended that the Midland was obliged to route it to Norwich over the E&MR and not the GER, notwithstanding inferior transit times. The Midland repeatedly protested at Tribunals that no such obligation existed. Now at last a sudden rapprochement took place. A Bill was to be submitted to the 1888 session of Parliament to build a connecting line from the Midland Railway near [[Ashwell, Rutland|Ashwell]] (in the vicinity of [[Oakham]]) and Bourne. The E&MR was to build this with Midland financial help, and the following year the Midland would take over the entire western section. Traffic from the eastern section would be directed via the Midland.\n\nAt a stroke this would have cut the GNR out of much of the traffic, even though it had constantly been friendly and supportive of the E&MR when the Midland had treated it shabbily. This was \"extraordinary conduct\" by the E&MR. Mr R A Read was a director, friendly to the Midland but prone to \"rash and elaborate schemes\", and Wrottesley attributes these schemes to him.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nNevertheless, the new line was sanctioned on 28 June 1888, although a junction to the GNR at [[Little Bytham]] was inserted to mollify the GNR.<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn the months following the passage of the Act, wiser counsels prevailed, and the E&MR, Midland and GNR boards negotiated a more congenial arrangement. The Midland and GNR would become joint owners of the western section; the eastern section would be unaffected for the time being. The route of the Bourne connecting line to the Midland would be varied, to meet the Midland at Saxby; the connection to the GNR main line at Little Bytham would be retained; and the connecting line west of that point would be Midland property, not E&MR. Ordinary shareholders in the E&MR would get \u00a347 for every \u00a3100 worth.{{refn|group=note|Wrottesley does not make it clear whether these are face value or market prices.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981|p=65}}}} A joint committee met at Kings Cross on 5 March 1889; it was a Midland and Great Northern Joint Committee, but at this stage no such designation was applied to the railway itself.\n\n==Eastern and Midlands Railway in chancery==\nAt the moment when the future seemed satisfactory, the E&MR was plunged into crisis. For some years it had been paying only modest dividends, and profitability had not always been adequate to support outgoings. A Mr W Jones had been hiring carriages to the company and for some time had not been paid. On 27 June 1889 he obtained judgement in his favour, but the company had no money to comply. At the time there was a system established since 1867 intended to keep a railway in operation for the convenience of the public in this situation: in effect to trade out of bankruptcy.\n\nThe \"rash\" Mr R A Read was appointed receiver, and at a shareholders' meeting in November 1889 it was stated that the company had liabilities of over \u00a3108,000 on working costs as well as \u00a371,645 on unpaid debenture interest and guaranteed share dividends. At a further meeting on 2 May 1890 the debenture holders accused Read of being to blame for getting the line into this situation, and demanded his removal, as well as a declaration that their debenture payments should rank equally with the railway operating costs, contrary to normal practice when a line was in receivership. Appeals were eventually dismissed and despite the legal and financial difficulties the railway kept running. It was not until 16 August 1892 that a scheme of financial arrangement was finalised.\n\n==Improvements despite the crisis==\nWhile this was continuing, some capital improvements took place, largely funded by the Midland Railway, Signalling was modernised, some additional crossing places were established as well as some short lengths of double track, and the Bourne to Saxby line continued to be built. On 25 July 1890 an avoiding line at Spalding was authorised, enabling through running past the south of the town. It opened for goods traffic on 5 June 1893, and on the same day the Saxby to Bourne section opened, also for goods only. On 28 June 1892 the Sutton Bridge was authorised to be renewed. It opened on 18 July 1897; it was a swing bridge, and carried road and rail traffic. There were tolls on the road part of the bridge, but these were given up in 1902.\n\nThe words ''Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway'' appeared in public timetables for the first time in 1890.\n\n==The M&GNJR is formed==\n[[File:Cromer-1906.png|thumb|Cromer railways in 1906]]The 1889 arrangement whereby the Midland and GNR jointly took over E&MR lines applied only to the western section. Now in 1891 the two larger companies indicated that they wished to acquire the eastern section too. This was agreed in October 1892, and a Bill was submitted to the 1893 session of Parliament. The consideration was \u00a31.2 million of Midland and GNR 3% rent stock, although there were complicated provisions for preference and debenture shareholders. Both eastern and western sections transferred to the M&GNJR.\n\nWith only minor interference from the GER, the new arrangement passed in Parliament on 9 June 1893: the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway would become an incorporated entity (rather than just a committee delegated by the two principals). 113 miles of railway were involved,{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = clark/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = Maxwell>{{cite magazine| first=Alexander| last=Maxwell| title=The Midland and Great Northern Railway : I: Its Traffic| magazine=Railway Magazine| date=September 1936}}</ref><ref name = hopwood>{{cite magazine| first=H.L.| last=Hopwood| title=The Midland and Great Northern Railway| magazine=Railway Magazine| date=August 1908}}</ref> so that the M&GNJR network was the longest joint railway in the United Kingdom, by mileage.<ref name = casserley/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Saxby and the Spalding avoiding line opened to passengers==\nOn 1 May 1894 the Bourne to Saxby line was opened to passengers, with additional platforms at Saxby. The formation was made for a southward connecting curve there, but track was never laid on it. The boundary with the Joint Line was at Little Bytham as planned, and the formation of the connection to the GNR was also made, and here too track was never laid on it. the Spalding avoiding line was opened to passenger traffic on the same day, 1 May 1894.\n\n==Mundesley to Cromer==\nAn Act of 7 August 1896 authorised the M&GJR to build on from Mundesley (not yet open) to Cromer, passing south of the town and curving back to approach it from the west.\n\n==The Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway==\nBoth the GER and the M&GNJR wanted to build a direct coastal line between Yarmouth and [[Lowestoft]]; the coastal area and Lowestoft itself were developing and offered the M&GNJR much potential. At the same time the GER wished to develop its access to Mundesley. Notwithstanding the friction between the two companies, a sensible accommodation was finalised on 18 March 1897 by which the GER Bill for the Yarmouth to Lowestoft line and a Mundesley to [[Happisburgh]] line would not be opposed by the M&GNJR. The M&GNJR would simply build a connecting curve from its line swinging round the north and west of Yarmouth and connecting in to the new GER line, and have running powers to Lowestoft. A [[Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway]] company would be created, and would control the Yarmouth to Lowestoft line (from Gorleston), the North Walsham to Mundesley line, Mundesley to Cromer, and Mundesley to Happisburgh.\n\nThe M&GNJR Bill for the curve at Yarmouth passed in Parliament on 6 August 1897, and the establishment of the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway was enacted on 25 July 1898.\n\nThe Lowestoft line opened on 13 July 1903.\n \n==Opening to Mundesley==\nThe Mundesley branch opened for goods traffic on 20 June 1898, and to passengers on 1 July 1898. As a joint line (from Antingham Road Junction) it had passenger trains of both companies: nine GER and seven M&GNJR daily. Goods services alternated month by month.\n\n==From 1900==\nIn the first years of the twentieth century the M&GNJR was doing well financially. Long distance expresses were run to the area from northern English cities as well as from London. Restaurant cars were put on, as well as workers trains for example bringing fish processing women from northern Scotland for seasonal work. Fish had become an important traffic since the N&SJR connection to Lowestoft had been established.\n\nAlthough some short sections of double track had been introduced, the majority of the network was single line, and this brought challenges to timekeeping at busy times. The Midland and GNR were operating trains on the line as of right, and the GER had acquired running powers over several sections and to some terminal stations. Conversely the M&GNJR needed the co-operation of the GER for some penetrating workings, at a time when competition with the GER was still intense.\n\nIn May 1906 the Committee approved introduction of the Whitaker tablet exchange apparatus. On single line sections, head-on collision due to signalman error was prevented by a tablet system: drivers of trains entering a single line section must be in possession of a physical token, a \"tablet\" specific to that section, and one only could only be released from control equipment in the one or other of the two signalboxes controlling entry to the section. When the train had passed through the section the tablet was placed in the apparatus at that end of the section, and only now another might be released either there or at the other end of the section. When non-stopping trains passed the tablet had to be passed from the signalman to the fireman of the train, and this could not be done at speed without injury.\n\nWhitaker devised mechanical apparatus to be placed at the lineside and on locomotives to enable the exchange at a higher speed.<ref name = sekon>{{cite magazine| first=G.A.| last=Sekon| title=How Expresses Exchange Trains Staffs and Tablets| magazine=Railway Magazine| date=October 1905}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]] many of the best long-distance express passenger trains were suspended for the duration; the M&GNJR took on considerable additional goods traffic during hostilities, and many of the workforce left for the armed forces. The company maintained an [[armoured train]], constructed by the [[LNWR]] at [[Crewe Works|Crewe]],  continuously in steam from early in 1915 in case of enemy invasion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pratt |first1=Edwin A. |title=British railways and the great war |volume=2|date=1921 |publisher=Selwyn & Blount |location=London |oclc=835846426 |page=|chapter=Armoured trains for coast defence}}</ref>\n \nAfter the armistice, government control of the railways continued, and much traffic in demobilised servicemen tested the capacity of the network. There was a general railway strike in the latter months of 1919, and a coal strike in 1921, both of which caused considerable damage to the M&GNJR. The national general strike took place in 1926.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Grouping of the railways==\nWartime control of the railways ended on 15 August 1921, and the Government passed the [[Railways Act 1921]], which had the effect of transferring most of the railways of Great Britain into one or other of four new large companies, in a process referred to as the \"grouping\". The Midland Railway was transferred to the new [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS) and the GNR and also the GER were transferred to the new [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER). The M&GNJR remained unchanged, of course now jointly owned by the LMS and LNER. The rivalry with the GER was naturally at an end. The change took place formally on 1 January 1923.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe long-distance express trains were reinstated progressively, and the LNER particularly emphasised Kings Cross to Cromer traffic.\n\nHolidays at the seaside increased in popularity very considerably after the war, and as well as trains to and from the area, local services for holidaymakers staying in the area were enhanced in the season.\n\nHowever road competition, both for goods and passengers, began to take a serious toll as roads were improved. at the same time a general depression in the agricultural sector harmed M&GNJR income.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Incorporation into the LNER===\nThe Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway had retained its identity at the grouping of the railways in 1923. In the mid-1930s there was good co-operation between the LMS and the LNER and in 1935 it was agreed that the LNER should manage the operational aspects of the M&GNJR system. This took effect from 1 October 1936.<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}} The system consisted of {{convert|183|mi|km|adj=pre|route}}, of which 40% was double track.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==World War II and after==\nIn 1939 [[World War II]] started, and once again most long-distance expresses were suspended; staff were called up or volunteered in the services. However the focus of defence, evacuation of children, and later the [[Normandy landings|D-day landings]] was in the south, not the east. The war ended in 1945. The railways were run down during the war and the Government passed the [[Transport Act 1947]], so that the railways became nationalised at the beginning of 1948.\n\nThe long distance and holiday trains began to be restored, and holiday camp facilities became popular, and were served by the line.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Local closures==\nThe very low usage of some parts of the M&GNJR system after nationalisation could not be ignored, and some local closures started.\n\nOn 6 April 1953 the Cromer to Mundesley section was closed,<ref name = rhodes/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nOn 21 September 1953 the Yarmouth Beach to Gorleston North section closed.<ref>Passengers No More Second Edition page 110</ref>\n\nCromer High was closed on 20 September 1954, services being concentrated on the M&GNJR station, Cromer Beach, which was extended and improved for the purpose.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nEye Green, Thorney and Wryde stations closed to passengers in 1957 and North Drove closed to passengers in 1958.\n\n==Diesel trains==\nDiesel multiple unit vehicles were introduced on the M&GNJR from 18 September 1955, gradually taking over the entire passenger service except the long-distance trains.{{sfn|Wrottesley|1981}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Total closure==\nIn May 1958 a report was finalised by British Railways. It concluded that the entirety of the M&GNJR was loss-making, and was largely duplicated by routes of the former GER. Complete closure of passenger services was proposed. Widespread closure of goods services too was contemplated, with only the Spalding to Sutton Bridge, Peterborough to Wisbech, South Lynn to Gayton Road, and Melton Constable to Norwich. The Melton to Cromer branch was to be unaffected by the proposals.\n\nThe scale of the closure aroused considerable opposition, mainly focussed on the reduction in amenity to communities, although there was also widespread apathy, reflected in poor turnouts at public meetings.\n\nAfter deliberation the Transport Users Consultative Committee issued its decision in November 1958, that the majority of the proposed closures should proceed. Retained sections were Spalding to Bourne for goods, Spalding to Sutton Bridge for goods. A new spur would be built at Murrow connecting the M&GN line with the GN&GE Joint line; the Peterborough to Wisbech line would be disconnected at the Peterborough end, and served via the Murrow curve from Whitemoor, at March. Wisbech too would be retained and served from Whitemoor via Murrow.\n\nFurther east the Melton Constable to Norwich line would remain open for goods trains, as would the South Lynn to Rudham line. Passenger trains would continue to operate between Melton Constable and Cromer, and between North Walsham and Mundesley. [[Great Yarmouth railway station|Yarmouth Vauxhall]] (former GER station) would be extended to handle the additional seasonal passenger traffic.\n\nThe closures took place after the last trains on Saturday 28 February 1959.

He is commemorated in the name of the [[Marriott's Way]] footpath, much of which follows the trackbed of the M&GN Norwich line, and in the work of the [[North Norfolk Railway]]\n\n==Murrow flat crossing==\nAt Murrow the M&GNJR crossed the GN&GE Joint Line on the level, one of few such crossings in the UK, and the only one where two joint lines crossed.<ref name = casserley/>{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Locomotives ==\nBecause of the relatively early closure date, most workings throughout the life of the M&GN were operated by steam power. A small number of diesel multiple unit services were run in the final years, alongside the very occasional incursions of early diesel locomotives.\n\nThe M&GN mainly used designs from the MR and GNR, but included in its stock some of the older E&M engines, often much rebuilt. The famous Beyer-Peacock engines survived in this way from the early 1880s to the mid-1930s. The best contemporary designs were acquired by the Joint in the 1893 \u2013 1901 period, but as there were no more modern engines forthcoming, the light [[0-6-0]]s and [[4-4-0]]s provided much of the motive power on the line until 1936. From then on the LNER tried various designs on the line, not necessarily bigger or even more recent than the Joint's own engines, but as the M&GN's engines were scrapped, newer engines such as the K2 [[2-6-0]]s and B12 [[4-6-0]]s became common. The ex-GER \"Claud Hamilton\" 4-4-0s provided the locomotive backbone of this later period.\n\nFrom the 1950s, [[LMS Ivatt 4MT|Ivatt 4MTs]] became the dominant motive power on the system, which achieved a higher degree of standardisation than any other part of British Railways\u2014more than 50 of these \"mucky ducks\" were allocated here. But there were other types still in use, and among them the line saw [[LMS Ivatt 2MT|Ivatt 2MTs]] and occasional [[BR standard class 4 2-6-0|Standard 4MT]] and LNER B1 and B17 types.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nBritish Railways' Eastern Region was an early adopter of diesel motive power and the M&GN lines were used by [[British Rail Class 31|Brush Type 2]] locomotives and several early DMU types including [[British Rail Class 101|Class 101]] and [[British Rail Class 105|Class 105s]]. A fleet of the latter was commissioned in the mid-1950s to take over all the long-distance locomotive-hauled passenger services, but the line's closure in 1959 saw them re-allocated (especially to the Great Northern suburban commuter workings out of King's Cross, for which they were particularly unsuitable).\nOne M&GN boiler from a Hudswell Clarke 4-4-0T survives, it is hoped this will be rebuilt as a static exhibit.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Badge and livery ==\n[[File:Norfolk Green.JPG|thumb|left|[[Stagecoach in Norfolk|Norfolk Green]] bus painted in the M&GN livery]]\n\nThe M&GN device consists of images derived from the [[Coat of arms|Coats of Arms]] of the four principal cities and towns it served: (clockwise from top left) Peterborough, Norwich, Great Yarmouth and King's Lynn.\n\nFor much of the company's life the locomotives were painted a light golden brown, often referred to by paintshop staff as \"autumn leaf\" or \"golden ochre\". From 1922 the goods engines were painted dark brown, followed by the rest of the locomotives in 1929. The LNER painted the survivors black. Most of the carriages were ex-GNR and were varnished teak, but some of the older stock and rebuilds were painted and grained to look like teak. Wagon stock was generally brown oxide, the same colour as the GNR used, until 1917 when general stock under the common user agreement began to be painted grey. The number of M&GN wagons declined during the 1920s, and were eventually bought by the parent companies in 1928, leaving only service stock, which was painted red oxide. Under British Railways' control, carriages were often carmine and cream, then maroon.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Cultural impact and heritage==\n[[File:M&GN Brake Van (Geograph 2566050).jpg|thumb|right|Preserved brake van No. 12 restored and in operation on the NNR.]]\nThe M&GN was frequently referred to as the \"Muddle and Go Nowhere\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walpolecrosskeys.co.uk/ |title=Walpole Cross Keys village website |website=Walpolecrosskeys.co.uk |accessdate=17 November 2012|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518202557/http://walpolecrosskeys.co.uk/ |archivedate=18 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> a fairly self-evident title for a route that served a mostly rural region, but after closure this phrase was commonly replaced with the phrase \"Missed and Greatly Needed\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.spaldingtoday.co.uk/news/local/trip_back_to_the_golden_age_of_steam_1_578607| title=Trip Back to the Golden Age of Steam| website=Spalding Advertiser}}</ref>\n\nThe M&GN's memory is kept alive by two heritage railway operations and railway museums.

The ironmaking industry in Nuanquan was flourished grounded on the weapon manufacturing, and the blacksmiths there inspired by the flakes of heated iron when they tried to find a cheap way to celebrate the festival. They found that the sparks created by the collision between heated iron with the cold wall have a similar scene of fireworks. Later, the poor collected waste iron and gave to local blacksmiths to perform Da Shuhua as a form of reveling and attracted more and more people who could not afford to buy real fireworks came to watch. The three-day show usually performs in the 15th of the first [[lunar month]], and it develops the tradition that during the Lunar New year, the rich watches fireworks and the poor watches Da Shuhua. At the very beginning, Da Shuhua was performed on a cold wall in Nuanquan. As the population of the audience getting bigger and bigger, local people built a square which is used explicitly for performing Da Shuhua and named it \u201cTree Flower Square\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />  The future of the art is uncertain because the four remaining artists are all over fifty years old.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Tourism ===\nThe fortress of Xigubao(Chinese: \u897f\u53e4\u5821) has been listed among the national nonmaterial cultural heritage in 2001 by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council of China]]. Xigubao is located in Nuanquan town, Yuxian county. Both small and large temples in the fortress were built in the [[Ming dynasty]] and decorated with ancient fresco.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/hebei/travel/2010-09/29/content_12292827.htm|title=Country escapes|last=|first=|date=29 Sep 2010|work=Global Times|access-date=}}</ref>[[File:Yuxian, Zhangjiakou, Hebei, China - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|Da Shuhua arose in Yuxian County in 500 years ago.]]\n\n== Performance process ==\nThe traditional performing process of Da Shuhua did not change much for more than 500 years. It takes four folk artists to perform and usually takes place in the Tree Flower Square of Nuanquan township. There will be one leader blacksmith, and the other three will assist the leader with managing his iron [[furnace]] during the performance. The artists need to collect more than 500 kilograms waste iron and melt them for at least half an hour in a furnace with high heat before the show. The wooden spoon is the primary tool for Da Shuhua, and the production process of it is cumbersome. The raw material of the spoon is [[willow]] root. The root needs to be soaked in water for a few days at first, and then blacksmiths will use small fire to dry it to make it anti-burning. The four blacksmiths have to wear [[straw hat]]s and thick [[sheepskin coat]]s to protect themselves from the splashing molten iron during performance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Before Dashuhua starts, performances such as dragon lantern dance, [[lion dance]] and land boat dance will be performed by folk artists of Nuanquan first. According to the record, during the show, the molten metal will be heated up to {{cvt|1600|\u00b0C}}.<ref name=\":1\" />  The art of Da Shuhua requires skills, power, and courage. When the leader artist scoops up the heavy iron from the furnace with the wooden spoon, the spoon cannot go very deep. Otherwise, the temperature difference between the cold spoon and heated iron will cause an explosion. Then the leader blacksmith throws the spoonful of iron on the cold wall through the burst of strength on his arms and the blast of liquid iron from the wall gives the audience showers of sparks. At the end of the show, the artists will perform a deep kowtow in front of the furnace and pray for happiness and good luck. The danger of Da Shuhua can be reflected from the wounds on those folk artists. The leader blacksmith of the performance team in recent years is Wang De (artist), whose father and grandfather were both blacksmiths. Wang said he suffered a burn on his leg years ago, and it took him two months to recover.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Scientific principle ===\nThe [[melting point]] of [[iron]] is {{cvt|1538|\u00b0C}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Okamato|first=H.|date=Aug 1990|title=The Fe-Te (Iron-Tellurium) system|journal=Bulletin of Alloy Phase Diagrams|volume=11|issue=4|pages=371\u2013376|doi=10.1007/BF02843316}}</ref> When blacksmiths heat the iron up to {{cvt|1600|\u00b0C}} Celsius, the solid iron will melt and turn into liquid iron. The splash of heated liquid iron is an [[energy transformation]] process. The [[potential energy]] of the surface of liquid iron transforms to [[kinetic energy]] when the blacksmith throws out the iron from the furnace. The explosion of molten iron is essentially an [[oxidation reaction]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kress|first=V.C|date=1988|title=Stoichiometry of the iron oxidation reaction in silicate melts.|url=http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM73/AM73_1267.pdf|journal=American Mineralogist|volume=73|pages=1267\u20131274|via=}}</ref>  When the blacksmith flings the molten iron against the wall, the carbon impurity in the iron will react with oxygen to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and the impact between the carbon in the iron and the cold wall will react and produce sparks. With the same performance process, the higher the carbon amount of the iron, the more sparks can be formed.\n\n==Television drama==\nThe first TV series that involved Da Shuhua is called \u201c[[Story of Yanxi Palace]].\" \"Story of Yanxi Palace\u201d is a popular TV series in the summer of 2018.

The ironmaking industry in Nuanquan was flourished grounded on the weapon manufacturing, and the blacksmiths there inspired by the flakes of heated iron when they tried to find a cheap way to celebrate the festival. They found that the sparks created by the collision between heated iron with the cold wall have a similar scene of fireworks. Later, the poor collected waste iron and gave to local blacksmiths to perform Da Shuhua as a form of reveling and attracted more and more people who could not afford to buy real fireworks came to watch. The three-day show usually performs in the 15th of the first [[lunar month]], and it develops the tradition that during the Lunar New year, the rich watches fireworks and the poor watches Da Shuhua. At the very beginning, Da Shuhua was performed on a cold wall in Nuanquan. As the population of the audience getting bigger and bigger, local people built a square which is used explicitly for performing Da Shuhua and named it \u201cTree Flower Square\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />  The future of the art is uncertain because the four remaining artists are all over fifty years old.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Tourism ===\nThe fortress of Xigubao(Chinese: \u897f\u53e4\u5821) has been listed among the national nonmaterial cultural heritage in 2001 by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council of China]]. Xigubao is located in Nuanquan town, Yuxian county. Both small and large temples in the fortress were built in the [[Ming dynasty]] and decorated with ancient fresco.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/hebei/travel/2010-09/29/content_12292827.htm|title=Country escapes|last=|first=|date=29 Sep 2010|work=Global Times|access-date=}}</ref>[[File:Yuxian, Zhangjiakou, Hebei, China - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|Da Shuhua arose in Yuxian County in 500 years ago.]]\n\n== Performance process ==\nThe traditional performing process of Da Shuhua did not change much for more than 500 years. It takes four folk artists to perform and usually takes place in the Tree Flower Square of Nuanquan township. There will be one leader blacksmith, and the other three will assist the leader with managing his iron [[furnace]] during the performance. The artists need to collect more than 500 kilograms waste iron and melt them for at least half an hour in a furnace with high heat before the show. The wooden spoon is the primary tool for Da Shuhua, and the production process of it is cumbersome. The raw material of the spoon is [[willow]] root. The root needs to be soaked in water for a few days at first, and then blacksmiths will use small fire to dry it to make it anti-burning. The four blacksmiths have to wear [[straw hat]]s and thick [[sheepskin coat]]s to protect themselves from the splashing molten iron during performance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Before Dashuhua starts, performances such as dragon lantern dance, [[lion dance]] and land boat dance will be performed by folk artists of Nuanquan first. According to the record, during the show, the molten metal will be heated up to {{cvt|1600|\u00b0C}}.<ref name=\":1\" />  The art of Da Shuhua requires skills, power, and courage. When the leader artist scoops up the heavy iron from the furnace with the wooden spoon, the spoon cannot go very deep. Otherwise, the temperature difference between the cold spoon and heated iron will cause an explosion. Then the leader blacksmith throws the spoonful of iron on the cold wall through the burst of strength on his arms and the blast of liquid iron from the wall gives the audience showers of sparks. At the end of the show, the artists will perform a deep kowtow in front of the furnace and pray for happiness and good luck. The danger of Da Shuhua can be reflected from the wounds on those folk artists. The leader blacksmith of the performance team in recent years is Wang De (artist), whose father and grandfather were both blacksmiths. Wang said he suffered a burn on his leg years ago, and it took him two months to recover.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Scientific principle ===\nThe [[melting point]] of [[iron]] is {{cvt|1538|\u00b0C}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Okamato|first=H.|date=Aug 1990|title=The Fe-Te (Iron-Tellurium) system|journal=Bulletin of Alloy Phase Diagrams|volume=11|issue=4|pages=371\u2013376|doi=10.1007/BF02843316}}</ref> When blacksmiths heat the iron up to {{cvt|1600|\u00b0C}} Celsius, the solid iron will melt and turn into liquid iron. The splash of heated liquid iron is an [[energy transformation]] process. The [[potential energy]] of the surface of liquid iron transforms to [[kinetic energy]] when the blacksmith throws out the iron from the furnace. The explosion of molten iron is essentially an [[oxidation reaction]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kress|first=V.C|date=1988|title=Stoichiometry of the iron oxidation reaction in silicate melts.|url=http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM73/AM73_1267.pdf|journal=American Mineralogist|volume=73|pages=1267\u20131274|via=}}</ref>  When the blacksmith flings the molten iron against the wall, the carbon impurity in the iron will react with oxygen to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and the impact between the carbon in the iron and the cold wall will react and produce sparks. With the same performance process, the higher the carbon amount of the iron, the more sparks can be formed.\n\n==Television drama==\nThe first TV series that involved Da Shuhua is called \u201c[[Story of Yanxi Palace]].\" \"Story of Yanxi Palace\u201d is a popular TV series in the summer of 2018.
