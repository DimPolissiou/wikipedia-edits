It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. A [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]], its heavy dependence on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equations|prey-predator cycle]]. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=[[The Animal Kingdom]] |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. A [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]], its heavy dependence on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a [[Lotka\u2013Volterra equations|prey-predator cycle]]. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=[[The Animal Kingdom]] |date=1792 |publisher=A.

His career spans several decades. His melodic and highly dramatic love ballads, especially from the 1970s (such as \"Questo piccolo grande amore\", \"E tu...\", \"Amore bello\", \"Sabato pomeriggio\", \"E tu come stai\") are part of Italy's musical and national subculture. \nHis works include the official [[Anthem]] for the 2006 [[2006 Winter Olympics|Olympic Winter Games in Turin]].\n\n==Biography==\nHis musical career began in 1965 when he entered a competition for new talents in the Rome district of [[Centocelle]]. Between 1965 and 1968, he composed a musical suite to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem \"Annabel Lee\", made a test recording for [[RCA]], and released his first album ''Claudio Baglioni''. In 1970, he entered the ''[[Disco per l'estate]]'' competition with the song \"Una favola blu\" and the ''Festivalbar'' competition with \"Signora Lia\".\n\nHe achieved more significant success following the release of his second album ''Un cantastorie dei giorni nostri'' in 1972, with the song ''Questo piccolo grande amore''. <!-- This is confusing. -->On 4 August 1973, he married Paola Massari. He produced ''E tu'' in Paris in 1974 in collaboration with [[Vangelis]] and ''Sabato pomeriggio'' in 1975 with arrangements by Luis Enriquez Bacalov. In 1977 he released ''Solo'' and began a tour of the United States and Canada. 1978 was the year of ''E tu come stai?'', released by his new record company CBS.\n\n[[File:Claudio Baglioni e Paola Massari.jpg|thumb|200|left|Baglioni and his wife Paola Massari in 1972.]]\nIn 1981 he produced the hugely successful album ''Strada facendo'' and gave a series of concerts. In 1982, he composed \"Avrai\", a song dedicated to his newborn son Giovanni, and set off for the ''Al\u00e9-o\u00f3'' tour, which spawned an album of the same name. In 1985 he produced ''La vita \u00e8 adesso'' and the following year set off for the ''Assolo'' tour, a three-hour tour-de-force of vocals, guitar and piano. After two years of work, he released ''Oltre'', an album which included the participation of numerous names from the international music world, such as [[Paco De Lucia]], [[Pino Daniele]], [[Mia Martini]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Phil Palmer]], [[Tony Levin]] and others.\n\nFrom then until 1994, he went on a series of tours around Italy. In 1995, he produced ''Io sono qui'', followed by the ''Tour Rosso'' in <!-- Check this. Probably \"Palazzo dello Sport\" in Roma. -->. In the summer of 1998, his dream of holding concerts in Italy's main stadiums came true. In 1999, he released the album ''Viaggiatore sulla coda del tempo''. In 2003, Baglioni released a new album, ''Sono io, l'uomo della storia accanto'', and won the Lunezia Prize. ''Crescendo e cercando'' and ''Tutti qui \u2013 Collezione dal 1967 al 2005'' followed two years later. In 2006, he released the album ''Quelli degli altri: Tutti qui,'' under the [[Columbia Records]] label.\n\nIn 2009, Baglioni worked on a movie called ''Questo piccolo grande amore'' based on themes from his songs. The double-disc soundtrack album ''[[Q.P.G.A]]'' features full-length versions performed together with other musicians like [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Laura Pausini]] and [[Irene Grandi]]. Baglioni also wrote a novella. In Italy, the album went triple platinum with more than 180,000 copies sold. In 2010, Baglioni went on a series of tours around the world. After that, he released a new album, ''Per il mondo. World Tour 2010''.\n\nIn October 2013, ten years after his album ''Sono io'', he released his new album ''[[Con voi]]''.

His career spans several decades. His melodic and highly dramatic love ballads, especially from the 1970s (such as \"Questo piccolo grande amore\", \"E tu...\", \"Amore bello\", \"Sabato pomeriggio\", \"E tu come stai\") are part of Italy's musical and national subculture. \nHis works include the official [[Anthem]] for the 2006 [[2006 Winter Olympics|Olympic Winter Games in Turin]].\n\n==Biography==\nHis musical career began in 1965 when he entered a competition for new talents in the Rome district of [[Centocelle]]. Between 1965 and 1968, he composed a musical suite to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem \"Annabel Lee\", made a test recording for [[RCA]], and released his first album ''Claudio Baglioni''. In 1970, he entered the ''[[Disco per l'estate]]'' competition with the song \"Una favola blu\" and the ''Festivalbar'' competition with \"Signora Lia\".\n\nHe achieved more significant success following the release of his second album ''Un cantastorie dei giorni nostri'' in 1972, with the song ''Questo piccolo grande amore''. <!-- This is confusing. -->On 4 August 1973, he married Paola Massari. He produced ''E tu'' in Paris in 1974 in collaboration with [[Vangelis]] and ''Sabato pomeriggio'' in 1975 with arrangements by Luis Enriquez Bacalov. In 1977 he released ''Solo'' and began a tour of the United States and Canada. 1978 was the year of ''E tu come stai?'', released by his new record company CBS.\n\n[[File:Claudio Baglioni e Paola Massari.jpg|thumb|200|left|Baglioni and his wife Paola Massari in 1972.]]\nIn 1981 he produced the hugely successful album ''Strada facendo'' and gave a series of concerts. In 1982, he composed \"Avrai\", a song dedicated to his newborn son Giovanni, and set off for the ''Al\u00e9-o\u00f3'' tour, which spawned an album of the same name. In 1985 he produced ''La vita \u00e8 adesso'' and the following year set off for the ''Assolo'' tour, a three-hour tour-de-force of vocals, guitar and piano. After two years of work, he released ''Oltre'', an album which included the participation of numerous names from the international music world, such as [[Paco De Lucia]], [[Pino Daniele]], [[Mia Martini]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[Phil Palmer]], [[Tony Levin]] and others.\n\nFrom then until 1994, he went on a series of tours around Italy. In 1995, he produced ''Io sono qui'', followed by the ''Tour Rosso'' in <!-- Check this. Probably \"Palazzo dello Sport\" in Roma. -->. In the summer of 1998, his dream of holding concerts in Italy's main stadiums came true. In 1999, he released the album ''Viaggiatore sulla coda del tempo''. In 2003, Baglioni released a new album, ''Sono io, l'uomo della storia accanto'', and won the Lunezia Prize. ''Crescendo e cercando'' and ''Tutti qui \u2013 Collezione dal 1967 al 2005'' followed two years later. In 2006, he released the album ''Quelli degli altri: Tutti qui,'' under the [[Columbia Records]] label.\n\nIn 2009, Baglioni worked on a movie called ''Questo piccolo grande amore'' based on themes from his songs. The double-disc soundtrack album ''[[Q.P.G.A]]'' features full-length versions performed together with other musicians like [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Laura Pausini]] and [[Irene Grandi]]. Baglioni also wrote a novella. In Italy, the album went triple platinum with more than 180,000 copies sold. In 2010, Baglioni went on a series of tours around the world. After that, he released a new album, ''Per il mondo. World Tour 2010''.\n\nIn October 2013, ten years after his album ''Sono io'', he released his new album ''[[Con voi]]''. In 2015, he worked with [[Gianni Morandi]] on his \"Capitani Coraggiosi Tour\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Paolo Carnevale |url=http://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/16_febbraio_22/claudio-baglioni-gianni-morandi-372677c6-d8b3-11e5-842d-faa039f37e46.shtml?refresh_ce-cp |title=Claudio Baglioni-Gianni Morandi: i numeri della strana coppia \u2013 Corriere.it |website=Corriere della Sera |accessdate=7 June 2017}}</ref> In 2018 and 2019 was the [[art director]] and the [[Master of ceremonies|presenter]] of ''[[Sanremo Music Festival]]''.\n\nIn 2020 he wrote the song \"[[Gli anni pi\u00f9 belli (song)|Gli anni pi\u00f9 belli]]\", which was included in the soundtrack of the [[Gli anni pi\u00f9 belli|film with the same name]] directed by [[Gabriele Muccino]].\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Atop the cliffs, Navajo Sandstone often appears as massive rounded domes and bluffs that are generally white in color.\n\n=== Appearance and provenance ===\n[[File:Great White Throne in Zion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Great White Throne (mountain)|Great White Throne]] in [[Zion National Park]] is an example of white Navajo Sandstone]]\n[[File:StevensArchUT.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stevens Arch, near the mouth of [[Coyote Gulch]] in the [[Canyons of the Escalante]], is formed from a layer of Navajo Sandstone.  The opening is {{convert|220|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|160|ft|m}} high.]]\n\nNavajo Sandstone frequently occurs as spectacular cliffs, [[cuesta]]s, domes, and bluffs rising from the desert floor.  It can be distinguished from adjacent Jurassic sandstones by its white to light pink color, meter-scale [[cross-bedding]], and distinctive rounded weathering.\n\nThe wide range of colors exhibited by the Navajo Sandstone reflect a long history of alteration by groundwater and other subsurface fluids over the last 190 million years. The different colors, except for white, are caused by the presence of varying mixtures and amounts of [[hematite]], [[goethite]], and [[limonite]] filling the pore space within the quartz sand comprising the Navajo Sandstone. The iron in these strata originally arrived via the erosion of iron-bearing [[silicate]] [[minerals]].\n\nInitially, this iron accumulated as iron-oxide coatings, which formed slowly after the sand had been deposited. Later, after having been deeply buried, reducing fluids composed of water and hydrocarbons flowed through the thick red sand which once comprised the Navajo Sandstone. The dissolution of the iron coatings by the reducing fluids bleached large volumes of the Navajo Sandstone a brilliant white. Reducing fluids transported the iron in solution until they mixed with oxidizing groundwater. Where the oxidizing and reducing fluids mixed, the iron precipitated within the Navajo Sandstone.\n\nDepending on local variations within the permeability, porosity, fracturing, and other inherent rock properties of the sandstone, varying mixtures of hematite, goethite, and limonite precipitated within spaces between quartz grains. Variations in the type and proportions of precipitated iron oxides resulted in the different black, brown, crimson, vermillion, orange, salmon, peach, pink, gold, and yellow colors of the Navajo Sandstone.\n\nThe precipitation of iron oxides also formed laminea, corrugated layers, columns, and pipes of ironstone within the Navajo Sandstone. Being harder and more resistant to erosion than the surrounding sandstone, the ironstone weathered out as ledges, walls, fins, \"flags\", towers, and other minor features, which stick out and above the local landscape in unusual shapes.<ref name=\"ChanOther2002a\">Chan, MA, and WT Parry (2002) [http://geology.utah.gov/online/pdf/pi-77.pdf ''Mysteries of Sandstone Colors and Concretions in Colorado Plateau Canyon Country.''

Informally, they are called \"Moqui marbles\" and are believed to represent an extension of [[Hopi]] Native American traditions regarding ancestor worship (\"moqui\" translates to \"the dead\" in the Hopi language).   Thousands of these concretions weather out of outcrops of the Navajo Sandstone within south-central and southeastern Utah within an area extending from Zion National Park eastward to Arches and Canyonland national parks. They are quite abundant within Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.<ref name=\"ChanOther2002a\"/><ref name=\"ChanOthers2005a\"/>\n\nThe iron oxide concretions found in the Navajo Sandstone exhibit a wide variety of sizes and shapes. Their shape ranges from spheres to discs; buttons; spiked balls; cylindrical hollow pipe-like forms; and other odd shapes. Although many of these concretions are fused together like soap bubbles, many more also occur as isolated concretions, which range in diameter from the size of peas to baseballs. The surface of these spherical concretions can range from being very rough to quite smooth. Some of the concretions are grooved spheres with ridges around their circumference.<ref name=\"ChanOther2002a\"/><ref name=\"ChanOthers2005a\"/>\n\nThe abundant concretions found in the Navajo Sandstone consist of sandstone cemented together by [[hematite]] (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and [[goethite]] (FeOOH). The iron forming these concretions came from the breakdown of iron-bearing [[silicate minerals]] by weathering to form iron oxide coatings on other grains. During later [[diagenesis]] of the Navajo Sandstone while deeply buried, [[Redox|reducing fluids]], likely [[hydrocarbons]], dissolved these coatings. When the reducing fluids containing dissolved iron mixed with oxidizing [[groundwater]], they and the dissolved iron were oxidized. This caused the iron to precipitate out as hematite and goethite to form the innumerable concretions found in the Navajo Sandstone. Evidence suggests that microbial metabolism may have contributed to the formation of some of these concretions.<ref name=WeberOthers2012a>Weber, WA, TL Spanbauer, D Wacey, MR Kilburn, DB Loope, and RM Kettler (2012) ''Biosignatures link microorganisms to iron mineralization in a paleoaquifer.''

Together, these formations can result in immense vertical cliffs of up to {{convert|2200|ft|m}}.  Atop the cliffs, Navajo Sandstone often appears as massive rounded domes and bluffs that are generally white in color.\n\n=== Appearance and provenance ===\n[[File:Great White Throne in Zion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Great White Throne (mountain)|Great White Throne]] in [[Zion National Park]] is an example of white Navajo Sandstone]]\n[[File:StevensArchUT.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stevens Arch, near the mouth of [[Coyote Gulch]] in the [[Canyons of the Escalante]], is formed from a layer of Navajo Sandstone.  The opening is {{convert|220|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|160|ft|m}} high.]]\n\nNavajo Sandstone frequently occurs as spectacular cliffs, [[cuesta]]s, domes, and bluffs rising from the desert floor.  It can be distinguished from adjacent Jurassic sandstones by its white to light pink color, meter-scale [[cross-bedding]], and distinctive rounded weathering.\n\nThe wide range of colors exhibited by the Navajo Sandstone reflect a long history of alteration by groundwater and other subsurface fluids over the last 190 million years. The different colors, except for white, are caused by the presence of varying mixtures and amounts of [[hematite]], [[goethite]], and [[limonite]] filling the pore space within the quartz sand comprising the Navajo Sandstone. The iron in these strata originally arrived via the erosion of iron-bearing [[silicate]] [[minerals]].\n\nInitially, this iron accumulated as iron-oxide coatings, which formed slowly after the sand had been deposited. Later, after having been deeply buried, reducing fluids composed of water and hydrocarbons flowed through the thick red sand which once comprised the Navajo Sandstone. The dissolution of the iron coatings by the reducing fluids bleached large volumes of the Navajo Sandstone a brilliant white. Reducing fluids transported the iron in solution until they mixed with oxidizing groundwater. Where the oxidizing and reducing fluids mixed, the iron precipitated within the Navajo Sandstone.\n\nDepending on local variations within the permeability, porosity, fracturing, and other inherent rock properties of the sandstone, varying mixtures of hematite, goethite, and limonite precipitated within spaces between quartz grains. Variations in the type and proportions of precipitated iron oxides resulted in the different black, brown, crimson, vermillion, orange, salmon, peach, pink, gold, and yellow colors of the Navajo Sandstone.\n\nThe precipitation of iron oxides also formed laminea, corrugated layers, columns, and pipes of ironstone within the Navajo Sandstone. Being harder and more resistant to erosion than the surrounding sandstone, the ironstone weathered out as ledges, walls, fins, \"flags\", towers, and other minor features, which stick out and above the local landscape in unusual shapes.<ref name=\"ChanOther2002a\">Chan, MA, and WT Parry (2002) [http://geology.utah.gov/online/pdf/pi-77.pdf ''Mysteries of Sandstone Colors and Concretions in Colorado Plateau Canyon Country.''

Informally, they are called \"Moqui marbles\" and are believed to represent an extension of [[Hopi]] Native American traditions regarding ancestor worship (\"moqui\" translates to \"the dead\" in the Hopi language).   Thousands of these concretions weather out of outcrops of the Navajo Sandstone within south-central and southeastern Utah within an area extending from Zion National Park eastward to Arches and Canyonland national parks. They are quite abundant within Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.<ref name=\"ChanOther2002a\"/><ref name=\"ChanOthers2005a\"/>\n\nThe iron oxide concretions found in the Navajo Sandstone exhibit a wide variety of sizes and shapes. Their shape ranges from spheres to discs; buttons; spiked balls; cylindrical hollow pipe-like forms; and other odd shapes. Although many of these concretions are fused together like soap bubbles, many more also occur as isolated concretions, which range in diameter from the size of peas to baseballs. The surface of these spherical concretions can range from being very rough to quite smooth. Some of the concretions are grooved spheres with ridges around their circumference.<ref name=\"ChanOther2002a\"/><ref name=\"ChanOthers2005a\"/>\n\nThe abundant concretions found in the Navajo Sandstone consist of sandstone cemented together by [[hematite]] (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and [[goethite]] (FeOOH). The iron forming these concretions came from the breakdown of iron-bearing [[silicate minerals]] by weathering to form iron oxide coatings on other grains. During later [[diagenesis]] of the Navajo Sandstone while deeply buried, [[Redox|reducing fluids]], likely [[hydrocarbons]], dissolved these coatings. When the reducing fluids containing dissolved iron mixed with oxidizing [[groundwater]], they and the dissolved iron were oxidized. This caused the iron to precipitate out as hematite and goethite to form the innumerable concretions found in the Navajo Sandstone. Evidence suggests that microbial metabolism may have contributed to the formation of some of these concretions.<ref name=WeberOthers2012a>Weber, WA, TL Spanbauer, D Wacey, MR Kilburn, DB Loope, and RM Kettler (2012) ''Biosignatures link microorganisms to iron mineralization in a paleoaquifer.''

Both D-CTS3946 and [[Haplogroup E (Y-DNA)|E]] lineages also exhibit the [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] [[Haplogroup CT|M168]] which is present in all Y-chromosome haplogroups except [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|A]] and [[Haplogroup B (Y-DNA)|B]], as well as the YAP+ [[unique-event polymorphism]], which is unique to [[Haplogroup DE]]. Subclades of haplogroup D-CTS3946 are found primarily in [[East Asia]], though they are also found regularly with low frequency in [[Central Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], and have also been found sporadically in [[Western Africa]] and [[Western Asia]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Haplogroup D (Y-DNA) migration.png|thumb|300px|right|Proposed migration of haplogroup D according to Haber et al.]]\nHaplogroup D was formerly the name of the D lineage [[Haplogroup D-M174|D-M174]]. However, a study (Haber et al. 2019) identified a haplogroup, termed \"D0\", in three Nigerian samples. The \"D0\" haplogroup is outside M174, but shares 7 SNPs with it that E lacks. The authors consider several possibilities, but in part because of the likely deep-rooting of haplogroup \"D0\", as well as recently calculated early divergence times for it and its parent haplogroup, DE, the authors conclude in favor of an African origin for D0 DE, as well as for the common ancestor (now known as D-CTS3946 or \"D\") of D0 and D-M174. According to Haber et al., D0 is a branch of the DE lineage near the DE split but on the D branch, diverging around 71,000 years ago. The authors find divergence times for DE*, E, and D0, all likely within a period of about 76,000-71,000 years ago, and a likely date for the exit of the ancestors of modern Eurasians out of Africa (and ensuing Neanderthal admixture) later, at around 50,300-59,400 years ago, which they argue, also supports an African origin for those haplogroups.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Thus D-CTS3946 is proposed to have spread both within and outside of Africa: with one branch diverging into D0 in Africa, and another branch outside Africa eventually diverging into D-M174 (i.e. with the M174 mutation later arising from the D-CTS3946 that had spread to Asia). \"D0\" has also been named \"D2\", and former D (D-M174) has now also been termed \"D1\" due to this discovery.\n\nThree other samples of D2 were also found in West Asia (also in 2019): two in Saudi Arabia and another one in Syria. The sample found in Syria is to date the most basal sample of D2. The recent evidence (as also proposed by Haber et al.) suggests that D2 is a highly divergent haplogroup close to the DE split but on the D branch and lacking the M174 mutation possessed by the other known D lineages (belonging to its sibling D-M174).<ref name=WestAsia>{{Cite web|url=https://dna-explained.com/2019/06/21/exciting-new-y-dna-haplogroup-d-discoveries/|title=Exciting New Y DNA Haplogroup D Discoveries!|last=Estes|first=Roberta|date=2019-06-21|website=DNAeXplained - Genetic Genealogy|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref>\n\nMore recent sample analysis by Hallast et al. 2019, including the D0 (D2) samples from Africa and West Asia, using detailed calibrated phylogeny, resulted in support for an [[Asia|Asian]] origin of the Y-chromosoma D. Branching patterns, together with present-day locations of the lineages are in support for an origin in Asia, possibly in or near East Asia. According to their results, haplogroup D was once more widespreaded in Eurasia than today and got largely replaced. Haplogroup D was also found among paleolithic  [[Europeans]] 45,000 to 30,000 years ago and persisted until 8,000 years ago where they were replaced by other lineages.

The club performed strongly again and almost won the [[Rugby league county leagues|Yorkshire Senior Competition]] but in the end fell short on the table by just one win.\n\nHowever, the club fell upon hard times after being relegated, and in 1903 only the successful staging of an archery tournament kept the club going.\n\nOn 30 January 1903, Scotsman James Whyte, a sub-editor of the ''Bradford Observer'' met [[The Football Association|Football Association]] representative John Brunt at [[Valley Parade]], the home of Manningham Football Club, to discuss establishing a [[The Football League|Football League]] club within the city.

It was released on October 25, 2010, by [[Big Machine Records]]. Production for the album took place during 2009 to 2010 at several recording studios, and was handled by Swift and [[Nathan Chapman (record producer)|Nathan Chapman]]. Written entirely by Swift as the follow-up to ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'', and described as a loose [[concept album]] about confessions,<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> ''Speak Now'' expands on the [[country pop]] style of her previous work, but with more [[Rock music|rock]] sensibility, drawing influences from [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[pop punk]], [[pop rock]] and [[soft rock]]. Lyrically, it deals with themes such as love, romance, heartbreak and forgiveness.\n\n''Speak Now'' received generally positive reviews from [[music criticism|music critics]], who praised Swift's songwriting and themes. It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, giving Swift her second consecutive chart-topper in the U.S. Its first-week sales of 1,047,000 copies was the [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|fifth-biggest debut in history]] for a female artist, the third biggest ever by a country album (the first being Swift's own ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' album later released in 2012), the biggest in five and a half years, and the biggest first week sales of 2010. The album also made music history for claiming the biggest one-week sales tally for an album by a female country artist. As of 2017, ''Speak Now'' was ranked as the 16th album to sell at least one million copies in a single week in the United States. Internationally, it charted within the top 10 in several countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. As of July 2019, ''Speak Now'' is certified [[RIAA certification|6\u00d7 platinum]] by the RIAA, for moving over six million units in the US. It has sold 4.68 million pure copies in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2011/09/20/taylor-swift-celebrates-nashville-homecoming/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104105419/http://blog.gactv.com/blog/2011/09/20/taylor-swift-celebrates-nashville-homecoming/|archivedate=November 4, 2015| title=Taylor Swift Celebrates Nashville Homecoming | publisher=[[Great American Country]]| date=September 20, 2011 | accessdate=February 9, 2020 | author=Wyland, Sarah}}</ref> It is also the tenth best-selling digital album of all time.\n\n''Speak Now'' was supported by six singles, out of which the first two reached the top 10 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]: the lead single \"[[Mine (Taylor Swift song)|Mine]]\" debuted at number three and \"[[Back to December]]\" peaked at number six. Additionally, the [[Speak Now (song)|title track]] peaked at number eight upon release as a [[promotional single]]; the release of the deluxe edition of the album led the bonus track \"If This Was a Movie\" to debut at number 10 on the chart, giving ''Speak Now'' its fourth top 10 hit on the Hot 100. Swift promoted the album with the [[Speak Now World Tour]], which grossed over $123 million. \n\nAt the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards|54th Grammy Awards]], ''Speak Now'' received three nominations, including one for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]]; its third single \"[[Mean (song)|Mean]]\" won the [[Grammy Award|Grammy awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance|Best Country Solo Performance]].

Written entirely by Swift as the follow-up to ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'', and described as a loose [[concept album]] about confessions,<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> ''Speak Now'' expands on the [[country pop]] style of her previous work, but with more [[Rock music|rock]] sensibility, drawing influences from [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[pop punk]], [[pop rock]] and [[soft rock]].

It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, giving Swift her second consecutive chart-topper in the U.S. Its first-week sales of 1,047,000 copies was the [[Lists of fastest-selling albums|fifth-biggest debut in history]] for a female artist, the third biggest ever by a country album (the first being Swift's own ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' album later released in 2012), the biggest in five and a half years, and the biggest first week sales of 2010. The album also made music history for claiming the biggest one-week sales tally for an album by a female country artist. As of 2017, ''Speak Now'' was ranked as the 16th album to sell at least one million copies in a single week in the United States. Internationally, it charted within the top 10 in several countries, including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

The player controls a researcher who is studying the local environment of a nearby alien facility, on planet 4546B.\n\n== Plot ==\n''Subnautica Below Zero'' takes place two years after the ending of ''[[Subnautica]]''. Alterra has placed the Vesper Station into orbit around the planet 4546B for research. The story opens with the Player being told to head to the nearby Mountain Alien Facility and locate Serik Jevov (Jeff). The player then encounters the voice of one of the architects, letting the player know that Jeff is gone; the Alien Facility then gets locked off and requires a White Tablet to enter. Afterward, the Alien Facility is struck by a meteor and begins re-routing its power to the Sanctuary. The player is told to get the escape ship back to base. However, the ship takes off, and the player has to take shelter in the Research Base Zero. After the meteor shower triggers an avalanche, the ice breaks below the player causing him to have to swim out into open water. Next, he needs to head-on to a Lifepod launched by Sam Goodall on the Vesper Station, just before The Vesper is struck by a meteorite damaging its communication ability. \n\nShortly after, the player receives a message traced from the Alien Sanctuary Site in the Twist Bridges. Once the player is exploring the Underwater Alien Facility, he is threatened by an Alien voice saying that its Storage Medium is failing. As the player reaches the inner of the Alien Facility, he finds an \"adequate storage medium\". The player offers his PDA for the consciousnesses to transfer into. However, it transfers into the player's Cerebral Cortex. The Alien Voice then lets the player know its name its Al-an.\n\nAs the player approaches Rocket Island, his PDA informs them that repairing the communications tower will reestablish contact with The Vesper, requiring the player to explore the Mercury II wreck, a ship that crashed somewhere between 30 to 100 years ago. After The Player repairs the communications tower, he is told that the ship took off and crash-landed in the Glacial Basin, where he has three objectives: Find Jeff, extract a sample of the Kharaa sample, and retrieve research data from Research Base Omega.\n\nIn the Glacial Basin, the player finds the crashed escape ship. The player can locate Jeff's base in the Glacial Basin and is informed that Jeff is most likely in another sector. The player is then told to head to the Leviathan Genetic Research Program to receive a sample of the Kharaa Bacterium and send it up to The Vesper. As the player explores the Glacial Basin, he finds a Cache with one of the architect's body parts.  A while after the player sends the Kharaa Bacterium, he gets a message that it never arrived. The player then gets a supply drop in the Lilypad Islands leading them towards Research Base Omega. Throughout the player's adventure, he finds two more caches, each containing one of the other parts to the architect's body. When the player arrives in the Fabricator Base, he's told that he can construct Al-an a body and transfer his consciousness back into it.\n\nThe player gets contacted by Sam who tells him the Vesper's supply of Enzyme 42 deteriorated overnight and that he needs a sample from a nearby Sea Emperor Leviathan. As the player sends the Enzyme up to The Vesper, an architect shield covers the planet causing the rocket containing the cure to explode. The player then calls Robin and the mission director about what happened. Jeff then joins the call and says his intention to hold the Vesper crew hostage as he is most likely exposed to the Kharaa bacterium, alongside the player being trapped on the surface. The Player then learns from Al-an that it needs to head to the Mountain Alien Facility \n\nAfter the player receives the white tablet to enter the facility, he goes to the Alien Facility and enters it.  The game ends with The Vesper station being blown up.\n\n<!--== Plot == how are there two different plots?

His international career was restricted to the [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1913-14|1913\u201314 tour of South Africa]], which was the last [[Test cricket|Test match]] tour before the [[First World War]]. After receiving a commission in the [[West Yorkshire Regiment]], Booth became [[Second Lieutenant]] Major Booth, and died just under a year later when he went over the top on the trenches on 1 July 1916, the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme offensive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/cricketers-who-died-in-world-war-1-part-1-of-5-165998 |title=Cricketers who died in World War 1 \u2014 Part 1 of 5 |work=Cricket Country |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> After his death his sister would light a candle in his room every night in the hope that he would return.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Men Who Played The Game : Sportsmen who gave their life in the Great War|last=Rees, Mike|isbn=9781781722862|location=Bridgend|oclc=935458537}}</ref>\n\n==Cricket career==\nBooth's earliest cricket was played at [[Fulneck School]], and later he was associated with Pudsey St. Lawrence and the Wath Athletic Club, which played in the Mexborough League, and of which he was captain.

Booth increased his reputation as a bowler in the following summer, and [[1913 English cricket season|in 1913]] made over a thousand runs and took 158 wickets for Yorkshire, whilst his aggregate of 181 wickets in first-class matches was the highest of any bowler that season. In 1914 he was not so successful in batting \u2013 it was said during the 1913 season that he should concentrate on bowling as his build was not ideal for hard work<ref name=\"commendation\"/> \u2013 but he obtained 141 wickets for Yorkshire at a cost of 18 runs apiece. Although a fine punishing batsman, Booth's claim to fame will rest chiefly upon what he accomplished as a bowler. Possessed of a free, natural action, he made the ball come quickly off the pitch. On occasion his off-break was quite formidable, but his strong points were swerve and pace off the ground.<ref name=\"Obituary\">[http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/155536.html Booth's Obituary] in the 1917 ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanac|John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanac]]''</ref>\n\n===Notable feats===\nHis best feats with the ball may be summarised thus:<ref name=\"Obituary\"/>\n\n*8\u201347, Yorkshire v.

In the second innings of the latter match Booth had the very rare experience of bowling throughout without obtaining a wicket, Drake taking all ten for 35 runs.\n\nIn 1913 Booth was chosen for the [[Players cricket team|Players]] at [[Lord's]], and during 1913\u201314 toured South Africa with MCC's team under [[Johnny Douglas|Douglas]]' captaincy. His doings abroad were somewhat disappointing, and so strong was the side that he was left out of three of the Test matches. In the 144 games in which he appeared for Yorkshire Booth scored 4,213 runs with an average of 22.65 and obtained 556 wickets for 18.89 runs each. Tall of stature, good-looking, and of engaging address, Booth was a very popular figure both on and off the cricket field. Booth was brought up at Town End House near the Britannia Inn at Pudsey. He was the best man at [[Roy Kilner]]'s wedding and the latter named a son after him.

His international career was restricted to the [[English cricket team in South Africa in 1913-14|1913\u201314 tour of South Africa]], which was the last [[Test cricket|Test match]] tour before the [[First World War]]. After receiving a commission in the [[West Yorkshire Regiment]], Booth became [[Second Lieutenant]] Major Booth, and died just under a year later when he went over the top on the trenches on 1 July 1916, the first day of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme offensive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/cricketers-who-died-in-world-war-1-part-1-of-5-165998 |title=Cricketers who died in World War 1 \u2014 Part 1 of 5 |work=Cricket Country |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref> After his death his sister would light a candle in his room every night in the hope that he would return.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Men Who Played The Game : Sportsmen who gave their life in the Great War|last=Rees, Mike|isbn=9781781722862|location=Bridgend|oclc=935458537}}</ref>\n\n==Cricket career==\nBooth\u2019s earliest cricket was played at [[Fulneck School]], and later he was associated with Pudsey St. Lawrence and the Wath Athletic Club, which played in the Mexborough League, and of which he was captain.

Booth increased his reputation as a bowler in the following summer, and [[1913 English cricket season|in 1913]] made over a thousand runs and took 158 wickets for Yorkshire, whilst his aggregate of 181 wickets in first-class matches was the highest of any bowler that season. In 1914 he was not so successful in batting \u2013 it was said during the 1913 season that he should concentrate on bowling as his build was not ideal for hard work<ref name=\"commendation\"/> \u2013 but he obtained 141 wickets for Yorkshire at a cost of 18 runs apiece. Although a fine punishing batsman, Booth\u2019s claim to fame will rest chiefly upon what he accomplished as a bowler. Possessed of a free, natural action, he made the ball come quickly off the pitch. On occasion his off-break was quite formidable, but his strong points were swerve and pace off the ground.<ref name=\"Obituary\">[http://content-ind.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/155536.html Booth\u2019s Obituary] in the 1917 ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanac|John Wisden\u2019s Cricketers\u2019 Almanac]]''</ref>\n\n===Notable feats===\nHis best feats with the ball may be summarised thus:<ref name=\"Obituary\"/>\n\n*8\u201347, Yorkshire v.

In the second innings of the latter match Booth had the very rare experience of bowling throughout without obtaining a wicket, Drake taking all ten for 35 runs.\n\nIn 1913 Booth was chosen for the [[Players cricket team|Players]] at [[Lord's]], and during 1913\u201314 toured South Africa with MCC\u2019s team under [[Johnny Douglas|Douglas]]\u2019 captaincy. His doings abroad were somewhat disappointing, and so strong was the side that he was left out of three of the Test matches. In the 144 games in which he appeared for Yorkshire Booth scored 4,213 runs with an average of 22.65 and obtained 556 wickets for 18.89 runs each. Tall of stature, good-looking, and of engaging address, Booth was a very popular figure both on and off the cricket field. Booth was brought up at Town End House near the Britannia Inn at Pudsey. He was the best man at [[Roy Kilner]]\u2019s wedding and the latter named a son after him.

Kinne claimed that the child, who had often been allowed to play with James' guns, had accidentally shot him, and police were initially unable to disprove her story. Then, on May 27, the body of 23-year-old Patricia Jones, a local file clerk, was found by Kinne and a boyfriend in a secluded area. Investigators found that Jones had been the wife of another of Kinne's boyfriends, and that Jones' husband had tried to break off his [[affair]] with Kinne shortly before Jones went missing. When Kinne admitted to having been the last person to speak to Jones, she was charged with her murder and, upon further investigation of his death, that of James.\n\nKinne went to trial for Jones' murder in June 1961 and was [[acquittal|acquitted]]. A January 1962 trial on charges of murdering her husband ended in [[conviction]] and a sentence of [[life imprisonment]], but the verdict was [[Vacated judgment|overturned]] because of procedural irregularities. The case went to a second trial, which ended within days in a [[Mistrial#Mistrials|mistrial]]. A third trial on the charge of murdering James ended in a [[hung jury]] in July 1964. Kinne was released on [[bail bond|bond]] following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial could be held in October 1964.\n\nIn Mexico, Kinne, claiming to have been acting in [[self-defense]], shot and killed a Mexican-born American citizen named Francisco Parades Ordo\u00f1ez, who was shot in the back. An employee of the hotel in which the shooting occurred, responding to the sound of gunshots, was also wounded but survived. Investigation into the shootings showed that Ordo\u00f1ez was shot with the same weapon that killed Jones. Kinne was convicted in October 1965 of the Mexican crimes and sentenced to ten years in prison, later lengthened to thirteen years after judicial review. Kinne [[Prison escape|escaped]] from the prison during a [[Power outage|blackout]] in December 1969.

Kinne claimed that the child, who had often been allowed to play with James' guns, had accidentally shot him, and police were initially unable to disprove her story. Then, on May 27, the body of 23-year-old Patricia Jones, a local file clerk, was found by Kinne and a boyfriend in a secluded area. Investigators found that Jones had been the wife of another of Kinne's boyfriends, and that Jones' husband had tried to break off his [[affair]] with Kinne shortly before Jones went missing. When Kinne admitted to having been the last person to speak to Jones, she was charged with her murder and, upon further investigation of his death, that of James.\n\nKinne went to trial for Jones' murder in June 1961 and was [[acquittal|acquitted]]. A January 1962 trial on charges of murdering her husband ended in [[conviction]] and a sentence of [[life imprisonment]], but the verdict was [[Vacated judgment|overturned]] because of procedural irregularities. The case went to a second trial, which ended within days in a [[Mistrial#Mistrials|mistrial]]. A third trial on the charge of murdering James ended in a [[hung jury]] in July 1964. Kinne was released on [[bail bond|bond]] following the third trial and subsequently traveled to Mexico before a scheduled fourth trial could be held in October 1964.\n\nIn Mexico, Kinne, claiming to have been acting in [[self-defense]], shot and killed a Mexican-born American citizen named Francisco Parades Ordo\u00f1ez, who was shot in the back. An employee of the hotel in which the shooting occurred, responding to the sound of gunshots, was also wounded but survived. Investigation into the shootings showed that Ordo\u00f1ez was shot with the same weapon that killed Jones. Kinne was convicted in October 1965 of the Mexican crimes and sentenced to ten years in prison, later lengthened to thirteen years after judicial review. Kinne [[Prison escape|escaped]] from the prison during a [[Power outage|blackout]] in December 1969.

The teeth are not the bat-eared fox's only morphological adaptation for its diet. The lower jaw has a step-like protrusion called the subangular process,{{Clarify|date=April 2018}} which anchors the large muscle to allow for rapid chewing. The [[digastric muscle]] is also modified to open and close the jaw five times per second.<ref name=clark/>\n\n===Foraging===\nBat-eared foxes usually hunt in groups, mostly in pairs and groups of three. Individuals forage alone after family groups break in June or July and during the months after cub birth. Prey is located primarily by auditory means, rather than by smell or sight. Foraging patterns vary between seasons and coincide with termite availability. In the midsummer, individuals begin foraging at sunset, continuing throughout the night, and fading into the early morning. Foraging is almost exclusively [[Diurnality|diurnal]] during the winter it usually occurs in patches, which match the clumped prey resources, such as termite colonies, that also occur in patches. Groups are able to forage on clumps of prey in patches because they do not fight each other for food due to their degree of sociality and lack of territoriality.<ref name=Kutzsch />\n\n==Behavior==\nIn the more northern areas of its range (around [[Serengeti]]), they are [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] 85% of the time. However, around South Africa, they are nocturnal only in the summer and diurnal during the winter.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Paul|title=Otocyon megalotis,bat-eared fox|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Otocyon_megalotis/|website=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nBat-eared foxes are highly social animals. They often live in pairs or groups of up to 15 individuals, and home ranges of groups either overlap substantially or very little. Individuals forage, play, and rest together in a group, which helps in protection against predators. [[Social grooming]] occurs throughout the year, mostly between mature adults, but also between young adults and mature adults.<ref name=clark />\n[[File:Otocyon megalotis Dvur zoo 1.jpg|thumb|Threat display of bat-eared fox]]\nVisual displays are very important in communication among bat-eared foxes. When they are looking intently at something, the head is held high, eyes are open, ears are erect and facing forward, and the mouth is closed. When an individual is in threat or showing submission, the ears are pulled back and lying against the head and the head is low. The tail also plays a role in communication. When an individual is asserting dominance or aggression, feeling threatened, playing, or being sexually aroused, the tail is arched in an inverted U shape. Individuals can also use [[piloerection]], which occurs when individual hairs are standing straight, to make it appear larger when faced with extreme threat. When running, chasing, or fleeing, the tail is straight and horizontal. The bat-eared fox can recognize individuals up to 30 m away. The recognition process has three steps: First they ignore the individual, then they stare intently, and finally they either approach or attack without displays. When greeting another, the approaching individual shows symbolic submission which is received by the other individual with a high head and tail down. Few vocalizations are used for communication, but contact calls and warning calls are used, mostly during the winter. [[Territory (animal)#Scent marking|Glandular secretions]] and scratching, other than for digging, are absent in communication.<ref name=clark />\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe bat-eared fox is predominantly socially [[Social monogamy in mammalian species|monogamous]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Harry WY |display-authors=et al | year = 2010 | title = Mating tactics and paternity in a socially monogamous canid, the bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis) | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 91 | issue = 2| pages = 437\u2013446 | doi=10.1644/09-mamm-a-046.1| doi-access = free }}</ref> although it has been observed in [[Polygyny in nature|polygynous]] groups. In contrast to other canids, the bat-eared fox has a reversal in parental roles, with the male taking on the majority of the parental care behavior. [[Gestation#Mammals|Gestation]] lasts for 60\u201370 days and females give birth to litters consisting of one to six kits. Beyond [[lactation]], which lasts 14 to 15 weeks,<ref name=clark/> males take over grooming, defending, huddling, chaperoning, and carrying the young between den sites.

However, according to more recent examinations, it is more closely related to the true foxes of the genus ''[[Vulpes]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Other research places the [[genus]] as an [[Outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]] which is not very closely related to foxes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Westbury|first=Michael|last2=Dalerum|first2=Fredrik|last3=Nor\u00e9n|first3=Karin|last4=Hofreiter|first4=Michael|date=2017-01-01|title=Complete mitochondrial genome of a bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis), along with phylogenetic considerations|journal=Mitochondrial DNA Part B|volume=2|issue=1|pages=298\u2013299|doi=10.1080/23802359.2017.1331325|url=http://digibuo.uniovi.es/dspace/bitstream/10651/43386/1/Complete%20mitochondrial%20.pdf}}</ref> The bat-eared fox is an old species that was widely distributed in the [[Pleistocene]] era. The teeth are not the bat-eared fox's only morphological adaptation for its diet. The lower jaw has a step-like protrusion called the subangular process,{{Clarify|date=April 2018}} which anchors the large muscle to allow for rapid chewing. The [[digastric muscle]] is also modified to open and close the jaw five times per second.<ref name=clark/>\n\n===Foraging===\nBat-eared foxes usually hunt in groups, mostly in pairs and groups of three. Individuals forage alone after family groups break in June or July and during the months after cub birth. Prey is located primarily by auditory means, rather than by smell or sight. Foraging patterns vary between seasons and coincide with termite availability. In the midsummer, individuals begin foraging at sunset, continuing throughout the night, and fading into the early morning. Foraging is almost exclusively [[Diurnality|diurnal]] during the winter it usually occurs in patches, which match the clumped prey resources, such as termite colonies, that also occur in patches. Groups are able to forage on clumps of prey in patches because they do not fight each other for food due to their degree of sociality and lack of territoriality.<ref name=Kutzsch />\n\n==Behavior==\nIn the more northern areas of its range (around [[Serengeti]]), they are [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] 85% of the time. However, around South Africa, they are nocturnal only in the summer and diurnal during the winter.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Paul|title=Otocyon megalotis,bat-eared fox|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Otocyon_megalotis/|website=Animal Diversity Web|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nBat-eared foxes are highly social animals. They often live in pairs or groups of up to 15 individuals, and home ranges of groups either overlap substantially or very little. Individuals forage, play, and rest together in a group, which helps in protection against predators. [[Social grooming]] occurs throughout the year, mostly between mature adults, but also between young adults and mature adults.<ref name=clark />\n[[File:Otocyon megalotis Dvur zoo 1.jpg|thumb|Threat display of bat-eared fox]]\nVisual displays are very important in communication among bat-eared foxes. When they are looking intently at something, the head is held high, eyes are open, ears are erect and facing forward, and the mouth is closed. When an individual is in threat or showing submission, the ears are pulled back and lying against the head and the head is low. The tail also plays a role in communication. When an individual is asserting dominance or aggression, feeling threatened, playing, or being sexually aroused, the tail is arched in an inverted U shape. Individuals can also use [[piloerection]], which occurs when individual hairs are standing straight, to make it appear larger when faced with extreme threat. When running, chasing, or fleeing, the tail is straight and horizontal. The bat-eared fox can recognize individuals up to 30 m away. The recognition process has three steps: First they ignore the individual, then they stare intently, and finally they either approach or attack without displays. When greeting another, the approaching individual shows symbolic submission which is received by the other individual with a high head and tail down. Few vocalizations are used for communication, but contact calls and warning calls are used, mostly during the winter. [[Territory (animal)#Scent marking|Glandular secretions]] and scratching, other than for digging, are absent in communication.<ref name=clark />\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe bat-eared fox is predominantly socially [[Social monogamy in mammalian species|monogamous]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Harry WY |display-authors=et al | year = 2010 | title = Mating tactics and paternity in a socially monogamous canid, the bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis) | journal = Journal of Mammalogy | volume = 91 | issue = 2| pages = 437\u2013446 | doi=10.1644/09-mamm-a-046.1| doi-access = free }}</ref> although it has been observed in [[Polygyny in nature|polygynous]] groups. In contrast to other canids, the bat-eared fox has a reversal in parental roles, with the male taking on the majority of the parental care behavior. [[Gestation#Mammals|Gestation]] lasts for 60\u201370 days and females give birth to litters consisting of one to six kits. Beyond [[lactation]], which lasts 14 to 15 weeks,<ref name=clark/> males take over grooming, defending, huddling, chaperoning, and carrying the young between den sites. Additionally, male care and den attendance rates have been shown to have a direct correlation with cub survival rates.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Harry William Yorkstone|title=Paternal den attendance is the best predictor of offspring survival in the socially monogamous bat-eared fox|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=2006|volume=71|issue=3|pages=503\u2013510|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.03.043}}</ref> The female forages for food, which she uses to maintain milk production, on which the pups heavily depend.

Young bat-eared foxes disperse and leave their family groups at 5\u20136 months old and reach sexual maturity at 8\u20139 months.<ref name=clark />\n\n==Conservation threats==\n{{Wikispecies|Otocyon megalotis}}\n{{Commons category|Otocyon megalotis}}\nThe bat-eared fox has some commercial use for humans. They are important for [[harvester termite]] population control, as the termites are considered pests. They have also been hunted for their fur by Botswana natives.<ref name=clark /> Additional threats to populations include disease and drought that can harm populations of prey; however, no major threats to bat-eared fox populations exist.<ref name=iucn />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n{{Carnivora}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q200400}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:fox, bat-eared}}\n[[Category:Foxes|bat-eared fox]]\n[[Category:Carnivorans of Africa]]\n[[Category:Fauna of East Africa]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Southern Africa]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Angola]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Botswana]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Ethiopia]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Kenya]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Namibia]]\n[[Category:Mammals of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Tanzania]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Zambia]]\n[[Category:Myrmecophagous mammals]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1822|bat-eared fox]]\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "-> lower case", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-eared_fox"}
