Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the [[Middle Ages]], in which five generations of kings from two rival [[Dynasty|dynasties]] fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in [[Western Europe]]. The war marked both the height of [[chivalry]] and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong [[National identity|national identities]] in both countries.\n\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French ([[Normans|Norman]], and later, [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]]) in origin. English monarchs had therefore historically held [[Angevin Empire|titles and lands within France]], which made them [[vassal]]s to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French [[fief]]s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], an [[Auld Alliance|ally of France]]. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the [[Crown lands of France|French royal domain]]; by 1337, however, only [[Gascony]] was English.\n\nIn 1328, [[Charles IV of France]] died without sons or brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession. Charles's [[Proximity of blood|closest male relative]] was his nephew [[Edward III of England]], whose mother, [[Isabella of France]], was Charles's sister. Isabella [[English claims to the French throne|claimed the throne of France for her son]], but the French{{who|date=December 2019}} rejected it, maintaining that Isabella [[Nemo dat quod non habet|could not transmit a right she did not possess]]. Political sentiment favoured a Frenchman for the crown rather than a foreign prince. The throne passed instead to Charles's [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip]], [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]]. The English had not expected their claim to be successful and did not immediately challenge the succession.  French disagreements with Edward, however, induced Philip to confiscate Edward's lands in France, which then prompted Edward to reclaim the French throne.\n\nThe early years of the war saw resounding English successes (notably at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346 and at [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]] in 1356 where King [[John II of France]] was taken prisoner). But by 1378, the French under King [[Charles the Wise]] had reconquered most of the lands they lost in the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] (signed in 1360) leaving the English with only a few cities on the continent. In the following decades, the weakening of royal authority, combined with the loss of a third of the european population to the plague and a major economic crisis, led to a period of civil war in both countries, struggles from which England emerged first. The newly crowned [[Henry V of England]] seized the opportunity presented by the mental illness of [[Charles VI of France]] and the French civil war between Armagnacs and Burgundians to revive the conflict. Overwhelming victories at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] in 1415 and [[Battle of Verneuil|Verneuil]] in 1424 as well as an alliance with the Burgundians raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph and persuaded the English to continue the war over many decades. However, a variety of factors such as the death of both Henry V and the mad king Charles VI in 1422, the emergence of [[Joan of Arc]] which boosted French morale and the loss of [[Burgundian State|Burgundy]] as an ally, marking the end of the civil war in France, prevented it. The [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1429 announced the beginning of the end for English hopes of conquest. Even with the eventual capture of Joan by the Burgundians and her execution in 1431, series of crushing French victories such as those at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]] in 1429, [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]] in 1450 and [[Battle of Castillon|Castillon]] in 1453 concluded the war in favour of the Valois dynasty. England permanently lost most of its continental possessions, with only the [[Pale of Calais]] remaining under its control on the continent until the [[Siege of Calais (1558)|Siege of Calais]] in 1558.\n\nLater historians adopted the term \"Hundred Years' War\" as a historiographical [[periodisation]] to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in [[History of Europe|European history]], but they commonly divide the war into three phases separated by [[Ceasefire|truces]]: the [[Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)|Edwardian War]] (1337\u20131360), the [[Hundred Years' War (1369\u20131389)|Caroline War]] (1369\u20131389), and the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|Lancastrian War]] (1415\u20131453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the [[War of the Breton Succession]] (1341\u20131365), the [[Castilian Civil War]] (1366\u20131369), the [[War of the Two Peters]] (1356\u20131369) in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], and the [[1383\u201385 crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], were used by the parties to advance their agendas.\n\nBy the war's end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]], the war inspired [[French nationalism|French]] and [[English nationalism#Medieval|English]] [[nationalism]]. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the [[feudalism|feudal]] armies where [[heavy cavalry]] had dominated, and [[artillery]] became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first [[standing army|standing armies]] in Western Europe since the [[Western Roman Empire]], and helped change their [[Military science|role in warfare]]. In France, [[civil war]]s, deadly [[epidemic]]s, [[famine]]s, and bandit [[Free company|free-companies]] of [[Routiers|mercenaries]] reduced the population drastically. In England, political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of [[History of the British peerage|English nobles]], resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock at losing a war in which investment had been so great, helped lead to the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).poopi\n\n==Origin of the conflict==\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crises of 14th-century Europe]]. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England involving [[Gascony]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Scotland]]. The question that arose, was the official pretext due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\n\n===Dynastic turmoil in France: 1316\u20131328===\n<!-- This section is linked from Edward III of England -->\n{{Main|English claims to the French throne}}\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316. Louis X left only [[Joan II of Navarre|one daughter]], and [[John I of France]], who only lived for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the [[Tour de Nesle affair]]. Philip, [[Count of Poitiers]], brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as [[Philip V of France|Philip V]]. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], in 1322.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}\n\n{{chart/start|align=center|style=font-size:80%| summary=Boxes and lines diagram with 16 boxes}}\n{{chart | | | | | AAA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA='''[[Philip III of France|Philip III]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1270\u20131285}}\n{{chart | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{chart | EEE | |AAA2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FFF |EEE=[[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux]]<br />(1276\u20131319)|AAA2='''[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1285\u20131314|FFF=[[Charles, Count of Valois]]<br />(1270\u20131325)}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{chart | |!| | |AAA3 | | BBB | | CCC | | DDD |y|EEE2 | |FFF2 |AAA3='''[[Louis X of France|Louis X]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1314\u20131316|BBB='''[[Philip V of France|Philip V]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1316\u20131322|CCC='''[[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1322\u20131328|DDD=[[Isabella of France|Isabella]]|EEE2=[[Edward II of England|Edward II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England|FFF2='''[[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1328\u20131350}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | GGG |y|AAA4 | |BBB2 | | | | | | | |EEE3 | | | | | | |GGG=[[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of \u00c9vreux]]|AAA4=[[Joan II of Navarre]]|BBB2=[[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1308)|EEE3=[[Edward III of England|Edward III]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England<br />(born 1312)}}\n{{chart | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | | |AAA5 | | | |BBB3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA5=[[Charles II of Navarre|Charles II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of Navarre (1328-1425).svg|15px]] King of Navarre<br />(born 1332)|BBB3=[[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1323)}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nCharles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans|A girl]], Blanche of France later Duchess of Orleans,[https://books.google.ca/books?id=6VEdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT12&dq=Blanche+of+France,+Duchess+of+Orl%C3%A9ans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj53PSemtDoAhWxTd8KHa2mA7UQ6AEIEDAB#v=onepage&q=Blanche%20of%20France%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans&f=false] ended up being born, therefore rendering the main male line of the [[House of Capet]] extinct.\n\nBy [[proximity of blood]], the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, [[Edward III of England]]. Edward was the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, baulked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the [[University of Paris]] decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest [[Agnatic primogeniture|heir through male ancestry]] was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]], and it was decided that he should be crowned [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]. In 1340 the [[Avignon papacy]] confirmed that under [[Salic law]] males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1978|p=872}}\n\nEventually, Edward III reluctantly recognised Philip VI and paid him [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for his French fiefs. He made concessions in [[Guyenne]], but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made [[Second War of Scottish Independence|war on Scotland]].\n\n===The dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty===\n{{Main|Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry}}\n{{Further|Peerage of France}}\n\n[[File:Hommage d \u00c9douard Ier \u00e0 Philippe le Bel.jpg|thumb|Homage of [[Edward I of England]] (kneeling) to [[Philip IV of France]] (seated), 1286. As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was also a vassal to the French King. Illumination by [[Jean Fouquet]] from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France]], Paris.]]\nTensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 [[Norman conquest of England]], in which the [[Throne of England|English throne]] was seized by the [[Duke of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now draw upon the economic power of [[England]] to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchs]] would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[House of Normandy|dynasty]] that had ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when [[Henry II of England|Henry]], the son of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda]] and great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]], became the first of the [[Angevin kings of England]] in 1154 as Henry II.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=22}} The Angevin kings directly ruled over the [[Angevin Empire]], more French territory than the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. The Angevins still owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, neutralising the issue.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=17}}\n\n[[John, King of England|King John of England]] inherited the Angevin domains from his brother [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. However, [[Philip II of France]] acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and [[French invasion of Normandy (1202\u20131204)|by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions]]. Following John's reign, the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), the [[Saintonge War]] (1242), and finally the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as [[Duke of Aquitaine]] (Guyenne), were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.{{sfn|Gormley|2007}}\n\nThe dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognise the [[suzerainty]] of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.\n\nDuring the War of Saint-Sardos, [[Charles, Count of Valois|Charles of Valois]], father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by [[Edward II of England]]. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.\n\nThe King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus [[Agenais|Agen]]. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.\n\n===Gascony under the King of England===\n[[File:Guyenne 1328-en.svg|thumb|France in 1330.\n{{Legend|#4682B4|France before 1214}}\n{{Legend|#9370DB|French acquisitions until 1330}}\n{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and Guyenne/Gascony as of 1330}}\n]]\nIn the 11th century, [[Gascony]] in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as ''Guyenne'' or ''Guienne'') and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: ''Guyenne-et-Gascogne''). The [[Angevin kings of England]] became [[Dukes of Aquitaine]] after [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] married the former Queen of France, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French Crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}}{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}} At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin ([[Plantagenet]]) Kings of England in south-west France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nFor the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French [[suzerainty]]. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=194}} Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}}\n\nGascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was [[Robert III of Artois]]. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}}\n\n===Franco-Scot alliance===\n{{See also|Auld Alliance}}\nFrance was an ally of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, [[Auld Alliance|a treaty]] was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Charles IV formally [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|renewed the treaty]] in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom were attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=304\u2013305}}\n\nPhilip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish navy, moved to the [[English Channel]] off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}} To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots \"at a suitable time\", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=180}}\n\n==Beginning of the war: 1337\u20131360==\n\n===End of homage===\n\n{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)}}\n{{Campaignbox Edwardian War}}\n[[File:Hundred years war.gif|thumb|200px|right|Animated map showing progress of the war (territorial changes and the most important battles between 1337 and 1453).]]\nAt the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' [[Robert III of Artois|Robert d'Artois]].{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=184}} Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.{{sfn|Prestwich|2003|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nOn 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the [[Count of Flanders]]. The civic authorities of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]] and [[Bruges]] proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the [[Low Countries]]. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the \"true\" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}}\n\nRelations with Flanders were also tied to the [[Medieval English wool trade|English wool trade]], since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed.

The English army captured the completely unguarded [[Caen]] in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed.  He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked.\n\nThe [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the [[English longbow|longbowmen]] and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=318\u2013319}} Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England.

The forces of the ruler [[Peter of Castile]] were pitched against those of his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]]. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trast\u00e1mara in his invasion of Castile.{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nPeter appealed to England and Aquitaine's [[Black Prince]] for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile. Peter was restored to power after Trast\u00e1mara's army was defeated at the [[Battle of N\u00e1jera]].{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=78}}\n\n[[File:Du Guesclin Dinan.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Bertrand du Guesclin]] in [[Dinan]]]]\nAlthough the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castile campaign, the prince instituted a [[hearth tax]]. [[Arnaud Amanieu, Lord of Albret|Arnaud-Amanieu VIII]], Lord of [[Albret]] had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his High Court in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III resumed the title of King of France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}} Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=122}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nWith the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry de Trast\u00e1mara led a second invasion that ended with Peter's death at the [[Battle of Montiel]] in March 1369.

While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English met more resistance as they moved south. French forces began to concentrate around the English force but under orders from [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], the French avoided a set battle. Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves trapped against the [[Allier (river)|River Allier]] by four French forces. With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] but lost all their baggage and loot. The English carried on south across the [[Limousin]] plateau but the weather was turning severe. Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour. At the beginning of December, the army entered friendly territory in [[Gascony]]. By the end of December they were in [[Bordeaux]], starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais.

[[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority.\n\nWith France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the [[Harelle]] and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.\n\nDifficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through [[proxy war]]s, such as during the [[1383\u20131385 Portuguese interregnum]]. The independence party in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.\n\n==Second peace: 1389\u20131415==\n\n{{See also|Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War}}\n{{Campaignbox Owain Glynd\u0175r's Revolt}}\n[[File:Apanages.svg|thumb|France in 1388, just before signing a truce.

In 1414 while Henry held court at [[Leicester]], he received ambassadors from Burgundy.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}} Henry accredited envoys to the French king to make clear his territorial claims in France; he also demanded the hand of Charles VI's youngest daughter [[Catherine of Valois]]. The French rejected his demands, leading Henry to prepare for war.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\n==Resumption of the war under Henry V: 1415\u20131429==\n\n===Burgundian alliance and the seizure of Paris===\n\n====Battle of Agincourt (1415)====\n\n{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)}}\n{{Main|Battle of Agincourt}}\n{{Campaignbox Lancastrian War}}\nIn August 1415, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] sailed from England with a force of about 10,500 and laid siege to [[Harfleur]]. The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of [[Cr\u00e9cy]], he found himself outmanoeuvred and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], north of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]]. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing the lives of many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed.{{sfn|Turchin|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than there were soldiers in the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\n====Treaty of Troyes (1420)====\n{{Main|Treaty of Troyes}}\n\n[[File:Agincour.JPG|thumb|Fifteenth-century miniature depicting the [[Battle of Agincourt]] of 1415.]]\nHenry retook much of Normandy, including Caen in 1417, and [[Rouen]] on 19 January 1419, turning Normandy English for the first time in two centuries. A formal alliance was made with Burgundy, which had taken Paris after the assassination of Duke [[John the Fearless]] in 1419. In 1420, Henry met with King Charles VI. They signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France. The Dauphin, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], was declared illegitimate. Henry formally entered Paris later that year and the agreement was ratified by the [[French States-General|Estates-General]].{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\n====Death of Clarence (1421)====\nOn 22 March 1421 Henry V's progress in his French campaign experienced an unexpected reverse. Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]] in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing mel\u00e9e, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence. Once on the ground, the duke was slain by [[Sir Alexander Buchanan|Alexander Buchanan]].{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=44\u201345}} The body of the Duke of Clarence was recovered from the field by [[Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury]], who conducted the English retreat.{{sfn|Harriss|2010}}\n\n===English success===\n[[File:Clan member crest badge - Clan Carmichael.svg|thumb|[[Clan Carmichael]] crest with a broken lance commemorating the unseating of the [[Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence|Duke of Clarence]], leading to his death at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]].]]\nHenry V returned to France and went to Paris, then visiting Chartres and G\u00e2tinais before returning to Paris. From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of [[Meaux]]. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\nAt the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at [[Senlis]]. While there, it became apparent that he was ill (possibly [[dysentery]]), and when he set out to the Upper Loire, he diverted to the royal castle at Vincennes, near Paris, where he died on 31 August 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}} The elderly and insane Charles VI of France died two months later on 21 October 1422. Henry left an only child, his nine-month-old son, [[Henry VI of England|Henry]], later to become Henry VI.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}}\n\nOn his deathbed, Henry V had given the Duke of Bedford responsibility for English France (as Henry VI was only an infant). The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the [[Battle of Verneuil]] (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baug\u00e9, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army. The effect of the battle was to virtually destroy the Dauphin's field army and to eliminate the Scots as a significant military force for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=307\u2013308}}\n\n==French victory: 1429\u20131453==\n\n===Joan of Arc and French revival===\n[[File:Contemporaine afb jeanne d arc.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Joan of Arc]] (picture 1429)]]\n\nThe appearance of [[Joan of Arc]] at the [[siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] sparked a revival of French spirit, and the tide began to turn against the English.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The English laid [[siege]] to Orl\u00e9ans in 1428, but their force was insufficient to fully [[investment (military)|invest]] the city. In 1429 Joan persuaded the Dauphin to send her to the siege, saying she had received visions from God telling her to drive out the English. She raised the morale of the troops, and they attacked the English [[redoubt]]s, forcing the English to lift the siege. Inspired by Joan, the French took several English strongholds on the Loire.{{sfn|Davis|2003|pp=76\u201380}}\n\nThe English retreated from the Loire Valley, pursued by a French army. Near the village of [[Battle of Patay|Patay]], French cavalry broke through a unit of English longbowmen that had been sent to block the road, then swept through the retreating English army. The English lost 2,200 men, and the commander, [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]], was taken prisoner. This victory opened the way for the Dauphin to march to [[Reims]] for his coronation as Charles VII, on 16 July 1429.{{sfn|Davis|2003|pp=76\u201380}}<ref name=nrofast>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.norfolk.gov.uk/view/NCC110270 |title=Sir John Fastolf (MC 2833/1) |publisher=[[Norfolk Record Office]] |place=[[Norwich]] |accessdate=20 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923173236/http://www.archives.norfolk.gov.uk/view/NCC110270 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter the coronation, Charles VII's army fared less well. An attempted French [[Siege of Paris (1429)|siege of Paris]] was defeated on 8 September 1429, and Charles VII withdrew to the Loire Valley.{{sfn|Jaques|2007|p=777}}\n\n===Henry's coronations and the desertion of Burgundy===\n[[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] was crowned king of England at Westminster Abbey on 5 November 1429 and king of France at Notre-Dame, in Paris, on 16 December 1431.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}}\n\n[[File:Siege orleans.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|The first Western image of a battle with cannon: the [[Siege of Orleans|Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1429.

The Burgundians transferred her to the English, who organised a trial headed by [[Pierre Cauchon]], Bishop of Beauvais and member of the English Council at Rouen. Joan was convicted and burned at the stake on 30 May 1431.{{sfn|Davis|2003|pp=76\u201380}} (She was rehabilitated 25 years later by [[Pope Callixtus III]].)\n\nAfter the death of Joan of Arc, the fortunes of war turned dramatically against the English.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}} Most of Henry's royal advisers were against making peace. Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas [[Cardinal Beaufort]] was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]], in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, [[Philip the Good]], [[duke of Burgundy]], deserted to Charles VII, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]].{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n===French resurgence===\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 32.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Formigny]] (1450)]]\n\nThe allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=562}} The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use. A castle that once could only be captured after a prolonged siege would now fall after a few days from cannon bombardment. The French artillery developed a reputation as the best in the world.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\nBy 1449, the French had retaken [[Rouen]]. In 1450 the [[Counts of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis|Count of Clermont]] and [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany|Arthur de Richemont]], Earl of Richmond, of the Montfort family (the future [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany]]), caught an English army attempting to relieve Caen and defeated it at the [[Battle of Formigny]]. Richemont's force attacked the English army from the flank and rear just as they were on the verge of beating Clermont's army.{{sfn|Nicolle|2012|pp=26\u201335}}\n\n===French conquest of Gascony===\n[[File:Charles VII by Jean Fouquet 1445 1450.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles VII of France|Charles \"the Victorious\"]] by [[Jean Fouquet]]. [[Louvre]], Paris.]]\nAfter Charles VII's successful Normandy campaign in 1450, he concentrated his efforts on Gascony, the last province held by the English. Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Castillon]] on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordinance officer [[Jean Bureau]] and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}}\n\n===End of the war===\n{{Campaignbox Burgundian Wars}}\nAlthough the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}} England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Bordeaux fell to the French on 19 October 1453; there were no more hostilities afterwards. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]], that started in 1455.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}<ref name=webster39>\"Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France\" {{harv|Webster|1998|pp=39\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke [[Charles the Bold|Charles of Burgundy]], counting on English support, [[Burgundian Wars|took up arms]] against [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying [[Edward IV of England]] off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in the [[Treaty of Picquigny]] (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to [[English claims to the French throne|claim the title]] until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]], who was living in England after the [[French Revolution]].{{sfn|Neillands|2001|pp=290\u2013291}}\n\nSome [[historian]]s use the term \"The Second Hundred Years' War\" as a [[periodisation]] to describe the series of [[military conflict]]s between [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[France]] that occurred from about 1689 (or some say 1714) to 1815. <ref>Buffinton, Arthur H.

The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the [[Anglo-Norman language|French language in England]], which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.{{sfn|Janvrin|Rawlinson|2016|p=16}}\n\nNational feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further. Despite the devastation on its soil, the Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state.{{sfn|Holmes Jr.|Schutz|1948|p=61}} In England the political and financial troubles which emerged from the defeat were a major cause of the [[War of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).<ref name=webster39/>\n\n[[File:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|The spread of the [[Black Death]] (with modern borders)]]\nLowe (1997) argued that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war \u2013 sales taxes, debasing the coinage \u2013 and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowe|1997|pp=147\u2013195}}</ref>\n\nBubonic [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period.

The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as [[compagnies d'ordonnance]] on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors.<ref name=\"RolandPreston1991\">{{harvnb|Preston|Wise|Werner|1991|pp=84\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that [[warfare]] taught. The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.\n\nBy the war's end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armoured horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield.{{sfn|Powicke|1962|p=189}} The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as [[hobelar]]s. Hobelars' tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would dismount to engage the enemy.<ref name=\"RolandPreston1991\" /><ref name=rogers267>Colm McNamee.

Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the [[Middle Ages]], in which five generations of kings from two rival [[Dynasty|dynasties]] fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in [[Western Europe]]. The war marked both the height of [[chivalry]] and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong [[National identity|national identities]] in both countries.\n\nTensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French ([[Normans|Norman]], and later, [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]]) in origin. English monarchs had therefore historically held [[Angevin Empire|titles and lands within France]], which made them [[vassal]]s to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French [[fief]]s was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], an [[Auld Alliance|ally of France]]. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the [[Crown lands of France|French royal domain]]; by 1337, however, only [[Gascony]] was English.\n\nIn 1328, [[Charles IV of France]] died without sons or brothers and a new principle disallowed female succession. Charles's [[Proximity of blood|closest male relative]] was his nephew [[Edward III of England]], whose mother, [[Isabella of France]], was Charles's sister. Isabella [[English claims to the French throne|claimed the throne of France for her son]], but the French{{who|date=December 2019}} rejected it, maintaining that Isabella [[Nemo dat quod non habet|could not transmit a right she did not possess]]. Political sentiment favoured a Frenchman for the crown rather than a foreign prince. The throne passed instead to Charles's [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] cousin, [[Philip VI of France|Philip]], [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]]. The English had not expected their claim to be successful and did not immediately challenge the succession.  French disagreements with Edward, however, induced Philip to confiscate Edward's lands in France, which then prompted Edward to reclaim the French throne.\n\nThe early years of the war saw resounding English successes (notably at [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] in 1346 and at [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]] in 1356 where King [[John II of France]] was taken prisoner). But by 1378, the French under King [[Charles the Wise]] had reconquered most of the lands they lost in the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] (signed in 1360) leaving the English with only a few cities on the continent. In the following decades, the weakening of royal authority, combined with the loss of a third of the european population to the plague and a major economic crisis, led to a period of civil war in both countries, struggles from which England emerged first. The newly crowned [[Henry V of England]] seized the opportunity presented by the mental illness of [[Charles VI of France]] and the French civil war between Armagnacs and Burgundians to revive the conflict. Overwhelming victories at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]] in 1415 and [[Battle of Verneuil|Verneuil]] in 1424 as well as an alliance with the Burgundians raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph and persuaded the English to continue the war over many decades. However, a variety of factors such as the death of both Henry V and the mad king Charles VI in 1422, the emergence of [[Joan of Arc]] which boosted French morale and the loss of [[Burgundian State|Burgundy]] as an ally, marking the end of the civil war in France, prevented it. The [[Siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] in 1429 announced the beginning of the end for English hopes of conquest. Even with the eventual capture of Joan by the Burgundians and her execution in 1431, series of crushing French victories such as those at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]] in 1429, [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]] in 1450 and [[Battle of Castillon|Castillon]] in 1453 concluded the war in favour of the Valois dynasty. England permanently lost most of its continental possessions, with only the [[Pale of Calais]] remaining under its control on the continent until the [[Siege of Calais (1558)|Siege of Calais]] in 1558.\n\nLater historians adopted the term \"Hundred Years' War\" as a historiographical [[periodisation]] to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in [[History of Europe|European history]], but they commonly divide the war into three phases separated by [[Ceasefire|truces]]: the [[Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)|Edwardian War]] (1337\u20131360), the [[Hundred Years' War (1369\u20131389)|Caroline War]] (1369\u20131389), and the [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u20131453)|Lancastrian War]] (1415\u20131453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the [[War of the Breton Succession]] (1341\u20131365), the [[Castilian Civil War]] (1366\u20131369), the [[War of the Two Peters]] (1356\u20131369) in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], and the [[1383\u201385 crisis]] in [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], were used by the parties to advance their agendas.\n\nBy the war's end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a [[War of succession|dynastic conflict]], the war inspired [[French nationalism|French]] and [[English nationalism#Medieval|English]] [[nationalism]]. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the [[feudalism|feudal]] armies where [[heavy cavalry]] had dominated, and [[artillery]] became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first [[standing army|standing armies]] in Western Europe since the [[Western Roman Empire]], and helped change their [[Military science|role in warfare]]. In France, [[civil war]]s, deadly [[epidemic]]s, [[famine]]s, and bandit [[Free company|free-companies]] of [[Routiers|mercenaries]] reduced the population drastically. In England, political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of [[History of the British peerage|English nobles]], resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock at losing a war in which investment had been so great, helped lead to the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131487).\n\n==Origin of the conflict==\nThe root causes of the conflict can be traced to the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages|crises of 14th-century Europe]]. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England involving [[Gascony]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Scotland]]. The question that arose, was the official pretext due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty.\n\n===Dynastic turmoil in France: 1316\u20131328===\n<!-- This section is linked from Edward III of England -->\n{{Main|English claims to the French throne}}\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316. Louis X left only [[Joan II of Navarre|one daughter]], and [[John I of France]], who only lived for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the [[Tour de Nesle affair]]. Philip, [[Count of Poitiers]], brother of Louis X, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as [[Philip V of France|Philip V]]. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], in 1322.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}\n\n{{chart/start|align=center|style=font-size:80%| summary=Boxes and lines diagram with 16 boxes}}\n{{chart | | | | | AAA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA='''[[Philip III of France|Philip III]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1270\u20131285}}\n{{chart | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| }}\n{{chart | EEE | |AAA2 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FFF |EEE=[[Louis, Count of \u00c9vreux]]<br />(1276\u20131319)|AAA2='''[[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1285\u20131314|FFF=[[Charles, Count of Valois]]<br />(1270\u20131325)}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{chart | |!| | |AAA3 | | BBB | | CCC | | DDD |y|EEE2 | |FFF2 |AAA3='''[[Louis X of France|Louis X]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1314\u20131316|BBB='''[[Philip V of France|Philip V]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1316\u20131322|CCC='''[[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]]'''<br />{{nowrap|[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France}}<br />1322\u20131328|DDD=[[Isabella of France|Isabella]]|EEE2=[[Edward II of England|Edward II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England|FFF2='''[[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]'''<br />[[File:Blason pays fr FranceAncien.svg|15px]] King of France<br />1328\u20131350}}\n{{chart | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | GGG |y|AAA4 | |BBB2 | | | | | | | |EEE3 | | | | | | |GGG=[[Philip III of Navarre|Philip, Count of \u00c9vreux]]|AAA4=[[Joan II of Navarre]]|BBB2=[[Joan III, Countess of Burgundy|Joan of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1308)|EEE3=[[Edward III of England|Edward III]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of England (1198-1340).svg|15px]] King of England<br />(born 1312)}}\n{{chart | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{chart | | |AAA5 | | | |BBB3 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |AAA5=[[Charles II of Navarre|Charles II]]<br />[[File:Royal Arms of Navarre (1328-1425).svg|15px]] King of Navarre<br />(born 1332)|BBB3=[[Philip II, Count of Auvergne|Philip of Burgundy]]<br />(born 1323)}}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nCharles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. [[Blanche of France, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans|A girl]], Blanche of France later Duchess of Orleans,[https://books.google.ca/books?id=6VEdDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT12&dq=Blanche+of+France,+Duchess+of+Orl%C3%A9ans&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj53PSemtDoAhWxTd8KHa2mA7UQ6AEIEDAB#v=onepage&q=Blanche%20of%20France%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans&f=false] ended up being born, therefore rendering the main male line of the [[House of Capet]] extinct.\n\nBy [[proximity of blood]], the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, [[Edward III of England]]. Edward was the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, baulked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]], who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the [[University of Paris]] decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest [[Agnatic primogeniture|heir through male ancestry]] was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, [[Counts and dukes of Valois|Count of Valois]], and it was decided that he should be crowned [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]]. In 1340 the [[Avignon papacy]] confirmed that under [[Salic law]] males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.{{sfn|Brissaud|1915|pp=329\u2013330}}{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1978|p=872}}\n\nEventually, Edward III reluctantly recognised Philip VI and paid him [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for his French fiefs. He made concessions in [[Guyenne]], but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made [[Second War of Scottish Independence|war on Scotland]].\n\n===The dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty===\n{{Main|Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry}}\n{{Further|Peerage of France}}\n\n[[File:Hommage d \u00c9douard Ier \u00e0 Philippe le Bel.jpg|thumb|Homage of [[Edward I of England]] (kneeling) to [[Philip IV of France]] (seated), 1286. As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was also a vassal to the French King. Illumination by [[Jean Fouquet]] from the ''[[Grandes Chroniques de France]]'' in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France]], Paris.]]\nTensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 [[Norman conquest of England]], in which the [[Throne of England|English throne]] was seized by the [[Duke of Normandy]], a [[vassal]] of the [[List of French monarchs|King of France]]. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now draw upon the economic power of [[England]] to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the [[List of English monarchs|English monarchs]] would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] [[House of Normandy|dynasty]] that had ruled [[Kingdom of England|England]] since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when [[Henry II of England|Henry]], the son of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda]] and great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]], became the first of the [[Angevin kings of England]] in 1154 as Henry II.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=22}} The Angevin kings directly ruled over the [[Angevin Empire]], more French territory than the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]. The Angevins still owed [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, neutralising the issue.{{sfn|Bartlett|2000|p=17}}\n\n[[John, King of England|King John of England]] inherited the Angevin domains from his brother [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. However, [[Philip II of France]] acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and [[French invasion of Normandy (1202\u20131204)|by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions]]. Following John's reign, the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), the [[Saintonge War]] (1242), and finally the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as [[Duke of Aquitaine]] (Guyenne), were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.{{sfn|Gormley|2007}}\n\nThe dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognise the [[suzerainty]] of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.\n\nDuring the War of Saint-Sardos, [[Charles, Count of Valois|Charles of Valois]], father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by [[Edward II of England]]. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.\n\nThe King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus [[Agenais|Agen]]. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.\n\n===Gascony under the King of England===\n[[File:Guyenne 1328-en.svg|thumb|France in 1330.\n{{Legend|#4682B4|France before 1214}}\n{{Legend|#9370DB|French acquisitions until 1330}}\n{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and Guyenne/Gascony as of 1330}}\n]]\nIn the 11th century, [[Gascony]] in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as ''Guyenne'' or ''Guienne'') and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: ''Guyenne-et-Gascogne''). The [[Angevin kings of England]] became [[Dukes of Aquitaine]] after [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] married the former Queen of France, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French Crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}}{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}} At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin ([[Plantagenet]]) Kings of England in south-west France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.{{sfn|Prestwich|1988|p=298}}{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=292\u2013293}}\n\nFor the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French [[suzerainty]]. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|p=194}} Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=394}}\n\nGascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was [[Robert III of Artois]]. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}}\n\n===Franco-Scot alliance===\n{{See also|Auld Alliance}}\nFrance was an ally of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, [[Auld Alliance|a treaty]] was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Charles IV formally [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|renewed the treaty]] in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom were attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=304\u2013305}}\n\nPhilip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish navy, moved to the [[English Channel]] off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|p=306}} To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots \"at a suitable time\", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=180}}\n\n==Beginning of the war: 1337\u20131360==\n\n===End of homage===\n\n{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)}}\n{{Campaignbox Edwardian War}}\n[[File:Hundred years war.gif|thumb|200px|right|Animated map showing progress of the war (territorial changes and the most important battles between 1337 and 1453).]]\nAt the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' [[Robert III of Artois|Robert d'Artois]].{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=184}} Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.{{sfn|Prestwich|2003|pp=149\u2013150}}\n\nOn 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the [[Count of Flanders]]. The civic authorities of [[Ghent]], [[Ypres]] and [[Bruges]] proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the [[Low Countries]]. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the \"true\" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=307\u2013312}}\n\nRelations with Flanders were also tied to the [[Medieval English wool trade|English wool trade]], since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] sit on the [[woolsack]] in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.{{sfn|Friar|2004|pp=480\u2013481}} At the time there were about 110,000 [[History of Sussex#Wool|sheep in Sussex]] alone.<ref name=\"darby160\">R.E.Glassock.

The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of [[Sluis]]. The English fleet deceived the French into believing they were withdrawing. When the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the [[Battle of Sluys]].

The English army captured the completely unguarded [[Caen]] in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed.  He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked.\n\nThe [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the [[English longbow|longbowmen]] and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.{{sfn|Prestwich|2007|pp=318\u2013319}} Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England.

The forces of the ruler [[Peter of Castile]] were pitched against those of his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]]. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trast\u00e1mara in his invasion of Castile.{{sfn|Curry|2002|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nPeter appealed to England and Aquitaine's [[Black Prince]] for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile.

[[Arnaud Amanieu, Lord of Albret|Arnaud-Amanieu VIII]], Lord of [[Albret]] had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax.

While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English met more resistance as they moved south. French forces began to concentrate around the English force but under orders from [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], the French avoided a set battle. Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves trapped against the [[Allier (river)|River Allier]] by four French forces. With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at [[Moulins, Allier|Moulins]] but lost all their baggage and loot. The English carried on south across the [[Limousin]] plateau but the weather was turning severe. Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour. At the beginning of December, the army entered friendly territory in [[Gascony]]. By the end of December they were in [[Bordeaux]], starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais.

The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the [[Harelle]] and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.\n\nDifficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through [[proxy war]]s, such as during the [[1383\u20131385 Portuguese interregnum]]. The independence party in the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.\n\n==Second peace: 1389\u20131415==\n\n{{See also|Armagnac\u2013Burgundian Civil War}}\n{{Campaignbox Owain Glynd\u0175r's Revolt}}\n[[File:Apanages.svg|thumb|France in 1388, just before signing a truce.

The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of [[Cr\u00e9cy]], he found himself outmanoeuvred and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], north of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]].

They signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France.

Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]] in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] at the [[Battle of Baug\u00e9]]. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing mel\u00e9e, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence.

From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of [[Meaux]]. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}}\n\nAt the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at [[Senlis]]. While there, it became apparent that he was ill (possibly [[dysentery]]), and when he set out to the Upper Loire, he diverted to the royal castle at Vincennes, near Paris, where he died on 31 August 1422.{{sfn|Allmand|2010}} The elderly and insane Charles VI of France died two months later on 21 October 1422.

The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the [[Battle of Verneuil]] (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baug\u00e9, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army. The effect of the battle was to virtually destroy the Dauphin's field army and to eliminate the Scots as a significant military force for the rest of the war.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}}{{sfn|Wagner|2006|pp=307\u2013308}}\n\n==French victory: 1429\u20131453==\n\n===Joan of Arc and French revival===\n[[File:Contemporaine afb jeanne d arc.png|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Joan of Arc]] (picture 1429)]]\n\nThe appearance of [[Joan of Arc]] at the [[siege of Orl\u00e9ans]] sparked a revival of French spirit, and the tide began to turn against the English.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The English laid [[siege]] to Orl\u00e9ans in 1428, but their force was insufficient to fully [[investment (military)|invest]] the city.

Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas [[Cardinal Beaufort]] was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]], in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, [[Philip the Good]], [[duke of Burgundy]], deserted to Charles VII, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.{{sfn|Griffiths|2015}} The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]].{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n===French resurgence===\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 32.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Formigny]] (1450)]]\n\nThe allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France.{{sfn|Sumption|1999|p=562}} The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use.

The French artillery developed a reputation as the best in the world.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\nBy 1449, the French had retaken [[Rouen]].

[[Louvre]], Paris.]]\nAfter Charles VII's successful Normandy campaign in 1450, he concentrated his efforts on Gascony, the last province held by the English. Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Castillon]] on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordinance officer [[Jean Bureau]] and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}}\n\n===End of the war===\n{{Campaignbox Burgundian Wars}}\nAlthough the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=79}} England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Bordeaux fell to the French on 19 October 1453; there were no more hostilities afterwards. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]], that started in 1455.{{sfn|Lee|1998|pp=145\u2013147}}<ref name=webster39>\"Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France\" {{harv|Webster|1998|pp=39\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nThe Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke [[Charles the Bold|Charles of Burgundy]], counting on English support, [[Burgundian Wars|took up arms]] against [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]].

The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the [[Anglo-Norman language|French language in England]], which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.{{sfn|Janvrin|Rawlinson|2016|p=16}}\n\nNational feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further.

Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war \u2013 sales taxes, debasing the coinage \u2013 and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures.

The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as [[compagnies d'ordonnance]] on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own.

The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.\n\nBy the war's end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armoured horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield.{{sfn|Powicke|1962|p=189}} The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as [[hobelar]]s. Hobelars' tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century.

[[Queen Victoria]] had been on the throne of the United Kingdom since 1837. As is indicated by his last name, Duncan's father, Alexander, was an offshoot of the [[Clan Mackenzie|Mackenzie clan]], whose territory stretched in a band westward across Scotland. In the clan system, the chiefs, guardians of the clan, were generally well-to-do, holding clan lands in trust, but later appropriating them as private property. They resided in castles on estates. The rest of the clan members were not so, but tended to be poor families dependent in some way on the chiefs. Alexander held the position of gamekeeper of the Fairburn Estate, on which Aultgowrie was located. It was at the confluence of highland streams. The owners were the MacKenzies of Seaforth, a branch of the clan. They had a mill, and raised sheep.\n\nDuncan was the fourth of nine children of Alexander and his wife, Margaret Kennedy MacKenzie. He was named after his grandfather, Duncan. His mother was the eldest daughter of Murdoch Kennedy, a schoolteacher. The family spoke Gaelic at home. When they went to school they were required to learn English.<ref>{{harvnb|Momigliano|1999|p=7}}</ref> Duncan was thus raised in a large-family, bilingual environment.\n\nHe studied [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]; and received his [[PhD]] from [[Vienna]] in classical archaeology.\n\n==Professional career==\nAppointed field supervisor of the excavation of Phylakopi by the British School at Athens, he worked closely with a team of professional archaeologists including [[Arthur Evans]] and [[David George Hogarth]]. They were investigating the provenance of [[Mycenaean pottery]] as defined by Heinrich Schliemann. After a few years they realised that Phylakopi was not going to yield that information. The evidence pointed toward Crete. Evans and Hogarth left Phylakopi, while MacKenzie stayed on to wind the excavation down.\n\nWithin a few years the secession of Crete from the Ottoman Empire opened opportunities to excavate there. Hogarth was the first to discover it. He sent for Evans immediately, as the Phylakopi crew had been a very close-knit team. Purchasing the land at Knossos, Evans began excavation, sending for the third member of the team, MacKenzie, who took up his old position as supervisor of excavation. In her book on the Evans family (of which she was the latest member, being Arthur's half-sister), ''Time and Chance'', Joan Evans gives this verbal portrait of MacKenzie in his prime:\n:Mackenzie was a Scot with an inaudible Highland voice, a brush of red hair, an uncertain temper, a great command of languages, and great experience in keeping the records of an excavation. Arthur Evans recognised his gifts, and endured his suspicious temper and his valetudinarian ways with exemplary patience.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1943|p=329}}</ref>\n\nHogarth left for other excavations and then other careers, but Evans and MacKenzie collaborated so closely on the excavation of Knossos and theorisation about it that the ideas of the two men are not distinguishable from each other. MacKenzie kept the day book, or log of daily discoveries and served as a middle man between Evans and the inhabitants of [[Crete]]. MacKenzie also wrote contributions of his own. The British connotation of \"assistant\" does not convey the true relationship. A PhD and professional archaeologist in his own right, MacKenzie was every bit the peer of Evans, His position as second-in-command was only a social convention. The two would work together for the next thirty years, long after the excavation was complete (1905). MacKenzie remained as curator of the site, taking up residence in the new Villa Ariadne constructed as headquarters in 1906 on the hill above the site. Prior to then the archaeologists resided and worked in a Turkish house below the site, which leaked apparently irreparably and provided difficult access to the site.\n\n==Tales of the end==\nAccording to Evans, Mackenzie came to suffer from severe alcoholism and could not only no longer function as curator, but was fast declining into a demented state. Evans placed him in an institution, where he died not long after. Joan Evans reports that Mackenzie had become very difficult to work with during the latter years of his curatorship because of \"the gradual onset of his illness.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1943|p=390}}</ref> It has also been said that Evans found Mackenzie one night passed out on a table and fired him the next day.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} Friends of Mackenzie disputed this, saying he did not drink. Whether the problem was alcoholism, denied for some reason by his family, or one of the brain disorders often inflicting the elderly, which Duncan then was, or some combination, Joan adds that he died in 1935 in a state of \"mental aberration.\" \n\nWhatever they were, none of the final events can have been any surprise at all to Arthur, least of all any implication that Duncan was leading some sort of unknown alcoholic life until discovered suddenly one day lying in a stupor on a table. Long after the deaths of both men, after the decipherment of Linear B, attempts were made to insert an imaginary opposition and conflict between the two over the date of the Linear B tablets, which, in the slander, caused Arthur to discredit Duncan with malice aforethought and hustle him off the scene. During the lives of the two men is no indication at all in their writings of any such disagreement; moreover, Evans was of a highly charitable character, nor has the veracity of either man ever been questioned during his lifetime, as was Heinrich Schliemann's (from which he was vindicated).\n\n==Post-mortem dispute==\nAfter Mackenzie's death in [[Italy]], some of Evans' system of Minoan [[dating]] came into question. Mackenzie's meticulous work was the key witness in defence of Evans' work.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} Though there was conflict between Evans and Mackenzie, Evans respected Mackenzie for his contributions{{Fact|date=January 2009}} to the excavation and paid tribute to his right-hand man in the last volume of ''The Palace of Minos''.\n\n<!--Mackenzie, D., 1897a. \u2018Ancient Sites in Melos\u2019, BSA 3, 71\u201388.\nMackenzie, D., 1897b. \u2018Excavations of the British School at Melos: The Site of the \u201cThree Churches\u201d\u2019, JHS 17, 122\u201333.\n\nMackenzie, D., 1898a. \u2018Der Westfries von Gj\u00f6lbaschi\u2019, in Festschrift f\u00fcr Otto BenndorfzuSeinem 60.

[[Queen Victoria]] had been on the throne of the United Kingdom since 1837. As is indicated by his last name, Duncan's father, Alexander, was an offshoot of the [[Clan Mackenzie|Mackenzie clan]], whose territory stretched in a band westward across Scotland. In the clan system, the chiefs, guardians of the clan, were generally well-to-do, holding clan lands in trust, but later appropriating them as private property. They resided in castles on estates. The rest of the clan members were not so, but tended to be poor families dependent in some way on the chiefs. Alexander held the position of gamekeeper of the Fairburn Estate, on which Aultgowrie was located. It was at the confluence of highland streams. The owners were the MacKenzies of Seaforth, a branch of the clan. They had a mill, and raised sheep.\n\nDuncan was the fourth of nine children of Alexander and his wife, Margaret Kennedy MacKenzie. He was named after his grandfather, Duncan. His mother was the eldest daughter of Murdoch Kennedy, a schoolteacher. The family spoke Gaelic at home. When they went to school they were required to learn English.<ref>{{harvnb|Momigliano|1999|p=7}}</ref> Duncan was thus raised in a large-family, bilingual environment.\n\nHe studied [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]; and received his [[PhD]] from [[Vienna]] in classical archaeology.\n\n==Professional career==\nAppointed field supervisor of the excavation of Phylakopi by the British School at Athens, he worked closely with a team of professional archaeologists including [[Arthur Evans]] and [[David George Hogarth]]. They were investigating the provenance of [[Mycenaean pottery]] as defined by Heinrich Schliemann. After a few years they realised that Phylakopi was not going to yield that information. The evidence pointed toward Crete. Evans and Hogarth left Phylakopi, while MacKenzie stayed on to wind the excavation down.\n\nWithin a few years the secession of Crete from the Ottoman Empire opened opportunities to excavate there. Hogarth was the first to discover it. He sent for Evans immediately, as the Phylakopi crew had been a very close-knit team. Purchasing the land at Knossos, Evans began excavation, sending for the third member of the team, MacKenzie, who took up his old position as supervisor of excavation. In her book on the Evans family (of which she was the latest member, being Arthur's half-sister), ''Time and Chance'', Joan Evans gives this verbal portrait of MacKenzie in his prime:\n:Mackenzie was a Scot with an inaudible Highland voice, a brush of red hair, an uncertain temper, a great command of languages, and great experience in keeping the records of an excavation. Arthur Evans recognised his gifts, and endured his suspicious temper and his valetudinarian ways with exemplary patience.<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1943|p=329}}</ref>\n\nHogarth left for other excavations and then other careers, but Evans and MacKenzie collaborated so closely on the excavation of Knossos and theorisation about it that the ideas of the two men are not distinguishable from each other. MacKenzie kept the day book, or log of daily discoveries and served as a middle man between Evans and the inhabitants of [[Crete]]. MacKenzie also wrote contributions of his own. The British connotation of \"assistant\" does not convey the true relationship. A PhD and professional archaeologist in his own right, MacKenzie was every bit the peer of Evans, His position as second-in-command was only a social convention. The two would work together for the next thirty years, long after the excavation was complete (1905). MacKenzie remained as curator of the site, taking up residence in the new Villa Ariadne constructed as headquarters in 1906 on the hill above the site. Prior to then the archaeologists resided and worked in a Turkish house below the site, which leaked apparently irreparably and provided difficult access to the site.\n\n==Tales of the end==\nAccording to Evans, Mackenzie came to suffer from severe alcoholism and could not only no longer function as curator, but was fast declining into a demented state. Evans placed him in an institution, where he died not long after. Joan Evans reports that Mackenzie had become very difficult to work with during the latter years of his curatorship because of \"the gradual onset of his illness.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1943|p=390}}</ref> It has also been said that Evans found Mackenzie one night passed out on a table and fired him the next day.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} Friends of Mackenzie disputed this, saying he did not drink. Whether the problem was alcoholism, denied for some reason by his family, or one of the brain disorders often inflicting the elderly, which Duncan then was, or some combination, Joan adds that he died in 1935 in a state of \"mental aberration.\" \n\nWhatever they were, none of the final events can have been any surprise at all to Arthur, least of all any implication that Duncan was leading some sort of unknown alcoholic life until discovered suddenly one day lying in a stupor on a table. Long after the deaths of both men, after the decipherment of Linear B, attempts were made to insert an imaginary opposition and conflict between the two over the date of the Linear B tablets, which, in the slander, caused Arthur to discredit Duncan with malice aforethought and hustle him off the scene. During the lives of the two men is no indication at all in their writings of any such disagreement; moreover, Evans was of a highly charitable character, nor has the veracity of either man ever been questioned during his lifetime, as was Heinrich Schliemann's (from which he was vindicated).\n\n==Post-mortem dispute==\nAfter Mackenzie's death in [[Italy]], some of Evans' system of Minoan [[dating]] came into question. Mackenzie's meticulous work was the key witness in defence of Evans' work.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} Though there was conflict between Evans and Mackenzie, Evans respected Mackenzie for his contributions{{Fact|date=January 2009}} to the excavation and paid tribute to his right-hand man in the last volume of ''The Palace of Minos''.\n\n<!--Mackenzie, D., 1897a. \u2018Ancient Sites in Melos\u2019, BSA 3, 71\u201388.\nMackenzie, D., 1897b. \u2018Excavations of the British School at Melos: The Site of the \u201cThree Churches\u201d\u2019, JHS 17, 122\u201333.\n\nMackenzie, D., 1898a. \u2018Der Westfries von Gj\u00f6lbaschi\u2019, in Festschrift f\u00fcr Otto BenndorfzuSeinem 60.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle.

Nevertheless, Koli pirates were notorious and a challenge for maritime powers. On the 21st January 1739, Koli pirates with some [[Siddi|Siddis]] of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] captured several British vessels, among one of which was the '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After a few years in 1749, Koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>', carrying sixty thousand pounds cash and [[cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for the British government, and after that the ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against Koli pirates. In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli. Some do not refer to themselves as Koli at all.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=221|ps=}}\n\n== Military Involvement ==\n[[File:Samadhi Of Tanaji Malusare.jpg|thumb|Samadhi of Maratha Koli general ''Sardar Tanajirao Malusare]]\n[[File:Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre I.jpg|thumb|''Sarkhel Kanhoji Raje Angre'', Maratha Koli admiral of Maratha Navy]]\nThe kolis as soldiers served in the all of the [[Princely state|Princely States]] of Gujarat.

By the year 1734, Kolis of Gujarat were well engaged in piracy. They were well known for their infamous activities at sea. The [[Royal Indian Navy|British Navy]] under Radford Nunn attacked Koli pirates and burnt nineteen armed vessels and fifty smalls of Koli pirates after six months, and ten more vessels were fired by British. Nevertheless, Koli pirates were notorious and a challenge for maritime powers. On the 21st January 1739, Koli pirates with some [[Siddi|Siddis]] of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] captured several British vessels, among one of which was the '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After a few years in 1749, Koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>', carrying sixty thousand pounds cash and [[cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for the British government, and after that the ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against Koli pirates. In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time. It seems that ''Koli Piracy'' was a headache for all naval powers of India.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saletore|first=Rajaram Narayan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1PVMMoChwY4C&dq=Koli+Pirate&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Indian Pirates|date=1978|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPrincely states of [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]] and [[Bhavnagar State|Bhavnagar]] also suffered Koli piracy.

The Civic was available as a two- or four-door fastback sedan, three- and a five-door [[hatchback]], as well as a five-door station wagon. Due to the [[1973 oil crisis]], consumer demand for fuel efficient vehicles was high, and due to the engine being able to run on either leaded or unleaded fuel, it gave drivers fuel choice flexibility over other vehicles. The [[CVCC]] engine debuted in December 1973, with a head design that allowed for more efficient combustion, and as a benefit the CVCC system did not require a [[catalytic converter]] or unleaded fuel to meet 1975 Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.<ref name=DriveCult>{{cite web |last=Wolfcale |first=James |title=The Top Ten Hondas of All Time |url=http://www.drivecult.com/features/the-top-ten-hondas-of-all-time |work=DriveCult |accessdate=26 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224081808/http://www.drivecult.com/features/the-top-ten-hondas-of-all-time |archive-date=24 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Civic was joined by a platform expansion of the three-door hatchback, called the [[Honda Accord]] in 1976.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1979\u20131983) ==\n{{main article| Honda Civic (second generation)}}\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = Honda Civic arriving Schaffen-Diest 2018 (cropped).jpg\n| image2 = 1982 Honda Civic 3-door hatchback (2015-07-14) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = Second-generation Civic hatchback\n}}\n\nThe second generation Honda Civic was introduced in June 1979 as a 1980 model.

The separate five-door hatchback and wagon models were merged into a five-door \"shuttle wagon\" or \"wagovan\" sometimes referred to colloquially as a \"breadbox\" due to its appearance, called the [[Honda Civic (third generation)#Shuttle/Wagon|Honda Civic Shuttle]]. An additional two-seat coupe style\u2014labeled [[Honda Civic CRX|CRX]]\u2014was introduced, noted for its compact dimensions and light weight. The third generation Civic saw the introduction of the long running four-cylinder [[Honda D engine|D series engine]] including a new {{convert|1.5|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[CVCC]] engine producing 76 HP. 1984 also saw the release of a high-performance [[Honda Civic Si|Si]] model for the Japanese market, featuring upgraded suspension and the {{convert|1.6|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Dohc#Double overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Honda D engine#ZC(similar to D16Y4, D16A8, D16Z6, D16A1, D16A3, D16A6, D16A9, and D16Z5 engines)|ZC engine]] which was rated at 130 PS (128 HP).

A [[4WD]] engine with different transmission mounts was introduced for the first time in 1984, and later upgraded in 1987. It delivered a fuel economy of around 28 mpg highway. The 4WD system was push-button operated until improved in 1987 when the rear wheels would engage automatically once the front wheels lost traction. This new system was called \"Realtime\" which used a \"viscous coupler\" connecting two propeller shafts between the front and rear axles. The manual transmission featured a synchronized 6th gear, called \"SL\", or \"Super-Low\", which was used for high torque at very low speeds. The \"Realtime\" idea is still utilized to this day but includes technological improvements since the first system. Starting with 1985, Japanese Civics were now exclusive to ''[[Honda Primo]]'', with variants sold at ''Honda Verno'' and ''Honda Clio''. A four-door version called the Ballade was built, under agreement, by [[Mercedes-Benz]] South Africa, models were 1300, 1500, 1500i and 1600i DOHC 1.6 injection.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation (1987\u20131991) ==\n{{main article|Honda Civic (fourth generation)}}\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1991 Honda Civic (ED) GL sedan (2015-06-25) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1991 Honda Civic (ED) GL sedan (2015-06-25) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = Fourth-generation Civic sedan\n}}\n\nIn September 1987, a redesigned Civic was introduced with increased dimensions and a lower hood line.

The wagon variant was now only available in the Japanese market where the previous generation wagon was carried over until 1995. The efficiency of the previous HF model was replaced by the VX hatchback which, with an EPA rating of 48/55 [[Fuel economy in automobiles|MPG]], was Honda's most fuel efficient model sold at the time. In North America the Si featured a [[SOHC]] [[VTEC]] valve train, whereas the VX featured the [[VTEC#SOHC VTEC-E|VTEC-E]]. The Japanese Si featured a [[DOHC]] non-VTEC valve train [[Honda D engine#D16|D16A9]]. Continuing in the sporty tradition of the original Civic SiR, Honda sold several similarly equipped variants of the fifth generation car, still referred to as the Civic SiR, in Japan, Asia and Europe. In South Africa, MBSA (Mercedes Benz of SA) built the Civic as the Ballade only in 4-door sedan. A special model was the 180i with the B18B4, that was fitted to Ballade models. A new body style was introduced with this generation called the Civic Coup\u00e9, based from the Civic Ferio sedan, and was sold in North America, Europe and Japan.

In the United States, model year 1996 to 2000 the Civic was sold under the CX, DX, EX, EXR, HX, LX, and for Canada, SE, and Si trims; all base models were made with 1.6-liter engines. The EX-CX are all SOHC ([[Honda D engine]]). The CX, DX and LX all have D16Y7 non-VTEC engines; whereas the EX has a D16Y8 VTEC, and the HX has D16Y5 VTEC-E. The USDM Si and Canadian SiR came with a DOHC (B16A2 VTEC). The first Civic Si coupe EM1 was introduced in 1999 until 2000. Europe saw a DOHC 1.6 VTi hatch and sedan and a DOHC 1.8L engine was available for the Domani related five-door liftback and estate.

While the redesign retained the previous generation's exterior dimensions, interior space was improved in part by using a flat rear floor thus bumping up Civic to a [[compact car]] size segment. The front suspension was changed from that of a [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] to a [[MacPherson strut]], in order to lower costs, as well as allow more engine bay room for the newly introduced [[Honda K engine|Honda K-series engine]]. Power was also increased on some trim levels. The four main trim levels were DX, LX, EX and HX. The Civic Coupe was no longer sold in Japan starting with this generation.\n\nIn North America, coupe and sedan body styles were available, except for the Si (SiR in Canada) which was offered only as a three-door hatchback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/honda/civic/2003/ |title=2003 Honda Civic Review |publisher=JB car pages |accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> The rest of the world received three- and five-door hatchbacks.

For the eighth generation, Honda split the model into two different platforms, one for sedan and coupe, and one for a hatchback designed primarily for the European market using a simpler rear suspension from the [[Honda Fit]] and more aggressive styling. As of 2006, a total of 16.5&nbsp;million Civics had been sold worldwide, with 7.3&nbsp;million of them in the United States.<ref name=\"Joe G.

Both Si and Type R trim levels continued although the Japanese and European Type R, while sharing the same engine size, are mechanically different. In the United States, an improved, sportier version of the Civic Si 4-door tuned by tuner [[Mugen Motorsports|Mugen]] was offered, featuring cosmetic alterations and changes to the suspension, wheels, slight exterior differences, and exhaust system. A Canadian only Acura model received a new nameplate, changing from the [[Acura EL]] to the [[Acura CSX]].

The front of the car features a new chrome wing design that flows across the top of the headlamps.\n\nThe interior of the new Civic likewise features major design changes. Unlike the split bi-level speedometer and tachometer of its predecessor, the EX and above trim levels of the tenth generation Civic consolidates these instruments into a fully customisable, all digital \"Driver Information Interface\" incorporating a 7-inch LCD screen positioned directly behind the steering wheel and in the driver's line of sight.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.netcarshow.com/honda/2016-civic_sedan/ |title=Honda Civic Sedan (2016)|publisher=}}</ref> The LX trim instrumentation consists of a large analog tachometer that surrounds a digital speedometer and other digital displays.\n\nCivic variants include sedan, coupe, five-door hatchback, [[Honda Civic Si|Si trims]] and [[Honda Civic Type R|Type-R models]].\n\nHonda claims the tenth generation Civic Si trim (which is the eighth generation of Civic to offer an Si trim level) reaches 60mph from 0mph in 7.0 seconds,<ref>{{cite web |last=Siler |first=Steve |title=2017 Honda Civic First Drive Review |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15095562/2017-honda-civic-si-first-drive-review/ |publisher=Car&Driver |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref> though [[Car and Driver]] was able to bring a 2017 Civic Si Coupe to 60mph in 6.3 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gall |first=Jared |title=2017 Honda Civic Coupe Test Review |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15091840/2017-honda-civic-si-coupe-test-review/ |publisher=[[Car and Driver]] |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 Civic Si also features adaptive dampers, stiffening of other suspension components, including mounting points, anti-roll bars, springs and bushings.\n\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = horizontal | width = 220\n| image1 = 2017 Honda Civic VTi-S sedan (2018-08-27) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2017 Honda Civic VTi-S sedan (2018-08-27) 02.jpg\n| caption1 = Tenth-generation Civic VTi-S sedan\n| image3 = 2017 Honda Civic EX VTEC CVT 1.0 Rear.jpg\n| caption3 = Tenth-generation Civic hatchback\n| image4 = 2017 Honda Civic LX coupe rear 1.23.19.jpg\n| caption4 = Tenth-generation Civic coup\u00e9\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== International marketing and platform derivatives ==\n[[File:BSB Flex cars 13 09 2008 Honda Flex logo zoom.jpg|thumb|The Civic has been sold in Brazil since late 2006 with a [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel engine]] capable of running on either gasoline or [[ethanol (fuel)|ethanol]] or any blend of both.]]\n\nWhile the Civic is sold in largely the same form worldwide, differences in the name of the models exist between markets. In Japan, the [[hatchback]] Civic is just called \"Civic\" while the sedan model was called the '''Civic Ferio''' ({{lang-ja|[[:ja:\u30db\u30f3\u30c0\u30fb\u30b7\u30d3\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a7\u30ea\u30aa|\u30b7\u30d3\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a7\u30ea\u30aa]]}}) during the fifth to seventh generations. The sixth-generation sedan was also sold as the [[Honda Integra#Integra SJ|Integra SJ]]. In Europe and the United States, \"Civic\" generically refers to any model, though in Europe the coupe is branded the \"Civic Coupe\". A four-door [[station wagon]] model called the Civic Shuttle (also Civic Pro in Japan) was available from 1984 until 1991 (this brand name would later be revived for the mid-1990s Honda Shuttle people carrier, known in some markets as the [[Honda Stream]]). In South Africa, the sedan (the only model sold there until the 1996 launch of the sixth generation sedan and hatch) was known as the [[Honda Ballade|Ballade]].\n[[File:Honda Civic Hybrid 5171 DCA 03 2009 badging zoom in.jpg|thumb|upright|left|First-generation [[Honda Civic Hybrid]] (U.S.)]]\nOther models have been built on the Civic platform, including [[Honda Prelude|Prelude]], [[Honda Ballade|Ballade]], [[Honda CRX|CR-X]], [[Honda Quint|Quint]], [[Honda Concerto|Concerto]], [[Honda Domani|Domani]], [[Honda Del Sol|CR-X Del Sol]], [[Honda Integra|Integra]], and [[Honda CR-V|CR-V]].\n\nAlso, at various times, the Civic or Civic-derived models have been sold by marques other than Honda&nbsp;\u2013 for example, [[Rover (marque)|Rover]] sold the [[Rover 200|200]], [[Rover 400|400]] and [[Rover 45|45]], each of which were Civic-based at some point (first 200s were the second generation Ballade; from 1990 the 200 and 400 were based on the Concerto; the 400 was the 1995 Domani), as was their predecessor, the [[Triumph Acclaim]], based on the first Honda Ballade. The Honda Domani, an upscale model based on the Civic, was sold as the [[Isuzu Gemini]] in Japan (1992\u20132000), and confusingly the 5-door Domani was sold as the Honda Civic (along with the \"real\" hatchback and sedan Civics) in Europe from 1995 to 2000. In Thailand, the sixth generation Civic was available as the four-door Isuzu Vertex. The sixth-generation station wagon was sold as the [[Honda Orthia]], with the Partner as the downmarket commercial variant. The seventh generation minivan model is called the [[Honda Stream]]. In Canada, the sixth and seventh generation Civics were mildly redesigned to create the [[Acura EL]] until the advent of the eight generation Civic, which was used to create the [[Acura CSX]], which was designed in Canada. Honda Japan adopted the CSX styling for the Civic in its home country.\n[[File:2012 Honda Civic GX CNG WAS 2012 0823.JPG|thumb|Ninth-generation [[Honda Civic GX]] (U.S.) with the blue diamond CNG sticker and the new natural gas badging.]]\nThe three-door hatchback body style has been somewhat unpopular in the United States, but has achieved wide acceptance in Canada, as well as popularity in Japan and European markets, helping cement Honda's reputation as a maker of sporty [[compact car|compact]] models. Starting in 2002, the Civic three-door hatchback has been built exclusively at Honda's manufacturing plant in [[Swindon]], England<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041105092934/http://www.mfg.honda.co.uk/Internet/HUM00254.nsf/All/5DEBYCJSEO?opendocument |url=http://www.mfg.honda.co.uk/Internet/HUM00254.nsf/All/5DEBYCJSEO?opendocument |title=HUM: Civic |publisher=Honda of the UK |accessdate=29 November 2014 |archivedate=5 November 2004}}</ref> \u2013 previously the five-door Civic/Domani and the Civic Aerodeck (based on the Japanese Orthia) were built in this plant for sale in Europe along with the Japanese Civics. Accordingly, all instances of the current model (left or right hand drive, anywhere in the world) are British-made cars designed with Japanese engineering, except for the US-built two-door coupe and the sedan version built in Brazil for the Latin American market.\n\nIn North America, the Civic hatchback was dropped for 2006. The 2006 model year standard Civics for North America are manufactured in [[Alliston]], Ontario, Canada (sedans, coupes and Si Coupes) and [[East Liberty, Ohio|East Liberty]], Ohio (sedans), while the Hybrid version is manufactured in Japan.\n\nIn Brazil, although being considered for local manufacturing since the early 1980s (it was illegal to import cars in Brazil from 1973 until 1990), the Civic wasn't available until 1992, via official importing. In 1997, production of the sixth generation Civic sedan started in the [[Sumar\u00e9]] (a city near Campinas, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo) factory. The only differences between the Japanese model and the Brazilian model were a slightly higher ground clearance, due to the country's road conditions and adaptations to make the engine suitable to Brazilian commercial gasoline, which contains about 25% [[ethanol fuel|ethanol (E25)]], and the absence of sunroof in the Brazilian sixth generation Civic EX. The seventh generation production started in 2001, displacing the [[Chevrolet Vectra]] from the top sales record for the mid-size sedan segment, however it lost that position to the [[Toyota Corolla]] the following year. In 2006, the eighth generation was released and regained the sales leadership. Identical to the North American version, it lacks options such a moonroof, and standard security equipment like VSA and side and curtain airbags were removed due to lack of car safety laws in the Mercosur. Furthermore, the Brazilian subsidiary began producing [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] versions for the Civic and the [[Honda Fit|Fit]] models, capable of running on any blend of gasoline ([[w:Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20|E20 to E25 blend]] in Brazil) and [[ethanol (fuel)|ethanol]] up to [[Neat alcohol fuel|E100]].<ref>{{cite web

Starting with the fourth generation and continuing through the 2000 model year, Civics had front [[double wishbone suspension]] and rear semi-trailing arm suspension.

From 1972 to 1974, the Civic was awarded [[Car of the Year Japan]]. In 1973, the Civic ranked third in the [[European Car of the Year]] awards, the highest ranking for a Japanese vehicle at that time. It also was awarded the U.S. ''Road Test'' magazine's \"1974 Car of the Year.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=First Generation (1972) |publisher=Honda Worldwide |url=http://world.honda.com/CIVIC/generation01/ |accessdate=5 November 2006}}</ref> The Civic was the ''[[Motor Trend]]'' [[Car of the Year|Import Car of the Year]] for 1980<ref>{{cite web |title=Second Generation (1972) |publisher=Honda Worldwide |url=http://world.honda.com/CIVIC/generation02/ |accessdate=5 November 2006}}</ref>\nas well as its 2006 [[Car of the Year]]. In 2006, the Civic earned the 2007 \"[[Semperit Irish Car of the Year]]\" title. In 1996, Automobile Magazine honored the Civic as its Automobile of the Year. The Civic has been on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's yearly [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best]] list six times, in 1985, 1988\u201391, and 1996. The Civic Si was named \"Best New Sport Car\" and the sedan was named \"Best New Economy Car\" in the 2006 [[Canadian Car of the Year]] awards. The Civic also won the ''[[North American Car of the Year]]'' and the [[North American International Auto Show]] (NAIAS) Car of the Year awards for 2006. In November 2006, the Civic received the prestigious \"Car of The Year\" award from Brazilian magazine Auto Esporte.\nThe four-door Civic VXi sedan won the [[South African Car of the Year]] award for 2007.\n\n== Racing ==\n{{See also|Honda in motorsport}}\n=== Touring car racing ===\nCivics have been used for racing ever since their introduction.\n\nCivics contested the Up to 1300cc class in the [[Bathurst 1000]] touring car race at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in Australia each year from 1973 to 1976, with a best placing of second in class in both 1974 and 1976.<ref>Bill Tuckey, Australia's Greatest Motor Race, 1981</ref>\n\nIn recent years the Civic has been used in a wide variety of racing series, particularly in Japan. It is also used in touring car races in Europe and the United States. The Civic has been used in the UK in endurance series by teams such as Barwell Motorsport and Cartek Motorsport.\n\nIn 2002 JAS Motorsport entered the [[European Touring Car Championship]] (ETCC) with a [[Super 2000]] spec Civic and was used until restart season of the [[World Touring Car Championship]] (WTCC) in [[2005 World Touring Car Championship season|2005]].\n\nIn December 2005, on the date of the new 2006 Civic Si's launch in the United States, Honda's R&D Engineering Team completed 645 laps in an eighth generation Civic Si coupe (FG2) to place first in the E1 class of the famous '25 Hours of [[Thunderhill Raceway Park|Thunderhill]]' marathon race.

The Civic Type R made its debut in the [[2002 British Touring Car Championship season|2002 season]] with the 'Works' team run by [[Arena Motorsport]]. Built to [[BTC Touring|BTC-T]] specifications, it gained the team third in the manufacturers championship. In the same year Synchro Motorsport won the BTCC Production Teams Championship with a pair of Civic Type Rs.\n\nThe [[2003 British Touring Car Championship season|2003 season]] saw the 'works' team Civics secure an impressive second in the manufacturers championship. The 2003 BTCC Production Teams Championship also went to the Civic again, this time in the hands of Barwell Motorsport.\n\nSuch was the competitiveness of the Civic in its first two-season, [[2004 British Touring Car Championship season|2004]] saw five teams enter Civics, allowing the model to secure second in the manufacturers championship.\n\nAlthough manufacturer support from Honda for the BTCC ended in 2005, several teams still found success running the Civic in [[2005 British Touring Car Championship season|2005]] and [[2006 British Touring Car Championship season|2006]].\n\n[[File:Gordon Shedden - 2017 BTCC Knockhill (Saturday, FP2).jpg|thumb|Gordon Shedden's FK2 Civic Type R at [[Knockhill Racing Circuit|Knockhill]] in 2017]]\nFor the [[2007 British Touring Car Championship season|2007 BTCC season]], [[Team Dynamics|Team Halfords]] ran the new [[Honda Civic (eighth generation)|eighth-generation Honda Civics]], built to the latest [[Super 2000|S2000]] regulations, for [[Matt Neal]] and [[Gordon Shedden]] with limited success and continued to use the Civic into the [[2008 British Touring Car Championship season|2008]] and [[2009 British Touring Car Championship season|2009 season]]. In both 2007 and 2008, the Civic allowed the team to finish 3rd in the Teams championship, behind the two manufacturer backed teams.\n\nIn 2010 Honda returned to the BTCC as a 'works' team with [[Team Dynamics]] using Civics to win the [[2010 British Touring Car Championship season|2010 manufacturers championship]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.btcc.net/html/generalnews_detail.php?id=2180&month=0&year=2010 |title=Honda sticks to a winning team |date=22 October 2010 |publisher=btcc |accessdate=17 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919205315/http://www.btcc.net/html/generalnews_detail.php?id=2180&month=0&year=2010 |archivedate=19 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn [[2011 British Touring Car Championship season|2011]] the team returns with its Civic to defend its Team and Manufacturers championship again with the [[Matt Neal|Neal]] and [[Gordon Shedden|Shedden]] pairing.\n\n[[Team Dynamics|Honda Racing Team]] swapped to the brand new [[Honda Civic (ninth generation)|ninth generation Honda Civic]], built fully to [[Next Generation Touring Car|NGTC]] rules, for the [[2012 British Touring Car Championship season|2012 BTCC season]].

It became one of the most influential automotive designs of the 1970s, with the [[Volkswagen Golf]] (1974), [[Ford Fiesta]] (1976), and [[Fiat Ritmo]] (1978) showing similarities as transverse-FF, truncated-trapezoidal hatchbacks occupying a size niche between minicars and compact sedans. Honda would later expand the Civic's FF-compact design to produce the larger and more upmarket [[Honda Accord|Accord]] (1976) and [[Honda Prelude|Prelude]] (1978) models. In Japan, the Civic was the first fully modern compact car in the European style, offering a level of prestige never before seen in this class in the market. The Civic quickly inspired Japanese domestic manufacturers to respond in kind, with models like the [[Mazda Familia#FA4|Mazda Familia AP]], [[Daihatsu Charade]], and [[Mitsubishi Mirage]].<ref name=CS21>{{cite journal | ref = CS21 | journal = Title: Car Styling Quarterly | number = 21 | publisher = San-ei Shobo Publishing | location = Tokyo, Japan | date = January 1978 | title = Japanese Cars 1978 | editor-first = Akira | editor-last = Fujimoto | page = 54 }}</ref>\n\n== First generation (1972\u20131979) ==\n{{main article|Honda Civic (first generation)}}\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1973-1978 Honda Civic 5-door hatchback 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1978-1979 Honda Civic 3-door hatchback 02.jpg\n| caption2 = First-generation Civic hatchback\n}}\n\nThe first generation Honda Civic was introduced on 11 July 1972, but sold as a 1973 model in Japan.

The Civic was available as a two- or four-door fastback sedan, three- and a five-door [[hatchback]], as well as a five-door station wagon. Due to the [[1973 oil crisis]], consumer demand for fuel efficient vehicles was high, and due to the engine being able to run on either leaded or unleaded fuel, it gave drivers fuel choice flexibility over other vehicles. The [[CVCC]] engine debuted in December 1973, with a head design that allowed for more efficient combustion, and as a benefit the CVCC system did not require a [[catalytic converter]] or unleaded fuel to meet 1975 Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.<ref name=DriveCult>{{cite web |last=Wolfcale |first=James |title=The Top Ten Hondas of All Time |url=http://www.drivecult.com/features/the-top-ten-hondas-of-all-time |work=DriveCult |accessdate=26 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224081808/http://www.drivecult.com/features/the-top-ten-hondas-of-all-time |archive-date=24 February 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Civic was joined by a platform expansion of the three-door hatchback, called the [[Honda Accord]] in 1976.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1979\u20131983) ==\n{{main article| Honda Civic (second generation)}}\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = Honda Civic arriving Schaffen-Diest 2018 (cropped).jpg\n| image2 = 1982 Honda Civic 3-door hatchback (2015-07-14) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = Second-generation Civic hatchback\n}}\n\nThe second generation Honda Civic was introduced in June 1979 as a 1980 model. It was larger, had a more angular shape, and came with increased engine power. All Civic engines now used the CVCC design, which added a third valve per cylinder; this introduced [[Lean burn#Honda lean burn systems|lean burn swirl technology]].

The separate five-door hatchback and wagon models were merged into a five-door \"shuttle wagon\" or \"wagovan\" sometimes referred to colloquially as a \"breadbox\" due to its appearance, called the [[Honda Civic (third generation)#Shuttle/Wagon|Honda Civic Shuttle]]. An additional two-seat coupe style\u2014labeled [[Honda Civic CRX|CRX]]\u2014was introduced, noted for its compact dimensions and light weight. The third generation Civic saw the introduction of the long running four-cylinder [[Honda D engine|D series engine]] including a new {{convert|1.5|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[CVCC]] engine producing 76 HP. 1984 also saw the release of a high-performance [[Honda Civic Si|Si]] model for the Japanese market, featuring upgraded suspension and the {{convert|1.6|L|cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[Dohc#Double overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Honda D engine#ZC(similar to D16Y4, D16A8, D16Z6, D16A1, D16A3, D16A6, D16A9, and D16Z5 engines)|ZC engine]] which was rated at 130 PS (128 HP).

A [[4WD]] engine with different transmission mounts was introduced for the first time in 1984, and later upgraded in 1987. It delivered a fuel economy of around 28 mpg highway. The 4WD system was push-button operated until improved in 1987 when the rear wheels would engage automatically once the front wheels lost traction. This new system was called \"Realtime\" which used a \"viscous coupler\" connecting two propeller shafts between the front and rear axles. The manual transmission featured a synchronized 6th gear, called \"SL\", or \"Super-Low\", which was used for high torque at very low speeds. The \"Realtime\" idea is still utilized to this day but includes technological improvements since the first system. Starting with 1985, Japanese Civics were now exclusive to ''[[Honda Primo]]'', with variants sold at ''Honda Verno'' and ''Honda Clio''. A four-door version called the Ballade was built, under agreement, by [[Mercedes-Benz]] South Africa, models were 1300, 1500, 1500i and 1600i DOHC 1.6 injection.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation (1987\u20131991) ==\n{{main article|Honda Civic (fourth generation)}}\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1991 Honda Civic (ED) GL sedan (2015-06-25) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1991 Honda Civic (ED) GL sedan (2015-06-25) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = Fourth-generation Civic sedan\n}}\n\nIn September 1987, a redesigned Civic was introduced with increased dimensions and a lower hood line.

The most notable of which was the Japanese market SiR (featuring the [[Honda B engine#B16|B16A]] [[Dohc#Double overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[VTEC]] engine). All U.S. models featured [[electronic fuel injection]], but carbureted models were still available elsewhere.

These Special Edition models included all white side molding that matched the white body and color matched dual mirrors. In the body molding was a wrap around blue stripe.

The wagon variant was now only available in the Japanese market where the previous generation wagon was carried over until 1995. The efficiency of the previous HF model was replaced by the VX hatchback which, with an EPA rating of 48/55 [[Fuel economy in automobiles|MPG]], was Honda's most fuel efficient model sold at the time. In North America the Si featured a [[SOHC]] [[VTEC]] valve train, whereas the VX featured the [[VTEC#SOHC VTEC-E|VTEC-E]]. The Japanese Si featured a [[DOHC]] non-VTEC valve train [[Honda D engine#D16|D16A9]]. Continuing in the sporty tradition of the original Civic SiR, Honda sold several similarly equipped variants of the fifth generation car, still referred to as the Civic SiR, in Japan, Asia and Europe. In South Africa, MBSA (Mercedes Benz of SA) built the Civic as the Ballade only in 4-door sedan. A special model was the 180i with the B18B4, that was fitted to Ballade models. A new body style was introduced with this generation called the Civic Coup\u00e9, based from the Civic Ferio sedan, and was sold in North America, Europe and Japan. The fifth generation remains popular among tuners and racers alike.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation (1995\u20132000) ==\n{{main article|Honda Civic (sixth generation)}}\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 1998-2000 Honda Civic CXi 3-door hatchback (2010-09-19) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1998-2000 Honda Civic CXi 3-door hatchback (2010-09-19) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = Sixth-generation Civic hatchback\n}}\n\nIntroduced in September 1995 for the 1996 model year, the sixth generation featured updated styling although less radical than previous redesigns. Suspension and engine options were available along with their first Natural Gas Powered Civic, the GX. In the United States, model year 1996 to 2000 the Civic was sold under the CX, DX, EX, EXR, HX, LX, and for Canada, SE, and Si trims; all base models were made with 1.6-liter engines. The EX-CX are all SOHC ([[Honda D engine]]). The CX, DX and LX all have D16Y7 non-VTEC engines; whereas the EX has a D16Y8 VTEC, and the HX has D16Y5 VTEC-E. The USDM Si and Canadian SiR came with a DOHC (B16A2 VTEC). The first Civic Si coupe EM1 was introduced in 1999 until 2000. Europe saw a DOHC 1.6 VTi hatch and sedan and a DOHC 1.8L engine was available for the Domani related five-door liftback and estate. In Canada, the <nowiki>[[Acura EL]]</nowiki> is based on the Civic, and was replaced by the <nowiki>[[Acura CSX|CSX]]</nowiki> in 2006.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (2000\u20132005) ==\n{{main article|Honda Civic (seventh generation)}}\n\nThe seventh generation was released in September 2000, for the 2001 model year. While the redesign retained the previous generation's exterior dimensions, interior space was improved in part by using a flat rear floor thus bumping up Civic to a [[compact car]] size segment. The front suspension was changed from that of a [[Double wishbone suspension|double wishbone]] to a [[MacPherson strut]], in order to lower costs, as well as allow more engine bay room for the newly introduced [[Honda K engine|Honda K-series engine]]. Power was also increased on some trim levels. The four main trim levels were DX, LX, EX and HX. The Civic Coupe was no longer sold in Japan starting with this generation.\n\nIn North America, coupe and sedan body styles were available, except for the Si (SiR in Canada) which was offered only as a three-door hatchback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/honda/civic/2003/ |title=2003 Honda Civic Review |publisher=JB car pages |accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> The rest of the world received three- and five-door hatchbacks. The Type R was redesigned as well this time using a more powerful [[i-VTEC]] motor and using the three-door hatchback body style. This generation saw Honda introduce their first Civic Hybrid, powered by a 1.3-liter engine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jbcarpages.com/honda/civic/2003hybrid/ |title=2003 Honda Civic Hybrid Review |publisher=JB car pages |accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = horizontal | width = 220\n| image1 = 2002 Honda Civic (MY02) GLi sedan (2015-05-29) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2002 Honda Civic (MY02) GLi sedan (2015-05-29) 02.jpg\n| caption2 = Seventh-generation Civic sedan\n| image3 = 2002 Honda Civic VTEC SE Sport 1.6 Front.jpg\n| image4 = 2002 Honda Civic VTEC SE Sport 1.6 Rear.jpg\n| caption4 = Seventh-generation Civic hatchback\n}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Eighth generation (2005\u20132011) ==\n{{main article|Honda Civic (eighth generation)}}\n\nThe eighth generation was released in September 2005, for the 2006 model year. For the eighth generation, Honda split the model into two different platforms, one for sedan and coupe, and one for a hatchback designed primarily for the European market using a simpler rear suspension from the [[Honda Fit]] and more aggressive styling. As of 2006, a total of 16.5&nbsp;million Civics had been sold worldwide, with 7.3&nbsp;million of them in the United States.<ref name=\"Joe G. Collier\"/> Although the North American and the home market model differ externally, they are mechanically identical. The hatchback is available as a three and five-door. Both Si and Type R trim levels continued although the Japanese and European Type R, while sharing the same engine size, are mechanically different. In the United States, an improved, sportier version of the Civic Si 4-door tuned by tuner [[Mugen Motorsports|Mugen]] was offered, featuring cosmetic alterations and changes to the suspension, wheels, slight exterior differences, and exhaust system. A Canadian only Acura model received a new nameplate, changing from the [[Acura EL]] to the [[Acura CSX]]. The end of this model generation also marked a hiatus of the Civic Type R in Japan, with no successor model until the later tenth generation, going on sale in mid-2017.<ref>http://jalopnik.com/the-2018-honda-civic-type-r-is-306-hp-of-front-wheel-dr-1793035578</ref>\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = horizontal | width = 220\n| image1 = 09 Honda Civic EX sedan.jpg\n| caption1 = Eighth-generation Civic sedan (North America)\n| image2 = 2010 Honda Civic (MY10) VTi-L sedan (2015-07-09) 01.jpg\n| caption2 = Eighth-generation Civic sedan (Asia Pacific)\n| image3 = Honda Civic (VIII) \u2013 Frontansicht, 13.

The front of the car features a new chrome wing design that flows across the top of the headlamps.\n\nThe interior of the new Civic likewise features major design changes. Unlike the split bi-level speedometer and tachometer of its predecessor, the EX and above trim levels of the tenth generation Civic consolidates these instruments into a fully customisable, all digital \"Driver Information Interface\" incorporating a 7-inch LCD screen positioned directly behind the steering wheel and in the driver's line of sight.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.netcarshow.com/honda/2016-civic_sedan/ |title=Honda Civic Sedan (2016)|publisher=}}</ref> The LX trim instrumentation consists of a large analog tachometer that surrounds a digital speedometer and other digital displays.\n\nCivic variants include sedan, coupe, five-door hatchback, [[Honda Civic Si|Si trims]] and [[Honda Civic Type R|Type-R models]].\n\nHonda claims the tenth generation Civic Si trim (which is the eighth generation of Civic to offer an Si trim level) reaches 60mph from 0mph in 7.0 seconds,<ref>{{cite web |last=Siler |first=Steve |title=2017 Honda Civic First Drive Review |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15095562/2017-honda-civic-si-first-drive-review/ |publisher=Car&Driver |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref> though [[Car and Driver]] was able to bring a 2017 Civic Si Coupe to 60mph in 6.3 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gall |first=Jared |title=2017 Honda Civic Coupe Test Review |url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15091840/2017-honda-civic-si-coupe-test-review/ |publisher=[[Car and Driver]] |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 Civic Si also features adaptive dampers, stiffening of other suspension components, including mounting points, anti-roll bars, springs and bushings.\n\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = horizontal | width = 220\n| image1 = 2017 Honda Civic VTi-S sedan (2018-08-27) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2017 Honda Civic VTi-S sedan (2018-08-27) 02.jpg\n| caption1 = Tenth-generation Civic VTi-S sedan\n| image3 = 2017 Honda Civic EX VTEC CVT 1.0 Rear.jpg\n| caption3 = Tenth-generation Civic hatchback\n| image4 = 2017 Honda Civic LX coupe rear 1.23.19.jpg\n| caption4 = Tenth-generation Civic coup\u00e9\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== International marketing and platform derivatives ==\n[[File:BSB Flex cars 13 09 2008 Honda Flex logo zoom.jpg|thumb|The Civic has been sold in Brazil since late 2006 with a [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel engine]] capable of running on either gasoline or [[ethanol (fuel)|ethanol]] or any blend of both.]]\n\nWhile the Civic is sold in largely the same form worldwide, differences in the name of the models exist between markets. In Japan, the [[hatchback]] Civic is just called \"Civic\" while the sedan model was called the '''Civic Ferio''' ({{lang-ja|[[:ja:\u30db\u30f3\u30c0\u30fb\u30b7\u30d3\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a7\u30ea\u30aa|\u30b7\u30d3\u30c3\u30af\u30d5\u30a7\u30ea\u30aa]]}}) during the fifth to seventh generations. The sixth-generation sedan was also sold as the [[Honda Integra#Integra SJ|Integra SJ]]. In Europe and the United States, \"Civic\" generically refers to any model, though in Europe the coupe is branded the \"Civic Coupe\". A four-door [[station wagon]] model called the Civic Shuttle (also Civic Pro in Japan) was available from 1984 until 1991 (this brand name would later be revived for the mid-1990s Honda Shuttle people carrier, known in some markets as the [[Honda Stream]]). In South Africa, the sedan (the only model sold there until the 1996 launch of the sixth generation sedan and hatch) was known as the [[Honda Ballade|Ballade]].\n[[File:Honda Civic Hybrid 5171 DCA 03 2009 badging zoom in.jpg|thumb|upright|left|First-generation [[Honda Civic Hybrid]] (U.S.)]]\nOther models have been built on the Civic platform, including [[Honda Prelude|Prelude]], [[Honda Ballade|Ballade]], [[Honda CRX|CR-X]], [[Honda Quint|Quint]], [[Honda Concerto|Concerto]], [[Honda Domani|Domani]], [[Honda Del Sol|CR-X Del Sol]], [[Honda Integra|Integra]], and [[Honda CR-V|CR-V]].\n\nAlso, at various times, the Civic or Civic-derived models have been sold by marques other than Honda&nbsp;\u2013 for example, [[Rover (marque)|Rover]] sold the [[Rover 200|200]], [[Rover 400|400]] and [[Rover 45|45]], each of which were Civic-based at some point (first 200s were the second generation Ballade; from 1990 the 200 and 400 were based on the Concerto; the 400 was the 1995 Domani), as was their predecessor, the [[Triumph Acclaim]], based on the first Honda Ballade. The Honda Domani, an upscale model based on the Civic, was sold as the [[Isuzu Gemini]] in Japan (1992\u20132000), and confusingly the 5-door Domani was sold as the Honda Civic (along with the \"real\" hatchback and sedan Civics) in Europe from 1995 to 2000. In Thailand, the sixth generation Civic was available as the four-door Isuzu Vertex. The sixth-generation station wagon was sold as the [[Honda Orthia]], with the Partner as the downmarket commercial variant. The seventh generation minivan model is called the [[Honda Stream]]. In Canada, the sixth and seventh generation Civics were mildly redesigned to create the [[Acura EL]] until the advent of the eight generation Civic, which was used to create the [[Acura CSX]], which was designed in Canada. Honda Japan adopted the CSX styling for the Civic in its home country.\n[[File:2012 Honda Civic GX CNG WAS 2012 0823.JPG|thumb|Ninth-generation [[Honda Civic GX]] (U.S.) with the blue diamond CNG sticker and the new natural gas badging.]]\nThe three-door hatchback body style has been somewhat unpopular in the United States, but has achieved wide acceptance in Canada, as well as popularity in Japan and European markets, helping cement Honda's reputation as a maker of sporty [[compact car|compact]] models. Starting in 2002, the Civic three-door hatchback has been built exclusively at Honda's manufacturing plant in [[Swindon]], England<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041105092934/http://www.mfg.honda.co.uk/Internet/HUM00254.nsf/All/5DEBYCJSEO?opendocument |url=http://www.mfg.honda.co.uk/Internet/HUM00254.nsf/All/5DEBYCJSEO?opendocument |title=HUM: Civic |publisher=Honda of the UK |accessdate=29 November 2014 |archivedate=5 November 2004}}</ref> \u2013 previously the five-door Civic/Domani and the Civic Aerodeck (based on the Japanese Orthia) were built in this plant for sale in Europe along with the Japanese Civics. Accordingly, all instances of the current model (left or right hand drive, anywhere in the world) are British-made cars designed with Japanese engineering, except for the US-built two-door coupe and the sedan version built in Brazil for the Latin American market.\n\nIn North America, the Civic hatchback was dropped for 2006. The 2006 model year standard Civics for North America are manufactured in [[Alliston]], Ontario, Canada (sedans, coupes and Si Coupes) and [[East Liberty, Ohio|East Liberty]], Ohio (sedans), while the Hybrid version is manufactured in Japan.\n\nIn Brazil, although being considered for local manufacturing since the early 1980s (it was illegal to import cars in Brazil from 1973 until 1990), the Civic wasn't available until 1992, via official importing. In 1997, production of the sixth generation Civic sedan started in the [[Sumar\u00e9]] (a city near Campinas, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo) factory. The only differences between the Japanese model and the Brazilian model were a slightly higher ground clearance, due to the country's road conditions and adaptations to make the engine suitable to Brazilian commercial gasoline, which contains about 25% [[ethanol fuel|ethanol (E25)]], and the absence of sunroof in the Brazilian sixth generation Civic EX. The seventh generation production started in 2001, displacing the [[Chevrolet Vectra]] from the top sales record for the mid-size sedan segment, however it lost that position to the [[Toyota Corolla]] the following year. In 2006, the eighth generation was released and regained the sales leadership. Identical to the North American version, it lacks options such a moonroof, and standard security equipment like VSA and side and curtain airbags were removed due to lack of car safety laws in the Mercosur. Furthermore, the Brazilian subsidiary began producing [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] versions for the Civic and the [[Honda Fit|Fit]] models, capable of running on any blend of gasoline ([[w:Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20|E20 to E25 blend]] in Brazil) and [[ethanol (fuel)|ethanol]] up to [[Neat alcohol fuel|E100]].<ref>{{cite web

In 2006, the Civic earned the 2007 \"[[Semperit Irish Car of the Year]]\" title. In 1996, Automobile Magazine honored the Civic as its Automobile of the Year. The Civic has been on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's yearly [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best]] list six times, in 1985, 1988\u201391, and 1996. The Civic Si was named \"Best New Sport Car\" and the sedan was named \"Best New Economy Car\" in the 2006 [[Canadian Car of the Year]] awards.

In November 2006, the Civic received the prestigious \"Car of The Year\" award from Brazilian magazine Auto Esporte.\nThe four-door Civic VXi sedan won the [[South African Car of the Year]] award for 2007.\n\n== Racing ==\n{{See also|Honda in motorsport}}\n=== Touring car racing ===\nCivics have been used for racing ever since their introduction.\n\nCivics contested the Up to 1300cc class in the [[Bathurst 1000]] touring car race at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] in Australia each year from 1973 to 1976, with a best placing of second in class in both 1974 and 1976.<ref>Bill Tuckey, Australia's Greatest Motor Race, 1981</ref>\n\nIn recent years the Civic has been used in a wide variety of racing series, particularly in Japan.

That year, China's sole legislative body, the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) passed CL97, a law that criminalizes \"cyber crimes\", which it divided into two broad categories: crimes that target computer networks and crimes carried out over computer networks.  Behavior illegal under the latter category includes among many things the dissemination of [[pornography|pornographic]] material and the usurping of \"[[classified information|state secrets]].\"{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSome Chinese judges were critical of CL97, calling it ineffective and unenforceable. However, the NPC claimed it intentionally left the law \"flexible\" so that it could be open to future interpretation and development. Given the gaps in the law, the central government of China relies heavily on its administrative body, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], to determine what falls under the definitions, and their determinations are not required to go through the NPC legislative process. As a result, the CPC has ended up relying heavily on state regulation to carry out CL97.<ref>{{cite book |last=Keith |first=Ronald |author2=Lin, Zhiqiu |title=New Crime in China |publisher=Routledge Taylor & Francis Group |date=2006 |pages=217\u2013225 |isbn=0415314828 }}</ref>\n\nThe latter definition of online activities punishable under CL97, or \"crimes carried out over computer networks\" is used as justification for the Great Firewall and can be cited when the government blocks any ISP, gateway connections, or any access to anything on the internet.  The definition also includes using the internet to distribute information considered \"harmful to national security,\" and using the internet to distribute information considered \"harmful to public order, social stability, and Chinese morality.\"  The central government relies heavily on its State Council regulators to determine what specific online behavior and speech fall under these definitions.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe reasons behind the Internet censorship in China include:\n* Social Control: The Internet is a means for freedom of speech, and dissemination of campaigns could lead to protests against the government.\n* Sensitive Content: To control information about the government in China. \n* Economic Protectionism: China prefers the use of local companies that are regulated by Chinese regulations, since they have more power over them.

The project was completed in 2006 and is now carried out in buildings with machines manned by civilians and supervised by China's national police force, the [[Chinese public security bureau|Public Security Bureau]] (PSB).  The main operating procedures of the gatekeepers at the Golden Shield Project include monitoring domestic websites and email and searching for politically sensitive language and calls to protest.  When damaging content is found, local PSB officials can be dispatched to investigate or make arrests.  However, by late 2007 the Golden Shield Project proved to operate sporadically at best, as users had long adapted to [[Block (Internet)|internet blocking]] by using proxy servers, among other strategies, to make communications and circumnavigate to blocked content.<ref name=\"OliverAugust\">{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-11/ff_chinafirewall |title=The Great Firewall: China's Misguided \u2014 and Futile \u2014 Attempt to Control What Happens Online |last= August |first=Oliver |date=23 October 2007 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\nInternet caf\u00e9s, an extremely popular way of getting online in developing countries where fewer people can afford a personal computer, are regulated by the Chinese government and by local Chinese government officials.

That year, China's sole legislative body, the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) passed CL97, a law that criminalizes \"cyber crimes\", which it divided into two broad categories: crimes that target computer networks and crimes carried out over computer networks.  Behavior illegal under the latter category includes among many things the dissemination of [[pornography|pornographic]] material and the usurping of \"[[classified information|state secrets]].\"{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSome Chinese judges were critical of CL97, calling it ineffective and unenforceable. However, the NPC claimed it intentionally left the law \"flexible\" so that it could be open to future interpretation and development. Given the gaps in the law, the central government of China relies heavily on its administrative body, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]], to determine what falls under the definitions, and their determinations are not required to go through the NPC legislative process. As a result, the CPC has ended up relying heavily on state regulation to carry out CL97.<ref>{{cite book |last=Keith |first=Ronald |author2=Lin, Zhiqiu |title=New Crime in China |publisher=Routledge Taylor & Francis Group |date=2006 |pages=217\u2013225 |isbn=0415314828 }}</ref>\n\nThe latter definition of online activities punishable under CL97, or \"crimes carried out over computer networks\" is used as justification for the Great Firewall and can be cited when the government blocks any ISP, gateway connections, or any access to anything on the internet.  The definition also includes using the internet to distribute information considered \"harmful to national security,\" and using the internet to distribute information considered \"harmful to public order, social stability, and Chinese morality.\"  The central government relies heavily on its State Council regulators to determine what specific online behavior and speech fall under these definitions.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe reasons behind the Internet censorship in China include:\n* Social Control: The Internet is a means for freedom of speech, and dissemination of campaigns could lead to protests against the government.\n* Sensitive Content: To control information about the government in China. \n* Economic Protectionism: China prefers the use of local companies that are regulated by Chinese regulations, since they have more power over them. E.g. [[Baidu]] over [[Google]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Campaigns and crackdowns==\nAs part of the Great Firewall, beginning in 2003 China started the [[Golden Shield Project]] , a massive surveillance and censoring system, the hardware for which was provided by mostly U.S. companies, including [[Cisco Systems]].  The project was completed in 2006 and is now carried out in buildings with machines manned by civilians and supervised by China's national police force, the [[Chinese public security bureau|Public Security Bureau]] (PSB).  The main operating procedures of the gatekeepers at the Golden Shield Project include monitoring domestic websites and email and searching for politically sensitive language and calls to protest.  When damaging content is found, local PSB officials can be dispatched to investigate or make arrests.  However, by late 2007 the Golden Shield Project proved to operate sporadically at best, as users had long adapted to [[Block (Internet)|internet blocking]] by using proxy servers, among other strategies, to make communications and circumnavigate to blocked content.<ref name=\"OliverAugust\">{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/15-11/ff_chinafirewall |title=The Great Firewall: China's Misguided \u2014 and Futile \u2014 Attempt to Control What Happens Online |last= August |first=Oliver |date=23 October 2007 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\nInternet caf\u00e9s, an extremely popular way of getting online in developing countries where fewer people can afford a personal computer, are regulated by the Chinese government and by local Chinese government officials.
