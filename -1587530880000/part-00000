After Iranian students stormed the American embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and took 52 Americans hostage, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] imposed an [[arms embargo]] on Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} After [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|Iraq unsuccessfully invaded Iran]] in September 1980, Iran needed weapons and spare parts for its current weapons. After Ronald Reagan took office as President on 20 January 1981, he vowed to continue Carter's policy of blocking arms sales to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nA group of senior Reagan administration officials in the Senior Interdepartmental Group conducted a secret study on 21 July 1981, and concluded that the arms embargo was ineffective because Iran could always buy arms and spare parts for its American weapons elsewhere, while at the same time the arms embargo opened the door for Iran to fall into the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] as the Kremlin could sell Iran weapons if the United States would not.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} The conclusion was that the United States should start selling Iran arms as soon as it was politically possible to keep Iran from falling into the Soviet sphere of influence.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} At the same time, the openly declared goal of Ayatollah Khomeini to export his Islamic revolution all over the Middle East and overthrow the governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|other states around the Persian Gulf]] led to the Americans perceiving Khomeini as a major threat to the United States.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nIn the spring of 1983, the United States launched [[Operation Staunch]], a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to persuade other nations all over the world not to sell arms or spare parts for weapons to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} At least part of the reason the Iran\u2013Contra affair proved so humiliating for the United States when the story first broke in November 1986 that the US was selling arms to Iran was that American diplomats, as part of Operation Staunch had, from the spring of 1983 on, been lecturing other nations about how morally wrong it was to sell arms to the Islamic Republic of Iran and applying strong pressure to prevent these arms sales to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nAt the same time that the American government was considering their options on selling arms to Iran, [[Contras|Contra]] militants based in [[Honduras]] were waging a guerrilla war to topple the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) revolutionary government of [[Nicaragua]].

Funding ran out for the Contras by July 1984, and in October a total ban was placed in effect. The second Boland Amendment, in effect from 3 October 1984 to 3 December 1985, stated:<blockquote>During the fiscal year 1985 no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of or which may have the effect of supporting directly or indirectly military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, organization, group, movement, or individual.{{r|Hicks|p=965}}</blockquote> In violation of the Boland Amendment, senior officials of the Reagan administration continued to secretly arm and train the Contras and provide arms to Iran, an operation they called \"the Enterprise\".<ref name=\"Johnston\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/09/us/secord-is-guilty-of-one-charge-in-contra-affair.html |title=Secord Is Guilty Of One Charge In Contra Affair |work=The New York Times |edition=National |page=A00024 |first=David |last=Johnston |accessdate=19 July 2011 |date=9 November 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Corn |first=David |title=Is There Really A 'Secret Team'? |work=The Nation |date=2 July 1988}}</ref> As the Contras were heavily dependent upon U.S. military and financial support, the second Boland amendment threatened to break the Contra movement and led to President Reagan in 1984 to order the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) to \"keep the Contras together 'body and soul'\", no matter what Congress voted for.{{r|Hicks|p=965}}\n\nA major legal debate at the center of the Iran\u2013Contra affair concerned the question of whether the NSC was one of the \"any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities\" covered by the Boland amendment. The Reagan administration argued it was not, and many in Congress argued that it was.{{r|Hicks|p=965}} The majority of constitutional scholars have asserted the NSC did indeed fall within the purview of the second Boland amendment, though the amendment did not mention the NSC by name.{{r|Hicks|p=966}} The broader constitutional question at stake was the power of Congress versus the power of the presidency. The Reagan administration argued that because the constitution assigned the right to conduct foreign policy to the executive, its efforts to overthrow the government of Nicaragua were a presidential prerogative that Congress had no right to try to halt via the Boland amendments.{{r|Hicks|p=964}} By contrast congressional leaders argued that the constitution had assigned Congress control of the budget, and Congress had every right to use that power not to fund projects like attempting to overthrow the government of Nicaragua that they disapproved of.{{r|Hicks|p=964}} As part of the effort to circumvent the Boland amendment, the NSC established \"the Enterprise\", an arms-smuggling network headed by a retired U.S. Air Force officer turned arms dealer [[Richard Secord]] that supplied arms to the Contras. It was ostensibly a private sector operation, but in fact was controlled by the NSC.{{r|Hicks|p=966}} To fund \"the Enterprise\", the Reagan administration was constantly on the look-out for funds that came from outside the U.S. government in order not to explicitly violate the letter of the Boland amendment, though the efforts to find alternative funding for the Contras violated the spirit of the Boland amendment.{{r|Hicks|pages=966\u2013967}} Ironically, military aid to the Contras was reinstated with Congressional consent in October 1986, a month before the scandal broke.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lemoyne |first=James |title=Ortega, Faulting Reagan, Warns of Coming War |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/world/ortega-faulting-reagan-warns-of-coming-war.html |accessdate=15 November 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=19 October 1986 |edition=National |page=1001006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Payton |first=Brenda |title=Is U.S. Backing Contras with Drug Funds? |work=Oakland Tribune |date=4 April 1988}}</ref>\n\n==Arms sales to Iran==\n{{See also|Brokers of Death arms case|Israel's role in the Iran\u2013Iraq war}}\nAs reported in ''The New York Times'' in 1991, \"continuing allegations that Reagan campaign officials made a deal with the Iranian Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the fall of 1980\" led to \"limited investigations.\" However \"limited,\" those investigations established that \"Soon after taking office in 1981, the Reagan Administration secretly and abruptly changed United States policy.\" Secret Israeli arms sales and shipments to Iran began in that year, even as, in public, \"the Reagan Administration\" presented a different face, and \"aggressively promoted a public campaign... to stop worldwide transfers of military goods to Iran.\" ''The New York Times'' explains: \"Iran at that time was in dire need of arms and spare parts for its American-made arsenal to defend itself against Iraq, which had attacked it in September 1980,\" while \"Israel [a U.S. ally] was interested in keeping the war between Iran and Iraq going to insure that these two potential enemies remained preoccupied with each other.\" Maj. Gen. Avraham Tamir, a high-ranking Israeli Defense Ministry in 1981, said there was a \"oral agreement\" to allow the sale of \"spare parts\" to Iran. This was based on an \"understanding\" with Secretary [[Alexander Haig]] (which a Haig adviser denied). This account was confirmed by a former senior American diplomat with a few modifications. The diplomat claimed that \"[Ariel] Sharon violated it, and Haig backed away...\". A former \"high-level\" CIA official who saw the reports of arms sales to Iran by Israel in the early 1980's estimated that the total was about 2 billion a year. But also said that \"The degree to which it was sanctioned I don't know.\"<ref name=\"israel-iran\" />\n\nOn 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser [[Robert McFarlane]] wrote a National Security Decision Directive which called for the United States to begin a rapprochement with the Islamic Republic of Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} The paper read:\n\n<blockquote>Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran.

As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.<ref name=\"pbs-speech\"/></blockquote>\n\nFinally, the president acknowledged that his previous assertions that the U.S. did not trade arms for hostages were incorrect:\n<blockquote>A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.

It is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when, and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages.

After Ronald Reagan took office as President on 20 January 1981, he vowed to continue Carter's policy of blocking arms sales to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nA group of senior Reagan administration officials in the Senior Interdepartmental Group conducted a secret study on 21 July 1981, and concluded that the arms embargo was ineffective because Iran could always buy arms and spare parts for its American weapons elsewhere, while at the same time the arms embargo opened the door for Iran to fall into the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] as the Kremlin could sell Iran weapons if the United States would not.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} The conclusion was that the United States should start selling Iran arms as soon as it was politically possible to keep Iran from falling into the Soviet sphere of influence.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} At the same time, the openly declared goal of Ayatollah Khomeini to export his Islamic revolution all over the Middle East and overthrow the governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|other states around the Persian Gulf]] led to the Americans perceiving Khomeini as a major threat to the United States.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nIn the spring of 1983, the United States launched [[Operation Staunch]], a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to persuade other nations all over the world not to sell arms or spare parts for weapons to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} At least part of the reason the Iran\u2013Contra affair proved so humiliating for the United States when the story first broke in November 1986 that the US was selling arms to Iran was that American diplomats, as part of Operation Staunch had, from the spring of 1983 on, been lecturing other nations about how morally wrong it was to sell arms to the Islamic Republic of Iran and applying strong pressure to prevent these arms sales to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nAt the same time that the American government was considering their options on selling arms to Iran, [[Contras|Contra]] militants based in [[Honduras]] were waging a guerrilla war to topple the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) revolutionary government of [[Nicaragua]]. Almost from the time he took office in 1981, a major goal of the Reagan administration was the overthrow of the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua and to support the Contra rebels.<ref name=\"Hicks\">{{cite journal |last=Hicks |first=D.

Funding ran out for the Contras by July 1984, and in October a total ban was placed in effect. The second Boland Amendment, in effect from 3 October 1984 to 3 December 1985, stated:<blockquote>During the fiscal year 1985 no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of or which may have the effect of supporting directly or indirectly military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, organization, group, movement, or individual.{{r|Hicks|p=965}}</blockquote> In violation of the Boland Amendment, senior officials of the Reagan administration continued to secretly arm and train the Contras and provide arms to Iran, an operation they called \"the Enterprise\".<ref name=\"Johnston\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/09/us/secord-is-guilty-of-one-charge-in-contra-affair.html |title=Secord Is Guilty Of One Charge In Contra Affair |work=The New York Times |edition=National |page=A00024 |first=David |last=Johnston |accessdate=19 July 2011 |date=9 November 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Corn |first=David |title=Is There Really A 'Secret Team'? |work=The Nation |date=2 July 1988}}</ref> As the Contras were heavily dependent upon U.S. military and financial support, the second Boland amendment threatened to break the Contra movement and led to President Reagan in 1984 to order the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) to \"keep the Contras together 'body and soul'\", no matter what Congress voted for.{{r|Hicks|p=965}}\n\nA major legal debate at the center of the Iran\u2013Contra affair concerned the question of whether the NSC was one of the \"any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities\" covered by the Boland amendment. The Reagan administration argued it was not, and many in Congress argued that it was.{{r|Hicks|p=965}} The majority of constitutional scholars have asserted the NSC did indeed fall within the purview of the second Boland amendment, though the amendment did not mention the NSC by name.{{r|Hicks|p=966}} The broader constitutional question at stake was the power of Congress versus the power of the presidency. The Reagan administration argued that because the constitution assigned the right to conduct foreign policy to the executive, its efforts to overthrow the government of Nicaragua were a presidential prerogative that Congress had no right to try to halt via the Boland amendments.{{r|Hicks|p=964}} By contrast congressional leaders argued that the constitution had assigned Congress control of the budget, and Congress had every right to use that power not to fund projects like attempting to overthrow the government of Nicaragua that they disapproved of.{{r|Hicks|p=964}} As part of the effort to circumvent the Boland amendment, the NSC established \"the Enterprise\", an arms-smuggling network headed by a retired U.S. Air Force officer turned arms dealer [[Richard Secord]] that supplied arms to the Contras. It was ostensibly a private sector operation, but in fact was controlled by the NSC.{{r|Hicks|p=966}} To fund \"the Enterprise\", the Reagan administration was constantly on the look-out for funds that came from outside the U.S. government in order not to explicitly violate the letter of the Boland amendment, though the efforts to find alternative funding for the Contras violated the spirit of the Boland amendment.{{r|Hicks|pages=966\u2013967}} Ironically, military aid to the Contras was reinstated with Congressional consent in October 1986, a month before the scandal broke.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lemoyne |first=James |title=Ortega, Faulting Reagan, Warns of Coming War |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/world/ortega-faulting-reagan-warns-of-coming-war.html |accessdate=15 November 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=19 October 1986 |edition=National |page=1001006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Payton |first=Brenda |title=Is U.S. Backing Contras with Drug Funds? |work=Oakland Tribune |date=4 April 1988}}</ref>\n\n==Arms sales to Iran==\n{{See also|Brokers of Death arms case|Israel's role in the Iran\u2013Iraq war}}\nAs reported in ''The New York Times'' in 1991, \"continuing allegations that Reagan campaign officials made a deal with the Iranian Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the fall of 1980\" led to \"limited investigations.\" However \"limited,\" those investigations established that \"Soon after taking office in 1981, the Reagan Administration secretly and abruptly changed United States policy.\" Secret Israeli arms sales and shipments to Iran began in that year, even as, in public, \"the Reagan Administration\" presented a different face, and \"aggressively promoted a public campaign... to stop worldwide transfers of military goods to Iran.\" ''The New York Times'' explains: \"Iran at that time was in dire need of arms and spare parts for its American-made arsenal to defend itself against Iraq, which had attacked it in September 1980,\" while \"Israel [a U.S. ally] was interested in keeping the war between Iran and Iraq going to insure that these two potential enemies remained preoccupied with each other.\" Maj. Gen. Avraham Tamir, a high-ranking Israeli Defense Ministry in 1981, said there was a \"oral agreement\" to allow the sale of \"spare parts\" to Iran. This was based on an \"understanding\" with Secretary [[Alexander Haig]] (which a Haig adviser denied). This account was confirmed by a former senior American diplomat with a few modifications. The diplomat claimed that \"[Ariel] Sharon violated it, and Haig backed away...\". A former \"high-level\" CIA official who saw the reports of arms sales to Iran by Israel in the early 1980's estimated that the total was about 2 billion a year. But also said that \"The degree to which it was sanctioned I don't know.\"<ref name=\"israel-iran\" />\n\nOn 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser [[Robert McFarlane]] wrote a National Security Decision Directive which called for the United States to begin a rapprochement with the Islamic Republic of Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} The paper read:\n\n<blockquote>Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran.

My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.

In 1904, in response to [[Newcastle Corporation Tramways|tramway competition]] which was taking away passengers, the [[North Eastern Railway (United Kingdom)|North Eastern Railway]] started [[railway electrification in Great Britain|electrifying]] parts of their local railway network north of the [[River Tyne]] with a 600\u00a0[[Volt|V]] [[direct current|DC]] [[third-rail]] system, forming one of the earliest suburban electric networks, known as the [[Tyneside Electrics|''Tyneside Electrics'']]. In 1938, the line south of the [[River Tyne]] between [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and {{rws|South Shields}} was also electrified.\n\nUnder [[British Rail]] in the 1960s, the decision was made to de-electrify the ''Tyneside Electrics'' network and convert it to diesel operation, owing to falling passenger numbers and the cost of renewing end-of-life electrical infrastructure and rolling stock. The [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[South Shields]] line was de-electrified in 1963, along with the [[North Tyneside]] routes, in 1967.<ref name=\"TAGBI\">{{cite book|last1=Schwandle|first1=Robert|title=Tram Atlas Britain & Ireland|date=|publisher=Robert Schwandl|year=2015|isbn=9783936573459|location=Berlin, Germany|pp=132\u2013137}}</ref><ref name=\"TNEE\">{{cite book|last1=Hoole|first1=K.|title=North Eastern Electrics: The History of the Tyneside Electric Passenger Services, 1904\u201367|date=|publisher=The Oakwood Press|year=1987|isbn=9780853613589|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emus.co.uk/zone/tyneside/tyneside.htm|title=The Tyneside Electrics|last=|first=|date=|website=Suburban Electric Railway Association|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref> This was widely viewed as a backward step, as the [[diesel multiple unit|diesel trains]] were slower than the electric trains they replaced.<ref name=\"SRT23\">{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Alan|title=Suburban Railways of Tyneside|date=|publisher=Martin Bairstow|year=1999|isbn=9781871944204|location=|page=23|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Planning and construction===\nIn the early 1970s, the poor local transport system was identified as one of the main factors holding back the region's economy, and in 1971 a study was commissioned by the recently created [[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority|Tyneside Passenger Transport Authority]] (now known as ''Nexus'') into how the transport system could be improved.\n\nThis study recommended reviving the badly run-down former Tyneside Electrics network by converting it into an electrified [[rapid transit]] system, which would include a new underground section to better serve the busy central areas of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Gateshead]], as it was felt that the existing rail network didn't serve these areas adequately. This new system was intended to be the core of a new integrated transport network, with buses acting as feeders to purpose-built transport interchanges. The plans were approved by the Tyneside Metropolitan Railway Bill, which was passed by [[Parliament]] in July 1973. Around 70% of the funding for the scheme came from a central [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] grant, with the remainder coming from local sources.<ref name=\"Nexus-history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nexus.org.uk/history/landmarks-urban-transport|title=Landmarks in urban transport|last=|first=|date=|year=|website=Nexus|publisher=Nexus|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Meet Your Metro|publisher=Tyne and Wear Transport|year=June 1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nThree railway lines, totalling {{convert|26|mi|km|abbr=}} were to be converted into Metro lines as part of the initial system \u2013 these being the [[North Tyneside Loop]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[South Shields]] branch (both of which were formerly part of the ''Tyneside Electrics'' network), and a short stretch of the freight-only [[Ponteland Railway]] between {{Metro|South Gosforth}} and [[Bank Foot Metro station|Bank Foot]], which had not seen any passenger traffic since 1929.<ref name=\"TAGBI\" />\n\nThe converted railway lines were to be connected by around {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=}} of new infrastructure, which was built both to separate the Metro from the existing rail network, and also to create the new underground routes under [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Gateshead]]. Around {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=}} of the new infrastructure was in [[#Tunnels|tunnels]], whilst the remainder was either at ground level or elevated.

Several purpose-built transport interchanges, such as {{metro|Four Lane Ends}}, [[Heworth Interchange|Heworth]] and {{metro|Regent Centre}} were built for this purpose.

In 1938, the line south of the [[River Tyne]] between [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and {{rws|South Shields}} was also electrified.\n\nUnder [[British Rail]] in the 1960s, the decision was made to de-electrify the ''Tyneside Electrics'' network and convert it to diesel operation, owing to falling passenger numbers and the cost of renewing end-of-life electrical infrastructure and rolling stock. The [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[South Shields]] line was de-electrified in 1963, along with the [[North Tyneside]] routes, in 1967.<ref name=\"TAGBI\">{{cite book|last1=Schwandle|first1=Robert|title=Tram Atlas Britain & Ireland|date=|publisher=Robert Schwandl|year=2015|isbn=9783936573459|location=Berlin, Germany|pp=132\u2013137}}</ref><ref name=\"TNEE\">{{cite book|last1=Hoole|first1=K.|title=North Eastern Electrics: The History of the Tyneside Electric Passenger Services, 1904\u201367|date=|publisher=The Oakwood Press|year=1987|isbn=9780853613589|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emus.co.uk/zone/tyneside/tyneside.htm|title=The Tyneside Electrics|last=|first=|date=|website=Suburban Electric Railway Association|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref> This was widely viewed as a backward step, as the [[diesel multiple unit|diesel trains]] were slower than the electric trains they replaced.<ref name=\"SRT23\">{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Alan|title=Suburban Railways of Tyneside|date=|publisher=Martin Bairstow|year=1999|isbn=9781871944204|location=|page=23|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Planning and construction===\nIn the early 1970s, the poor local transport system was identified as one of the main factors holding back the region's economy, and in 1971 a study was commissioned by the recently created [[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority|Tyneside Passenger Transport Authority]] (now known as ''Nexus'') into how the transport system could be improved.\n\nThis study recommended reviving the badly run-down former Tyneside Electrics network by converting it into an electrified [[rapid transit]] system, which would include a new underground section to better serve the busy central areas of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Gateshead]], as it was felt that the existing rail network didn't serve these areas adequately. This new system was intended to be the core of a new integrated transport network, with buses acting as feeders to purpose-built transport interchanges. The plans were approved by the Tyneside Metropolitan Railway Bill, which was passed by [[Parliament]] in July 1973. Around 70% of the funding for the scheme came from a central [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] grant, with the remainder coming from local sources.<ref name=\"Nexus-history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nexus.org.uk/history/landmarks-urban-transport|title=Landmarks in urban transport|last=|first=|date=|year=|website=Nexus|publisher=Nexus|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Meet Your Metro|publisher=Tyne and Wear Transport|year=June 1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nThree railway lines, totalling {{convert|26|mi|km|abbr=}} were to be converted into Metro lines as part of the initial system \u2013 these being the [[North Tyneside Loop]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[South Shields]] branch (both of which were formerly part of the ''Tyneside Electrics'' network), and a short stretch of the freight-only [[Ponteland Railway]] between {{Metro|South Gosforth}} and [[Bank Foot Metro station|Bank Foot]], which had not seen any passenger traffic since 1929.<ref name=\"TAGBI\" />\n\nThe converted railway lines were to be connected by around {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=}} of new infrastructure, which was built both to separate the Metro from the existing rail network, and also to create the new underground routes under [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Gateshead]].

When in service, Metrocars are normally coupled together in pairs, and have a maximum speed of {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The first units to be built were two prototypes, numbered 4001 and 4002, which were delivered for testing in 1975. These were followed by 88 production units, which were built between 1978 and 1981. The design of the Metrocar was based on the [[Stadtbahnwagen B]], a [[Germany|German]] [[light rail]] vehicle developed in the early 1970s.

By extension, the ''In'' line runs from [[Newcastle Airport Metro station|Airport]] to [[South Gosforth Metro station|South Gosforth]], and from [[Pelaw Metro station|Pelaw]] to [[South Hylton Metro station|South Hylton]].\n\nDistance plates are mounted on all [[Overhead lines#Overhead catenary|overhead line]] structures.

During [[World War II]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]] began using the Wonderlic Personnel Test to select candidates for [[aviator|pilot]] [[training]] and [[air navigation|navigation]]. During this time period, 1940\u20131960, it was supplied for free as the data was so valuable to E. F. Wonderlic. He wanted to perfect the test, not charge for it. In the 1970s [[Tom Landry]], coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], was the first to use the Wonderlic Personnel Test to predict player performance.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/> It is still used in the annual [[NFL Combine]] as a form of pre-draft assessment.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In short, it attempts to screen candidates for certain jobs within the shortest possible time. It may be termed as a quick IQ test.<ref name=\"tests.com\">{{cite web|title=Personality and Aptitude Career Tests.

The Wonderlic Personnel test is divided into two different forms of test: the Wonderlic Personnel Test \u2013 Quicktest (30 questions in 8 minutes) and the Wonderlic Personnel Test (50 questions, 12 minutes). The Wonderlic Personnel Test-Quicktest differs from the Wonderlic Personnel Test in that it is not proctored giving employers a general idea of the potential applicant's cognitive ability.

The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile and the Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile tests individuals on five primary dimensions of the individual's personality: [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]], [[neuroticism|emotional stability/neuroticism]], and [[openness to experience]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Description of Five Factor Model|url=http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/five-factor-model.html|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> These are essentially the same [[Construct (philosophy of science)|constructs]] as the [[Big Five personality traits]], also known as the Five Factor Model.\n\n===Motivation===\nAveraging 10\u201315 minutes, the 58-item assessment is based on leading workplace motivation model, Holland/RIASEC. It evaluates a candidate\u2019s interests, which helps predict how motivated they will be by the actual responsibilities of the job.

New London''===\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\",<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/</ref><ref>https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html</ref> based on the city's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.\n\nJordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by [[Groton Long Point]], and as a seasonal officer for the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity.

New London''===\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\",<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/</ref><ref>https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html</ref> based on the city's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.\n\nJordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by [[Groton Long Point]], and as a seasonal officer for the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"<ref>http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html</ref> The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].\n\n==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==\n{{See also|Central tendency}}\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.<ref name=Wonderlic1983>{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F.

The [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] found on the iPhone 8, has been replaced with Haptic Touch on the iPhone SE. It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. Smart HDR is featured on the rear camera, but not the front camera.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly due to being based on the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR single-camera systems.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13|iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|IPhone SE (2nd generation)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the 2nd generation iPhone SE|its predecessor|iPhone SE (1st generation)|the general use of the term ''iPhone SE''|iPhone SE (disambiguation)}}\n<noinclude>\n{{User:RMCD bot/subject notice|1=iPhone SE (2020)|2=Talk:IPhone SE (2nd generation)#Requested move 16 April 2020 }}\n</noinclude>\n{{pp-move|small=yes}}\n{{short description|thirteenth-generation Apple smartphone}}\n{{lowercase title}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox mobile phone\n| name         = iPhone SE\n| codename     = \n| logo         = IPhone SE (2nd generation) wordmark.svg\n| logosize     = <!-- include \"px\" - Uses users default image size if omitted -->\n| image        = IPhone SE (2nd generation) white vector.svg\n| imagesize    = \n| alt          = \n| caption      = <!-- This is indeed white!

The [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] found on the iPhone 8, has been replaced with Haptic Touch on the iPhone SE. It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. Smart HDR is featured on the rear camera, but not the front camera.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly due to being based on the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR single-camera systems.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13|iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|IPhone SE (2nd generation)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "name_user": "Traveltoromantis", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(2nd_generation)"}

It had a rear-mounted engine and used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimeter-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on [[Torsion bar suspension|transverse torsion bars]], in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, as when the same steel-tired road wheels were used on later Tiger I hulls, the wheels were only overlapping ''without'' being interleaved\u2014the full ''Schachtellaufwerk'' rubber-rimmed road-wheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the early production versions of the Tiger&nbsp;I<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> and Panther.\n\nThe Porsche hull designs included a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension was the same as on the ''[[Elefant]]'' tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired [[bogies]] sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a [[Diesel-electric transmission]], only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), similar to a [[gasoline-electric hybrid]] but without a storage battery; two separate [[drivetrain]]s in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine\u2013[[electric generator]]\u2013electric motor\u2013drive [[sprocket]]. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the [[VK4501|Tiger (P)]] (later ''Elefant'' prototypes) and in some US designs and was put into production in the WW1 [[Saint-Chamond (tank)|Saint-Chamond]] tank and the post-WW1 FCM [[Char 2C]]. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later ''[[Jagdtiger]]'' tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Munster Koenigstiger Porscheturm Modell detail.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A tank turret with a front face which curves up and down.

The rough [[Zimmerit]] coating is evident, used to prevent magnetic mines from adhering to the tank's armour.]]\n\nHenschel won the design contract, and all Tiger IIs were produced by the firm.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 17</ref> Two turret designs were used in production vehicles. The initial design is often misleadingly called the Tiger II (P), after the \"Porsche\" turret due to the misbelief that it was designed by Porsche for their [[VK 4502 (P)|prototype]]; in fact it was the initial Krupp design for both prototypes.<ref name=\":0\" /> This turret had a rounded front and steeply sloped sides, with a difficult-to-manufacture curved bulge on the turret's left side to accommodate the commander's cupola. Fifty early turrets were mounted to Henschel's hull and used in action. In December 1943 the more common \"production\" turret, sometimes erroneously called the \"Henschel\" turret, was simplified with a significantly thicker flat face, no [[shot trap]] (created by the curved face of the earlier turret), and less-steeply sloped sides, which prevented the need for a bulge for the commander's cupola, and added additional room for ammunition storage.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe turrets were designed to mount the [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] L/71 gun. Combined with the ''Turmzielfernrohr'' 9d (German \"turret telescopic sight\") monocular sight by Leitz, which all but a few early Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first-round hit on a {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} wide target was 100 percent at {{convert|1000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, 95\u201397 percent at {{convert|1500|m|mi|abbr=on}} and 85\u201387 percent at {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, depending on ammunition type. Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000&nbsp;m, in the 60s at 1,500&nbsp;m and the 40s at 2,000&nbsp;m. Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was {{convert|202|and|132|mm|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}} respectively for the [[Panzergranate 39|''Panzergranate'' 39/43]] projectile (PzGr\u2014[[armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing shell]]), and {{convert|238|and|153|mm|abbr=on}} for the PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges. The ''Sprenggranate'' 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets, or the ''Hohlgranate'' or ''Hohlgeschoss'' 39 (HlGr\u2014HEAT or [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead]]) round, which had {{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} penetration at any range, could be used as a dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets.<ref name=\"J&D23-24\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nPowered turret traverse was provided by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6\u00ba/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19\u00ba/second \u2014 [[Tiger I#Mobility and reliability|the same as with the Tiger I]] \u2014  with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36\u00ba/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a control lever near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually rotate the turret at a rate of one-half a degree per each revolution of the hand crank (i.e. 20\u00b0 turret rotation required 40 full cranks of the handwheel, and to turn the turret a full 360\u00b0 the gunner would be required to crank the handwheel 720 full revolutions).\n\n[[File:Tiger II mg 7802.jpg|thumb|alt=The overhanging rear face of a large tank, two laterally spaced exhaust pipes protrude from mountings, pointing upwards, curving away from the vehicle at their ends.|Rear view showing dual exhausts]]\nLike all German tanks, the Tiger II had a [[petrol engine]]; in this case the same 700 [[Horsepower#PS|PS]] (690&nbsp;hp, 515&nbsp;kW) V-12 [[Maybach HL230|Maybach HL 230 P30]] which powered the much lighter [[Panther tank|Panther]] and [[Tiger I]] tanks. The Tiger II was under-powered, like many other heavy tanks of World War II, and consumed a lot of fuel, which was in short supply for the Germans. The transmission was the Maybach OLVAR EG 40 12 16 Model B, giving eight forward gears and four reverse, which drove the steering gear. This was the Henschel L 801, a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure. Transverse torsion bar suspension supported the hull on nine axles per side. Overlapped {{convert|800|mm|abbr=on}} diameter road wheels with rubber cushions and steel tyres rode inside the tracks.<ref name=\"J&D11-12\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nLike the Tiger I, each tank was issued with two sets of tracks: a normal \"battle track\" and a narrower \"transport\" version used during rail movement. The transport tracks reduced the overall width of the load and could be used to drive the tank short distances on firm ground. The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon as the tank was unloaded. Ground pressure was 0.76&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (10.8 psi).<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Command variant===\nThe command variant of the Tiger II was designated ''Panzerbefehlswagen'' Tiger ''Ausf. B''. It had two versions, ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 and ''Sd.Kfz''. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8&nbsp;cm ammunition to provide room to    accommodate the extra radios and equipment,<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 was to have used ''FuG'' 8 and ''FuG'' 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|spell=in}} rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a ''Sternantenne D'' (\"Star antenna D\"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105&nbsp;mm ''Antennenfu\u00df Nr. 1''), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment.<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> The ''Sd.Kfz''. 268 used ''FuG'' 7 and ''FuG'' 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe Tiger II was developed late in the war and built in relatively small numbers. Orders were placed for 1,500 Tiger IIs\u2014slightly more than the 1,347 [[Tiger I]] tanks produced\u2014but production was severely disrupted by Allied bombing raids.<ref name=\"Manchester68-498\">Manchester 1968, p. 498.</ref> Among others, five raids between 22 September and 7 October 1944 destroyed 95 percent of the floor area of the Henschel plant.

The AK-7-200 was also explored as an alternative to the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but ''[[Waffenamt]]'' research and development department ''Wa Pr\u00fcf 6'' found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained.<ref name=\"J&D1997.144-154\">{{cite book|last1=Jentz|first1=Thomas|last2=Doyle|first2=Hilary|title=Germany's Tiger Tanks: VK45.02 to TIGER II Design, Production & Modifications|date=1997|publisher=Schiffer Publishing, Ltd|isbn=0764302248|pages=144\u2013154}}</ref> There was also a program using the Simmering-Graz-Pauker Sla.16 engine, but the war's constraint on supplies and capitulation resulted in the cancellation of this program.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the [[10.5 cm]] KwK L/68.

Given that the Panzer IV and Panther tanks were often mistakenly reported by allied soldiers as \"Tigers\" due to their similar appearances to the Tiger I and II respectively it is more likely that the it was a case of mistaken identity.\n\nSome Tiger IIs were also present during the Soviet [[Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive|Vistula\u2013Oder]]<ref>Schneider 2000, p. 47.</ref> and [[East Prussian Offensive]]s in January 1945,<ref>Schneider 2000, pp. 89\u201391.</ref> as well as the German [[Lake Balaton Offensive]] in Hungary in March 1945,<ref>Schneider 2005, p. 217.</ref> the [[Battle of the Seelow Heights]] in April 1945, and the [[Battle of Berlin]] at the end of the war.<ref>Schneider 2005, pp. 300\u2013303.</ref> On 12 January 1945, a column of Tiger IIs among other tanks from 524th Heavy Panzer Battalion were involved in a short-range engagement with T-34 85 tanks near the village of [[Lis\u00f3w, Kielce County|Lisow]], with the Germans leaving behind 5 Tiger IIs, 7 Tiger Is and 5 Panthers for the loss of 4 T-34 85 tanks burnt out.<ref>https://worldoftanks.ru/ru/news/history/lisuv_battle_1945/</ref> The Germans claimed they had destroyed 50-60 IS-2s even though no IS-2 tanks were present. <ref>https://www.onlinetv.ru//video/2106/</ref>\n\nThe [[103rd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion]] (s.SS Pz.Abt. 503) claimed approximately 500 kills in the period from January to April 1945 on the Eastern Front for the loss of 45 Tiger IIs (most of which were abandoned and destroyed by their own crews after mechanical breakdowns or for lack of fuel).<ref>Schneider 2005, pp. 304, 324.</ref>\n\n===Gun and armour performance===\n[[File:Tiger II punctured in front turret.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A head-on view of a large tank with a flat-faced turret.

This was especially true on the Western Front where, until the arrival of the few [[M26 Pershing]]s in 1945 and the few [[M4 Sherman#Upgrades|M4A3E2 Sherman \"Jumbo\"s]] that were scattered around Europe after D-Day, neither the British nor US forces brought heavy tanks into service. A ''Wa Pr\u00fcf 1'' report estimated that the Tiger II's frontal aspect was impervious to the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T, the largest calibre tank gun of WW2. However, Soviet testing contradicted this as they found that the frontal glacis could be destroyed by firing 3-4 shots at the weld joints from the ranges of 500-600m<ref name=\"Tekhnika molodezhi\">{{cite book|last1=Zheltov|first1=Igor|title= TankoMaster Special Issues 02, 2002: Isoif Stalin|publisher= Tekhnika molodezhi|page=33}}</ref> which were found to be inferior in quality to that of previous German designs like the Tiger I or Panther.<ref name=\"Tigertest\">{{cite web |url=http://english.battlefield.ru/analytics/126-was-the-tiger-really-king.html |title=Was the Tiger really King?: Testing the King Tiger at Kubinka |work=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate= 2009-10-20 |date=19 September 2011 |quote=source: Tankomaster #6 1999.}}</ref> On the other hand, an R.A.C 3.d. document of February 1945 estimated that the British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm)]] gun, using [[armour-piercing discarding sabot]] shot was theoretically capable of penetrating the front of the Tiger II's turret and nose (lower front hull) at {{convert|1100|and|1200|yd|m|abbr=on}} respectively although, given the lack of a stated angle, this was presumably at the ideal 90 degrees and in combat the Tiger II was never penetrated frontally by the QF 17-Pounder.<ref name=\"KTHT34-36\">Jentz and Doyle, 1993 , pp 34\u201336</ref> \n\nAs a result of its thick frontal armour, flanking manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements.<ref name=\"Jary274\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 274.</ref> Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding {{convert|2.5|km}}, well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.<ref name=\"Jary258\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 258.</ref>\n\n===Soviet wartime testing===\n\nDuring August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B tanks were captured by the Soviets near [[Sandomierz]], and were soon moved to the testing grounds at [[Kubinka]]. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox. The right suspension of one of the tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 10\u201315&nbsp;km. The [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its \"colleague\", a Tiger Ausf B's turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152&nbsp;mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of [[spalling]] from the inside of the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Lab testing found that the armour plates lacked molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), resulting in low malleability.<ref name=\"Tigertest\">{{cite web |url=http://english.battlefield.ru/analytics/126-was-the-tiger-really-king.html |title=Was the Tiger really King?: Testing the King Tiger at Kubinka |work=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate= 2009-10-20 |date=19 September 2011 |quote=source: Tankomaster #6 1999.}}</ref><ref>[https://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article129869643/Der-riesige-deutsche-Koenigstiger-war-ein-Irrweg.html Der riesige deutsche \u201eK\u00f6nigstiger\u201c war ein Irrweg]Von Sven Felix Kellerhoff.

The firing test against the Tiger B turret front, however, was conducted after removal of the gun and mantlet, and resulted in penetrations close to armour openings, such as vision slits and gun location. The penetrations to the right gun opening were influenced by previous 100&nbsp;mm projectile penetration hits or armour damage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bird|first1=Lorrin Rexford|last2=Livingston|first2=Robert D.|title=WWII Ballistics - Armour and Gunnery|date=2001|publisher=Overmatch Press|page=90|<!-- accessdate=22 January 2015 -->}}</ref>The [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)|100 mm BS-3]] and [[122 mm gun M1931 (A-19)|122 mm A-19]] could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500\u2013600 metres after 3\u20134 shots.<ref name=\"Tekhnika molodezhi\">{{cite book|last1=Zheltov|first1=Igor|title= TankoMaster Special Issues 02, 2002: Isoif Stalin|publisher= Tekhnika molodezhi|page=33}}</ref>\n\nSome {{who|date=July 2018}} have said the large 122&nbsp;mm OF-471 (\u041e\u0424-471) [[High explosive|HE]] projectiles, equipped with a 3.8&nbsp;kg [[TNT]] charge, would easily crack and could even completely tear off the front armor plate at the seam weld, blow off the turret and driver sprocket<ref name=\"books.google.com.vn\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=MuGsf0psjvcC&pg=PA41&dq=is-2+powerful&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVsremgMvSAhUIU7wKHaX5DswQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=is-2%20powerful&f=false The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II, Chris Bishop, P. 41]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}, mechanical shock and explosion was often enough to knock out enemy heavy tanks without any armor penetration<ref name=\"books.google.com.vn\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=RLjQDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=122mm+shell+effect&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=122mm%20shell%20effect&f=false Soviet Heavy Tanks: World War 2 In Review Special]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Surviving vehicles==\n[[File:Koenigstiger Saumur F.jpg|thumb|alt=The side of a large tank with wide, wavy green and grey striped camouflage, as it drives past, the commander sitting in the cupola.|The working Tiger II of the ''Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s'' being displayed to the public, 2005]]The only working example is displayed at the ''[[Mus\u00e9e des Blind\u00e9s]]'', [[Saumur]], France.

The tank weighed almost 70 [[tonne]]s, and was protected by {{convert|100|to|185|mm|abbr=on}} of armour to the front.<ref name=\"J&Darmor\"/> It was armed with the long barrelled [[8.8 cm KwK 43|8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71]] anti-tank cannon.<ref group=notes>''Kampfwagenkanone'' \u2013 abbr: ''KwK'' (English: \"fighting vehicle cannon\")</ref> The chassis was also the basis for the [[Jagdtiger]] [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|turretless]] [[Jagdpanzer]] anti-tank vehicle.<ref name=\"Schneider19\">Schneider 1990, p. 18.</ref>\n\nThe Tiger II was issued to [[German heavy tank battalion|heavy tank battalions]] of the [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|Army]] and the [[Waffen-SS]]. It was first used in combat by [[503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion]] during the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]] on 11 July 1944;<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 37.</ref> on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the first unit to be outfitted with the Tiger II was the [[501st Heavy Panzer Battalion]], which by 1 September 1944 listed 25 Tiger IIs operational.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 40.</ref>\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment of a heavy tank design had been initiated in 1937; the initial design contract was awarded to [[Henschel & Son|Henschel]]. Another design contract followed in 1939, and was given to [[Ferdinand Porsche|Porsche]].<ref name=\"Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3\">Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3.</ref> Both prototype series used the same turret design from [[Krupp]]; the main differences were in the hull, transmission, suspension and automotive features.<ref name=\"Jentz & Doyle 1993, p. 3\"/>\n\n[[File:Chambois1.jpg|thumb|left|[[SHAEF]] commander Gen. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] walks by an overturned Tiger II. The overlapping, non-interleaved steel-rim roadwheel arrangement is visible.]]\nThe Henschel version used a conventional hull design with sloped armour resembling the layout of the Panther tank. It had a rear-mounted engine and used nine steel-tired, eighty-centimeter-diameter overlapping road wheels per side with internal springing, mounted on [[Torsion bar suspension|transverse torsion bars]], in a similar manner to the original Henschel-designed Tiger I. To simplify maintenance, however, as when the same steel-tired road wheels were used on later Tiger I hulls, the wheels were only overlapping ''without'' being interleaved\u2014the full ''Schachtellaufwerk'' rubber-rimmed road-wheel system that had been in use on nearly all German half-tracks used the interleaved design, later inherited by the early production versions of the Tiger&nbsp;I<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> and Panther.\n\nThe Porsche hull designs included a rear-mounted turret and a mid-mounted engine. The suspension was the same as on the ''[[Elefant]]'' tank destroyer. This had six road wheels per side mounted in paired [[bogies]] sprung with short longitudinal torsion bars that were integral to the wheel pair; this saved internal space and facilitated repairs. One Porsche version had a gasoline-electric drive (fundamentally identical to a [[Diesel-electric transmission]], only using a gasoline-fueled engine as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), similar to a [[gasoline-electric hybrid]] but without a storage battery; two separate [[drivetrain]]s in parallel, one per side of the tank, each consisting of a hybrid drive train; gasoline engine\u2013[[electric generator]]\u2013electric motor\u2013drive [[sprocket]]. This method of propulsion had been attempted before on the [[VK4501|Tiger (P)]] (later ''Elefant'' prototypes) and in some US designs and was put into production in the WW1 [[Saint-Chamond (tank)|Saint-Chamond]] tank and the post-WW1 FCM [[Char 2C]]. The Porsche suspension components were later used on a few of the later ''[[Jagdtiger]]'' tank destroyers. Another proposal was to use hydraulic drives. Dr. Porsche's unorthodox designs gathered little favour.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Munster Koenigstiger Porscheturm Modell detail.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A tank turret with a front face which curves up and down.

The rough [[Zimmerit]] coating is evident, used to prevent magnetic mines from adhering to the tank's armour.]]\n\nHenschel won the design contract, and all Tiger IIs were produced by the firm.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 17</ref> Two turret designs were used in production vehicles. The initial design is often misleadingly called the Tiger II (P), after the \"Porsche\" turret due to the misbelief that it was designed by Porsche for their [[VK 4502 (P)|prototype]]; in fact it was the initial Krupp design for both prototypes.<ref name=\":0\" /> This turret had a rounded front and steeply sloped sides, with a difficult-to-manufacture curved bulge on the turret's left side to accommodate the commander's cupola. Fifty early turrets were mounted to Henschel's hull and used in action. In December 1943 the more common \"production\" turret, sometimes erroneously called the \"Henschel\" turret, was simplified with a significantly thicker flat face, no [[shot trap]] (created by the curved face of the earlier turret), and less-steeply sloped sides, which prevented the need for a bulge for the commander's cupola, and added additional room for ammunition storage.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 13\u201316.</ref>\n\nThe turrets were designed to mount the [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] L/71 gun. Combined with the ''Turmzielfernrohr'' 9d (German \"turret telescopic sight\") monocular sight by Leitz, which all but a few early Tiger IIs used, it was a very accurate and deadly weapon. During practice, the estimated probability of a first-round hit on a {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|2.5|m|abbr=on}} wide target was 100 percent at {{convert|1000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, 95\u201397 percent at {{convert|1500|m|mi|abbr=on}} and 85\u201387 percent at {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}}, depending on ammunition type. Recorded combat performance was lower, but still over 80 percent at 1,000&nbsp;m, in the 60s at 1,500&nbsp;m and the 40s at 2,000&nbsp;m. Penetration of armoured plate inclined at 30 degrees was {{convert|202|and|132|mm|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|m|yd|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2000|m|mi|abbr=on}} respectively for the [[Panzergranate 39|''Panzergranate'' 39/43]] projectile (PzGr\u2014[[armor-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing shell]]), and {{convert|238|and|153|mm|abbr=on}} for the PzGr. 40/43 projectile between the same ranges. The ''Sprenggranate'' 43 (SpGr) high-explosive round was available for soft targets, or the ''Hohlgranate'' or ''Hohlgeschoss'' 39 (HlGr\u2014HEAT or [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead]]) round, which had {{convert|90|mm|abbr=on}} penetration at any range, could be used as a dual-purpose munition against soft or armoured targets.<ref name=\"J&D23-24\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 23\u201324</ref>\n\nPowered turret traverse was provided by the variable speed Boehringer-Sturm L4S hydraulic motor, which was driven from the main engine by a secondary drive shaft. A high and a low speed setting was available to the gunner via a lever on his right. The turret could be rotated 360 degrees at 6\u00ba/second in low gear independent of engine rpm, at 19\u00ba/second \u2014 [[Tiger I#Mobility and reliability|the same as with the Tiger I]] \u2014  with the high speed setting and engine at 2000 rpm, and over 36\u00ba/second at the maximum allowable engine speed of 3000 rpm. The direction and speed of traverse were controlled by the gunner through foot pedals, or a control lever near his left arm. If power was lost, such as when the tank ran out of fuel, the turret could be slowly traversed by hand, assisted by the loader who had an additional wheel, which could manually rotate the turret at a rate of one-half a degree per each revolution of the hand crank (i.e. 20\u00b0 turret rotation required 40 full cranks of the handwheel, and to turn the turret a full 360\u00b0 the gunner would be required to crank the handwheel 720 full revolutions).\n\n[[File:Tiger II mg 7802.jpg|thumb|alt=The overhanging rear face of a large tank, two laterally spaced exhaust pipes protrude from mountings, pointing upwards, curving away from the vehicle at their ends.|Rear view showing dual exhausts]]\nLike all German tanks, the Tiger II had a [[petrol engine]]; in this case the same 700 [[Horsepower#PS|PS]] (690&nbsp;hp, 515&nbsp;kW) V-12 [[Maybach HL230|Maybach HL 230 P30]] which powered the much lighter [[Panther tank|Panther]] and [[Tiger I]] tanks. The Tiger II was under-powered, like many other heavy tanks of World War II, and consumed a lot of fuel, which was in short supply for the Germans. The transmission was the Maybach OLVAR EG 40 12 16 Model B, giving eight forward gears and four reverse, which drove the steering gear. This was the Henschel L 801, a double radius design which proved susceptible to failure. Transverse torsion bar suspension supported the hull on nine axles per side. Overlapped {{convert|800|mm|abbr=on}} diameter road wheels with rubber cushions and steel tyres rode inside the tracks.<ref name=\"J&D11-12\">Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 11\u201312.</ref>\n\nLike the Tiger I, each tank was issued with two sets of tracks: a normal \"battle track\" and a narrower \"transport\" version used during rail movement. The transport tracks reduced the overall width of the load and could be used to drive the tank short distances on firm ground. The crew were expected to change to normal battle tracks as soon as the tank was unloaded. Ground pressure was 0.76&nbsp;kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (10.8 psi).<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Command variant===\nThe command variant of the Tiger II was designated ''Panzerbefehlswagen'' Tiger ''Ausf. B''. It had two versions, ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 and ''Sd.Kfz''. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8&nbsp;cm ammunition to provide room to    accommodate the extra radios and equipment,<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The ''Sd.Kfz''. 267 was to have used ''FuG'' 8 and ''FuG'' 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a {{convert|2|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|spell=in}} rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a ''Sternantenne D'' (\"Star antenna D\"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105&nbsp;mm ''Antennenfu\u00df Nr. 1''), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear decking in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment.<ref name=\"J&D16\"/> The ''Sd.Kfz''. 268 used ''FuG'' 7 and ''FuG'' 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.<ref>Jentz and Doyle 1993, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe Tiger II was developed late in the war and built in relatively small numbers. Orders were placed for 1,500 Tiger IIs\u2014slightly more than the 1,347 [[Tiger I]] tanks produced\u2014but production was severely disrupted by Allied bombing raids.<ref name=\"Manchester68-498\">Manchester 1968, p. 498.</ref> Among others, five raids between 22 September and 7 October 1944 destroyed 95 percent of the floor area of the Henschel plant.

The 503rd then took part in the [[Battle of Debrecen]]. The 503rd remained in the Hungarian theater of operations for 166 days, during which it accounted for at least 121 Soviet tanks, 244 anti-tank guns and artillery pieces, five aircraft and a train. This was set against the loss of 25 Tiger IIs; ten were knocked out by Soviet troops and burned out, two were sent back to Vienna for a factory overhaul, while thirteen were blown up by their crews for various reasons, usually to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. [[Kurt Knispel]], the highest scoring tank ace of all time (162 enemy [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s destroyed), also served with the 503rd, and was killed in action on 29 April 1945 in his Tiger II.<ref name=\"Sz\u00e1mv\u00e9ber147\">Sz\u00e1mv\u00e9ber, 2000. p. 147.</ref>\n\nThe Tiger II was also used in significant numbers, distributed into four heavy panzer battalions, during the [[Ardennes Offensive]] (also known as the Battle of the Bulge) of December 1944.<ref>Schneider 2005, pp. 214\u2013216.</ref> At least 150 Tiger IIs were present, nearly a third of total production, and most were lost during the course of the offensive.<ref>Green, Michael. \"German Tanks of World War II\".

This was especially true on the Western Front where, until the arrival of the few [[M26 Pershing]]s in 1945 and the few [[M4 Sherman#Upgrades|M4A3E2 Sherman \"Jumbo\"s]] that were scattered around Europe after D-Day, neither the British nor US forces brought heavy tanks into service. A ''Wa Pr\u00fcf 1'' report estimated that the Tiger II's frontal aspect was impervious to the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T, the largest calibre tank gun of WW2. However, Soviet testing contradicted this as they found that the frontal glacis could be destroyed by firing 3-4 shots at the weld joints from the ranges of 500-600m<ref name=\"Tekhnika molodezhi\">{{cite book|last1=Zheltov|first1=Igor|title= TankoMaster Special Issues 02, 2002: Isoif Stalin|publisher= Tekhnika molodezhi|page=33}}</ref> which were found to be inferior in quality to that of previous German designs like the Tiger I or Panther.<ref name=\"Tigertest\">{{cite web |url=http://english.battlefield.ru/analytics/126-was-the-tiger-really-king.html |title=Was the Tiger really King?: Testing the King Tiger at Kubinka |work=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate= 2009-10-20 |date=19 September 2011 |quote=source: Tankomaster #6 1999.}}</ref> On the other hand, an R.A.C 3.d. document of February 1945 estimated that the British [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder|QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm)]] gun, using [[armour-piercing discarding sabot]] shot was theoretically capable of penetrating the front of the Tiger II's turret and nose (lower front hull) at {{convert|1100|and|1200|yd|m|abbr=on}} respectively although, given the lack of a stated angle, this was presumably at the ideal 90 degrees and in combat the Tiger II was never penetrated frontally by the QF 17-Pounder.<ref name=\"KTHT34-36\">Jentz and Doyle, 1993 , pp 34\u201336</ref> \n\nAs a result of its thick frontal armour, flanking manoeuvres were most often used against the Tiger II to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour, giving a tactical advantage to the Tiger II in most engagements.<ref name=\"Jary274\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 274.</ref> Moreover, the main armament of the Tiger II was capable of knocking out any Allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding {{convert|2.5|km}}, well beyond the effective range of Allied tank guns.<ref name=\"Jary258\">Jarymowycz 2001, p. 258.</ref>\n\n===Soviet wartime testing===\n\nDuring August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B tanks were captured by the Soviets near [[Sandomierz]], and were soon moved to the testing grounds at [[Kubinka]]. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox. The right suspension of one of the tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 10\u201315&nbsp;km. The [[8.8 cm KwK 43]] gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122&nbsp;mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its \"colleague\", a Tiger Ausf B's turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152&nbsp;mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of [[spalling]] from the inside of the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Lab testing found that the armour plates lacked molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), resulting in low malleability.<ref name=\"Tigertest\">{{cite web |url=http://english.battlefield.ru/analytics/126-was-the-tiger-really-king.html |title=Was the Tiger really King?: Testing the King Tiger at Kubinka |work=The Russian Battlefield|accessdate= 2009-10-20 |date=19 September 2011 |quote=source: Tankomaster #6 1999.}}</ref><ref>[https://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article129869643/Der-riesige-deutsche-Koenigstiger-war-ein-Irrweg.html Der riesige deutsche \u201eK\u00f6nigstiger\u201c war ein Irrweg]Von Sven Felix Kellerhoff.

[[Mohammed Hossein Fahmideh]], a 13-year-old boy who fought in the war, is said to be the first Muslim to have participated in such an attack in contemporary history. He strapped [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s to his chest and blew himself up under an Iraqi tank in November 1980. [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] declared Fahmideh a national hero and inspiration for further volunteers for martyrdom.<ref>[http://www.tebyan.net/index.aspx?pid=52570 Our leader: Mohammed Hossein Fahmideh]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article626388.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=The making of a suicide bomber | date=September 3, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>  Other Iranian [[basij]] volunteers ran through minefields to detonate buried [[landmine]]s and clear a safe battlefield path for following soldiers.\n\n[[Shia]] usually refer to the martyrdom of [[Hussain ibn Ali]] and his companions and family members in the [[Battle of Karbala]] as role models and inspiration for martyrdom as a glorious and noble death.\n\nWhen the Palestinian Islamist group [[Hamas]] first carried out [[suicide attacks]] \u2013 involved strapping the body of the mission carrier with explosives \u2013 in the Israeli-inhabited towns of Afula and Khidara in the spring of 1994, it \"described these operations as ''`amaliyat istishhadiya'' (martyrdom operations)\" rather than the more secular ''a'maliyat fida'iyah'' (self-sacrifice operations).  The term 'amaliyat istishhadiya has caught on and \"today, istishhad is the most frequently used term to refer to acts of sacrifice in the Palestinian resistance and is used by Islamic, secular, and Marxist groups alike\".<ref name=\"whitehead\"/>\n\nAccording to one scholar, [[Noah Feldman]]: \"The vocabulary of martyrdom and sacrifice, the formal videotaped preconfession of faith, the technological tinkering to increase deadliness\u2014all are now instantly recognizable to every Muslim.\" Feldman sees a worrying trend in the steady expansion of the targets of Istishhad since its debut in 1983 when successful bombing of [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|barracks]] and [[1983 United States Embassy bombing|embassy buildings]] drove the U.S. military out of Lebanon.\n\n<blockquote>First the targets were American soldiers, then mostly [[Israel]]is, including women and children. From [[Lebanon]] and Israel, the technique of suicide bombing moved to [[Iraq]], where the targets have included mosques and shrines, and the intended victims have mostly been [[Shia|Shiite]] [[Iraqi people|Iraqis]]. The newest testing ground is Afghanistan, where both the perpetrators and the targets are orthodox [[Sunni]] Muslims. Not long ago, a bombing in [[Lashkar Gah]], the capital of [[Helmand Province]], killed Muslims, including women, who were applying to go on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. Overall, the trend is definitively in the direction of Muslim-on-Muslim violence. By a conservative accounting, more than three times as many Iraqis have been killed by suicide bombings in the last 3 years as have Israelis in the last 10. Suicide bombing has become the archetype of Muslim violence\u2014not just to frightened Westerners but also to Muslims themselves.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">[[Noah Feldman]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/magazine/29islam.html?pagewanted=all \"Islam, Terror and the Second Nuclear Age\"], ''New York Times'', October 29, 2006</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ General Statistics for <BR>suicide attacks in 22 conflicts{{#tag:ref|Year:1982\u20132015.

The term is usually used by [[Islam|Muslim]] militants, although non-Muslim groups, such as the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], have also engaged in suicide attacks. [[Islamism|Islamist]] militants prefer the term \"martyrdom operation\" to \"suicide attack\", as suicide is forbidden under classical Islamic law.  While combat inherently involves a risk of death, a \"martyrdom operation\" implies a deliberate act leading to death as part of the attack.\n\nActs of istishhad are governed by Islamic legal [[Rules of war in Islam|rules associated with armed warfare]] or military jihad.  The rules governing [[jihad]], literally meaning struggle but often called \"[[religious war|holy war]]\" by non-Muslims, are covered in exquisite detail in the classical texts of Islamic jurisprudence.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> In orthodox Islamic law, jihad is a collective religious obligation on the Muslim community, when the community is endangered or Muslims are subjected to oppression and subjugation. The rules governing such conflicts include not killing women, children or non-combatants, and leaving cultivated or residential areas undamaged.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/><ref name=\"Buntzie Ellis Churchill 2008, pp. 145-153\">Bernard Lewis and Buntzie Ellis Churchill, ''Islam: The Religion and the People'', Wharton School Publishing, 2008, pp. 145\u2013153</ref><ref>Muhammad Hamidullah, ''The Muslim Conduct of State'' (Ashraf Printing Press 1987): pp. 205\u2013208</ref>\n\nFor more than a millennium, these tenets were accepted by Sunnis and Shiites; however, since the 1980s militant Islamists have challenged the traditional Islamic rules of warfare in an attempt to justify suicide attacks despite clear contradictions to established Islamic laws.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/><ref name=\"Buntzie Ellis Churchill 2008, pp. 145-153\"/>\n\n==Scholarship==\nSome Western and Muslim [[List of modern-day Muslim scholars of Islam|scholars of Islam]] find [[suicide attack]]s to be a clear violation of classical Islamic law. Nevertheless, the militant groups that carry out \"martyrdom operations\" believe that their actions fulfill the obligation of [[jihad]], and  some clerics support this view.\n\n===Against suicide attacks===\n\nSuicide bombings as acts of [[terrorism]] have spurred some Muslims to provide scholastic refutations of suicide bombings and to condemn them. For example, Ihsanic Intelligence, a [[London]]-based Islamic [[think tank]], published a study on suicide bombings that concluded, \"suicide bombing is anathema, antithetical and abhorrent to [[Sunni Islam]]. It is considered legally forbidden, constituting a reprehensible innovation in the Islamic tradition, morally an enormity of sin combining suicide and murder and theologically an act which has consequences of eternal damnation\".<ref name=\"hijacked_caravan\">[http://www.ihsanic-intelligence.com/dox/The_Hijacked_Caravan.pdf \"The Hijacked Caravan: Refuting Suicide Bombings as Martyrdom Operations in Contemporary ''Jihad'' Strategy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906062050/http://www.ihsanic-intelligence.com/dox/The_Hijacked_Caravan.pdf |date=2005-09-06 }}, Ihsanic Intelligence</ref>\n\nOxford-based Malaysian jurist Shaykh [[Afifi al-Akiti]], issued his fatwa forbidding suicide bombing and targeting innocent civilians: \"If the attack involves a bomb placed on the body or placed so close to the bomber that when the bomber detonates it the bomber is certain [yaqin] to die, then the More Correct Position according to us is that it does constitute suicide.

He strapped [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s to his chest and blew himself up under an Iraqi tank in November 1980.

The term 'amaliyat istishhadiya has caught on and \"today, istishhad is the most frequently used term to refer to acts of sacrifice in the Palestinian resistance and is used by Islamic, secular, and Marxist groups alike\".<ref name=\"whitehead\"/>\n\nAccording to one scholar, [[Noah Feldman]]: \"The vocabulary of martyrdom and sacrifice, the formal videotaped preconfession of faith, the technological tinkering to increase deadliness\u2014all are now instantly recognizable to every Muslim.\" Feldman sees a worrying trend in the steady expansion of the targets of Istishhad since its debut in 1983 when successful bombing of [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|barracks]] and [[1983 United States Embassy bombing|embassy buildings]] drove the U.S. military out of Lebanon.\n\n<blockquote>First the targets were American soldiers, then mostly [[Israel]]is, including women and children. From [[Lebanon]] and Israel, the technique of suicide bombing moved to [[Iraq]], where the targets have included mosques and shrines, and the intended victims have mostly been [[Shia|Shiite]] [[Iraqi people|Iraqis]]. The newest testing ground is Afghanistan, where both the perpetrators and the targets are orthodox [[Sunni]] Muslims. Not long ago, a bombing in [[Lashkar Gah]], the capital of [[Helmand Province]], killed Muslims, including women, who were applying to go on [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]]. Overall, the trend is definitively in the direction of Muslim-on-Muslim violence. By a conservative accounting, more than three times as many Iraqis have been killed by suicide bombings in the last 3 years as have Israelis in the last 10. Suicide bombing has become the archetype of Muslim violence\u2014not just to frightened Westerners but also to Muslims themselves.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">[[Noah Feldman]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/magazine/29islam.html?pagewanted=all \"Islam, Terror and the Second Nuclear Age\"], ''New York Times'', October 29, 2006</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ General Statistics for <BR>suicide attacks in 22 conflicts{{#tag:ref|Year:1982\u20132015.

The term is usually used by [[Islam|Muslim]] militants, although non-Muslim groups, such as the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], have also engaged in suicide attacks. [[Islamism|Islamist]] militants prefer the term \"martyrdom operation\" to \"suicide attack\", as suicide is forbidden under classical Islamic law.  While combat inherently involves a risk of death, a \"martyrdom operation\" implies a deliberate act leading to death as part of the attack.\n\nActs of istishhad are governed by Islamic legal [[Rules of war in Islam|rules associated with armed warfare]] or military jihad.  The rules governing [[jihad]], literally meaning struggle but often called \"[[religious war|holy war]]\" by non-Muslims, are covered in exquisite detail in the classical texts of Islamic jurisprudence.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> In orthodox Islamic law, jihad is a collective religious obligation on the Muslim community, when the community is endangered or Muslims are subjected to oppression and subjugation.

Nevertheless, the militant groups that carry out \"martyrdom operations\" believe that their actions fulfill the obligation of [[jihad]], and  some clerics support this view.\n\n===Against suicide attacks===\n\nSuicide bombings as acts of [[terrorism]] have spurred some Muslims to provide scholastic refutations of suicide bombings and to condemn them. For example, Ihsanic Intelligence, a [[London]]-based Islamic [[think tank]], published a study on suicide bombings that concluded, \"suicide bombing is anathema, antithetical and abhorrent to [[Sunni Islam]]. It is considered legally forbidden, constituting a reprehensible innovation in the Islamic tradition, morally an enormity of sin combining suicide and murder and theologically an act which has consequences of eternal damnation\".<ref name=\"hijacked_caravan\">[http://www.ihsanic-intelligence.com/dox/The_Hijacked_Caravan.pdf \"The Hijacked Caravan: Refuting Suicide Bombings as Martyrdom Operations in Contemporary ''Jihad'' Strategy\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906062050/http://www.ihsanic-intelligence.com/dox/The_Hijacked_Caravan.pdf |date=2005-09-06 }}, Ihsanic Intelligence</ref>\n\nOxford-based Malaysian jurist Shaykh [[Afifi al-Akiti]], issued his fatwa forbidding suicide bombing and targeting innocent civilians: \"If the attack involves a bomb placed on the body or placed so close to the bomber that when the bomber detonates it the bomber is certain [yaqin] to die, then the More Correct Position according to us is that it does constitute suicide.
