They currently make up between 8 and 9% of the total population and number around 4.5\u20135 million. They are found in large numbers in practically every province in [[South Africa]], although always as a minority, and are high in concentration in [[List of cities in South Africa|large cities]].\n\nHistorically in the pre-1994 provinces, the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and [[Orange Free State]] were predominantly Afrikaans-speaking, [[Natal Province|Natal]] was mostly English-speaking, while the [[Cape Province]] was largely mixed.\n\n==By province==\n[[Afrikaner]]s are located in all parts of the nation, apart from the former homelands such as [[Transkei]] and [[KwaZulu]], where they are very small in number. English-speaking whites are generally concentrated in Natal, Johannesburg and major settlements in the Cape. Other white groups (such as Portuguese and Germans) live mostly in Johannesburg or Cape Town. In the former homelands, the white populations are so tiny, that even the slightest population can affect how Afrikaans or English speaking they are. Of the largest cities in the country, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, East London and Pietermaritzburg are largely English speaking in the core, while Pretoria, Bloemfontein, Kimberley, Polokwane, Nelspruit, Witbank and Rustenburg are predominantly Afrikaans speaking. Port Elizabeth is largely mixed.\n[[File:South Africa 2001 linguistic distribution of white people map.svg|thumb|350px|left|Distribution of Afrikaans versus English as home language of white South Africans.\n{{legend|#2166ac|87.5\u2013100% Afrikaans}}\n{{legend|#4393c3|75\u201387.5% Afrikaans}}\n{{legend|#92c5de|62.5\u201375% Afrikaans}}\n{{legend|#d1e5f0|50\u201362.5% Afrikaans}}\n{{legend|#fddbc7|50\u201362.5% English}}\n{{legend|#f4a582|62.5\u201375% English}}\n{{legend|#d6604d|75\u201387.5% English}}\n{{legend|#b2182b|87.5\u2013100% English}}]]\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+White population of South Africa by province and first language, 2001<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/timeseriesdata/pxweb2006/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=Language%20by%20province&ti=Table%3A+Census+2001+by+province%2C+language%2C+population+group+and++gender.&path=../Database/South%20Africa/Population%20Census/Census%202001%20-%20NEW%20Demarcation%20boundaries%20as%20at%209%20December%202005/Provincial%20level%20-%20Persons/&lang=1 |title=Table: Census 2001 by province, language, population group and gender. |work=Census 2001 |publisher=Statistics South Africa |accessdate=18 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130131334/http://www.statssa.gov.za/timeseriesdata/pxweb2006/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=Language%20by%20province&ti=Table%3A+Census+2001+by+province%2C+language%2C+population+group+and++gender.&path=..%2FDatabase%2FSouth%20Africa%2FPopulation%20Census%2FCensus%202001%20-%20NEW%20Demarcation%20boundaries%20as%20at%209%20December%202005%2FProvincial%20level%20-%20Persons%2F&lang=1 |archivedate=30 November 2006 }}</ref>\n|-\n!Province !!Afrikaans !!% Afrikaans !!English !!% English !!Other !!% Other !!''Total''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Eastern Cape]]||149,395||48.8%||153,434||50.2%||3,010||1.0%||''305,839''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]]||214,020||89.6%||22,225||9.3%||2,544||1.1%||''238,789''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Gauteng]]||984,472||56.7%||716,403||41.3%||34,219||2.0%||''1,735,094''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[KwaZulu-Natal]]||115,721||24.0%||357,200||74.1%||9,193||1.9%||''482,114''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Limpopo (South African province)|Limpopo]]||115,921||87.5%||14,898||11.3%||1,602||1.2%||''132,421''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Mpumalanga]]||164,620||83.5%||29,678||15.1%||2,780||1.4%||''197,078''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[North West (South African province)|North West]]||237,598||89.0%||26,346||9.9%||2,940||1.1%||''266,884''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Northern Cape]]||93,637||91.3%||7,737||7.5%||1,144||1.1%||''102,518''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Western Cape]]||461,522||55.4%||359,738||43.2%||11,639||1.4%||''832,899''\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Total||'''2,536,906'''||'''59.1%'''||'''1,687,659'''||'''39.3%'''||'''69,071'''||'''1.6%'''||'''''4,293,636'''''\n|}\n\n===Eastern Cape===\nThe Eastern cape has one of the lowest percentages of whites in South Africa, which is currently around 4.7%. They number just above 300,000. Similarly to the Limpopo province, whites as a percent of the population varies around the Eastern Cape. The East, where the former black designated homelands of [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]] are found, have both a high density of black people, and only a small number of whites. For example, in the [[OR Tambo District Municipality]], located in the former Transkei, only 0.1% of the 1.6 million inhabitants are white. On the other hand, in the west, Local Municipalities such as in the [[Cacadu District Municipality]], contain white percentages exceeding 10%, with the highest being the [[Kouga Local Municipality]], which stands at 25.4%. The largest white population centre is [[Port Elizabeth]], which houses over half (170,000) of the Eastern Cape's white population. Other major white populations exist in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], [[Grahamstown]], [[Graaff-Reinet]], and a number of [[List of cities and towns in the Eastern Cape|smaller towns]]. The Eastern Cape houses the most equal mix of both English and Afrikaans speaking whites. The geographic background of the province shows a mix of English and Afrikaans place names, with no clear distinction between where Afrikaans or English speakers live.\n\n===Free State===\nThe Afrikaners far outnumber English-speaking white people in the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] (formerly called the ''Orange Free State''), because British immigration to the region was very limited. They are predominant in practically all cities, and in many farms. The Afrikaner population is largest around [[Bloemfontein]], which currently holds an estimated 100,000 white people (or a third of the total in the province). The white percentage has recently rebounded after prolonged decline.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 1880 the white percentage was 45.7% and 24 years later, this declined to 36.8% in 1904.<ref>{{cite EB1911|first=Alfred Peter |last=Hillier |first2=Frank Richardson |last2=Cana |wstitle=Orange Free State |display=Orange Free State \u00a7 Inhabitants |volume=20 |page=152}}</ref> Despite a long and steady decline all through the 20th century, the 2007 Community Survey showed the white percentage of the Free State increased from 8.8% to 9.6%. There could be issues with this figure as overall the population of some municipalities decreased in population by up to 50%, which meant that the \"missing\" black people counted resulted in an increased white percentage. Major white populations are also found in cities such as [[Welkom]], [[Kroonstad]] and [[Sasolburg]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Gauteng===\n[[Gauteng]] has both the highest percentage (18.4%) and number (just under 2 million) of white people compared to any of the [[provinces of South Africa|other provinces]]. Afrikaner whites tend to be gathered in and around [[Pretoria]] (with around 450,000 Afrikaners), the [[East Rand|East]] and [[West Rand]], and in many other [[List of cities and towns in Gauteng|cities and towns in Gauteng]]. English-speaking white South Africans are mostly found in central Gauteng, namely [[Johannesburg]] and the [[East Rand]]. Also, the [[Midvaal Local Municipality]], located in Gauteng, contains one of the highest percentage of whites in the country, which in 2007 stood at 35%.\n\n===KwaZulu-Natal===\n[[KwaZulu-Natal]] is the only province where the vast majority of white people are English-speaking.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ac1qgEEtI0C&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=english+whites+in+natal&source=bl&ots=4-pF8o_QaX&sig=QG6xB4Ys2DBJQPKX5ykO37LjYR0&hl=en&ei=hwVcTZT5H6OAhAfFpe2HDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=english%20whites%20in%20natal&f=false The highest stage of white supremacy - Google Books]</ref> However, there do remain some towns in the north with large Afrikaner populations such as in the town of [[Vryheid]]. Before 1994 the province was just called Natal, and in the [[South African republic referendum, 1960|1960 republic referendum]], it was the only province to vote against severing links to the British Crown. KwaZulu-Natal, like most provinces, has experienced a both numerical and proportional decline in the white population. Over half of KwaZulu-Natal's white population lives in Durban and its surrounding suburbs.\n\n===Limpopo===\nThe [[Limpopo]] province has the smallest percentage of white people of any province in the country, which in 2007 stood at 2.2%. They are almost entirely Afrikaners. The white population is very unevenly spread. Some municipalities, especially in the more lightly populated west, have white percentages reaching far beyond 10% such as the [[Thabazimbi Local Municipality|Thabazimbi]] (23%), [[Bela-Bela Local Municipality|Bela-Bela]] (13%) and [[Mookgopong Local Municipality]] (21%). Conversely, in the much more densely populated East (where the former homelands of [[Gazankulu]], [[Lebowa]] and [[Venda]] lie), the white percentage drops significantly due to the high black population density. Some municipalities, including the [[Thulamela Local Municipality|Thumamela]] and [[Mutale Local Municipality]], have white populations of no more than 500, and therefore percentages reaching as low as 0.05%. The capital city, [[Polokwane]] (formerly Pietersburg), holds around 27,000 whites, making up just under a fourth of the province's white population. Other major white concentrations are in [[Tzaneen]], [[Phalaborwa]], [[Thabazimbi]], [[Louis Trichardt]] and practically every settlement along the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] national road.\n\n===Mpumalanga===\nIn 2007 roughly 6.7% of Mpumalanga was white. The majority of whites in Mpumalanga are Afrikaans speaking. Approximately 250,000 whites live in Mpumalanga, with major population centres being the capital, [[Nelspruit]] and other large cities such as [[Witbank]], [[Middelburg, Mpumalanga|Middelburg]], [[Ermelo, Mpumalanga|Ermelo]] and [[Lydenburg]].\n\n===Northwest Province===\nThe [[Northwest Province (South Africa)|Northwest Province]] has an almost identical situation to that of Mpumalanga. There is a very strong and patriotic Afrikaner community, and the province is also the birthplace of the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB), which was created in [[Ventersdorp, North West|Ventersdorp]]. There is an especially strong Afrikaner influence in the city of [[Potchefstroom]]. In 2007 there were 235,580 whites, making up roughly 7.2% (up from 6.7% in 2001) of the province's total population. The vast majority are Afrikaans speaking.\n\n===Northern Cape===\nThe [[Northern Cape]]'s small white population is also dominated by Afrikaners, with some English whites in cities such as [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. Although the white population only number no more than 100,000, because the province is very sparsely populated, it means the white population has remained very much above 10%, even since 1994.<ref>Despite the white population percentage decrease since 1994, the Northern Cape has retained a white percentage of 10%+</ref> Roughly 25% of whites live in the [[Sol Plaatje Local Municipality]], which contains the Diamond-mining city of Kimberley. Although only having about 12,000 white inhabitants, the [[Namakwa District Municipality]], in the very sparse western Northern Cape, they still manage to make up over 11% of the District Municipality's population. Afrikaans is the [[lingua franca]] in the Northern Cape, because the majority of the province (mostly Coloureds) speak it as a first language. Only in the north-eastern areas are there more blacks than Coloureds, and as well as far fewer white people. Besides Kimberley, other important white concentrations are found in [[Upington]], [[Britstown]], [[Springbok, Northern Cape|Springbok]], [[De Aar]], [[Jan Kempdorp]] and [[Barkly West]]. [[Orania, Northern Cape|Orania]], a purpose-built town for only-Afrikaans-speaking whites, is also located in the east of the Northern Cape, bordering the Free State. It houses just over 1400 inhabitants and is a special case as it is the only \"main-place\"<ref>In South African censuses, a \"main place\" is a locality representing a village, e.g. ''Centurion'', is a \"main-place\" within Tshwane municipality.</ref> where virtually all inhabitants are white.\n\n===Western Cape===\n[[File:Minister Alan Winde (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Alan Winde]], the Premier of the Western Cape, is an English White South African]]\nThe [[Western Cape]] has the second-highest percentage of white people (18.4%) in South Africa, at 850 000 and the only one with a [[Alan Winde|White premier]] (governor). The lingua franca is Afrikaans, although some urban areas, especially Cape Town, have a large English speaking population. Many Cape Town suburbs and neighbourhoods have white majorities, including some with a white population of 95% or greater including: [[Llandudno, Cape Town|Llandudno]], [[Fish Hoek]], [[Constantia, Cape Town|Constantia]] and [[Noordhoek, Cape Town|Noordhoek]]. The Western Cape has some of the highest white percentage municipalities in South Africa, such as the [[Overstrand Local Municipality|Overstrand]] (33%), [[Cape Agulhas Local Municipality|Cape Agulhas]] (23%), [[Mossel Bay Local Municipality|Mossel Bay]] (28%), [[Knysna Local Municipality|Knysna]] (23%) and [[Hessequa Local Municipality|Hessequa]] (38%) to name a few.\n\n== Largest population centres ==\nThis is an incomplete list of the \"main places\" (localities) in South Africa with a white population of more than 10,000.

They currently make up between 8 and 9% of the total population and number around 4.5\u20135 million. They are found in large numbers in practically every province in [[South Africa]], although always as a minority, and are high in concentration in [[List of cities in South Africa|large cities]].\n\nHistorically in the pre-1994 provinces, the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] and [[Orange Free State]] were predominantly Afrikaans-speaking, [[Natal Province|Natal]] was mostly English-speaking, while the [[Cape Province]] was largely mixed.\n\n==By province==\n[[Afrikaner]]s are located in all parts of the nation, apart from the former homelands such as [[Transkei]] and [[KwaZulu]], where they are very small in number. English-speaking whites are generally concentrated in Natal, Johannesburg and major settlements in the Cape. Other white groups (such as Portuguese and Germans) live mostly in Johannesburg or Cape Town. In the former homelands, the white populations are so tiny, that even the slightest population can affect how Afrikaans or English speaking they are. Of the largest cities in the country, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, East London and Pietermaritzburg are largely English speaking in the core, while Pretoria, Bloemfontein, Kimberley, Polokwane, Nelspruit, Witbank and Rustenburg are predominantly Afrikaans speaking. Port Elizabeth is largely mixed.\n[[File:South Africa 2001 linguistic distribution of white people map.svg|thumb|350px|left|Distribution of Afrikaans versus English as home language of white South Africans.\n{{legend|#2166ac|87.5\u2013100% Afrikaans}}\n{{legend|#4393c3|75\u201387.5% Afrikaans}}\n{{legend|#92c5de|62.5\u201375% Afrikaans}}\n{{legend|#d1e5f0|50\u201362.5% Afrikaans}}\n{{legend|#fddbc7|50\u201362.5% English}}\n{{legend|#f4a582|62.5\u201375% English}}\n{{legend|#d6604d|75\u201387.5% English}}\n{{legend|#b2182b|87.5\u2013100% English}}]]\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+White population of South Africa by province and first language, 2001<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/timeseriesdata/pxweb2006/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=Language%20by%20province&ti=Table%3A+Census+2001+by+province%2C+language%2C+population+group+and++gender.&path=../Database/South%20Africa/Population%20Census/Census%202001%20-%20NEW%20Demarcation%20boundaries%20as%20at%209%20December%202005/Provincial%20level%20-%20Persons/&lang=1 |title=Table: Census 2001 by province, language, population group and gender. |work=Census 2001 |publisher=Statistics South Africa |accessdate=18 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130131334/http://www.statssa.gov.za/timeseriesdata/pxweb2006/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=Language%20by%20province&ti=Table%3A+Census+2001+by+province%2C+language%2C+population+group+and++gender.&path=..%2FDatabase%2FSouth%20Africa%2FPopulation%20Census%2FCensus%202001%20-%20NEW%20Demarcation%20boundaries%20as%20at%209%20December%202005%2FProvincial%20level%20-%20Persons%2F&lang=1 |archivedate=30 November 2006 }}</ref>\n|-\n!Province !!Afrikaans !!% Afrikaans !!English !!% English !!Other !!% Other !!''Total''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Eastern Cape]]||149,395||48.8%||153,434||50.2%||3,010||1.0%||''305,839''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]]||214,020||89.6%||22,225||9.3%||2,544||1.1%||''238,789''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Gauteng]]||984,472||56.7%||716,403||41.3%||34,219||2.0%||''1,735,094''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[KwaZulu-Natal]]||115,721||24.0%||357,200||74.1%||9,193||1.9%||''482,114''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Limpopo (South African province)|Limpopo]]||115,921||87.5%||14,898||11.3%||1,602||1.2%||''132,421''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Mpumalanga]]||164,620||83.5%||29,678||15.1%||2,780||1.4%||''197,078''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[North West (South African province)|North West]]||237,598||89.0%||26,346||9.9%||2,940||1.1%||''266,884''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Northern Cape]]||93,637||91.3%||7,737||7.5%||1,144||1.1%||''102,518''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| [[Western Cape]]||461,522||55.4%||359,738||43.2%||11,639||1.4%||''832,899''\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n|style=\"text-align:left\"| Total||'''2,536,906'''||'''59.1%'''||'''1,687,659'''||'''39.3%'''||'''69,071'''||'''1.6%'''||'''''4,293,636'''''\n|}\n\n===Eastern Cape===\nThe Eastern cape has one of the lowest percentages of whites in South Africa, which is currently around 4.7%. They number just above 300,000. Similarly to the Limpopo province, whites as a percent of the population varies around the Eastern Cape. The East, where the former black designated homelands of [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]] are found, have both a high density of black people, and only a small number of whites. For example, in the [[OR Tambo District Municipality]], located in the former Transkei, only 0.1% of the 1.6 million inhabitants are white. On the other hand, in the west, Local Municipalities such as in the [[Cacadu District Municipality]], contain white percentages exceeding 10%, with the highest being the [[Kouga Local Municipality]], which stands at 25.4%. The largest white population centre is [[Port Elizabeth]], which houses over half (170,000) of the Eastern Cape's white population. Other major white populations exist in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], [[Grahamstown]], [[Graaff-Reinet]], and a number of [[List of cities and towns in the Eastern Cape|smaller towns]]. The Eastern Cape houses the most equal mix of both English and Afrikaans speaking whites. The geographic background of the province shows a mix of English and Afrikaans place names, with no clear distinction between where Afrikaans or English speakers live.\n\n===Free State===\nThe Afrikaners far outnumber English-speaking white people in the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] (formerly called the ''Orange Free State''), because British immigration to the region was very limited. They are predominant in practically all cities, and in many farms. The Afrikaner population is largest around [[Bloemfontein]], which currently holds an estimated 100,000 white people (or a third of the total in the province). The white percentage has recently rebounded after prolonged decline.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 1880 the white percentage was 45.7% and 24 years later, this declined to 36.8% in 1904.<ref>{{cite EB1911|first=Alfred Peter |last=Hillier |first2=Frank Richardson |last2=Cana |wstitle=Orange Free State |display=Orange Free State \u00a7 Inhabitants |volume=20 |page=152}}</ref> Despite a long and steady decline all through the 20th century, the 2007 Community Survey showed the white percentage of the Free State increased from 8.8% to 9.6%. There could be issues with this figure as overall the population of some municipalities decreased in population by up to 50%, which meant that the \"missing\" black people counted resulted in an increased white percentage. Major white populations are also found in cities such as [[Welkom]], [[Kroonstad]] and [[Sasolburg]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===Gauteng===\n[[Gauteng]] has both the highest percentage (18.4%) and number (just under 2 million) of white people compared to any of the [[provinces of South Africa|other provinces]]. Afrikaner whites tend to be gathered in and around [[Pretoria]] (with around 450,000 Afrikaners), the [[East Rand|East]] and [[West Rand]], and in many other [[List of cities and towns in Gauteng|cities and towns in Gauteng]]. English-speaking white South Africans are mostly found in central Gauteng, namely [[Johannesburg]] and the [[East Rand]]. Also, the [[Midvaal Local Municipality]], located in Gauteng, contains one of the highest percentage of whites in the country, which in 2007 stood at 35%.\n\n===KwaZulu-Natal===\n[[KwaZulu-Natal]] is the only province where the vast majority of white people are English-speaking.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ac1qgEEtI0C&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=english+whites+in+natal&source=bl&ots=4-pF8o_QaX&sig=QG6xB4Ys2DBJQPKX5ykO37LjYR0&hl=en&ei=hwVcTZT5H6OAhAfFpe2HDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=english%20whites%20in%20natal&f=false The highest stage of white supremacy - Google Books]</ref> However, there do remain some towns in the north with large Afrikaner populations such as in the town of [[Vryheid]]. Before 1994 the province was just called Natal, and in the [[South African republic referendum, 1960|1960 republic referendum]], it was the only province to vote against severing links to the British Crown. KwaZulu-Natal, like most provinces, has experienced a both numerical and proportional decline in the white population. Over half of KwaZulu-Natal's white population lives in Durban and its surrounding suburbs.\n\n===Limpopo===\nThe [[Limpopo]] province has the smallest percentage of white people of any province in the country, which in 2007 stood at 2.2%. They are almost entirely Afrikaners. The white population is very unevenly spread. Some municipalities, especially in the more lightly populated west, have white percentages reaching far beyond 10% such as the [[Thabazimbi Local Municipality|Thabazimbi]] (23%), [[Bela-Bela Local Municipality|Bela-Bela]] (13%) and [[Mookgopong Local Municipality]] (21%). Conversely, in the much more densely populated East (where the former homelands of [[Gazankulu]], [[Lebowa]] and [[Venda]] lie), the white percentage drops significantly due to the high black population density. Some municipalities, including the [[Thulamela Local Municipality|Thumamela]] and [[Mutale Local Municipality]], have white populations of no more than 500, and therefore percentages reaching as low as 0.05%. The capital city, [[Polokwane]] (formerly Pietersburg), holds around 27,000 whites, making up just under a fourth of the province's white population. Other major white concentrations are in [[Tzaneen]], [[Phalaborwa]], [[Thabazimbi]], [[Louis Trichardt]] and practically every settlement along the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] national road.\n\n===Mpumalanga===\nIn 2007 roughly 6.7% of Mpumalanga was white. The majority of whites in Mpumalanga are Afrikaans speaking. Approximately 250,000 whites live in Mpumalanga, with major population centres being the capital, [[Nelspruit]] and other large cities such as [[Witbank]], [[Middelburg, Mpumalanga|Middelburg]], [[Ermelo, Mpumalanga|Ermelo]] and [[Lydenburg]].\n\n===Northwest Province===\nThe [[Northwest Province (South Africa)|Northwest Province]] has an almost identical situation to that of Mpumalanga. There is a very strong and patriotic Afrikaner community, and the province is also the birthplace of the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] (AWB), which was created in [[Ventersdorp, North West|Ventersdorp]]. There is an especially strong Afrikaner influence in the city of [[Potchefstroom]]. In 2007 there were 235,580 whites, making up roughly 7.2% (up from 6.7% in 2001) of the province's total population. The vast majority are Afrikaans speaking.\n\n===Northern Cape===\nThe [[Northern Cape]]'s small white population is also dominated by Afrikaners, with some English whites in cities such as [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]]. Although the white population only number no more than 100,000, because the province is very sparsely populated, it means the white population has remained very much above 10%, even since 1994.<ref>Despite the white population percentage decrease since 1994, the Northern Cape has retained a white percentage of 10%+</ref> Roughly 25% of whites live in the [[Sol Plaatje Local Municipality]], which contains the Diamond-mining city of Kimberley. Although only having about 12,000 white inhabitants, the [[Namakwa District Municipality]], in the very sparse western Northern Cape, they still manage to make up over 11% of the District Municipality's population. Afrikaans is the [[lingua franca]] in the Northern Cape, because the majority of the province (mostly Coloureds) speak it as a first language. Only in the north-eastern areas are there more blacks than Coloureds, and as well as far fewer white people. Besides Kimberley, other important white concentrations are found in [[Upington]], [[Britstown]], [[Springbok, Northern Cape|Springbok]], [[De Aar]], [[Jan Kempdorp]] and [[Barkly West]]. [[Orania, Northern Cape|Orania]], a purpose-built town for only-Afrikaans-speaking whites, is also located in the east of the Northern Cape, bordering the Free State. It houses just over 1400 inhabitants and is a special case as it is the only \"main-place\"<ref>In South African censuses, a \"main place\" is a locality representing a village, e.g. ''Centurion'', is a \"main-place\" within Tshwane municipality.</ref> where virtually all inhabitants are white.\n\n===Western Cape===\n[[File:Minister Alan Winde (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Alan Winde]], the Premier of the Western Cape, is an English White South African o]]\nThe [[Western Cape]] has the second-highest percentage of white people (18.4%) in South Africa, at 850 000 and the only one with a [[Alan Winde|White premier]] (governor). The lingua franca is Afrikaans, although some urban areas, especially Cape Town, have a large English speaking population.

He was a subscriber to the third charter of the [[Virginia Company]] who emigrated to the colony in 1618. After surviving the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], he moved to [[Jordan Point, Virginia|Jordan's Journey]]. In the following year, Farrar became involved in North America's first breach of promise suit when he proposed to [[Cecily Jordan Farrar|Cecily Jordan]].  In 1626, Farrar was appointed to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council of Virginia]] where he served as an advisor to the royal governor, a judge of the highest court in the colony, and a member of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] of [[Colonial Jamestown]]. He was also appointed magistrate of the upper James River community. In both these roles, he served as a voice of the early planters' interest as the colony transitioned from being managed by the Virginia Company and becoming a royal colony under [[Charles I of England]]. Farrar was also on the Council when it arrested Governor [[John Harvey (Virginia)|John Harvey]] for misgovernance and forced his temporary return to England. By the time of his death around 1637, Farrar had sold off his remaining assets in England and established rights to a 2000 acre patent on [[Farrar's Island]], located on a curl of the James River.\n\n[[File:Farrar Complete Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb|The [[Coat of arms|arms]] of William Farrar's father, John Farrar of Croxton and London, Esquire<ref name= Bannerman1899/>]]\n\n==Background==\nWilliam Farrar was born before April 28, 1583,<ref name=\"Dorman2004\" /> the date of his christening, in [[Croxton, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref name=CroxtonParish1583 /> He was the 3rd son of John Farrar of Croxton<ref name= \"Bannerman1899\" /> and London, [[Esquire]], a wealthy [[merchant]] and [[Land tenure|landowner]] with various holdings in [[West Yorkshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], and [[Hertfordshire]]<ref name =Farrer1936/>, and Cecily Kelke, an heiress <ref name=Richardson2011/> and direct descendant of [[Edward III of England]].<ref name=ElleMagazine2014/> The nineteenth century historian of Virginia, [[Alexander Brown (author)|Alexander Brown]], states that while in England, William Farrar received an education in law.<ref name=Brown1890v2 />\n\n== Relation to the Virginia Company and emigration to the New World ==\n[[File:Nova Britannia Cover.jpg|thumb|left|Facsimile cover of \"Nova Britannia\", a tract from Farrar's time used to recruit people to Virginia.]]\nWhen Farrar went to Virginia, it was still part of the [[Virginia Company of London]], a [[joint-stock company]], sanctioned by [[Royal charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]].<ref name=\"Wolfe2016\" /> Farrar was a subscriber to the Third Charter of the Virginia Company,<ref name= Kolp2014 /> where his name appears as \"William Ferrers\".<ref name= Bemiss1957 /> His subscription consisted of three shares that were bought for a total of \u00a337 10s (equivalent to about ${{formatnum:{{ To USD round|{{inflation|UK|37.5|1600}}|GBR|sf=3}}}} today).{{Notetag|For another comparison of the share's value, the entire annual wages of a skilled [[journeyman]] in London around 1588 was authorized to be between \u00a34 and \u00a310. {{refn|name=Aughterson1998}} }}<ref name=Brown1890v2 /> Farrar also had family interests in the Virginia Company as two of his second cousins,<ref name=Torrence1942 /> the brothers [[John Ferrar]] and [[Nicholas Ferrar]], played key roles in the managing the company's interests.<ref name=Kingsbury1906v1/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/recordsofvirgini01virg_0/page/n121/mode/2up 60}} }}\n\nFarrar left London on ''Neptune''<ref name= Hotten1874/> on March 16, 1617/18  {{notetag|[[Dual dating]] is given because the [[Old Style and New Style dates#Start of the year in the historical records of Britain and its colonies and possessions|English new year did not begin until March 25]] during Farrar's lifetime.}}<ref name=\"Kolb1980\" /> along with Virginia's governor, [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Thomas West, Baron De La Warr]].

In 1626, Farrar was appointed to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council of Virginia]] where he served as an advisor to the royal governor, a judge of the highest court in the colony, and a member of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] of [[Colonial Jamestown]]. He was also appointed magistrate of the upper James River community. In both these roles, he served as a voice of the early planters' interest as the colony transitioned from being managed by the Virginia Company and becoming a royal colony under [[Charles I of England]]. Farrar was also on the Council when it arrested Governor [[John Harvey (Virginia)|John Harvey]] for misgovernance and forced his temporary return to England.

The possibility of high returns incentivizes unestablished actors to accept minimal [[wage]]s in exchange for roles. With the exception of a few extremely talented actors, producers are unable to evaluate the [[aptitude]] of the vast majority of qualified actors due to [[uncertainty]]. As a result, some actors give sexual favors to producers to obtain a perceived advantage in the [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]]; the casting couch functions as a counterpayment that effectively reduces their wages. This creates a [[conflict of interest]] in which corrupt producers substitute aptitude (an unquantifiable variable) with sexual activity in their decision-making.<ref name=\"Borcherding\" />\n\nActors who submit to the casting couch are not guaranteed roles, as there is an abundance of actors who partake in the practice. An actor's decision of whether to provide sex is comparable to the [[prisoner's dilemma]], and results in a [[tragedy of the commons]] in which sex is needed to obtain film roles from producers who demand it, but fails to provide an advantage relative to other actors who offer sexual favors. If the provision of sex were voluntary and performed with the [[Sexual consent|consent]] of all parties, the casting couch would be a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' exchange and a [[victimless crime]]. However, the practice is illegal in the United States and likely involves some degree of [[sexual exploitation]] or [[sexual harassment]]. Actors who do not participate in the casting couch are subject to [[externalities]], including reduced [[employability]].<ref name=\"Borcherding\" />\n\nBorcherding and Filson argue that the casting couch became less prominent after the [[Hollywood studio system]], which enforced long-term [[employment contract]]s for actors, was eliminated on [[antitrust]] grounds in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' (1948). Long-term contracts gave producers stronger [[bargaining power]], which was used by corrupt producers to extract sex from actors more effectively.<ref name=\"Borcherding\" />\n\n== Pornography ==\n[[File:The Casting Couch.jpg|thumb|An actress and a casting director in ''The Casting Couch'' ({{circa}} 1924)]]\n''The Casting Couch'' ({{circa}} 1924), a classic title in the [[stag film]] genre,<ref name=\"Williams\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Linda |author-link=Linda Williams (film scholar) |title=Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the \"Frenzy of the Visible\", Expanded Edition |date=1999 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=9780520219434 |pages=68\u201369 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wAe48_yfNUC |accessdate=17 November 2019 |language=en |chapter=The Stag Film}}</ref> was an early depiction of the casting couch as a [[pornographic]] [[Trope (cinema)|trope]] that later became mundane as it grew in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Mark|last1=Hay|accessdate=17 November 2019|title=Porn from the 1920s Was More Wild and Hardcore Than You Could Imagine|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59k785/porn-from-the-1920s-was-more-wild-and-hardcore-than-you-could-imagine|date=5 April 2018|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]}}</ref> In the ten-minute film, a [[casting director]] tells a young actress to wear a [[swimsuit]] during an [[audition]], spies on her in a [[voyeuristic]] manner while she undresses in a different room, and enters the room to solicit sex from her. The actress initially rebuffs his advances with disgust, but returns to the director after taking advice from a book named ''How to Become a Movie Star''. She performs [[fellatio]] and [[vaginal intercourse]] in exchange for a role in his film; the latter takes place on a couch.

The possibility of high returns incentivizes unestablished actors to accept minimal [[wage]]s in exchange for roles. With the exception of a few extremely talented actors, producers are unable to evaluate the [[aptitude]] of the vast majority of qualified actors due to [[uncertainty]]. As a result, some actors give sexual favors to producers to obtain a perceived advantage in the [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]]; the casting couch functions as a counterpayment that effectively reduces their wages. This creates a [[conflict of interest]] in which corrupt producers substitute aptitude (an unquantifiable variable) with sexual activity in their decision-making.<ref name=\"Borcherding\" />\n\nActors who submit to the casting couch are not guaranteed roles, as there is an abundance of actors who partake in the practice. An actor's decision of whether to provide sex is comparable to the [[prisoner's dilemma]], and results in a [[tragedy of the commons]] in which sex is needed to obtain film roles from producers who demand it, but fails to provide an advantage relative to other actors who offer sexual favors. If the provision of sex were voluntary and performed with the [[Sexual consent|consent]] of all parties, the casting couch would be a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' exchange and a [[victimless crime]]. However, the practice is illegal in the United States and likely involves some degree of [[sexual exploitation]] or [[sexual harassment]]. Actors who do not participate in the casting couch are subject to [[externalities]], including reduced [[employability]].<ref name=\"Borcherding\" />\n\nBorcherding and Filson argue that the casting couch became less prominent after the [[Hollywood studio system]], which enforced long-term [[employment contract]]s for actors, was eliminated on [[antitrust]] grounds in ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' (1948). Long-term contracts gave producers stronger [[bargaining power]], which was used by corrupt producers to extract sex from actors more effectively.<ref name=\"Borcherding\" />\n\n== Pornography ==\n[[File:The Casting Couch.jpg|thumb|An actress and a casting director in ''The Casting Couch'' ({{circa}} 1924)]]\n''The Casting Couch'' ({{circa}} 1924), a classic title in the [[stag film]] genre,<ref name=\"Williams\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Linda |author-link=Linda Williams (film scholar) |title=Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the \"Frenzy of the Visible\", Expanded Edition |date=1999 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=9780520219434 |pages=68\u201369 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3wAe48_yfNUC |accessdate=17 November 2019 |language=en |chapter=The Stag Film}}</ref> was an early depiction of the casting couch as a [[pornographic]] [[Trope (cinema)|trope]] that later became mundane as it grew in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Mark|last1=Hay|accessdate=17 November 2019|title=Porn from the 1920s Was More Wild and Hardcore Than You Could Imagine|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59k785/porn-from-the-1920s-was-more-wild-and-hardcore-than-you-could-imagine|date=5 April 2018|website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]}}</ref> In the ten-minute film, a [[casting director]] tells a young actress to wear a [[swimsuit]] during an [[audition]], spies on her in a [[voyeuristic]] manner while she undresses in a different room, and enters the room to solicit sex from her.

In 2026, a civil war erupts on Altis following a [[coup d'etat]] by the Altis Armed Forces (AAF). In 2030, a ceasefire is declared. A loyalist rebel group, the Freedom and Independence Army (FIA), rejects the new military government and wages a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against the AAF. NATO [[peacekeeping]] forces are deployed to Altis, establishing a US-led joint NATO-AAF peacekeeping force, Task Force Aegis (TF Aegis). Five years later, NATO investment in the Aegean dwindles, and CSAT begins to subsidize the AAF and mobilizes its own forces in the Pacific. With the peacekeeping mandate nearing its end, NATO begins to withdraw from Altis, and tensions rise between AAF and NATO.<ref>https://arma3.com/features/campaign</ref><ref>https://arma3.com/features/factions</ref>\n\nThe DLC campaign, ''Apex Protocol'', added in the ''ARMA 3: Apex'' expansion, is set on the Northern Division of a South Pacific island group nation known as the Horizon Islands Federation. The division is commonly known as Tanoa, the largest island in the division. The campaign takes place after the events of the base game campaign, following the regroup with NATO ending.\n\n''Remnants of War'' is a story-driven DLC campaign added in the ''Laws of War'' DLC. The story focuses on Nathan MacDade, an [[Bomb disposal|EOD]] technician working for the International Development and Aid Project (IDAP for short), a humanitarian [[NGO]]. Other scenarios are explored as Nathan reminisces about past events. Some actions the player can take have moral consequences, which are reflected in the ending.\n\nThe main player character of the singleplayer campaign features [[Corporal]] Ben Kerry, a [[United States Army|US Army]] soldier assigned to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] deployed on Stratis. Players also play as [[Sergeant]] Conway during the prologue. Other major NATO characters include [[Staff Sergeant]] Adams, General Armstrong, as well as Combat Technology Research Group (a NATO spec ops group, CTRG for short) personnel Captain Scott Miller, and Miller's second in command Lieutenant James. Major FIA characters include Kostas Stavrou, leader of northern FIA forces, and Nikos Panagopoulos, an FIA head. Players play as CTRG Group 15 operators in ''Apex Protocol''.\n\n===''The East Wind''===\nIn 2034, a firing incident between the AAF and FIA leads to the breakdown of their ceasefire, and eventually escalates into open warfare. NATO-AAF relations deteriorate, and NATO peacekeepers are reduced to the smaller island of Stratis. By 2035, NATO prepares to fully withdraw from Stratis. On July 7, 2035, the AAF suddenly attacks the remaining NATO forces on Stratis, destroying their bases and killing their commander.{{#tag:ref|The exact cause of AAF attacking NATO is unclear, though it is implied to be a reaction to a NATO black operation.|group=N}} Corporal Ben Kerry and Staff Sergeant Adams attempt to regroup with NATO survivors, but Adams is killed by a [[landmine]]. Kerry and other NATO survivors eventually regroup under a group of [[United Kingdom Special Forces|British special forces]] led by Captain Scott Miller.\n\nMiller organizes a number of ineffective [[guerrilla]] missions against the AAF, while his own squad conducts clandestine operations independently. Over the course of a few days, under group Alpha, Kerry helps destroy a helicopter to hide the position of the NATO survivors, breaks an AAF siege around a small village, assassinates a high ranking AAF commander, and helps attack Mike Air Station-26 to try and contact NATO MEDCOM (which fails). After making contact with an FIA operative by the name of Nikos Panagopolous, Kerry's group follows them to a cache, only to have it destroyed by AAF forces, with Nikos seemingly escaping. With the cache lost, Miller orders an attack on AAF positions in the south, but after overunning a village, mortar fire hits Camp Maxwell where the NATO survivors are hiding. Despite Miller's orders, Kerry's team returns to camp to find it in ruins, with NATO survivors tending to the wounded. The next day, Miller manages to contact NATO command and arranges for a re-invasion of Stratis. To assist with the invasion, Miller leads the survivors to take control of a town on Stratis, called Agia Marina. However, CSAT reinforcements foil the operation, and Miller orders the survivors to head to Altis on two boats he prepared in a small cove. Miller states that the survivors will link up with the FIA upon arriving at Altis, but AAF [[Attack aircraft|attack jets]] attack and destroy the boats before they arrive at Altis.\n\nKerry wakes up on Altis and manages to reunite with Lieutenant James, Miller's second in command, who laid in on a mountain after an FIA attack on Kavala (the former capital of Altis) failed miserably. Kerry is taken to the FIA and given charge of an FIA squad to ambush a convoy. During this part, Kerry can accidentally destroy the ammo truck, though it does not effect the outcome of the mission as CSAT carries out a massive counterattack and nearly exterminates the FIA, forcing them to move to a different camp near Gori. More missions pass as Kerry helps take down an outpost and capture a fuel truck (he can either use the fuel truck to blow up a ranking commander from CSAT and lower CSAT's reserves in later missions, or bring the fuel back and get a head start on other missions). In the next mission, Kerry helps an officer named Orestes defect, and uses him to either take down a helicopter or raid a CSAT fuel dump. Eventually, the FIA learns that their main smuggler and figurehead, Nikos Panagopolous, has been spotted on the island of Stratis, and CTRG arranges a rescue operation to retrieve him. The operation is successful, and the FIA begins to become more emboldened in their strategy. Later on, the FIA learns that NATO main forces will be invading Altis, and plans their own operation to assist. During the operation, Kerry witnesses NATO [[gunship]]s firing on FIA forces. Kerry manages to call off the attack through a downed NATO pilot. The next day, NATO commander Colonel Armstrong meets with Kerry and tells him that they were unaware of the FIA's activities around the AAC airfield. When Kerry asks about Miller, Armstrong responds that he has no knowledge of Scott Miller, and that British forces left Stratis many months ago. Mentioning Miller drives Armstrong to believe Kerry may be hostile, on top of the fact that he is the only survivor from Task Force Aegis on Stratis.\n\nArmstrong, under the callsign \"Crossroads\", orders Kerry to lead an FIA squad and assist in NATO operations. NATO manages to repel AAF and CSAT forces and secure most of Altis. Crossroads confirms that Miller is not hostile, but he warns Kerry to avoid him and his team. During this time, tectonic activity on Altis increases sharply.\n\nWith the AAF on the verge of defeat, Crossroads orders all NATO forces to regroup for one final offensive, Kerry is suddenly contacted by a dying Lt. James who provides his location to find him. Kerry can either regroup with NATO or disobey orders and find James.\n\nIf Kerry regroups with NATO, Kerry is ordered to lead a reconnaissance squad to mark out enemy positions and spearhead the offensive. The AAF surrenders shortly after the offensive begins. An epilogue set six weeks later shows peace returning to Altis, while Kerry, now Sergeant, works with the continued NATO presence to maintain peace.\n\nIf Kerry looks for James, Kerry finds him at the site of a failed assault on a secret CSAT facility. James orders Kerry to find a truck loaded with a special device and take it to Miller, before dying. Kerry finds the truck in the facility and brings it to Miller. Kerry confronts Miller about his manipulations and the nature of the device, but Miller only hints that the device is responsible for the recent tremors. As they talk, CSAT suddenly launches a massive invasion against both NATO and the AAF, forcing NATO into withdrawal. Miller initially promises to return for Kerry after he takes the device off the island, but breaks the promise after he leaves, leaving Kerry alone to find a way off the island.\n\n===''Apex Protocol''===\n\nFollowing a major tsunami known as the Pacific disaster, the paramilitary crime syndicate, the Syndikat, rose to power in several regions on Tanoa. Finding the Syndikat's rapid expansion suspicious, NATO sends in CTRG Group 15 to investigate.\n\nCTRG Group 15, under callsign \"Raider\", deploys on Tanoa and conducts several operations against the Syndikat, destroying a Syndikat ammo depot and ambushing a Syndikat convoy. They discover evidence of CSAT support of the Syndikat. During an operation to capture the Syndikat's leader, Solomon Maru, Raider instead finds that they've been led into an ambush by the Chinese CSAT special forces Viper Team. Raider manages to escape from the ambush.\n\nFollowing the ambush, Raider conducts an operation to rescue CTRG asset \"Keystone\". Keystone turns out to be Captain Scott Miller, leader of CTRG Group 14, who had been tracking the special CSAT device since it left Altis, which is a [[tectonic weapon]] codenamed \"Eastwind\". Miller believes that Viper deployed Eastwind on Tanoa, causing the Pacific disaster, and supported the Syndikat, all to destabilize Tanoa.\n\nAfter rescuing Miller, CTRG raids a Viper black site on Tanoa to retrieve Eastwind. They find the black site already attacked and abandoned; Syndikat double-crossed CSAT before CTRG arrived, holding Eastwind ransom to blackmail against CSAT. CTRG did however recover files about CSAT's \"Apex Protocol,\" which involves using operatives to destabilize strategically important nations so CSAT can provide assistance and foster CSAT support.\n\nCTRG tracks Eastwind to a large port, where CSAT attempts to deal with Syndikat to recover Eastwind, while Maru arms Eastwind. CTRG quickly attacks, fighting against both Syndikat and Viper, and manages to kill Maru, disarm Eastwind, and secure the device. Following the operation, CSAT's Apex Protocol is exposed to the whole world, leading to international condemnation, while Eastwind is now in NATO's possession.\n\n===''Remnants of War''===\n\nDays after the end of the NATO invasion of Altis, a civilian mechanic from the Altis town of Oreokastro returns to the town, after hearing news that his missing brother had appeared at the town's church in a recent firefight. As he searches the church, he is killed by a landmine.\n\nSeveral days later, journalist Katherine Bishop conducts an online interview with Nathan MacDade as he works on the disposal of [[explosive remnants of war]] at Oreokastro. Oreokastro, formerly a major FIA garrison and the site of an IDAP camp, was completely destroyed during the war and is now a [[ghost town]]. Nathan reminisces about Oreokastro's past as he conducts his work, and tells five stories surrounding Oreokastro during the war.\n\n* In the first story, after the breakdown of the FIA-AAF ceasefire, NATO peacekeeper Staff Sergeant Adams led a TF Aegis squad to secure a NATO [[airdrop]] intended for the Oreokastro IDAP camp, and repelled an attack from FIA bandits.\n* In the second story, a FIA fighter from Oreokastro, Alexis Kouris, sets up defenses around Oreokastro after the AAF announced their plans to assault the town.\n* In the third story, Nathan recounts a rumor that a squad of supposed CSAT special forces parachuted in near Oreokastro and [[Laser designator|designated]] FIA positions in the town for an AAF [[cluster bomb]] air strike, destroying much of the town. Nathan notes that NATO casings were discovered on site, and it is implied that the special forces may have been Miller's CTRG team instead.\n* In the fourth story, Markos Kouris, Alexis' brother and a [[non-combatant]] at Oreokastro, was heavily injured by the AAF air strike. As the AAF assaults the town, Markos limps his way to the IDAP camp at the town church, and was eventually evacuated. The town is abandoned after the assault.\n* In the final story, set during the NATO invasion of Altis, AAF officers Lieutenant Antoniou Dimitriou and Major Gavras were overwhelmed by NATO-FIA forces and were pushed back to Oreokastro. The two defend themselves at the town's church, and deploy landmines for self defense. They withstand the attack and extract. Alexis is one of the casualties in the assault, leading Markos to search the church after the war, resulting in him being killed by leftover landmines.\n\nBack at present, Katherine asks Nathan about who he thinks is most responsible for the destruction of Oreokastro: NATO, CSAT, AAF, FIA, or nobody. After Nathan responds, Katherine shows Nathan a draft of her report on the impacts the war had left on the life on Altis, the contents reflecting on the player's actions throughout the campaign. As Nathan completes the EOD operation, he bides Katherine farewell as he and his team pack up and leave Oreokastro, proceeding to their next cleanup site.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:James Crowe Bohemia Interactive.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Jay Crowe was the game's creative director and provided some voice acting for the game.]]\nBohemia Interactive officially announced the development of ''ARMA 3'' on May 19, 2011.<ref name=\"arma3anounced\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/oznameni/bohemia-interactive-oznamuje-arma-3-55791|title=ARMA 3 announced|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In June 2012 an [[Alpha release|alpha version]] of the game was demonstrated at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]].<ref name=\"alpha-e3\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tv/arma-3-e3-2012-rozhovor-6419|title=Arma 3 shown during E3 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In August 2013, Bohemia Interactive announced that they will release three [[downloadable content]] episodes for free after the game's initial launch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arma3.com/news/arma-3-campaign-deployed-across-3-free-dlc-episodes|title=Free DLC|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> An alpha version of the game was released on March 5, 2013, allowing players to experience the game during development, as well as assist in development by reporting bugs and giving feedback on their experience.

In 2026, a civil war erupts on Altis following a [[coup d'etat]] by the Altis Armed Forces (AAF). In 2030, a ceasefire is declared. A loyalist rebel group, the Freedom and Independence Army (FIA), rejects the new military government and wages a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against the AAF. NATO [[peacekeeping]] forces are deployed to Altis, establishing a US-led joint NATO-AAF peacekeeping force, Task Force Aegis (TF Aegis). Five years later, NATO investment in the Aegean dwindles, and CSAT begins to subsidize the AAF and mobilizes its own forces in the Pacific. With the peacekeeping mandate nearing its end, NATO begins to withdraw from Altis, and tensions rise between AAF and NATO.<ref>https://arma3.com/features/campaign</ref><ref>https://arma3.com/features/factions</ref>\n\nThe DLC campaign, ''Apex Protocol'', added in the ''ARMA 3: Apex'' expansion, is set on the Northern Division of a South Pacific island group nation known as the Horizon Islands Federation. The division is commonly known as Tanoa, the largest island in the division. The campaign takes place after the events of the base game campaign, following the regroup with NATO ending.\n\n''Remnants of War'' is a story-driven DLC campaign added in the ''Laws of War'' DLC. The story focuses on Nathan MacDade, an [[Bomb disposal|EOD]] technician working for the International Development and Aid Project (IDAP for short), a humanitarian [[NGO]]. Other scenarios are explored as Nathan reminisces about past events. Some actions the player can take have moral consequences, which are reflected in the ending.\n\nThe main player character of the singleplayer campaign features [[Corporal]] Ben Kerry, a [[United States Army|US Army]] soldier assigned to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] deployed on Stratis. Players also play as [[Sergeant]] Conway during the prologue. Other major NATO characters include [[Staff Sergeant]] Adams, General Armstrong, as well as Combat Technology Research Group (a NATO spec ops group, CTRG for short) personnel Captain Scott Miller, and Miller's second in command Lieutenant James. Major FIA characters include Kostas Stavrou, leader of northern FIA forces, and Nikos Panagopoulos, an FIA head. Players play as CTRG Group 15 operators in ''Apex Protocol''.\n\n===''The East Wind''===\nIn 2034, a firing incident between the AAF and FIA leads to the breakdown of their ceasefire, and eventually escalates into open warfare. NATO-AAF relations deteriorate, and NATO peacekeepers are reduced to the smaller island of Stratis. By 2035, NATO prepares to fully withdraw from Stratis. On July 7, 2035, the AAF suddenly attacks the remaining NATO forces on Stratis, destroying their bases and killing their commander.{{#tag:ref|The exact cause of AAF attacking NATO is unclear, though it is implied to be a reaction to a NATO black operation.|group=N}} Corporal Ben Kerry and Staff Sergeant Adams attempt to regroup with NATO survivors, but Adams is killed by a [[landmine]]. Kerry and other NATO survivors eventually regroup under a group of [[United Kingdom Special Forces|British special forces]] led by Captain Scott Miller.\n\nMiller organizes a number of ineffective [[guerrilla]] missions against the AAF, while his own squad conducts clandestine operations independently. Over the course of a few days, under group Alpha, Kerry helps destroy a helicopter to hide the position of the NATO survivors, breaks an AAF siege around a small village, assassinates a high ranking AAF commander, and helps attack Mike Air Station-26 to try and contact NATO MEDCOM (which fails). After making contact with an FIA operative by the name of Nikos Panagopolous, Kerry's group follows them to a cache, only to have it destroyed by AAF forces, with Nikos seemingly escaping. With the cache lost, Miller orders an attack on AAF positions in the south, but after overunning a village, mortar fire hits Camp Maxwell where the NATO survivors are hiding. Despite Miller's orders, Kerry's team returns to camp to find it in ruins, with NATO survivors tending to the wounded. The next day, Miller manages to contact NATO command and arranges for a re-invasion of Stratis. To assist with the invasion, Miller leads the survivors to take control of a town on Stratis, called Agia Marina. However, CSAT reinforcements foil the operation, and Miller orders the survivors to head to Altis on two boats he prepared in a small cove. Miller states that the survivors will link up with the FIA upon arriving at Altis, but AAF [[Attack aircraft|attack jets]] attack and destroy the boats before they arrive at Altis.\n\nKerry wakes up on Altis and manages to reunite with Lieutenant James, Miller's second in command, who laid in on a mountain after an FIA attack on Kavala (the former capital of Altis) failed miserably. Kerry is taken to the FIA and given charge of an FIA squad to ambush a convoy. During this part, Kerry can accidentally destroy the ammo truck, though it does not effect the outcome of the mission as CSAT carries out a massive counterattack and nearly exterminates the FIA, forcing them to move to a different camp near Gori. More missions pass as Kerry helps take down an outpost and capture a fuel truck (he can either use the fuel truck to blow up a ranking commander from CSAT and lower CSAT's reserves in later missions, or bring the fuel back and get a head start on other missions). In the next mission, Kerry helps an officer named Orestes defect, and uses him to either take down a helicopter or raid a CSAT fuel dump. Eventually, the FIA learns that their main smuggler and figurehead, Nikos Panagopolous, has been spotted on the island of Stratis, and CTRG arranges a rescue operation to retrieve him. The operation is successful, and the FIA begins to become more emboldened in their strategy. Later on, the FIA learns that NATO main forces will be invading Altis, and plans their own operation to assist. During the operation, Kerry witnesses NATO [[gunship]]s firing on FIA forces. Kerry manages to call off the attack through a downed NATO pilot. The next day, NATO commander Colonel Armstrong meets with Kerry and tells him that they were unaware of the FIA's activities around the AAC airfield. When Kerry asks about Miller, Armstrong responds that he has no knowledge of Scott Miller, and that British forces left Stratis many months ago. Mentioning Miller drives Armstrong to believe Kerry may be hostile, on top of the fact that he is the only survivor from Task Force Aegis on Stratis.\n\nArmstrong, under the callsign \"Crossroads\", orders Kerry to lead an FIA squad and assist in NATO operations. NATO manages to repel AAF and CSAT forces and secure most of Altis. Crossroads confirms that Miller is not hostile, but he warns Kerry to avoid him and his team. During this time, tectonic activity on Altis increases sharply.\n\nWith the AAF on the verge of defeat, Crossroads orders all NATO forces to regroup for one final offensive, Kerry is suddenly contacted by a dying Lt. James who provides his location to find him. Kerry can either regroup with NATO or disobey orders and find James.\n\nIf Kerry regroups with NATO, Kerry is ordered to lead a reconnaissance squad to mark out enemy positions and spearhead the offensive. The AAF surrenders shortly after the offensive begins. An epilogue set six weeks later shows peace returning to Altis, while Kerry, now Sergeant, works with the continued NATO presence to maintain peace.\n\nIf Kerry looks for James, Kerry finds him at the site of a failed assault on a secret CSAT facility. James orders Kerry to find a truck loaded with a special device and take it to Miller, before dying. Kerry finds the truck in the facility and brings it to Miller. Kerry confronts Miller about his manipulations and the nature of the device, but Miller only hints that the device is responsible for the recent tremors. As they talk, CSAT suddenly launches a massive invasion against both NATO and the AAF, forcing NATO into withdrawal. Miller initially promises to return for Kerry after he takes the device off the island, but breaks the promise after he leaves, leaving Kerry alone to find a way off the island.\n\n===''Apex Protocol''===\n\nFollowing a major tsunami known as the Pacific disaster, the paramilitary crime syndicate, the Syndikat, rose to power in several regions on Tanoa. Finding the Syndikat's rapid expansion suspicious, NATO sends in CTRG Group 15 to investigate.\n\nCTRG Group 15, under callsign \"Raider\", deploys on Tanoa and conducts several operations against the Syndikat, destroying a Syndikat ammo depot and ambushing a Syndikat convoy. They discover evidence of CSAT support of the Syndikat. During an operation to capture the Syndikat's leader, Solomon Maru, Raider instead finds that they've been led into an ambush by the Chinese CSAT special forces Viper Team. Raider manages to escape from the ambush.\n\nFollowing the ambush, Raider conducts an operation to rescue CTRG asset \"Keystone\". Keystone turns out to be Captain Scott Miller, leader of CTRG Group 14, who had been tracking the special CSAT device since it left Altis, which is a [[tectonic weapon]] codenamed \"Eastwind\". Miller believes that Viper deployed Eastwind on Tanoa, causing the Pacific disaster, and supported the Syndikat, all to destabilize Tanoa.\n\nAfter rescuing Miller, CTRG raids a Viper black site on Tanoa to retrieve Eastwind. They find the black site already attacked and abandoned; Syndikat double-crossed CSAT before CTRG arrived, holding Eastwind ransom to blackmail against CSAT. CTRG did however recover files about CSAT's \"Apex Protocol,\" which involves using operatives to destabilize strategically important nations so CSAT can provide assistance and foster CSAT support.\n\nCTRG tracks Eastwind to a large port, where CSAT attempts to deal with Syndikat to recover Eastwind, while Maru arms Eastwind. CTRG quickly attacks, fighting against both Syndikat and Viper, and manages to kill Maru, disarm Eastwind, and secure the device. Following the operation, CSAT's Apex Protocol is exposed to the whole world, leading to international condemnation, while Eastwind is now in NATO's possession.\n\n===''Remnants of War''===\n\nDays after the end of the NATO invasion of Altis, a civilian mechanic from the Altis town of Oreokastro returns to the town, after hearing news that his missing brother had appeared at the town's church in a recent firefight. As he searches the church, he is killed by a landmine.\n\nSeveral days later, journalist Katherine Bishop conducts an online interview with Nathan MacDade as he works on the disposal of [[explosive remnants of war]] at Oreokastro. Oreokastro, formerly a major FIA garrison and the site of an IDAP camp, was completely destroyed during the war and is now a [[ghost town]]. Nathan reminisces about Oreokastro's past as he conducts his work, and tells five stories surrounding Oreokastro during the war.\n\n* In the first story, after the breakdown of the FIA-AAF ceasefire, NATO peacekeeper Staff Sergeant Adams led a TF Aegis squad to secure a NATO [[airdrop]] intended for the Oreokastro IDAP camp, and repelled an attack from FIA bandits.\n* In the second story, a FIA fighter from Oreokastro, Alexis Kouris, sets up defenses around Oreokastro after the AAF announced their plans to assault the town.\n* In the third story, Nathan recounts a rumor that a squad of supposed CSAT special forces parachuted in near Oreokastro and [[Laser designator|designated]] FIA positions in the town for an AAF [[cluster bomb]] air strike, destroying much of the town. Nathan notes that NATO casings were discovered on site, and it is implied that the special forces may have been Miller's CTRG team instead.\n* In the fourth story, Markos Kouris, Alexis' brother and a [[non-combatant]] at Oreokastro, was heavily injured by the AAF air strike. As the AAF assaults the town, Markos limps his way to the IDAP camp at the town church, and was eventually evacuated. The town is abandoned after the assault.\n* In the final story, set during the NATO invasion of Altis, AAF officers Lieutenant Antoniou Dimitriou and Major Gavras were overwhelmed by NATO-FIA forces and were pushed back to Oreokastro. The two defend themselves at the town's church, and deploy landmines for self defense. They withstand the attack and extract. Alexis is one of the casualties in the assault, leading Markos to search the church after the war, resulting in him being killed by leftover landmines.\n\nBack at present, Katherine asks Nathan about who he thinks is most responsible for the destruction of Oreokastro: NATO, CSAT, AAF, FIA, or nobody. After Nathan responds, Katherine shows Nathan a draft of her report on the impacts the war had left on the life on Altis, the contents reflecting on the player's actions throughout the campaign. As Nathan completes the EOD operation, he bides Katherine farewell as he and his team pack up and leave Oreokastro, proceeding to their next cleanup site.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:James Crowe Bohemia Interactive.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Jay Crowe was the game's creative director and provided some voice acting for the game.]]\nBohemia Interactive officially announced the development of ''ARMA 3'' on May 19, 2011.<ref name=\"arma3anounced\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/oznameni/bohemia-interactive-oznamuje-arma-3-55791|title=ARMA 3 announced|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In June 2012 an [[Alpha release|alpha version]] of the game was demonstrated at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]].<ref name=\"alpha-e3\">{{cite web |url=http://games.tiscali.cz/tv/arma-3-e3-2012-rozhovor-6419|title=Arma 3 shown during E3 2012|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> In August 2013, Bohemia Interactive announced that they will release three [[downloadable content]] episodes for free after the game's initial launch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arma3.com/news/arma-3-campaign-deployed-across-3-free-dlc-episodes|title=Free DLC|date=August 6, 2013|accessdate=August 10, 2013}}</ref> An alpha version of the game was released on March 5, 2013, allowing players to experience the game during development, as well as assist in development by reporting bugs and giving feedback on their experience.

The municipality is limited to the north by the municipality of [[Santo Tirso]], to the northeast by [[Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira]], to the east by [[Paredes, Portugal|Paredes]], to the southwest by [[Gondomar, Portugal|Gondomar]] and to the west by [[Maia, Portugal|Maia]]. It consists of the cities of [[Alfena]], [[Ermesinde]], Valongo (city) and the towns of Campo and Sobrado.\n\n== History ==\nThe Municipality of Valongo was created in 1836 as a part of the administrative reform of the country, which occurred during in the reign of [[Maria II of Portugal|D. Maria II]]. However, human occupation of this region predates the [[Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula|Roman conquest of the Iberian-Peninsula]].\n\n===Ancient history===\nThis region was occupied by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], especially for gold mining in the Serra de Santa Justa. One of the traces of Roman occupation is in the municipality name, which originated in the Latin words ''Vallis Longus''. There are still traces that would allow the detection of two main Roman connecting roads that would cross the municipality: the [[Porto]] - [[Guimar\u00e3es]] road and the [[Alfena]] - Valongo - Aguiar de Sousa / [[Penafiel]] road .\n\nThis region would then be occupied by barbarian peoples ([[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]]) and later by [[Arabs]] and [[Moors]].\n\nAccording to Father Lopes dos Reis, a native of Valongo, \u201cthe Moors entered Hespanha enthusiastic about the holy war with the alfange in one hand and Alkor\u00e3o in the other, taking over with their powerful army all the places they could pass through. In Vallongo, perhaps there was no blood at all, because the inhabitants, few and without defense, could only fearlessly try to prevent the passage to a powerful enemy from whom they had known that an army of brave people had fled in terror. That is why, when the Arabs arrived in Vallongo (716), they left their people in peace without writing it, and by means of a certain tribute they gave them the freedom to live as they did here, going to settle far from the Goda settlement, which occupied the Sus\u00e3o and the western part of the villa, on the plain at the edge of a stream that was later called Ilhar Mourisco.\u201d <ref>{{Cite book|last=Ferreira|first=Nuno|title=Igreja Matriz de Sobrado- O Segredo da Mem\u00f3ria, Edi\u00e7\u00e3o de Autor|publisher=Valongo|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the ''[[Reconquista|reconquest]]'' of ''Portus Cale'' ([[Porto]]) by [[V\u00edmara Peres]] in 868, he was named a count and given control of the [[March (territory)|frontier region]] between the [[Limia River|Limia]] and [[Douro]] rivers by [[Alfonso III of Asturias]], therefore bringing the region under control of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. \n\n===Middle ages===\nFrom the General Inquiries of 1258, the current municipality was divided at the time between the parish of [[Aguiar de Sousa]] - which included S. Martinho de Campo and Sobrado, and the ''parish'' of [[Maia, Portugal|Maia]], which included S.Vicente da Queimadela, Valongo and S. Louren\u00e7o de Asmes .\n\nFrom the economic and social point of view, at this time, the ownership of land was the basis of the economy and the main element of survival and power. In the area of \u200b\u200bthe municipality, land belonged to the [[King]] and the [[Clergy]] - particularly the [[Regular clergy|Regular Clergy.]]\n\nThe appearance of new settlements, the progressive extension of the term of existing settlements, the multiplication of suffragan chapels and the division of property, is evidence of the notorious demographic growth of this region over the centuries. This increase in population was accompanied by the progressive development of other sectors of the economy. Industry and commerce, initially based on incipient forms, acquire a strong expression in the economy. The traditional bakery industry is an excellent example of this: its origins date back to the Low Middle Ages, but the development of wheat bread is such a development, which allowed Valongo bakers to feed the entire surrounding region and with the product of their work. This in turn, allow them to make a decisive contribution. for the construction of the new church, the Igreja Matriz de Valongo, whose construction dates to the end of the 18th century.\n\n===19th century===\nAt the dawn of the 19th century, Valongo experiences the [[Napoleon|hardship of the presence of Napoleon's troops]], during the French Invasions. A division settled in Valongo, turning the church into a stable and plundering values \u200b\u200bfrom individuals and the church.\n\nThese lands therefore served as a stage for battles and military movements that took place between the two straying brothers: D. Pedro, on the side of the Liberals, D. Miguel, on the part of the Miguelists/Absolutists. During this period two important battles take place: the Battle of Ponte Ferreira and the Battle of the Ant. In Ermesinde, the former Convent of N\u00aa. Mr. do Bom Despacho (now, the Church of St. Rita), became a military hospital for Miguelists forces.\n\nBy decree published on November 29, 1836, D. Maria II creates the Municipality of Valongo with the parishes of Sobrado, Campo and Gandra (which belonged to the Municipality of Baltar) and Alfena, Ermesinde and Valongo (which belonged to the Municipality of Maia) .\n\nOn May 18, 1852, there was a lunch at Travagem offered by the Municipality chamber to the Royal Family composed of [[Maria II of Portugal|Queen D. Maria II]], [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|King D. Fernando II]], then prince D. Pedro (future [[Pedro V of Portugal|D. Pedro V]]) and then prince D. Lu\u00eds (future [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal|D. Lu\u00eds I]]). This lunch took place on the last visit of D. Maria II to the north of Portugal in the form of thanks for the creation of the Municipality of Valongo in 1836. \n\nYears later, there would be another royal visit, this time by D. Lu\u00eds and D. Maria Pia. \"For a long time, there was still talk with great admiration of the gigantic and beautiful arches that were made in many places of passage of the procession and that gave the celebrations an admirable splendor.\" <ref>{{Cite book|last=Costa|first=Jos\u00e9 An\u00e9gia.|title=Valongo, um salto para a modernidade|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira|pages=pp. 8\u201337}}</ref>\n\nDetween the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 20th century, large farming houses were built in all villages whose rural nature. The road network was developed within the limits of the municipality, which began being served by transport such as the electric car and the train. The main artery of Valongo and Ermesinde saw the opening of commercial establishments. During this time, the local population increased with the arrival of people from the interior of Portugal.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, the region became an actractive site for the [[mining]] of [[slate]], but also of [[antimony]], [[tungsten]] and [[coal]]. At the borders of Ermesinde, large factories were set up, such as \u201cResineira\u201d, \u201cCer\u00e2mica\u201d - \u201cEmpresa Industrial de Ermesinde\u201d and \u201cT\u00eaxtil de S\u00e1\u201d, among others.

The municipality is limited to the north by the municipality of [[Santo Tirso]], to the northeast by [[Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira]], to the east by [[Paredes, Portugal|Paredes]], to the southwest by [[Gondomar, Portugal|Gondomar]] and to the west by [[Maia, Portugal|Maia]]. It consists of the cities of [[Alfena]], [[Ermesinde]], Valongo (city) and the towns of Campo and Sobrado.\n\n== History ==\nThe Municipality of Valongo was created in 1836 as a part of the administrative reform of the country, which occured during in the reign of [[Maria II of Portugal|D. Maria II]]. However, human occupation of this region predates the [[Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula|Roman conquest of the Iberian-Peninsula]].\n\n===Ancient history===\nThis region was occupied by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], especially for gold mining in the Serra de Santa Justa. One of the traces of Roman occupation is in the municipality name, which originated in the Latin words ''Vallis Longus''. There are still traces that would allow the detection of two main Roman connecting roads that would cross the municipality: the [[Porto]] - [[Guimar\u00e3es]] road and the [[Alfena]] - Valongo - Aguiar de Sousa / [[Penafiel]] road .\n\nThis region would then be occupied by barbarian peoples ([[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]]) and later by [[Arabs]] and [[Moors]].\n\nAccording to Father Lopes dos Reis, a native of Valongo, \u201cthe Moors entered Hespanha enthusiastic about the holy war with the alfange in one hand and Alkor\u00e3o in the other, taking over with their powerful army all the places they could pass through. In Vallongo, perhaps there was no blood at all, because the inhabitants, few and without defense, could only fearlessly try to prevent the passage to a powerful enemy from whom they had known that an army of brave people had fled in terror. That is why, when the Arabs arrived in Vallongo (716), they left their people in peace without writing it, and by means of a certain tribute they gave them the freedom to live as they did here, going to settle far from the Goda settlement, which occupied the Sus\u00e3o and the western part of the villa, on the plain at the edge of a stream that was later called Ilhar Mourisco.\u201d <ref>{{Cite book|last=Ferreira|first=Nuno|title=Igreja Matriz de Sobrado- O Segredo da Mem\u00f3ria, Edi\u00e7\u00e3o de Autor|publisher=Valongo|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the ''[[Reconquista|reconquest]]'' of ''Portus Cale'' ([[Porto]]) by [[V\u00edmara Peres]] in 868, he was named a count and given control of the [[March (territory)|frontier region]] between the [[Limia River|Limia]] and [[Douro]] rivers by [[Alfonso III of Asturias]], therefore bringing the region under control of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. \n\n===Middle ages===\nFrom the General Inquiries of 1258, the current municipality was divided at the time between the parish of [[Aguiar de Sousa]] - which included S. Martinho de Campo and Sobrado , and the ''parish'' of [[Maia, Portugal|Maia]], which included S.Vicente da Queimadela, Valongo and S. Louren\u00e7o de Asmes .\n\nFrom the economic and social point of view, at this time, the ownership of land was the basis of the economy and the main element of survival and power. In the area of \u200b\u200bthe municipality, land belonged to the [[King]] and the [[Clergy]] - particularly the [[Regular clergy|Regular Clergy.]]\n\nThe appearance of new settlements, the progressive extension of the term of existing settlements, the multiplication of suffragan chapels and the division of property, is evidence of the notorious demographic growth of this region over the centuries. This increase in population was accompanied by the progressive development of other sectors of the economy. Industry and commerce, initially based on incipient forms, acquire a strong expression in the economy. The traditional bakery industry is an excellent example of this: its origins date back to the Low Middle Ages, but the development of wheat bread is such a development, which allowed Valongo bakers to feed the entire surrounding region and with the product of their work. This in turn, allow them to to make a decisive contribution. for the construction of the new church, the Igreja Matriz de Valongo, whose construction dates to the end of the 18th century.\n\n===19th century===\nAt the dawn of the 19th century, Valongo experiences the [[Napoleon|hardship of the presence of Napoleon's troops]], during the French Invasions. A division settled in Valongo, turning the church into a stable and plundering values \u200b\u200bfrom individuals and the church.\n\nThese lands therefore served as a stage for battles and military movements that took place between the two straying brothers: D. Pedro, on the side of the Liberals, D. Miguel, on the part of the Miguelists/Absolutists. During this period two important battles take place: the Battle of Ponte Ferreira and the Battle of the Ant. In Ermesinde, the former Convent of N\u00aa. Mr. do Bom Despacho (now, the Church of St. Rita), became a military hospital for Miguelists forces.\n\nBy decree published on November 29, 1836, D. Maria II creates the Municipality of Valongo with the parishes of Sobrado, Campo and Gandra (which belonged to the Municipality of Baltar) and Alfena , Ermesinde and Valongo (which belonged to the Municipality of Maia) .\n\nOn May 18, 1852, there was a lunch at Travagem offered by the Municipality chamber to the Royal Family composed of [[Maria II of Portugal|Queen D. Maria II]], [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|King D. Fernando II]], then prince D. Pedro (future [[Pedro V of Portugal|D. Pedro V]]) and then prince D. Lu\u00eds (future [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal|D. Lu\u00eds I]]). This lunch took place on the last visit of D. Maria II to the north of Portugal in the form of thanks for the creation of the Municipality of Valongo in 1836. \n\nYears later, there would be another royal visit, this time by D. Lu\u00eds and D. Maria Pia. \"For a long time, there was still talk with great admiration of the gigantic and beautiful arches that were made in many places of passage of the procession and that gave the celebrations an admirable splendor.\" <ref>{{Cite book|last=Costa|first=Jos\u00e9 An\u00e9gia.|title=Valongo, um salto para a modernidade|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira|pages=pp. 8\u201337}}</ref>\n\nDetween the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 20th century, large farming houses were built in all villages whose rural nature. The road network was developed within the limits of the municipality, which began being served by transport such as the electric car and the train. The main artery of Valongo and Ermesinde saw the opening of commercial establishments. During this time, the local population increased with the arrival of people from the interior of Portugal.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century, the region became an actractive site for the [[mining]] of [[slate]], but also of [[antimony]], [[tungsten]] and [[coal]]. At the borders of Ermesinde, large factories were set up, such as \u201cResineira\u201d, \u201cCer\u00e2mica\u201d - \u201cEmpresa Industrial de Ermesinde\u201d and \u201cT\u00eaxtil de S\u00e1\u201d, among others. The Municipality became the site for the expansion of industries such as [[metallurgy]], [[Textile|textile manufacting]], [[Construction|civil construction]], public works, [[Food industry|food]], [[Wood industry|wood]] and [[furniture]].
