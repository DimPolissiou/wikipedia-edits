It was founded with the declared aim of creating a novel political centre based on the principles of [[classical liberalism]] and libertarianism. Girchi promotes itself as being open to youth willing to participate in politics.

The party is chaired by Iago Khvichia. \nThe name ''Girchi'' translates to pine cone and is a symbol of freshness and greenery that is also associated with the third-eye and the enlightenment. \n\nGirchi is the first Georgian online party that rejected a standard party structure and methods of political struggle by selecting Facebook as the main hub of its activities and as a platform of communication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tabula.ge/en/story/113804-girchi-we-refuse-to-be-traditional-political-party|title=Girchi: We Refuse to be Traditional Political Party|website=Tabula|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>\n\nGirchi was briefly, from August to September 2016, a part of [[Paata Burchuladze]]'s [[State for the People]] election bloc, which they quit just eleven days before the upcoming [[2016 Georgian parliamentary election|parliamentary election]], citing \"serious problems in terms of management\".<ref>{{cite news|title=NPC-Girchi Quits Burchuladze\u2019s Election Bloc|url=http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=29468|accessdate=2 October 2016|work=Civil Georgia|date=7 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe party has been vocal regarding the ideals underpinning their work.

The portal functions as a medium between the supporters and politicians whereby the former are able to accumulate the said digital currency, the ''GeD,'' and distribute them among\u00a0 the candidates (that is everyone who shows the desire to represent the party). This forms a hierarchy between the politicians that ultimately will determine their positions on the party lists. The platform allows for the reallocation of GeDs in the event that a supporters shifts their favour of one candidate to another.The public can earn GeDs through direct financial donations to the party or individual politicians/projects and actions that Girchi considers to be contributing towards the promotion and proliferation of the ideals of individual freedom and non-interference from the Government in non-violent consensual societal relationships. The greater the number of GeDs accumulated by a platform member, the greater his/her voting power in the political decision-making process. \n\nThe other and - according to the party - \u2018ultimate and the most important purpose of the GeD is to function as a private currency in the future, when in case Girchi assumes legislative power, it returns assets worth trillions of [[United States dollar|US Dollars]] to its rightful owners - the Georgian population - that was taken from them by the [[Soviet regime|Soviet regime.]]\n\n== 2018 Presidential Elections ==\nAccording to Georgian legislation, a party must have been registered in the previous parliamentary elections to present a presidential candidate in the upcoming elections<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2018/1682|title=Politician asks for middle name \u2018pine cone\u2019 to run for presidency|website=Agenda.ge|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>.

The Georgian legislation envisages an interview before a person\u2019s name is officially changed. Since, the said interview was never scheduled, Zurab Girchi Japaridze did not withdraw his application. However, the Ministry of Justice, without informing the applicant, changed his name to Zurab Girchi Japaridze. Since the Georgian legislation only allows Georgian citizens to change their names once, Zurab Girchi Japaridze will remain Zurab Girchi Japaridze if essential changes to the legislation are not made in the future.\n\nThe presidential elections were the first elections Girchi took part in. 36,000 people voted for Girchi\u2019s candidate equalling 2.26% of the total number of votes.\n\n== 2019 Mid-term Parliamentary Elections ==\nDue to the fact that Salome Zurabishvili was elected Georgia\u2019s fifth president in 2018 Presidential elections the mid-term parliamentary elections were scheduled for 19 May 2019. Girchi presented Hermann Sabo as a candidate. Girchi intended to demonstrate the flaws of the Georgian majoritarian electoral system and publicly called upon Girchi supporters to change their addresses of registration to Mtatsminda district in order to be able to vote in the elections. This is the mechanism that every government in Georgia has resorted to in secrecy.  Up to 1000 applications had been registered with the Ministry of Justice. The Georgian legislation does not envisage any conditions to be met in order for a person to change his/her address of registration. However, the Ministry of Justice of Georgia granted requests to only around 60 applicants, thus, breaching a constitutional right of every individual to freely choose their residence. \n\nHermann Sabo got 4.8% of the total number of votes.\n== Activism ==\nGirchi's political ideology has manifested itself through a number of initiatives and protest actions which include, but are not limited to: the founding of a religion (''see'' Biblical Freedom) and a live TV station - Girchi TV, the creation of a digital currency Georgian Dollar (GeD) and the planting of cannabis seeds on the party\u2019s premises. The party has also taken legal action against the ruling government.

The process was aired live by the Georgian TV networks and live-streamed on Facebook by Girchi and social media channels. Although the planting/cultivation of cannabis is punishable under the current Criminal Code of Georgia and stipulates a maximum penalty of 12-years imprisonment the Government made the decision not to charge the participants of this act of civil disobedience. An investigation on the matter was conducted and the police confiscated 84 plant pots containing cannabis seeds for laboratory tests. Citing a low level of THC in the plants, the police closed the investigation. One of the leaders of the party, Zurab Girchi Japaridze, was presented with administrative charges and fined as an organiser.\n[[File:Planting_of_Cannabis_seeds_at_the_Girchi_Party_HQ.jpg|thumb|Planting of Cannabis seeds at the Girchi Party HQ]]\n\n=== Legal Efforts to Legalise Cannabis Possession and Consumption (2017 - 2018) ===\nOn November 30, 2017, the [[Constitutional Court of Georgia]] decriminalised the personal consumption of cannabis and other cannabis-based products.

According to the Applicants: <blockquote>''The consumption of cannabis is not an act that threatens society. In particular, it can only harm the users\u2019 health, making that user him/herself responsible for the outcome. The responsibility for such actions does not cause dangerous consequences for the public.''</blockquote>\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Georgia noted that giving legal permission to consume cannabis protects an individual\u2019s right to free development of his/her personality, and while prohibition of the consumption of cannabis is an action directed against its turnover and therefore serves the aim of consumer protection of health, according to the Court, the role of an individual user in the support of cannabis circulation is very small, and consequently the threats from individual consumption are likewise small. Due to the above-mentioned, the court ruled the punishment for consumption of cannabis to be disproportionate. The court took into account certain exceptions in cases when the use of cannabis might create threats to third parties and stated:<blockquote>''In addition, the Constitutional Court highlights the imposition of responsibility of cannabis consumption when it creates a threat to third parties. For instance, the Court will justify responsibility when cannabis is consumed in educational institutions, public places, such as on public transport, and in the presence of children.''</blockquote>Georgia is the first former soviet country where the consumption of cannabis is legal, hence, does not entail any criminal or administrative penalties. \n\n=== Girchi's Religious Organisation - Christian Evangelical Protestant \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019 Church of Georgia (2017) ===\nOn March 2017, the Public Registry of the [[Ministry of Justice of Georgia]] officially registered Girchi\u2019s church - the [[Christian Evangelical Protestant Biblical Freedom Church of Georgia|Christian Evangelical Protestant \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019 Church of Georgia]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oc-media.org/georgian-opposition-party-registers-religion-for-men-to-avoid-conscription/|title=Georgian opposition party registers \u2018religion\u2019 for men to avoid conscription|date=2017-04-24|website=OC Media|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>. Georgian legislation provides special privileges and exemptions for the [[clergy]] and students at [[Theology|theological]] schools, including the deferment of [[Conscription|compulsory military service]]. \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019 used the provision, the so-called legislative loophole, for the benefit of young men and issues state-recognised documents to those who do not wish to join the army, certifying that they are \u2018priests\u2019. It serves to effectively exempt them from mandatory military service, so that they can lead their lives according to their own free will, values and opinions. The [[consecration]] process takes 10 minutes. [[File:Levan_Jgerenaia.png|thumb|Levan Jgerenaia, The Archbishop of Biblical Freedom]]\n\nGirchi fights for individual liberty and considers the mandatory one-year term of military service for youngsters to be a manifestation of state violence against its citizens and constitutes a contemporary form of slavery. Girchi established \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019 for the sole purpose of helping young men to avoid military service and, to date, has helped approximately 25 000 men from having to either undertake the term or having to pay 2 000 GEL for postponing it for one year. Girchi believes that this is an immoral legal mechanism, extorting money from the citizenry for the benefit of the state. \n\nPeople of various backgrounds have approached \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019 for help. Congregants of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Muslims, Protestants, Catholics and even atheists are among them.\n\nAccording to Girchi whether a human being is trained in combat or undergoes any other type of non-military service is not of principal importance. For the party members any form of labour or service is unacceptable if it occurs through use of force by the State. This sentiment underpinned a concerted protest action directed against the draft law proposed by the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Irakli Sesiashvili on 13<sup>th</sup> March 2019 within the framework of which he asked the Parliament to abolish the law allowing priests of any religious denomination to postpone their compulsory term of military service. The amendment would not affect priests of the [[Concordat of 2002|Georgian Orthodox Church]], due to a [[Concordat of 2002|Constitutional Agreement between the Church and the Georgian state]], creating an alternate legal regime. It was obviously directed against \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019. \n\nAccording to the bill introduced by Irakli Sesiashvili, young men who refuse to complete Mandatory Military Service on the basis of their religious beliefs, personal endeavours or conscience will have to undertake a term of non-military service.\n\nThe initiative was proposed despite the fact that the Constitutional Court of Georgia has already noted in its decision that:<blockquote>''The recognition of the special role of the Church (the Georgian Christian Orthodox Church) is related to its historical merits and does not serve as means for creating privileged legal conditions for the Orthodox Christianity in the future. The historical merits shall not be considered as a legitimate source of privilege. The differentiation and creation of privileged legal conditions are not and shall not be the objective of the Constitution''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://constcourt.ge/ge/legal-acts/judgments/1-2-671-ssip-saqartvelos-evangelur-baptisturi-eklesia-aaip-saqartvelos-sicocxlis-sityvis-eklesia-ssip-qristes-eklesia-ssip-saqartvelos-saxarebis-rwmenis-eklesia-aaip-meshvide-dgis-qristian-adventistta-eklesiis-transkavkasiuri-iunioni-ssip-latin-katoliketa.page|title=\u10e1\u10e1\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d5\u10d0\u10dc\u10d2\u10d4\u10da\u10e3\u10e0-\u10d1\u10d0\u10de\u10e2\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10e3\u10e0\u10d8 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u201d, \u10d0\u10d0\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d8\u10ea\u10dd\u10ea\u10ee\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d8\u10e2\u10e7\u10d5\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u201d, \u10e1\u10e1\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10e5\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d4\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u201d, \u10e1\u10e1\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10ee\u10d0\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e0\u10ec\u10db\u10d4\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u201d, \u10d0\u10d0\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10db\u10d4\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10d3\u10d4 \u10d3\u10e6\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e5\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc-\u10d0\u10d3\u10d5\u10d4\u10dc\u10e2\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d7\u10d0 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e2\u10e0\u10d0\u10dc\u10e1\u10d9\u10d0\u10d5\u10d9\u10d0\u10e1\u10d8\u10e3\u10e0\u10d8 \u10d8\u10e3\u10dc\u10d8\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8\u201d, \u10e1\u10e1\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10da\u10d0\u10d7\u10d8\u10dc \u10d9\u10d0\u10d7\u10dd\u10da\u10d8\u10d9\u10d4\u10d7\u10d0 \u10d9\u10d0\u10d5\u10d9\u10d0\u10e1\u10d8\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10ea\u10d8\u10e5\u10e3\u10da\u10dd \u10d0\u10d3\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10e0\u10d0\u10ea\u10d8\u10d0\u201d, \u10d0\u10d0\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da \u10db\u10e3\u10e1\u10da\u10d8\u10db\u10d7\u10d0 \u10d9\u10d0\u10d5\u10e8\u10d8\u10e0\u10d8\u201d, \u10e1\u10e1\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0 \u10e1\u10d0\u10db\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u201d \u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10de\u10d0\u10e0\u10da\u10d0\u10db\u10d4\u10dc\u10e2\u10d8\u10e1 \u10ec\u10d8\u10dc\u10d0\u10d0\u10e6\u10db\u10d3\u10d4\u10d2|website=\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10d9\u10dd\u10dc\u10e1\u10e2\u10d8\u10e2\u10e3\u10ea\u10d8\u10dd \u10e1\u10d0\u10e1\u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10da\u10dd|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>''.''</blockquote>The said initiative was supported by the most influential religious institution in Georgia - the patriarchate of Georgia.

In reality, they have been copying data from the Central Election Commission/CEC database into the application forms designated by the Commission. This documentation is then presented to the CEC, which registers a political party for elections.\n\nGirchi rejected this tradition of forging supporters\u2019 signatures and announced that it would participate in the elections only if it collected 25,000 on-line signatures of exclusively genuine supporters. In less than one month, Girchi managed to collect 7,200 signatures, which was not enough to take part in the elections.\n\n=== Lotto Civil Disobedience (2017) ===\nSince 2009, according to Georgian legislation, conducting lottery activities in Georgia is the sole domain of one company - Georgian National Lottery - lotto.ge<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lotto.ge/|title=\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10d4\u10e0\u10dd\u10d5\u10dc\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10da\u10d0\u10e2\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0 {{!}} lotto.ge|website=lotto.ge|language=ka|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>. According to Girchi, giving a monopoly to one company is unfair, immoral, economically unjustified and poses questions related to the existence of corruption. To protest this state of affairs, on July 2018 Girchi members carried out an act of civil disobedience on the party\u2019s premises and, in breach of existing legislation, played lotto for money. This was accompanied by live coverage. There was no reaction from law-enforcement agencies, which proved once again how absurd the legislation prohibiting citizens to play lotto or organise a lottery is.\n=== Cannabis Legalisation Festival (2018) ===\nOn 20 October 2018, one week before the presidential election, Girchi and its activists held the Cannabis Legalisation Festival<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/441840-georgias-marijuana-festival-flop/|title=Blunt move: Georgia\u2019s presidential hopeful hands out \u2018marijuana joints,\u2019 gets detained (VIDEO)|website=RT International|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> in Tbilisi, protesting the new aim of Parliament to pass a bill restricting the consumption of cannabis. The event was not green-lighted by the authorities, and police prevented organisers from actually holding the festival. Nevertheless, Zurab Girchi Japaridze publicly handed out cannabis joints to certain individuals, hence, committed another act of civil disobedience by breaking Article 273(1) of the Criminal Code of Georgia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://police.ge/en/shinagan-saqmeta-saministros-gantskhadeba/12063|title=Statement of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia|website=Ministry of Internal Affairs|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>. Zurab Girchi Japaridze was eventually detained along with several other participants who protested for the legalisation of Cannabis consumption at the festival. \n\nBased on Girchi\u2019s statements, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia launched an investigation under the 2nd and 8th Paragraphs of Article 273 (1) of the Criminal Code of Georgia on the illegal possession, use and trade of cannabis or cannabis-related products . However, no formal charges were presented and Zurab Girchi Japaridze and the other detainees were released the same day<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://1tv.ge/en/news/presidential-candidate-zurab-japaridze-detained/|title=Presidential candidate Zurab Japaridze detained|website=1TV|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>.[[File:Girchi_TV.jpg|thumb|Girchi TV Logo]]\n\n=== Girchi T.V. (2019) ===\nGirchi TV started broadcasting on August 21, 2019. One of the leaders of the party Zurab Girchi Japaridze, explained that they want to reach a segment of the Georgian population that still receives political information from television and not from the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/4469_august_27_2019/4469_econ_one.html|title=The Messenger - Girchi TV starts broadcasting, representatives say they won\u2019t pay taxes until debt is at GEL 24 984 000|website=www.messenger.com.ge|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the representatives of the party, their new channel will not pay taxes until their debt reaches 24,984,000 GEL since other leading Channels had the debt of somewhat similar amount annulled by the Government of Georgia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.girchi.com/ge/media/news/985-girchi-tv-s-sagangebo-gantskhadeba|title=\u10d2\u10d8\u10e0\u10e9\u10d8 TV-\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10d2\u10d0\u10dc\u10d2\u10d4\u10d1\u10dd \u10d2\u10d0\u10dc\u10ea\u10ee\u10d0\u10d3\u10d4\u10d1\u10d0|website=www.girchi.com|language=ka|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>. According to the party Georgian Broadcasters use two different methods in order to avoid taxes: either working for the Government, in which case they are simply exempt from their obligations, or the opposition, so that when the State attacks the latter the society perceives it as a fight against the freedom of speech.\n\n=== Girchi Brothel 'Pioneer' (2019) ===\nIn 2019, just one week before the mid-term parliamentary elections which Girchi participated in, Girchi opened a brothel in its headquarters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2019/1242|title=Georgian political party Girchi opens brothel in headquarters|website=Agenda.ge|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\nWith this act of civil disobedience Girchi addressed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GirchiParty/posts/2547060992012011|title=\u10d2\u10d8\u10e0\u10e9\u10d8 / Girchi|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> the arrest of 3 individuals on charges of promoting prostitution<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/4393_may_13_2019/4393_girchi.html|title=The Messenger - Georgia\u2019s Girchi party opens a brothel in its office|website=www.messenger.com.ge|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> and opposed relevant Georgian criminal legislation, that has become a source of arbitrary justice on many occasions in Georgia. As a result of such Government actions people who support themselves and their families through selling sexual services and who have not harmed anyone, are left without any financial means. They additionally suffer public reproach, since the social stigma associated with being a sex service provider is deeply rooted in Georgian society .\n\nGirchi believes that, whether to engage in any job/activity that does not involve elements of physical or psychological violence should be subject to the discretion of freely consenting adults. Following this line of reasoning, Girchi believes that prostitution is a fair and acceptable occupation.\n\nGirchi states that the only path towards ending this situation and, consequently, protecting people involved in the sex-industry from violence and abuse, coming mainly from the law enforcement agencies, is the legalisation of prostitution. According to Girchi the full legalisation would also benefit society at large through preventing the spread of AIDS/HIV among other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nWith this act of civil disobedience Girchi staff violated paragraph 3 of Article 254 of the Criminal Code of Georgia (Promotion of Prostitution) which states that:<blockquote>''Making available an area or dwelling place for prostitution committed jointly by more than one person shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of three to six years''</blockquote>\n\n=== Purchase of Bio Drugs ===\nThroughout years, Girchi has protested against current drug policies. One of the issues that Girchi continuously underlines is that existing prohibitions and punishments prescribed by legislation for drug-related offences, are of financial interest for some individuals \u2013 while it is very difficult to obtain cannabis, which grows wildly in almost all regions of Georgia, it is very easy to purchase other drugs of dubious origin and composition. These reach Georgia from abroad, having had to cross customs borders.\n\nTo illustrate this state of affairs, on February 24, 2017 Girchi undertook a so-called \u2018bio drug purchase\u2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apmultimedianewsroom.com/multimedia-newsroom/buying-drugs-online-in-georgia|title=Buying drugs online in Georgia|last=Ltd|first=Online Solutions|website=AP Multimedia Newsroom|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>, shooting a video depicting all details of the process.

The portal functions as a medium between the supporters and politicians whereby the former are able to accumulate the said digital currency, the ''GeD,'' and distribute them among\u00a0 the candidates (that is everyone who shows the desire to represent the party). This forms a hierarchy between the politicians that ultimately will determine their positions on the party lists. The platform allows for the reallocation of GeDs in the event that a supporters shifts their favour of one candidate to another.The public can earn GeDs through direct financial donations to the party or individual politicians/projects and actions that Girchi considers to be contributing towards the promotion and proliferation of the ideals of individual freedom and non-interference from the Government in non-violent consensual societal relationships. The greater the number of GeDs accumulated by a platform member, the greater his/her voting power in the political decision-making process. \n\nThe other and - according to the party - \u2018ultimate and the most important purpose of the GeD is to function as a private currency in the future, when in case Girchi assumes legislative power, it returns assets worth trillions of [[United States dollar|US Dollars]] to its rightful owners - the Georgian population - that was taken from them by the [[Soviet regime|Soviet regime.]]\n\n== 2018 Presidential Elections ==\nAccording to Georgian legislation, a party must have been registered in the previous parliamentary elections to present a presidential candidate in the upcoming elections<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2018/1682|title=Politician asks for middle name \u2018pine cone\u2019 to run for presidency|website=Agenda.ge|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>.

The Georgian legislation envisages an interview before a person\u2019s name is officially changed. Since, the said interview was never scheduled, Zurab Girchi Japaridze did not withdraw his application. However, the Ministry of Justice, without informing the applicant, changed his name to Zurab Girchi Japaridze. Since the Georgian legislation only allows Georgian citizens to change their names once, Zurab Girchi Japaridze will remain Zurab Girchi Japaridze if essential changes to the legislation are not made in the future.\n\nThe presidential elections were the first elections Girchi took part in. 36,000 people voted for Girchi\u2019s candidate equalling 2.26% of the total number of votes.\n\n== 2019 Mid-term Parliamentary Elections ==\nDue to the fact that Salome Zurabishvili was elected Georgia\u2019s fifth president in 2018 Presidential elections the mid-term parliamentary elections were scheduled for 19 May 2019. Girchi presented Hermann Sabo as a candidate. Girchi intended to demonstrate the flaws of the Georgian majoritarian electoral system and publicly called upon Girchi supporters to change their addresses of registration to Mtatsminda district in order to be able to vote in the elections. This is the mechanism that every government in Georgia has resorted to in secrecy.  Up to 1000 applications had been registered with the Ministry of Justice. The Georgian legislation does not envisage any conditions to be met in order for a person to change his/her address of registration. However, the Ministry of Justice of Georgia granted requests to only around 60 applicants, thus, breaching a constitutional right of every individual to freely choose their residence. \n\nHermann Sabo got 4.8% of the total number of votes.\n== Activism ==\nGirchi's political ideology has manifested itself through a number of initiatives and protest actions which include, but are not limited to: the founding of a religion (''see'' Biblical Freedom) and a live TV station - Girchi TV, the creation of a digital currency Georgian Dollar (GeD) and the planting of cannabis seeds on the party\u2019s premises. The party has also taken legal action against the ruling government.

The process was aired live by the Georgian TV networks and live-streamed on Facebook by Girchi and social media channels. Although the planting/cultivation of cannabis is punishable under the current Criminal Code of Georgia and stipulates a maximum penalty of 12-years imprisonment the Government made the decision not to charge the participants of this act of civil disobedience. An investigation on the matter was conducted and the police confiscated 84 plant pots containing cannabis seeds for laboratory tests. Citing a low level of THC in the plants, the police closed the investigation. One of the leaders of the party, Zurab Girchi Japaridze, was presented with administrative charges and fined as an organiser.\n[[File:Planting_of_Cannabis_seeds_at_the_Girchi_Party_HQ.jpg|thumb|Planting of Cannabis seeds at the Girchi Party HQ]]\n\n=== Legal Efforts to Legalise Cannabis Possession and Consumption (2017 - 2018) ===\nOn November 30, 2017, the [[Constitutional Court of Georgia]] decriminalised the personal consumption of cannabis and other cannabis-based products.

According to the Applicants: <blockquote>''The consumption of cannabis is not an act that threatens society. In particular, it can only harm the users\u2019 health, making that user him/herself responsible for the outcome. The responsibility for such actions does not cause dangerous consequences for the public.''</blockquote>\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Georgia noted that giving legal permission to consume cannabis protects an individual\u2019s right to free development of his/her personality, and while prohibition of the consumption of cannabis is an action directed against its turnover and therefore serves the aim of consumer protection of health, according to the Court, the role of an individual user in the support of cannabis circulation is very small, and consequently the threats from individual consumption are likewise small. Due to the above-mentioned, the court ruled the punishment for consumption of cannabis to be disproportionate. The court took into account certain exceptions in cases when the use of cannabis might create threats to third parties and stated:<blockquote>''In addition, the Constitutional Court highlights the imposition of responsibility of cannabis consumption when it creates a threat to third parties. For instance, the Court will justify responsibility when cannabis is consumed in educational institutions, public places, such as on public transport, and in the presence of children.''</blockquote>Georgia is the first former soviet country where the consumption of cannabis is legal, hence, does not entail any criminal or administrative penalties. \n\n=== Girchi's Religious Organisation - Christian Evangelical Protestant \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019 Church of Georgia (2017) ===\nOn March 2017, the Public Registry of the [[Ministry of Justice of Georgia]] officially registered Girchi\u2019s church - the [[Christian Evangelical Protestant Biblical Freedom Church of Georgia|Christian Evangelical Protestant \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019 Church of Georgia]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://oc-media.org/georgian-opposition-party-registers-religion-for-men-to-avoid-conscription/|title=Georgian opposition party registers \u2018religion\u2019 for men to avoid conscription|date=2017-04-24|website=OC Media|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>. Georgian legislation provides special privileges and exemptions for the [[clergy]] and students at [[Theology|theological]] schools, including the deferment of [[Conscription|compulsory military service]]. \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019 used the provision, the so-called legislative loophole, for the benefit of young men and issues state-recognised documents to those who do not wish to join the army, certifying that they are \u2018priests\u2019. It serves to effectively exempt them from mandatory military service, so that they can lead their lives according to their own free will, values and opinions. The [[consecration]] process takes 10 minutes. [[File:Levan_Jgerenaia.png|thumb|Levan Jgerenaia, The Archbishop of Biblical Freedom]]\n\nGirchi fights for individual liberty and considers the mandatory one-year term of military service for youngsters to be a manifestation of state violence against its citizens and constitutes a contemporary form of slavery. Girchi established \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019 for the sole purpose of helping young men to avoid military service and, to date, has helped approximately 25 000 men from having to either undertake the term or having to pay 2 000 GEL for postponing it for one year. Girchi believes that this is an immoral legal mechanism, extorting money from the citizenry for the benefit of the state. \n\nPeople of various backgrounds have approached \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019 for help. Congregants of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Muslims, Protestants, Catholics and even atheists are among them.\n\nAccording to Girchi whether a human being is trained in combat or undergoes any other type of non-military service is not of principal importance. For the party members any form of labour or service is unacceptable if it occurs through use of force by the State. This sentiment underpinned a concerted protest action directed against the draft law proposed by the Chairman of the Defence and Security Committee, Irakli Sesiashvili on 13<sup>th</sup> March 2019 within the framework of which he asked the Parliament to abolish the law allowing priests of any religious denomination to postpone their compulsory term of military service. The amendment would not affect priests of the [[Concordat of 2002|Georgian Orthodox Church]], due to a [[Concordat of 2002|Constitutional Agreement between the Church and the Georgian state]], creating an alternate legal regime. It was obviously directed against \u2018Biblical Freedom\u2019. \n\nAccording to the bill introduced by Irakli Sesiashvili, young men who refuse to complete Mandatory Military Service on the basis of their religious beliefs, personal endeavours or conscience will have to undertake a term of non-military service.\n\nThe initiative was proposed despite the fact that the Constitutional Court of Georgia has already noted in its decision that:<blockquote>''The recognition of the special role of the Church (the Georgian Christian Orthodox Church) is related to its historical merits and does not serve as means for creating privileged legal conditions for the Orthodox Christianity in the future. The historical merits shall not be considered as a legitimate source of privilege. The differentiation and creation of privileged legal conditions are not and shall not be the objective of the Constitution''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://constcourt.ge/ge/legal-acts/judgments/1-2-671-ssip-saqartvelos-evangelur-baptisturi-eklesia-aaip-saqartvelos-sicocxlis-sityvis-eklesia-ssip-qristes-eklesia-ssip-saqartvelos-saxarebis-rwmenis-eklesia-aaip-meshvide-dgis-qristian-adventistta-eklesiis-transkavkasiuri-iunioni-ssip-latin-katoliketa.page|title=\u10e1\u10e1\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d5\u10d0\u10dc\u10d2\u10d4\u10da\u10e3\u10e0-\u10d1\u10d0\u10de\u10e2\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10e3\u10e0\u10d8 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u201d, \u10d0\u10d0\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d8\u10ea\u10dd\u10ea\u10ee\u10da\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d8\u10e2\u10e7\u10d5\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u201d, \u10e1\u10e1\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10e5\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d4\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u201d, \u10e1\u10e1\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10ee\u10d0\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e0\u10ec\u10db\u10d4\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u201d, \u10d0\u10d0\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10db\u10d4\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10d3\u10d4 \u10d3\u10e6\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e5\u10e0\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d8\u10d0\u10dc-\u10d0\u10d3\u10d5\u10d4\u10dc\u10e2\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10d7\u10d0 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e2\u10e0\u10d0\u10dc\u10e1\u10d9\u10d0\u10d5\u10d9\u10d0\u10e1\u10d8\u10e3\u10e0\u10d8 \u10d8\u10e3\u10dc\u10d8\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8\u201d, \u10e1\u10e1\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10da\u10d0\u10d7\u10d8\u10dc \u10d9\u10d0\u10d7\u10dd\u10da\u10d8\u10d9\u10d4\u10d7\u10d0 \u10d9\u10d0\u10d5\u10d9\u10d0\u10e1\u10d8\u10d8\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10db\u10dd\u10ea\u10d8\u10e5\u10e3\u10da\u10dd \u10d0\u10d3\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d8\u10e1\u10e2\u10e0\u10d0\u10ea\u10d8\u10d0\u201d, \u10d0\u10d0\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da \u10db\u10e3\u10e1\u10da\u10d8\u10db\u10d7\u10d0 \u10d9\u10d0\u10d5\u10e8\u10d8\u10e0\u10d8\u201d, \u10e1\u10e1\u10d8\u10de \u201e\u10ec\u10db\u10d8\u10dc\u10d3\u10d0 \u10e1\u10d0\u10db\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 \u10d4\u10d9\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\u10d0\u201d \u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10de\u10d0\u10e0\u10da\u10d0\u10db\u10d4\u10dc\u10e2\u10d8\u10e1 \u10ec\u10d8\u10dc\u10d0\u10d0\u10e6\u10db\u10d3\u10d4\u10d2|website=\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10e1\u10d0\u10d9\u10dd\u10dc\u10e1\u10e2\u10d8\u10e2\u10e3\u10ea\u10d8\u10dd \u10e1\u10d0\u10e1\u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10da\u10dd|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>''.''</blockquote>The said initiative was supported by the most influential religious institution in Georgia - the patriarchate of Georgia.

In reality, they have been copying data from the Central Election Commission/CEC database into the application forms designated by the Commission. This documentation is then presented to the CEC, which registers a political party for elections.\n\nGirchi rejected this tradition of forging supporters\u2019 signatures and announced that it would participate in the elections only if it collected 25,000 on-line signatures of exclusively genuine supporters. In less than one month, Girchi managed to collect 7,200 signatures, which was not enough to take part in the elections.\n\n=== Lotto Civil Disobedience (2017) ===\nSince 2009, according to Georgian legislation, conducting lottery activities in Georgia is the sole domain of one company - Georgian National Lottery - lotto.ge<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lotto.ge/|title=\u10e1\u10d0\u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10d5\u10d4\u10da\u10dd\u10e1 \u10d4\u10e0\u10dd\u10d5\u10dc\u10e3\u10da\u10d8 \u10da\u10d0\u10e2\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8\u10d0 {{!}} lotto.ge|website=lotto.ge|language=ka|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>.

To protest this state of affairs, on July 2018 Girchi members carried out an act of civil disobedience on the party\u2019s premises and, in breach of existing legislation, played lotto for money. This was accompanied by live coverage. There was no reaction from law-enforcement agencies, which proved once again how absurd the legislation prohibiting citizens to play lotto or organise a lottery is.\n=== Cannabis Legalisation Festival (2018) ===\nOn 20 October 2018, one week before the presidential election, Girchi and its activists held the Cannabis Legalisation Festival<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/441840-georgias-marijuana-festival-flop/|title=Blunt move: Georgia\u2019s presidential hopeful hands out \u2018marijuana joints,\u2019 gets detained (VIDEO)|website=RT International|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> in Tbilisi, protesting the new aim of Parliament to pass a bill restricting the consumption of cannabis. The event was not green-lighted by the authorities, and police prevented organisers from actually holding the festival.

According to the party Georgian Broadcasters use two different methods in order to avoid taxes: either working for the Government, in which case they are simply exempt from their obligations, or the opposition, so that when the State attacks the latter the society perceives it as a fight against the freedom of speech.\n\n=== Girchi Brothel 'Pioneer' (2019) ===\nIn 2019, just one week before the mid-term parliamentary elections which Girchi participated in, Girchi opened a brothel in its headquarters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2019/1242|title=Georgian political party Girchi opens brothel in headquarters|website=Agenda.ge|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\nWith this act of civil disobedience Girchi addressed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GirchiParty/posts/2547060992012011|title=\u10d2\u10d8\u10e0\u10e9\u10d8 / Girchi|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> the arrest of 3 individuals on charges of promoting prostitution<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/4393_may_13_2019/4393_girchi.html|title=The Messenger - Georgia\u2019s Girchi party opens a brothel in its office|website=www.messenger.com.ge|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> and opposed relevant Georgian criminal legislation, that has become a source of arbitrary justice on many occasions in Georgia. As a result of such Government actions people who support themselves and their families through selling sexual services and who have not harmed anyone, are left without any financial means. They additionally suffer public reproach, since the social stigma associated with being a sex service provider is deeply rooted in Georgian society .\n\nGirchi believes that, whether to engage in any job/activity that does not involve elements of physical or psychological violence should be subject to the discretion of freely consenting adults. Following this line of reasoning, Girchi believes that prostitution is a fair and acceptable occupation.\n\nGirchi states that the only path towards ending this situation and, consequently, protecting people involved in the sex-industry from violence and abuse, coming mainly from the law enforcement agencies, is the legalisation of prostitution. According to Girchi the full legalisation would also benefit society at large through preventing the spread of AIDS/HIV among other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nWith this act of civil disobedience Girchi staff violated paragraph 3 of Article 254 of the Criminal Code of Georgia (Promotion of Prostitution) which states that:<blockquote>''Making available an area or dwelling place for prostitution committed jointly by more than one person shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of three to six years''</blockquote>\n\n=== Purchase of Bio Drugs ===\nThroughout years, Girchi has protested against current drug policies. One of the issues that Girchi continuously underlines is that existing prohibitions and punishments prescribed by legislation for drug-related offences, are of financial interest for some individuals \u2013 while it is very difficult to obtain cannabis, which grows wildly in almost all regions of Georgia, it is very easy to purchase other drugs of dubious origin and composition. These reach Georgia from abroad, having had to cross customs borders.\n\nTo illustrate this state of affairs, on February 24, 2017 Girchi undertook a so-called \u2018bio drug purchase\u2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://apmultimedianewsroom.com/multimedia-newsroom/buying-drugs-online-in-georgia|title=Buying drugs online in Georgia|last=Ltd|first=Online Solutions|website=AP Multimedia Newsroom|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>, shooting a video depicting all details of the process. It was completed in under an hour. The documentary was distributed to the public as well as media companies. The drugs obtained were then submitted to the police in accordance with relevant procedures. Through this act, Girchi intended to demonstrate how accessible bio-drugs are in Georgia, including for under-age citizens, and how false the claims by the Ministry of Internal Affairs - that the current repressive regime on narcotics has any positive effect \u2013 were.\n\n== Facts & Stats ==\n\n* More than 147 000 followers on Facebook<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GirchiParty/|title=\u10d2\u10d8\u10e0\u10e9\u10d8 / Girchi|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>;\n* 13 000 members of Closed Girchi Group or supporters on Facebook<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/NPCmemb/|title=\u10d2\u10d8\u10e0\u10e9\u10d8 {{!}} \u10ec\u10d4\u10d5\u10e0\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>;\n* The first political party in the world that started collecting funds in cryptocurrency.\n* Translated more than 200 educational videos;\n* With the support of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, translated all 10 parts of Milton Friedman's Free to Choose; \n* Made more than 40 videos on economic and political topics, using the infographics;\n* Participated in up to 2 000 TV programmes\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Christian Evangelical Protestant Biblical Freedom Church of Georgia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Georgian political parties}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Girchi}}\n[[Category:2015 establishments in Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Classical liberal parties]]\n[[Category:Liberal parties in Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Libertarian parties]]\n[[Category:Political parties established in 2015]]\n[[Category:Political parties in Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Pro-European political parties in Georgia (country)]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIdeology:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Political_Center_%E2%80%94_Girchi"}

Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal [[ferrule]].

First, beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade.

{"title_page": "Library and information science", "text_new": "'''Library and information science''' ('''LIS''') (sometimes given as the plural '''library and information sciences''')<ref name=\"eolis17\"/><ref name=\"dewey\"/> or \"'''library and information studies'''\"<ref name=\"canun\"/> is a merging of [[library science]] and [[information science]]. The joint term is associated with schools of library and information science (abbreviated to \"SLIS\"). In the last part of the 1960s, [[library school|schools of librarianship]], which generally developed from professional training programs (not academic disciplines) to university institutions during the second half of the 20th century, began to add the term \"information science\" to their names. The first school to do this was at the University of Pittsburgh in 1964.<ref name=\"dekeolis\"/> More schools followed during the 1970s and 1980s, and by the 1990s almost all library schools in the USA had added information science to their names.\nWeaver Press:\nAlthough there are exceptions, similar developments have taken place in other parts of the world. In Denmark, for example, the 'Royal School of Librarianship' changed its English name to [[The Royal School of Library and Information Science]] in 1997. Exceptions include Troms\u00f8, Norway, where the term [[documentation science]] is the preferred name of the field, France, where information science and communication studies form one [[interdiscipline]],<ref name=\"collec\"/> and Sweden, where the fields of [[Archival science]], [[Library science]] and [[Museology]] have been integrated as Archival, Library and Museum studies.\n\nIn spite of various trends to merge the two fields, some consider the two original disciplines, [[library science]] and [[information science]], to be separate.<ref name=\"Saracevic\"/><ref name=\"concept\"/> However, the tendency today is to use the terms as [[synonym]]s or to drop the term \"library\" and to speak about ''information departments'' or ''[[I-school]]s''.<ref name=\"duedu\"/> There have also been attempts to revive the concept of [[documentation]] and to speak of [[Library, information and documentation]] studies (or science).<ref>Rayward, W. B. (Ed.) (2004). Aware and responsible. Papers of the Nordic- International Colloquium on Social and Cultural Awareness and responsibility in Library, Information, and Documentation Studies (SCARLID). Lanham, MD:</ref>\n\n==Relations between library science, information science and LIS==\nTefko Saracevic (1992, p.&nbsp;13)<ref name=\"Saracevic\"/> argued that library science and information science are separate fields:\n\n{{quote|The common ground between library science and information science, which is a strong one, is in the sharing of their social role and in their general concern with the problems of effective utilization of graphic records. But there are also very significant differences in several critical respects, among them in: (1) selection of problems addressed and in the way they were defined; (2) theoretical questions asked and frameworks established;(3) the nature and degree of experimentation and empirical development and the resulting practical knowledge/competencies derived; (4) tools and approaches used; and (5) the nature and strength of interdisciplinary relations established and the dependence of the progress and evolution of interdisciplinary approaches. All of these differences warrant the conclusion that librarianship and information science are two different fields in a strong interdisciplinary relation, rather than one and the same field, or one being a special case of the other.}}\n\nAnother indication of the different uses of the two terms are the indexing in UMI's [[Dissertations Abstracts]]. In ''Dissertations Abstracts Online'' on November 2011 were 4888 dissertations indexed with the descriptor LIBRARY SCIENCE and 9053 with the descriptor INFORMATION SCIENCE. For the year 2009 the numbers were 104 LIBRARY SCIENCE and 514 INFORMATION SCIENCE. 891 dissertations were indexed with both terms (36 in 2009).\n\nIt should be considered that information science grew out of [[documentation science]] and therefore has a tradition for considering scientific and scholarly communication, [[bibliographic database]]s, subject knowledge and terminology etc. Library science, on the other hand has mostly concentrated on libraries and their internal processes and best practices. It is also relevant to consider that information science used to be done by scientists, while librarianship has been split between public libraries and scholarly research libraries. [[Library school]]s have mainly educated librarians for public libraries and not shown much interest in scientific communication and documentation. When information scientists from 1964 entered library schools, they brought with them competencies in relation to information retrieval in subject databases, including concepts such as recall and precision, boolean search techniques, query formulation and related issues. Subject bibliographic databases and citation indexes provided a major step forward in information dissemination - and also in the curriculum at library schools.\n\nJulian Warner (2010)<ref name=\"Warner\"/> suggests that the information and computer science tradition in [[information retrieval]] may broadly be characterized as '''query transformation''', with the query articulated verbally by the user in advance of searching and then transformed by a system into a set of records. From librarianship and indexing, on the other hand, has been an implicit stress on '''selection power''' enabling the user to make relevant selections.\n\n==Difficulties defining LIS==\n\"The question, 'What is library and information science?' does not elicit responses of the same internal conceptual coherence as similar inquiries as to the nature of other fields, e.g., 'What is chemistry?', 'What is economics?', 'What is medicine?' Each of those fields, though broad in scope, has clear ties to basic concerns of their field. [...] Neither LIS theory nor practice is perceived to be monolithic nor unified by a common literature or set of professional skills. Occasionally, LIS scholars (many of whom do not self-identify as members of an interreading LIS community, or prefer names other than LIS), attempt, but are unable, to find core concepts in common. Some believe that computing and internetworking concepts and skills underlie virtually every important aspect of LIS, indeed see LIS as a sub-field of computer science! [Footnote III.1] Others claim that LIS is principally a social science accompanied by practical skills such as ethnography and interviewing. Historically, traditions of public service, bibliography, documentalism, and information science have viewed their mission, their philosophical toolsets, and their domain of research differently. Still others deny the existence of a greater metropolitan LIS, viewing LIS instead as a loosely organized collection of specialized interests often unified by nothing more than their shared (and fought-over) use of the descriptor information. Indeed, claims occasionally arise to the effect that the field even has no theory of its own.\" (Konrad, 2007, p.&nbsp;652-653).\n\n=== A multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary or monodisciplinary field? ===\nThe Swedish researcher Emin Tengstr\u00f6m (1993)<ref>Tengstr\u00f6m, E. (1993). Biblioteks- och informationsvetenskapen - ett fler- eller tv\u00e4r-vetenskapligt omr\u00e5de? Svensk Biblioteksforskning,(1), 9-20.</ref> described [[cross-disciplinary]] research as a process, not a state or structure. He differentiates three levels of ambition regarding cross-disciplinary research:\n* The \"[[Pluridisciplinary]]\" or \"[[multidisciplinarity]]\" level\n* The genuine cross-disciplinary level: \"[[interdisciplinarity]]\"\n* The discipline-forming level \"[[transdisciplinarity]]\"\n\nWhat is described here is a view of social fields as dynamic and changing. Library and information science is viewed as a field that started as a multidisciplinary field based on literature, psychology, sociology, management, computer science etc., which is developing towards an [[academic discipline]] in its own right. However, the following quote seems to indicate that LIS is actually developing in the opposite direction:\n\nChua & Yang (2008)<ref name=\"amsocit\"/> studied papers published in ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' in the period 1988-1997 and found, among other things: \"Top authors have grown in diversity from those being affiliated predominantly with library/information-related departments to include those from information systems management, information technology, business, and the humanities. Amid heterogeneous clusters of collaboration among top authors, strongly connected crossdisciplinary\ncoauthor pairs have become more prevalent. Correspondingly, the distribution of top keywords\u2019 occurrences that leans heavily on core information science has shifted towards other subdisciplines such as information technology and sociobehavioral science.\"\n\nA more recent study revealed that 31% of the papers published in 31 LIS journals from 2007 through 2012 were by authors in academic departments of library and information science (i.e., those offering degree programs accredited by the [[American Library Association]] or similar professional organizations in other countries).  Faculty in departments of [[computer science]] (10%), [[management]] (10%), [[communication]] (3%), the other social sciences (9%), and the other natural sciences (7%) were also represented.  Nearly one-quarter of the papers in the 31 journals were by practicing librarians, and 6% were by others in non-academic (e.g., corporate) positions.<ref name=\"assist\"/>\n\nAs a field with its own body of interrelated concepts, techniques, journals, and professional associations, LIS is clearly a discipline. But by the nature of its subject matter and methods LIS is just as clearly an [[interdiscipline]], drawing on many adjacent fields (see below).\n\n=== A fragmented adhocracy ===\nRichard Whitley (1984,<ref name=\"fragst\"/> 2000)<ref name=\"intelorg\"/> classified scientific fields according to their intellectual and social organization and described management studies as a \u2018fragmented adhocracy\u2019, a field with a low level of coordination around a diffuse set of goals and a non-specialized terminology; but with strong connections to the practice in the business sector. \u00c5str\u00f6m (2006)<ref name=\"Astrom\"/> applied this conception to the description of LIS.\n\n=== Scattering of the literature ===\nMeho & Spurgin (2005)<ref name=\"amsist\"/> found that in a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 schools of library and information science, only 10 databases provided significant coverage of the LIS literature. Results also show that restricting the data sources to one, two, or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions. Because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the LIS literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes. Even when the nine most comprehensive databases in LIS was searched and combined, 27.0% (or 710 of 2,635) of the publications remain not found.\n{{quote|The study confirms earlier research that LIS literature is highly scattered and is not limited to standard LIS databases. What was not known or verified before, however, is that a significant amount of this literature is indexed in the interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary databases of Inside Conferences and INSPEC. Other interdisciplinary databases, such as America: History and Life, were also found to be very useful and complementary to traditional LIS databases, particularly in the areas of archives and library history. (Meho & Spurgin, 2005, p.1329).}}\n\n==The unique concern of library and information science==\n\"Concern for people becoming informed is not unique to LIS, and thus is insufficient to differentiate LIS from other fields. LIS are a part of a larger enterprise.\" (Konrad, 2007, p.&nbsp;655).<ref name=\"eschol\"/>\n\n\"The unique concern of LIS is recognized as: Statement of the core concern of LIS:\n'''Humans becoming informed (constructing meaning) via intermediation between inquirers and instrumented records'''. No other field has this as its concern. \" (Konrad, 2007, p.&nbsp;660)\n\n\"Note that the promiscuous term ''information'' does not appear in the above statement circumscribing the field's central concerns: The detrimental effects of the ambiguity this term provokes are discussed above (Part III). Furner [Furner 2004, 427] has shown that discourse in the field is improved where specific terms are utilized in place of the i-word for specific senses of that term.\" (Konrad, 2007, p.&nbsp;661).\n\nMichael Buckland wrote: \"Educational programs in library, information and documentation are concerned with what people know, are not limited to technology, and require wide-ranging expertise. They differ fundamentally and importantly from computer science programs and from the information systems programs found in business schools.\".<ref name=\"scarlid\"/>\n\nBawden and Robinson argue that while Information Science has overlaps with numerous other disciplines with interest in studying communication, it is unique in that it is concerned with all aspects of the communication chain.<ref name = \"Bawden\"/>{{rp|6,8}}  For example Computer Science may be interested in the indexing and retrieval, sociology with user studies, and publishing (business) with dissemination, whereas information science is interested in the study of all of these individual areas and the interactions between them.<ref name=\"Bawden\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nThe organization of information and information resources is one of the fundamental aspects of LIS.<ref name=\"Bawden\"/>{{rp|106}} and is an example of both LIS's uniqueness and its multidisciplinary origins.  Some of the main tools used by LIS toward this end to provide access to the digital resources of modern times (particularly theory relating to indexing and classification) originated in 19th century to assist humanity's effort to make its intellectual output accessible by recording, identifying, and providing bibliographic control of printed knowledge.<ref name=\"Bawden\"/>{{rp|105}}  The origin for some of these tools were even earlier. For example, in the 17th century, during the [[History of libraries#Enlightenment era libraries|'golden age of libraries']], publishers and sellers seeking to take advantage of the burgeoning book trade developed descriptive catalogs of their wares for distribution \u2013 a practice was adopted and further extrapolated by many libraries of the time to cover areas like philosophy, sciences, linguistics, medicine, etc.<ref name=\"libhist\"/> {{rp|120}}  In this way, a business concern of publishers \u2013 keeping track of and advertising inventory \u2013 was developed into a system for organizing and preserving information by the library.\n\nThe development of [[Metadata]] is another area that exemplifies the aim of LIS to be something more than an mishmash of several disciplines \u2013 that uniqueness Bawden and Robinson describe.  Pre-Internet classification systems and [[cataloging]] systems were mainly concerned with two objectives: 1. to provide rich bibliographic descriptions and relations between information objects and 2. to facilitate sharing of this bibliographic information across library boundaries.<ref name = \"Qin\"/>  {{rp|14}}  The development of the Internet and the information explosion that followed found many communities needing mechanisms for the description, authentication and management of their information.<ref name = \"Qin\"/>{{rp|15}}  These communities developed taxonomies and controlled vocabularies to describe their knowledge as well as unique information architectures to communicate these classifications and libraries found themselves as liaison or translator between these metadata systems.<ref name = \"Qin\"/>{{rp|15\u201316}}  Of course the concerns of cataloging in the Internet era have gone beyond simple bibliographic descriptions.  The need for descriptive information about the ownership and copyright of a digital product \u2013 a publishing concern \u2013 and description for the different formats and accessibility features of a resource \u2013 a sociological concern \u2013 show the continued development and cross discipline necessity of resource description.<ref name = \"Qin\"/>{{rp|15}}\n\n==LIS theories==\nJulian Warner (2010, p.&nbsp;4-5)<ref name=\"Warner\"/> suggests that\n\n{{quote|Two paradigms, the cognitive and the physical, have been distinguished in information retrieval research, but they share the assumption of the value of delivering relevant records (Ellis 1984, 19;<ref name=\"ellis84\"/> Belkin and Vickery 1985, 114<ref name=\"blrep\"/>). For the purpose of discussion here, they can be considered a single heterogeneous paradigm, linked but not united by this common assumption. The value placed on query transformation is dissonant with common practice, where users may prefer to explore an area and may value fully informed exploration. Some dissenting research discussions have been more congruent with practice, advocating explorative capability - the ability to explore and make discriminations between representations of objects - as the fundamental design principle for information retrieval systems.}}\n\nThe domain analytic approach (e.g., Hj\u00f8rland 2010<ref name=\"conrel\"/>) suggests that the relevant criteria for making discriminations in information retrieval are scientific and scholarly criteria. In some fields (e.g. evidence-based medicine)<ref name=\"philsci\"/> the relevant distinctions are very explicit. In other cases they are implicit or unclear. At the basic level, the relevance of bibliographical records are determined by epistemological criteria of what constitutes knowledge.\n\nAmong other approaches, [[Evidence Based Library and Information Practice]] should also be mentioned.\n\n==Journals==\n(see also [[List of LIS Journals in India]] page,  ''[[:Category:Library science journals]]'' and [[Journal Citation Reports]] for listing according to [[Impact factor]])\n\nSome core journals in LIS are:\n\n* [[Annual Review of Information Science and Technology]] (ARIST) (1966\u20132011)\n* [[El Profesional de la Informaci\u00f3n]] [[:es:El Profesional de la Informaci\u00f3n|(es)]] (EPI) (1992-) (Formerly Information World en Espa\u00f1ol) \n* [[Information Processing and Management]]\n* [[Information Research: An international electronic journal]] (IR) (1995-)\n* [[Italian Journal of Library and Information Studies]] (JLIS.it)\n* [[Journal of Documentation]] (JDoc) (1945-)\n* [[Journal of Information Science]] (JIS) (1979-)\n* [[Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology]] (Formerly [[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]) (JASIST) (1950-)\n* [[Knowledge Organization (journal)]]\n* [[The Library Quarterly]]  (LQ) (1931-)\n* [[Library Trends]] (1952-)\n* [[Scientometrics (journal)]] (1978-)\n* [https://www.ebscohost.com/academic/library-literature-information-science-retrospective Library Literature and Information Science Retrospective] (1901-1983)\n\nImportant bibliographical databases in LIS are, among others, [[Social Sciences Citation Index]] and [[Library and Information Science Abstracts]]\n\n==Conferences==\nThis is a list of some of the major conferences in the field.\n\n* Annual meeting of the [[American Society for Information Science and Technology]]\n* [[Conceptions of Library and Information Science]]\n* [[i-School]]s' \"iConferences\n* ISIC - the Information Behaviour Conference https://web.archive.org/web/20120714152856/http://informationr.net/isic/index.html\n* The [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA): World Library and Information Congress, https://web.archive.org/web/20150706164140/http://conference.ifla.org/\n* The international conferences of the [[International Society for Knowledge Organization]] (ISKO),  http://www.isko.org/events.html\n\n==Common subfields==\n{{Information science}}\nAn advertisement for a full Professor in information science at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, spring 2011, provides one view of which subdisciplines are well-established:<ref name=\"staten\"/> \"The research and teaching/supervision must be within some (and at least one) of these well-established information science areas\n* a.\t[[Knowledge organization]]\n* b.\t[[Library studies]]\n* c.\t[[Information architecture]]\n* d.\t[[Information behavior]]\n* e.\tInteractive [[information retrieval]]\n* f.\t[[Information systems]]\n* g.\t[[Scholarly communication]]\n* h.\t[[Digital literacy]] (cf [[information literacy]])\n* i.\t[[Bibliometrics]] or [[scientometrics]]\n* j.\t[[Interaction design]] and [[user experience]]\"\n* k.

The joint term is associated with schools of library and information science (abbreviated to \"SLIS\"). In the last part of the 1960s, [[library school|schools of librarianship]], which generally developed from professional training programs (not academic disciplines) to university institutions during the second half of the 20th century, began to add the term \"information science\" to their names. The first school to do this was at the University of Pittsburgh in 1964.<ref name=\"dekeolis\"/> More schools followed during the 1970s and 1980s, and by the 1990s almost all library schools in the USA had added information science to their names.\nWeaver Press:\nAlthough there are exceptions, similar developments have taken place in other parts of the world. In Denmark, for example, the 'Royal School of Librarianship' changed its English name to [[The Royal School of Library and Information Science]] in 1997. Exceptions include Troms\u00f8, Norway, where the term [[documentation science]] is the preferred name of the field, France, where information science and communication studies form one [[interdiscipline]],<ref name=\"collec\"/> and Sweden, where the fields of [[Archival science]], [[Library science]] and [[Museology]] have been integrated as Archival, Library and Museum studies.\n\nIn spite of various trends to merge the two fields, some consider the two original disciplines, [[library science]] and [[information science]], to be separate.<ref name=\"Saracevic\"/><ref name=\"concept\"/> However, the tendency today is to use the terms as [[synonym]]s or to drop the term \"library\" and to speak about ''information departments'' or ''[[I-school]]s''.<ref name=\"duedu\"/> There have also been attempts to revive the concept of [[documentation]] and to speak of [[Library, information and documentation]] studies (or science).<ref>Rayward, W. B. (Ed.) (2004). Aware and responsible. Papers of the Nordic- International Colloquium on Social and Cultural Awareness and responsibility in Library, Information, and Documentation Studies (SCARLID). Lanham, MD:</ref>\n\n==Relations between library science, information science and LIS==\nTefko Saracevic (1992, p.&nbsp;13)<ref name=\"Saracevic\"/> argued that library science and information science are separate fields:\n\n{{quote|The common ground between library science and information science, which is a strong one, is in the sharing of their social role and in their general concern with the problems of effective utilization of graphic records. But there are also very significant differences in several critical respects, among them in: (1) selection of problems addressed and in the way they were defined; (2) theoretical questions asked and frameworks established;(3) the nature and degree of experimentation and empirical development and the resulting practical knowledge/competencies derived; (4) tools and approaches used; and (5) the nature and strength of interdisciplinary relations established and the dependence of the progress and evolution of interdisciplinary approaches. All of these differences warrant the conclusion that librarianship and information science are two different fields in a strong interdisciplinary relation, rather than one and the same field, or one being a special case of the other.}}\n\nAnother indication of the different uses of the two terms are the indexing in UMI's [[Dissertations Abstracts]]. In ''Dissertations Abstracts Online'' on November 2011 were 4888 dissertations indexed with the descriptor LIBRARY SCIENCE and 9053 with the descriptor INFORMATION SCIENCE. For the year 2009 the numbers were 104 LIBRARY SCIENCE and 514 INFORMATION SCIENCE. 891 dissertations were indexed with both terms (36 in 2009).\n\nIt should be considered that information science grew out of [[documentation science]] and therefore has a tradition for considering scientific and scholarly communication, [[bibliographic database]]s, subject knowledge and terminology etc. Library science, on the other hand has mostly concentrated on libraries and their internal processes and best practices. It is also relevant to consider that information science used to be done by scientists, while librarianship has been split between public libraries and scholarly research libraries. [[Library school]]s have mainly educated librarians for public libraries and not shown much interest in scientific communication and documentation. When information scientists from 1964 entered library schools, they brought with them competencies in relation to information retrieval in subject databases, including concepts such as recall and precision, boolean search techniques, query formulation and related issues. Subject bibliographic databases and citation indexes provided a major step forward in information dissemination - and also in the curriculum at library schools.\n\nJulian Warner (2010)<ref name=\"Warner\"/> suggests that the information and computer science tradition in [[information retrieval]] may broadly be characterized as '''query transformation''', with the query articulated verbally by the user in advance of searching and then transformed by a system into a set of records. From librarianship and indexing, on the other hand, has been an implicit stress on '''selection power''' enabling the user to make relevant selections.\n\n==Difficulties defining LIS==\n\"The question, 'What is library and information science?' does not elicit responses of the same internal conceptual coherence as similar inquiries as to the nature of other fields, e.g., 'What is chemistry?', 'What is economics?', 'What is medicine?' Each of those fields, though broad in scope, has clear ties to basic concerns of their field. [...] Neither LIS theory nor practice is perceived to be monolithic nor unified by a common literature or set of professional skills. Occasionally, LIS scholars (many of whom do not self-identify as members of an interreading LIS community, or prefer names other than LIS), attempt, but are unable, to find core concepts in common. Some believe that computing and internetworking concepts and skills underlie virtually every important aspect of LIS, indeed see LIS as a sub-field of computer science! [Footnote III.1] Others claim that LIS is principally a social science accompanied by practical skills such as ethnography and interviewing. Historically, traditions of public service, bibliography, documentalism, and information science have viewed their mission, their philosophical toolsets, and their domain of research differently. Still others deny the existence of a greater metropolitan LIS, viewing LIS instead as a loosely organized collection of specialized interests often unified by nothing more than their shared (and fought-over) use of the descriptor information. Indeed, claims occasionally arise to the effect that the field even has no theory of its own.\" (Konrad, 2007, p.&nbsp;652-653).\n\n=== A multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary or monodisciplinary field? ===\nThe Swedish researcher Emin Tengstr\u00f6m (1993)<ref>Tengstr\u00f6m, E. (1993). Biblioteks- och informationsvetenskapen - ett fler- eller tv\u00e4r-vetenskapligt omr\u00e5de? Svensk Biblioteksforskning,(1), 9-20.</ref> described [[cross-disciplinary]] research as a process, not a state or structure. He differentiates three levels of ambition regarding cross-disciplinary research:\n* The \"[[Pluridisciplinary]]\" or \"[[multidisciplinarity]]\" level\n* The genuine cross-disciplinary level: \"[[interdisciplinarity]]\"\n* The discipline-forming level \"[[transdisciplinarity]]\"\n\nWhat is described here is a view of social fields as dynamic and changing. Library and information science is viewed as a field that started as a multidisciplinary field based on literature, psychology, sociology, management, computer science etc., which is developing towards an [[academic discipline]] in its own right. However, the following quote seems to indicate that LIS is actually developing in the opposite direction:\n\nChua & Yang (2008)<ref name=\"amsocit\"/> studied papers published in ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' in the period 1988-1997 and found, among other things: \"Top authors have grown in diversity from those being affiliated predominantly with library/information-related departments to include those from information systems management, information technology, business, and the humanities. Amid heterogeneous clusters of collaboration among top authors, strongly connected crossdisciplinary\ncoauthor pairs have become more prevalent. Correspondingly, the distribution of top keywords\u2019 occurrences that leans heavily on core information science has shifted towards other subdisciplines such as information technology and sociobehavioral science.\"\n\nA more recent study revealed that 31% of the papers published in 31 LIS journals from 2007 through 2012 were by authors in academic departments of library and information science (i.e., those offering degree programs accredited by the [[American Library Association]] or similar professional organizations in other countries).  Faculty in departments of [[computer science]] (10%), [[management]] (10%), [[communication]] (3%), the other social sciences (9%), and the other natural sciences (7%) were also represented.  Nearly one-quarter of the papers in the 31 journals were by practicing librarians, and 6% were by others in non-academic (e.g., corporate) positions.<ref name=\"assist\"/>\n\nAs a field with its own body of interrelated concepts, techniques, journals, and professional associations, LIS is clearly a discipline. But by the nature of its subject matter and methods LIS is just as clearly an [[interdiscipline]], drawing on many adjacent fields (see below).\n\n=== A fragmented adhocracy ===\nRichard Whitley (1984,<ref name=\"fragst\"/> 2000)<ref name=\"intelorg\"/> classified scientific fields according to their intellectual and social organization and described management studies as a \u2018fragmented adhocracy\u2019, a field with a low level of coordination around a diffuse set of goals and a non-specialized terminology; but with strong connections to the practice in the business sector. \u00c5str\u00f6m (2006)<ref name=\"Astrom\"/> applied this conception to the description of LIS.\n\n=== Scattering of the literature ===\nMeho & Spurgin (2005)<ref name=\"amsist\"/> found that in a list of 2,625 items published between 1982 and 2002 by 68 faculty members of 18 schools of library and information science, only 10 databases provided significant coverage of the LIS literature. Results also show that restricting the data sources to one, two, or even three databases leads to inaccurate rankings and erroneous conclusions. Because no database provides comprehensive coverage of the LIS literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking and other research purposes. Even when the nine most comprehensive databases in LIS was searched and combined, 27.0% (or 710 of 2,635) of the publications remain not found.\n{{quote|The study confirms earlier research that LIS literature is highly scattered and is not limited to standard LIS databases. What was not known or verified before, however, is that a significant amount of this literature is indexed in the interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary databases of Inside Conferences and INSPEC. Other interdisciplinary databases, such as America: History and Life, were also found to be very useful and complementary to traditional LIS databases, particularly in the areas of archives and library history. (Meho & Spurgin, 2005, p.1329).}}\n\n==The unique concern of library and information science==\n\"Concern for people becoming informed is not unique to LIS, and thus is insufficient to differentiate LIS from other fields. LIS are a part of a larger enterprise.\" (Konrad, 2007, p.&nbsp;655).<ref name=\"eschol\"/>\n\n\"The unique concern of LIS is recognized as: Statement of the core concern of LIS:\n'''Humans becoming informed (constructing meaning) via intermediation between inquirers and instrumented records'''. No other field has this as its concern. \" (Konrad, 2007, p.&nbsp;660)\n\n\"Note that the promiscuous term ''information'' does not appear in the above statement circumscribing the field's central concerns: The detrimental effects of the ambiguity this term provokes are discussed above (Part III). Furner [Furner 2004, 427] has shown that discourse in the field is improved where specific terms are utilized in place of the i-word for specific senses of that term.\" (Konrad, 2007, p.&nbsp;661).\n\nMichael Buckland wrote: \"Educational programs in library, information and documentation are concerned with what people know, are not limited to technology, and require wide-ranging expertise. They differ fundamentally and importantly from computer science programs and from the information systems programs found in business schools.\".<ref name=\"scarlid\"/>\n\nBawden and Robinson argue that while Information Science has overlaps with numerous other disciplines with interest in studying communication, it is unique in that it is concerned with all aspects of the communication chain.<ref name = \"Bawden\"/>{{rp|6,8}}  For example Computer Science may be interested in the indexing and retrieval, sociology with user studies, and publishing (business) with dissemination, whereas information science is interested in the study of all of these individual areas and the interactions between them.<ref name=\"Bawden\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nThe organization of information and information resources is one of the fundamental aspects of LIS.<ref name=\"Bawden\"/>{{rp|106}} and is an example of both LIS's uniqueness and its multidisciplinary origins.  Some of the main tools used by LIS toward this end to provide access to the digital resources of modern times (particularly theory relating to indexing and classification) originated in 19th century to assist humanity's effort to make its intellectual output accessible by recording, identifying, and providing bibliographic control of printed knowledge.<ref name=\"Bawden\"/>{{rp|105}}  The origin for some of these tools were even earlier. For example, in the 17th century, during the [[History of libraries#Enlightenment era libraries|'golden age of libraries']], publishers and sellers seeking to take advantage of the burgeoning book trade developed descriptive catalogs of their wares for distribution \u2013 a practice was adopted and further extrapolated by many libraries of the time to cover areas like philosophy, sciences, linguistics, medicine, etc.<ref name=\"libhist\"/> {{rp|120}}  In this way, a business concern of publishers \u2013 keeping track of and advertising inventory \u2013 was developed into a system for organizing and preserving information by the library.\n\nThe development of [[Metadata]] is another area that exemplifies the aim of LIS to be something more than an mishmash of several disciplines \u2013 that uniqueness Bawden and Robinson describe.  Pre-Internet classification systems and [[cataloging]] systems were mainly concerned with two objectives: 1. to provide rich bibliographic descriptions and relations between information objects and 2. to facilitate sharing of this bibliographic information across library boundaries.<ref name = \"Qin\"/>  {{rp|14}}  The development of the Internet and the information explosion that followed found many communities needing mechanisms for the description, authentication and management of their information.<ref name = \"Qin\"/>{{rp|15}}  These communities developed taxonomies and controlled vocabularies to describe their knowledge as well as unique information architectures to communicate these classifications and libraries found themselves as liaison or translator between these metadata systems.<ref name = \"Qin\"/>{{rp|15\u201316}}  Of course the concerns of cataloging in the Internet era have gone beyond simple bibliographic descriptions.  The need for descriptive information about the ownership and copyright of a digital product \u2013 a publishing concern \u2013 and description for the different formats and accessibility features of a resource \u2013 a sociological concern \u2013 show the continued development and cross discipline necessity of resource description.<ref name = \"Qin\"/>{{rp|15}}\n\n==LIS theories==\nJulian Warner (2010, p.&nbsp;4-5)<ref name=\"Warner\"/> suggests that\n\n{{quote|Two paradigms, the cognitive and the physical, have been distinguished in information retrieval research, but they share the assumption of the value of delivering relevant records (Ellis 1984, 19;<ref name=\"ellis84\"/> Belkin and Vickery 1985, 114<ref name=\"blrep\"/>). For the purpose of discussion here, they can be considered a single heterogeneous paradigm, linked but not united by this common assumption. The value placed on query transformation is dissonant with common practice, where users may prefer to explore an area and may value fully informed exploration. Some dissenting research discussions have been more congruent with practice, advocating explorative capability - the ability to explore and make discriminations between representations of objects - as the fundamental design principle for information retrieval systems.}}\n\nThe domain analytic approach (e.g., Hj\u00f8rland 2010<ref name=\"conrel\"/>) suggests that the relevant criteria for making discriminations in information retrieval are scientific and scholarly criteria. In some fields (e.g. evidence-based medicine)<ref name=\"philsci\"/> the relevant distinctions are very explicit. In other cases they are implicit or unclear. At the basic level, the relevance of bibliographical records are determined by epistemological criteria of what constitutes knowledge.\n\nAmong other approaches, [[Evidence Based Library and Information Practice]] should also be mentioned.\n\n==Journals==\n(see also [[List of LIS Journals in India]] page,  ''[[:Category:Library science journals]]'' and [[Journal Citation Reports]] for listing according to [[Impact factor]])\n\nSome core journals in LIS are:\n\n* [[Annual Review of Information Science and Technology]] (ARIST) (1966\u20132011)\n* [[El Profesional de la Informaci\u00f3n]] [[:es:El Profesional de la Informaci\u00f3n|(es)]] (EPI) (1992-) (Formerly Information World en Espa\u00f1ol) \n* [[Information Processing and Management]]\n* [[Information Research: An international electronic journal]] (IR) (1995-)\n* [[Italian Journal of Library and Information Studies]] (JLIS.it)\n* [[Journal of Documentation]] (JDoc) (1945-)\n* [[Journal of Information Science]] (JIS) (1979-)\n* [[Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology]] (Formerly [[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]) (JASIST) (1950-)\n* [[Knowledge Organization (journal)]]\n* [[The Library Quarterly]]  (LQ) (1931-)\n* [[Library Trends]] (1952-)\n* [[Scientometrics (journal)]] (1978-)\n* [https://www.ebscohost.com/academic/library-literature-information-science-retrospective Library Literature and Information Science Retrospective] (1901-1983)\n\nImportant bibliographical databases in LIS are, among others, [[Social Sciences Citation Index]] and [[Library and Information Science Abstracts]]\n\n==Conferences==\nThis is a list of some of the major conferences in the field.\n\n* Annual meeting of the [[American Society for Information Science and Technology]]\n* [[Conceptions of Library and Information Science]]\n* [[i-School]]s' \"iConferences\n* ISIC - the Information Behaviour Conference https://web.archive.org/web/20120714152856/http://informationr.net/isic/index.html\n* The [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA): World Library and Information Congress, https://web.archive.org/web/20150706164140/http://conference.ifla.org/\n* The international conferences of the [[International Society for Knowledge Organization]] (ISKO),  http://www.isko.org/events.html\n\n==Common subfields==\n{{Information science}}\nAn advertisement for a full Professor in information science at the Royal School of Library and Information Science, spring 2011, provides one view of which subdisciplines are well-established:<ref name=\"staten\"/> \"The research and teaching/supervision must be within some (and at least one) of these well-established information science areas\n* a.\t[[Knowledge organization]]\n* b.\t[[Library studies]]\n* c.\t[[Information architecture]]\n* d.\t[[Information behavior]]\n* e.\tInteractive [[information retrieval]]\n* f.\t[[Information systems]]\n* g.\t[[Scholarly communication]]\n* h.\t[[Digital literacy]] (cf [[information literacy]])\n* i.\t[[Bibliometrics]] or [[scientometrics]]\n* j.\t[[Interaction design]] and [[user experience]]\"\n* k.   [[Digital library]]\n\nThere are other ways to identify subfields within LIS, for example bibliometric mapping and comparative studies of curricula.\nBibliometric maps of LIS have been produced by, among others, Vickery & Vickery (1987, frontispiece),<ref name=\"istp\"/> White & McCain (1998),<ref name=\"jouram\"/> \u00c5str\u00f6m (2002),<ref name=\"visual\"/> 2006) and Hassan-Montero & Herrero-Solana (2007).<ref name=\"visual22\"/> \nAn example of a curriculum study is Kajberg & L\u00f8rring, 2005.<ref name=\"eurcur\"/> In this publication are the following data reported (p 234):\n\"Degree of overlap of the ten curricular themes with subject areas in the current curricula of responding LIS schools\n* [[Information seeking]] and [[Information retrieval]] 100%\n* [[Library management]] and promotion 96%\n* [[Knowledge management]] 86%\n* [[Knowledge organization]] 82%\n* [[Information literacy]] and learning 76%\n* Library and society in a historical perspective ([[Library history]]) 66%\n*  The [[Information society]]: Barriers to the [[free access to information]] 64%\n* [[Cultural heritage]] and digitisation of the cultural heritage ([[Digital preservation]]) 62%\n* The library in the multi-cultural information society: International and intercultural communication 42%\n* Mediation of culture in a special European context 26% \"\n\nThere is often an overlap between these subfields of LIS and other fields of study. Most information retrieval research, for example, belongs to computer science. Knowledge management is considered a subfield of management or organizational studies.<ref name=\"ieos\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Archival science]]\n* [[Authority control]]\n* [[Bibliography]]\n* [[Digital Asset Management]] (DAM)\n* [[Documentation science]]\n* [[Education for librarianship]]\n* [[Glossary of library and information science]]\n* [[I-school]]\n* [[Information history]]\n* [[Information systems]]\n* [[Knowledge management]]\n* [[Library and information scientist]]\n* [[Metadata]]\n* [[Museology]]\n* [[Museum informatics]]\n* [[Records Management]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"eolis17\">Bates, M.J. and Maack, M.N.

Similarly, Guttmann and Dopart (2011) found that when a subject wearing earplugs yawns, the air moving between the subject's ear and the environment causes a breeze to be heard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enn.com/health/article/43278/print |title=Global Health and Wellness News: Yawn! |publisher=Enn.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref> Guttmann and Dopart determined that a yawn causes one of three possible situations to occur: the brain cools down due to an influx or outflux of oxygen; pressure in the brain is reduced by an outflux of oxygen; or the pressure of the brain is increased by an influx of air caused by increased cranial space.\n\nStill another hypothesis suggests yawns are caused by the same neurotransmitters that affect [[emotion]]s, [[mood (psychology)|mood]], [[appetite]], and other phenomena. These chemicals include [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[glutamic acid]], and [[nitric oxide]]. As more (or fewer) of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of [[opioid]] [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[endorphin]]s, reduces the frequency of yawning. Individuals in [[Drug withdrawal|opioid withdrawal]] exhibit a greatly increased frequency of yawning, and patients taking the selective [[serotonin]] reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Paxil ([[paroxetine]] HCl) or Celexa ([[citalopram]]) have been observed yawning more often.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Excessive yawning is more common during the first three months of taking SSRIs. Anecdotal reports by users of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] often describe a marked stimulation of yawning while inebriated, often associated with excess [[tears|lacrimation]] (eyes producing tears) and nasal mucosal stimulation, especially while \"peaking\" (undergoing the most intense portion of the [[psilocybin]] experience). While [[opioid]]s have been demonstrated to reduce this yawning and lacrimation provoked by psilocybin,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} it is not clear that the same pathways that induce yawning as a symptom of opioid abstinence in habituated users are the mode of action in yawning in mushroom users.

This creates a rumbling noise perceived as coming from within the head; however, the noise is due to mechanical disturbance of the hearing apparatus and is not generated by the motion of air.

Similarly, Guttmann and Dopart (2011) found that when a subject wearing earplugs yawns, the air moving between the subject's ear and the environment causes a breeze to be heard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enn.com/health/article/43278/print |title=Global Health and Wellness News: Yawn! |publisher=Enn.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2014-03-02}}</ref> Guttmann and Dopart determined that a yawn causes one of three possible situations to occur: the brain cools down due to an influx or outflux of oxygen; pressure in the brain is reduced by an outflux of oxygen; or the pressure of the brain is increased by an influx of air caused by increased cranial space.\n\nStill another hypothesis suggests yawns are caused by the same neurotransmitters that affect [[emotion]]s, [[mood (psychology)|mood]], [[appetite]], and other phenomena. These chemicals include [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[glutamic acid]], and [[nitric oxide]]. As more (or fewer) of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of [[opioid]] [[neurotransmitter]]s such as [[endorphin]]s, reduces the frequency of yawning. Individuals in [[Drug withdrawal|opioid withdrawal]] exhibit a greatly increased frequency of yawning, and patients taking the selective [[serotonin]] reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Paxil ([[paroxetine]] HCl) or Celexa ([[citalopram]]) have been observed yawning more often.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Excessive yawning is more common during the first three months of taking SSRIs. Anecdotal reports by users of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] often describe a marked stimulation of yawning while inebriated, often associated with excess [[tears|lacrimation]] (eyes producing tears) and nasal mucosal stimulation, especially while \"peaking\" (undergoing the most intense portion of the [[psilocybin]] experience). While [[opioid]]s have been demonstrated to reduce this yawning and lacrimation provoked by psilocybin,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} it is not clear that the same pathways that induce yawning as a symptom of opioid abstinence in habituated users are the mode of action in yawning in mushroom users. While even opioid-dependent users of psilocybin on stable opioid therapy often report yawning and excess lacrimation while undergoing this [[entheogen]]ic mushroom experience, there are no reports on mushrooms in the literature regarding habituated users{{clarify|date=July 2012}} experiencing other typical opioid withdrawal symptoms, such as cramping, physical pain, anxiety, gooseflesh, etc.\n\nYawning behavior may be altered as a result of medical issues such as diabetes,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00429.2006 |title=Lack of central nitric oxide triggers erectile dysfunction in diabetes |year=2006 |last1=Zheng |first1=Hong |last2=Bidasee |first2=Keshore R. |last3=Mayhan |first3=William G. |last4=Patel |first4=Kaushik P. |journal=AJP: Regulatory, Integrative and Comparative Physiology |volume=292 |issue=3 |pmid=17095652 |pages=R1158\u201364}}</ref> stroke,<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Jones |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/steve-jones/6583820/Yawning-is-part-of-what-makes-us-human.html |title=Telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-20}}</ref> or adrenal conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2004.02.013 |title=Adrenalectomy and dexamethasone replacement on yawning behavior |year=2004 |last1=An\u00edas-Calder\u00f3n |first1=Jos\u00e9 |last2=Verdugo-D\u00edaz |first2=Leticia |last3=Drucker-Col\u00edn |first3=Ren\u00e9 |journal=Behavioural Brain Research |volume=154 |pages=255\u20139 |pmid=15302132 |issue=1}}</ref> Excessive yawning is seen in immunosuppressed patients such as those with multiple sclerosis <ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.msard.2018.04.019 |title=Yawning and cortisol levels in multiple sclerosis: potential new diagnostic tool |year=2018 |last1=Thompson |first1=S.B.N. |last2=Coleman |first2=A. |last3=Williams |first3=N. |journal=Multiple Sclerosis & Related Disorders |volume=23 |pages=51\u20135|pmid=29772467 }}</ref>.

It has been studied in [[Canidae]] species, such as the domestic dog and wolf. Domestic dogs have shown the ability to yawn contagiously in response to human yawns. Domestic dogs have demonstrated they are skilled at reading human communication behaviours. This ability makes it difficult to ascertain whether yawn contagion among domestic dogs is deeply rooted in their evolutionary history or is a result of domestication. \nIn a 2014 study, wolves were observed in an effort to answer this question. The results of the study showed that wolves are capable of yawn contagion.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Romero T. |author2=Ito M. |author3=Saito A. |author4=Hasegawa T. | year = 2014 | title = Social Modulation of Contagious Yawning in Wolves | url = | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 8| page = e105963 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0105963|pmid=25162677 |pmc=4146576 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...9j5963R }}</ref> This study also found that the social bond strength between individuals affected the frequency of contagious yawning in wolves, supporting previous research which ties contagious yawning to emotional proximity.\n\nSome evidence for contagious yawning has also been found in budgerigars (''Melopsittacus undulatus''), a species of social parrots.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gallup |first1=A |last2=Swartwood |first2=L |last3=Militello |first3=J |last4=Sackett |first4=S |title=Experimental evidence of contagious yawning in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus). |journal=Animal Cognition |date=2015 |volume=18|issue=5 |pages=1051\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0873-1 |pmid=26012708 }}</ref> This indicates that contagious yawning may have evolved several times in different lineages. In budgerigars, contagious yawning does not seem to be related to social closeness.\n\nIn certain neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, the patient has an impaired ability to infer the mental states of others. In such cases, yawn contagion can be used to evaluate their ability to infer or empathize with others. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder which severely affects social and communicative development, including empathy. The results of various studies have showed a diminished susceptibility to contagious yawn compared to the control group of typically-developing children.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Helt M.
