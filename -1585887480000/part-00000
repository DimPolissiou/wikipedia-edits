Thunder-stones were preserved in family life as important [[cult object]]s. It was believed that bringing them inside the house could bring [[good fortune]], prosperity and progress in people, in livestock and in agriculture, or that rifle bullets would not hit the owners of the thunder-stones.{{sfn|Tirta|2004|pp=82, 406}} A common practice was to hung a thunder-stone pendant on the body of the cattle or on the pregnant woman for good luck and to contrast the [[evil eye]].{{sfn|Tirta|2004|p=101}}\n\nIn [[Albanian culture]], the heaviest type of [[Oath|oath swearing]] ([[Albanian language|Alb.]] ''[[Besa (Albanian culture)|beja]] m\u00eb e r\u00ebnd\u00eb'') is taken by a thunder-stone \"which comes from the sky\" (''beja me gur/kok\u00ebrr reje/rrufeje q\u00eb vjen nga per\u00ebndia''). It was a very serious oath and people were afraid of it even though they were telling the truth.{{sfn|Tirta|2004|p=101}} The act of absolving himself of any allegation of theft was performed in the following way: the thunder-stone was taken in the left hand and was touched by the right hand saying:{{sfn|Tirta|2004|p=102}}\n{{Verse translation|lang=sq|P\u00ebr k\u00ebt\u00eb kok\u00ebrr rejet, nuk ta kam vjedh\u00eb as un\u00eb, as kush i shpis\u00eb sime e nuk e di se kush ta ka vjedh\u00eb! N\u00eb t\u00eb rrejsha, reja m\u00eb gjoft\u00eb!|I swear by this thunder-stone that I have not stolen it, nor anyone of my house and I don't know who stole it! If I lied to you, cloud strike me!}}\n\n=== Rainmaking ===\nPer\u00ebndi is especially [[Invocation|invoked]] by [[Albanians]] in [[incantation]]s and [[Rainmaking (ritual)|songs praying for rain]].{{sfn|Gamkrelidze|1995|p=528}} [[Rituals]] were performed in times of summer drought to make it rain, usually in June and July, but sometimes also in the spring months when there was severe drought. In different Albanian regions, for rainmaking purpose, people threw water upwards to make it subsequently fall to the ground in the form of rain. This was an imitative type of [[Incantation|magic practice]] with ritual songs.{{sfn|Tirta|2004|p=310}} \n\nIn [[Nowruz]] or in the Albanian [[Spring Day]] (''[[Dita e Ver\u00ebs]]''), in particular, in some villages of the region of [[Kurvelesh (region)|Kurvelesh]] in southern [[Albania]] people addressed the following prayer to the deity for plants and cattle:{{sfn|Tirta|2004|p=308}}\n{{Verse translation|lang=sq|O ''per\u00ebndi'', nepna shi n\u00eb v\u00ebrri!<br>T\u00eb b\u00ebhet misri dhe shelegu me bri!|Oh 'sky', give us rain on winter pastures!<br>So that corn and lamb will become horned!}}\n\nThe following is a hetero-homometric ritual song for rainmaking which includes also the figure of [[Dodola|Peperona]] (or ''Rona'', in other cases also ''Perperuga'', ''Dudula'' or the masculine form ''Dordolec'' or ''Durdulec''), a traditional mythical character of [[Balkans|Balkan]] folklore:{{sfn|Pipa|1978|p=58}}\n{{Verse translation|lang=sq|Rona-rona, Peperona,<br>bjer\u00eb shi nd\u00eb arat tona!<br>T\u00eb b\u00ebhet\u00eb thek\u00ebri<br>i gjat\u00eb gjer n\u00eb \u00e7ati,<br>gruri gjer n\u00eb per\u00ebndi,<br>ashtu edhe mis\u00ebri!|Rona-rona, Peperona,<br>pour rain on our fields!<br>So that oats will frow<br>as high as the roof,<br>wheat as high as the 'sky'.<br>and corn as well!}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Albanian folk beliefs]]\n*[[Illyrian religion]]\n*[[En (deity)]]\n*[[Zojz (deity)]]\n*[[Prende]]\n*[[Drangue]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n*{{cite book|last=Demiraj|first=Bardhyl|title=Albanische Etymologien: Untersuchungen zum albanischen Erbwortschatz|series=Leiden Studies in Indo-European|volume=7|year=1997|language=de|place=Amsterdam, Atlanta|publisher=Rodopi|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Gamkrelidze|first=Ivanov|title=Indo-European and the Indoeuropeans|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|year=1995|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Jakobson|first=Roman|author-link=Roman Jakobson|editor=Stephen Rudy|title=Roman Jakobson: Selected Writings|volume=VII: Contributions to Comparative Mythology: Studies in Linguistics and Philology, 1972-1982|chapter=Linguistic Evidence in Comparative Mythology|year=1985|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110855463|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsucH7YYr7kC&pg|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Peter|date=2002|title=Light from Distant Asterisks.
