In the state of [[New Jersey]], it runs along much of the mainline of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] (exit 6 to exit 18), as well as the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension (formerly and still commonly known as the Pennsylvania Turnpike Connector; from exit 6 to the [[Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge]]), and the New Jersey Turnpike's I-95 Extension (from exit 18) to the [[George Washington Bridge]] for a total of {{convert|77.96|mi|km|2|abbr=on}}. Located in the northeastern part of the state near [[New York City]], the {{convert|11.03|mi|km|2|adj=on}} Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike, considered to be '''Route 95W''' by the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT), is also part of I-95. \n\nI-95 enters the state from the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] on the Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge, following the length of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension to exit 6 on the New Jersey Turnpike mainline, continuing north along the remainder of the latter road to [[U.S. Route 46]] (US&nbsp;46), where it continues as the turnpike's I-95 Extension to the George Washington Bridge, on which it enters [[New York (state)|New York]]. All of I-95 in New Jersey is maintained by the [[New Jersey Turnpike Authority]] (NJTA) except for the George Washington Bridge, which is maintained by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (PANYNJ). \n\nUntil 2018, I-95 had been discontinuous within New Jersey. From [[Pennsylvania]], I-95 entered New Jersey on the [[Scudder Falls Bridge]] and ended at [[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|US&nbsp;1]] in [[Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Lawrence Township]], where the freeway then turned south as [[Interstate 295 (Delaware\u2013Pennsylvania)|I-295]]. From New York, I-95 continued from the George Washington Bridge southward along the New Jersey Turnpike and west along the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension to end at the Pennsylvania state line. This discontinuity was caused by the 1983 cancellation of the '''Somerset Freeway''', which would have connected the former Trenton segment of I-95 in [[Hopewell Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hopewell Township]] northeast to [[Interstate 287|I-287]] in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway Township]]. From here, I-95 would have followed present-day I-287 to exit&nbsp;10 on the New Jersey Turnpike in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison]].\n\nIn order to fill the gap, the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project]] saw the construction of an interchange between the Pennsylvania Turnpike and I-95 in [[Bristol Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bristol Township, Pennsylvania]], with I-95 being rerouted to use the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge. By March 2018, the former I-95 around the north side of Trenton to just across the Scudder Falls Bridge in Pennsylvania became an extension of I-295, with I-295 extended to the interchange by July of the same year. On September 22, 2018, the ramps connecting I-95 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened, allowing a direct freeway route from Philadelphia to New York City and finally completing I-95 as a whole.\n\n==Route description==\n===Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension===\n\n[[File:2018-09-23 15 50 15 View north along Interstate 95 (New Jersey Turnpike Pennsylvania Extension) at the exit for the New Jersey Turnpike SOUTH (Camden, Wilmington) in Mansfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) at the interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike mainline in Mansfield Township]]\nI-95 enters New Jersey at the [[Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge]] over the Delaware River in [[Burlington Township, New Jersey|Burlington Township]], [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]], where the road continues west into Pennsylvania as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].<ref name=\"095sld\"/><ref name=tbsm>{{cite web |author= Travel Boards |publisher=Travel Boards |url=http://www.travelboards.com/turnpike/NJ/map.asp|title=New Jersey Interchanges & Service Areas|access-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref> From the river, I-95 follows the six-lane [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension|Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension]] of the New Jersey Turnpike east into New Jersey.

In the state of [[New Jersey]], it runs along much of the mainline of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] (exit 6 to exit 18), as well as the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension (formerly and still commonly known as the Pennsylvania Turnpike Connector; from exit 6 to the [[Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge]]), and the New Jersey Turnpike's I-95 Extension (from exit 18) to the [[George Washington Bridge]] for a total of {{convert|77.96|mi|km|2|abbr=on}}. Located in the northeastern part of the state near [[New York City]], the {{convert|11.03|mi|km|2|adj=on}} Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike, considered to be '''Route 95W''' by the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT), is also part of I-95. \n\nI-95 enters the state from the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] on the Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge, following the length of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension to exit 6 on the New Jersey Turnpike mainline, continuing north along the remainder of the latter road to [[U.S. Route 46]] (US&nbsp;46), where it continues as the turnpike's I-95 Extension to the George Washington Bridge, on which it enters [[New York (state)|New York]]. All of I-95 in New Jersey is maintained by the [[New Jersey Turnpike Authority]] (NJTA) except for the George Washington Bridge, which is maintained by the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (PANYNJ). \n\nUntil 2018, I-95 had been discontinuous within New Jersey. From [[Pennsylvania]], I-95 entered New Jersey on the [[Scudder Falls Bridge]] and ended at [[U.S. Route 1 in New Jersey|US&nbsp;1]] in [[Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Lawrence Township]], where the freeway then turned south as [[Interstate 295 (Delaware\u2013Pennsylvania)|I-295]]. From New York, I-95 continued from the George Washington Bridge southward along the New Jersey Turnpike and west along the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension to end at the Pennsylvania state line. This discontinuity was caused by the 1983 cancellation of the '''Somerset Freeway''', which would have connected the former Trenton segment of I-95 in [[Hopewell Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hopewell Township]] northeast to [[Interstate 287|I-287]] in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey|Piscataway Township]]. From here, I-95 would have followed present-day I-287 to exit&nbsp;10 on the New Jersey Turnpike in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison]].\n\nIn order to fill the gap, the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project]] saw the construction of an interchange between the Pennsylvania Turnpike and I-95 in [[Bristol Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bristol Township, Pennsylvania]], with I-95 being rerouted to use the Pennsylvania Turnpike to the Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge. By March 2018, the former I-95 around the north side of Trenton to just across the Scudder Falls Bridge in Pennsylvania became an extension of I-295, with I-295 extended to the interchange by July of the same year. On September 22, 2018, the ramps connecting I-95 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened, allowing a direct freeway route from Philadelphia to New York City and finally completing I-95 as a whole.\n\n==Route description==\n===Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension===\n\n[[File:2018-09-23 15 50 15 View north along Interstate 95 (New Jersey Turnpike Pennsylvania Extension) at the exit for the New Jersey Turnpike SOUTH (Camden, Wilmington) in Mansfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) at the interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike mainline in Mansfield Township]]\nI-95 enters New Jersey at the [[Delaware River\u2013Turnpike Toll Bridge]] over the Delaware River in [[Burlington Township, New Jersey|Burlington Township]], [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]], where the road continues west into Pennsylvania as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]].<ref name=\"095sld\"/><ref name=tbsm>{{cite web |author= Travel Boards |publisher=Travel Boards |url=http://www.travelboards.com/turnpike/NJ/map.asp|title=New Jersey Interchanges & Service Areas|access-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref> From the river, I-95 follows the six-lane [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension|Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension]] of the New Jersey Turnpike east into New Jersey.

The long and heavily debated \"Novelle II\" came into force on 1 September 2009. They change 18 paragraphs in the BDSG. Content includes changes to the list privilege for address trading, new regulations for market and opinion research, opt-in , coupling ban, employee data protection, order data processing, new powers for the supervisory authorities and new or greatly expanded fines, information obligations in the event of data breaches, dismissal protection for data protection officers. On June 11, 2010 changed the \"Novelle III\" [4] as a small sub-item within the law implementing the EU Consumer Credit Directive, the \u00a7 29 BDSG by two paragraphs.\n\n== The legal amendment ==\n\nIn 2009, there were three amendments to the BDSG as a result of criticism from consumer advocates and numerous privacy scandals in business.

Prohibition with reservation of permission:'''\n\nThe collection, processing and use of personal data is strictly prohibited, unless it is permitted by the law or the person concerned gives consent (\u00a7 4 I BDSG).\n\n'''2. Principle of immediacy:'''\n\nThe personal data has to be collected directly from the person concerned. An exception of this principle is a legal permission or a disproportionate effort (\u00a7 4 III BDSG).\n\n'''3. Priority to special laws:'''\n\nThe BDSG supersedes any other federal law that relates to personal information and its publication (\u00a7 1 III BDSG).\n\n'''4. Principle of proportionality:'''\n\nThe creation of standards restrict the fundamental rights of the affected person. Therefore, these laws and procedures must be appropriate and necessary. A balancing of interests must occur.\n\n'''5. Principle of data avoidance and data economy:'''\n\nThrough the use of data anonymization or pseudo-anonymization, every data processing system should achieve the goal to use no (or as little as possible) personally identifiable data.  \n\n'''6. Principle of transparency:'''\n\nIf personal data is collected, the responsible entity must inform the affected person of its identity and the purposes of the collection, processing or use (\u00a7 4 III BDSG).\n\n'''7. Principle of earmarking:'''\n\nIf data is permitted to be collected for a particular purpose, use of the data is restricted to this purpose. A new consent or law is required, if the data will be used for another purpose.\n\n== Types of personal data ==\n\n[[Personal data]] means all data that provide information about personal relationships or facts about an identified or identifiable [[natural person]]. They include:\n* '''Personal relationships''': name, address, occupation, e-mail, IP address, or personal number \n* '''Factual circumstances''': income, taxes, ownership \n* '''Special kind of personal data''': racial or [[ethnic origin]], political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health, or sex life. These data are subject to special protection. \nProtected personal data does not include anonymized data, where the person's identity is not discernible. [[Pseudonymized]] data (where the person's name is replaced with a pseudonym) is protected by the BDSG, because the data relates to a person whose identity is discernible.  The BDSG does not protect the data of [[legal person]]s, such as corporations, although some courts have extended protection to legal persons.\n\n== Interaction with European law ==\nThe Council of Ministers and the European Parliament adopted the [[Data Protection Directive]] on October 24, 1995, that had to be transposed into internal law of the Member States by the end of 1998 (Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and Council on the protection of individuals with the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data). All member states have enacted their own data protection legislation.\n\nOn 25 January 2012, the European Commission unveiled a draft [[General Data Protection Regulation]] that will supersede the Data Protection Directive.\n\n== Cross-border data transmission ==\nThe following rules apply in accordance with the requirements of the [[European Commission]]'s [[Data Protection Directive]] to companies domiciled in Germany and for companies based abroad.\n\n===Companies domiciled in Germany===\nFor companies based in Germany, the Federal Data Protection Act regulates the transfer of data differently in another EU member country and to a third country.\n\n===Transmission from Germany to another EU member country===\nThrough the implementation of the EU Data Protection Directive, a uniform level of data protection has emerged in EU member countries. A company domiciled in Germany is therefore entitled to transfer personal data in Europe under the same rules as if it were to transfer data within Germany.\n\n===Transmission from Germany to a third country===\nTransfers to third countries must comply with the requirements of the Federal Privacy Act (\u00a7 4b II sentence 1 BDSG). The transmission must cease if the person has a legitimate interest in the prevention of transmission, especially if an adequate data protection in the third country is not guaranteed (\u00a7 4b II sentence 2 BDSG). The adequacy of protection shall be assessed by taking all the circumstances into account that are of importance for data transmission (\u00a7 4b III BDSG). These include the type of data, the purpose, duration of processing, professional rules and security measures.   In the opinion of the European Commission, [[Switzerland]] and [[Canada]] have an adequate level of protection. \n\nA further decision by the European Commission affects data transmission into the United States. According to the decision, the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] assured a reasonable level of data protection through the negotiated [[Safe Harbor Principles|Safe Harbor]] Agreement. Through the Safe Harbor Agreement, the recipient in the United States commits itself to comply with certain data protection principles by means of statements that to the relevant U.S. authorities . \n\nFor other third countries, it is hardly possible to determine the appropriate level of protection because of the complex criteria. For this reason certain exceptions (in \u00a7 4c I and II BDSG) under which a data transmission is allowed in third countries, even if an adequate level of data protection is not guaranteed, are important.  \u00a7 4c I BDSG allows cross-border data transfer with the person's consent and subject to the fulfillment of a contract between the person and the responsible party.\n\nIn all other cases, the \"subject to approval\" solution (\u00a7 4c II BDSG) allows the manufacturing site to transfer data in recipient countries where an adequate level of data protection is ensured. The contractual clauses or \"binding corporate rules\" must offer adequate guarantees regarding the protection of personal rights and must be approved in advance by the Competent Authority (\u00a7 4c BDSG II set 1). For international companies, it is advisable to obtain approval for standard contractual clauses. Even self-regulation in corporate policies can enable the data flow within multinational corporations. The [[codes of conduct]] must also give victims legal rights and certain guarantees, as is the case in contracts.<ref>Gola/Schomerus, BDSG Kommentar, page 151, M\u00fcnchen 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-406-59834-0}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[:de:Volksz\u00e4hlungsurteil|Volksz\u00e4hlungsurteil]]'' {{in lang|de}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.datenschutzbeauftragter-info.de/fachbeitraege/die-sieben-grundprinzipien-im-datenschutz/ Overview of the First Principles] {{in lang|de}}\n\n{{privacy}}\n\n[[Category:German law]]\n[[Category:Privacy in Germany]]\n[[Category:Data laws of Europe]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:{{lang|de|Bundesdatenschutzgesetz|nocat=y}}}}\n{{Infobox legislation\n|short_title         = Bundesdatenschutzgesetz\n|legislature         = Germany\n|image               = \n|imagesize           = \n|imagealt            = \n|caption             = \n|long_title          = \n|citation            = \n|enacted_by          = \n|date_enacted        = \n|date_passed         = \n|enacted_by2         = \n|date_enacted2       = \n|date_passed2        = \n|date_assented       = \n|royal_assent        = \n|date_commenced      = \n|bill                = \n|bill_citation       = \n|bill_date           = \n|introduced_by       = \n|1st_reading         = \n|2nd_reading         = \n|3rd_reading         = \n|committee_report    = \n|bill2               = \n|bill_citation2      = \n|bill_date2          = \n|introduced_by2      = \n|1st_reading2        = \n|2nd_reading2        = \n|3rd_reading2        = \n|committee_report2   = \n|white_paper         = \n|amendments          = \n|repeals             = \n|related_legislation = \n|summary             = \n|keywords            = \n|status              = \n}}\n{{italic title}}\nThe German '''{{lang|de|Bundesdatenschutzgesetz}}''' ('''BDSG''') is a federal data protection act, that together with the data protection acts of the [[German federal state]]s and other area-specific regulations, governs the exposure of personal data, which are manually processed or stored in IT systems.\n\n== Historical development ==\n\n===1960\u20131970===\n\nIn the early 1960s, consideration for comprehensive data protection began in the United States and further developed with advancements in computer technology and its privacy risks.  So a regulatory framework was needed to counteract the impairment of privacy in the processing of personal data.\n\n===1970\u20131990===\n\nIn the year 1970, the federal state of Hessen passed the first national data protection law, which was also the first data protection law in the world. In 1971, the first draft bill was submitted for a federal data protection act. Finally, on 1 January 1978, the first federal data protection act came into force.<ref>Gola/Schomerus, BDSG  Kommentar, page 47, M\u00fcnchen 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-406-59834-0}}</ref> In the following years, as the BDSG was taking shape in practice, a technical development took place in data processing as the computer became increasingly important both at work and in the private sector.<ref>Gola/Schomerus, BDSG Kommentar, page 47, M\u00fcnchen 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-406-59834-0}}</ref> \n\nThere were also significant changes the legal field.

Everton\".\n*The 1997 television drama ''[[The Fix (TV film)|The Fix]]'' told the story of the exposure of a match fixing scandal in 1963 that centred around Everton player [[Tony Kay]]. [[Jason Isaacs]] (himself a Liverpool fan) played Kay while [[Colin Welland]] portrayed then manager [[Harry Catterick]] with a broad [[Scouse|Liverpool accent]], despite the fact Catterick himself was from [[Darlington]].

Everton\".\n*The 1997 television drama ''[[The Fix (TV film)|The Fix]]'' told the story of the exposure of a match fixing scandal in 1963 that centred around Everton player [[Tony Kay]]. [[Jason Isaacs]] (himself a Liverpool fan) played Kay while [[Colin Welland]] portrayed then manager [[Harry Catterick]] with a broad [[Scouse|Liverpool accent]], despite the fact Catterick himself was from [[Darlington]].

Starting off on the National Express coach to Wembley, he sits cross from the two Liverpool fans singing \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\".
