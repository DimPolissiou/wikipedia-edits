It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, return.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious around Dee and self-conscious. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago, where Mama carried her out in her arms as Dee watched the house burn, seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she has also brought with her a man whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, and does not ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs in to the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama and they get into an argument. Dee feels that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is very physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' - Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name. \n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship to their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee(Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture.

These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artefacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em.

However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be na\u00efve to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, return.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious around Dee and self-conscious. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago, where Mama carried her out in her arms as Dee watched the house burn, seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she has also brought with her a man whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, and does not ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs in to the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama and they get into an argument. Dee feels that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is very physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' - Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name. \n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship to their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee(Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt.

Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artefacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be na\u00efve to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

{"title_page": "African-American art", "text_new": "{{African American topics sidebar|right}}'''African-American art''' is a broad term describing the visual arts of the [[United States|American]] [[Black people|black]] community ([[African American]]s). Influenced by various cultural traditions, including those of [[Africa]], [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]], traditional African-American art forms include the range of [[plastic arts]], from [[basket weaving]], [[pottery]], and [[quilting]] to [[woodcarving]] and [[painting]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-colonial, Antebellum and Civil War eras===\n[[File:John Bush powder horn carving.png|thumb|left|250px|Powder horn carved by John Bush, 1754.]]\n[[Image:PowersBibleQuilt 1898.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Harriet Powers]], ''Bible quilt'', Mixed Media. 1898.]]\nThe earliest evidence of African-American art in the [[United States]] is the work of skilled craftsmen slaves from [[New England]]. Two categories of slave craft items survive from colonial America: articles created for personal use by slaves and articles created for public use. Examples from the period between the 17th century and the early 19th century include:  small drums, quilts, wrought-iron figures, baskets, ceramic vessels, and gravestones.<ref>Sharon F. Patton, ''African-American Art'', Oxford University Press, 1998.</ref><ref name=\"African American Art book\">{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Samella |title=African American Art and Artists |date=2003 |publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>\n\nMany of Africa's most skilled slave artisans were hired out by slave owners. With the consent of their masters, some slave artisans also were able to keep a small percentage of the wages earned in their free time and thereby save enough money to purchase their, and their families', freedom.<ref>Romare Bearden, Harry Henderson, ''A History of African-American Artists. From 1792 to the Present''. New York: [[Pantheon Books]], 1993.</ref>\n\nThe public works of art produced by slave craftsmen were an important contribution to the Colonial economy. In New England and the Mid-Atlantic colonies, slaves were apprenticed as goldsmiths, cabinetmakers, engravers, carvers portrait painters, carpenters, masons and iron workers. \nThe construction and decoration of the Janson House built on the Hudson River in 1712 was the work of African-Americans. Many of the oldest buildings in Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia were built by craftsmen slaves.<ref name=\"African American Art book\" />\n\nIn the mid-eighteenth century, [[John Bush (provincial soldier)|John Bush]] was a powder horn carver and soldier with the Massachusetts militia fighting with the British in the [[French and Indian War]].<ref>USA Today Magazine.

Reason]], [[Joshua Johnson (painter)|Joshua Johnson]], and [[Scipio Moorhead]] were among the earliest known portrait artists, from the period of 1773\u20131887. Patronage by some white families allowed for private tutorship in special cases. Many of these sponsoring whites were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]s.  The artists received more encouragement and were better able to support themselves in cities, of which there were more in the North and border states.\n\n[[Harriet Powers]] (1837\u20131910) was an [[African-American]] folk artist and [[quilt]] maker from rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia, United States]], born into slavery. Now nationally recognized for her [[quilts]], she used traditional [[appliqu\u00e9]] techniques to record local legends, Bible stories, and astronomical events on her quilts.  Only two of her late quilts have survived: ''Bible Quilt 1886'' and ''Bible Quilt 1898''. Her quilts are considered among the finest examples of 19th-century Southern quilting,.<ref>Kyra E.

Although widely separated by geography, they have qualities reminiscent of [[Amish]] quilts and [[modern art]]. The [[The Quilts of Gees Bend|women of Gee's Bend]] passed their skills and aesthetic down through at least six generations to the present.<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040222230415/http://www.quiltsofgeesbend.com/history/ The Quilts of Gees Bend]''.</ref> At one time scholars believed slaves sometimes utilized [[quilt block]]s to alert other slaves about escape plans during the time of the [[Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Underground Railroad]],<ref>Raymond Dobard, Jr., Ph.D., and Jacqueline Tobin, ''Hidden in Plain View'', 1999.{{where|date=January 2011}}</ref> but most historians do not agree. [[African-American Quilts|Quilting]] remains alive as form of artistic expression in the African-American community.\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nAfter the Civil War, it became increasingly acceptable for African American-created works to be exhibited in museums, and artists increasingly produced works for this purpose. These were works mostly in the European romantic and classical traditions of landscapes and portraits. [[Edward Mitchell Bannister]], [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]] and [[Edmonia Lewis]] are the most notable of this time. Others include [[Grafton Tyler Brown]], [[Nelson Primus|Nelson A. Primus]] and [[Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller]].\n\nThe goal of widespread recognition across racial boundaries was first eased within America's big cities, including [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[New Orleans]]. Even in these places, however, there were [[racial discrimination|discriminatory]] limitations. Abroad, however, African Americans were much better received. In Europe \u2014 especially [[Paris, France]] \u2014 these artists could express much more freedom in experimentation and education concerning techniques outside traditional western art. Freedom of expression was much more prevalent in Paris as well as [[Munich]] and [[Rome]] to a lesser extent.\n\n===The Harlem Renaissance to contemporary art===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:sanddunes by tanner.jpg|thumb|''Sand Dunes at Sunset, Atlantic City'' by Henry Ossawa Tanner is in the collection of the [[White House]], and hangs in the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]].

Certain freedoms and ideas that were already widespread in many parts of the world at the time had begun to spread into the artistic communities United States during the 1920s. During this period notable artists included [[Richmond Barth\u00e9]], [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Lawrence Harris]], [[Palmer Hayden]], William H. Johnson, [[Sargent Johnson]], [[John T. Biggers]], [[Earle Wilton Richardson]], [[Malvin Gray Johnson]], [[Archibald Motley]], [[Augusta Savage]], [[Hale Woodruff]], and photographer [[James Van Der Zee]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe establishment of the [[Harmon Foundation]] by art patron William E. Harmon in 1922 sponsored many artists through its [[William E. Harmon Foundation award for distinguished achievement among Negroes|Harmon Award]] and annual exhibitions. As it did with many such endeavors, the 1929 [[Great Depression]] largely ended funding for the arts for a time. While the Harmon Foundation still existed in this period, its financial support toward artists ended. The Harmon Foundation, however, continued supporting artists until 1967 by mounting exhibitions and offering funding for developing artists such as [[Jacob Lawrence]].<ref>Driskell, p. 121.</ref>\n\n[[Image:E.J.Martin.1990.jpg|thumb|upright|''Midnight Golfer'' by [[Eugene J. Martin]], mixed media collage on rag paper.]]\nThe [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]]'s [[Public Works of Art Project]] ineffectively attempted to provide support for artists in 1933. In 1935, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] created the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). The WPA provided for all American artists and proved especially helpful to African-American artists. Artists and writers both gained work that helped them survive the Depression. Among them were [[Jacob Lawrence]] and [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]. Politics, human and social conditions all became the subjects of accepted art forms.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nImportant cities with significant black populations and important African-American art circles included Philadelphia, Boston, [[San Francisco]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] The WPA led to a new wave of important black art professors. Mixed media, abstract art, cubism, and social realism became not only acceptable, but desirable. Artists of the WPA united to form the 1935 [[Harlem Artists Guild]], which developed community art facilities in major cities.  Leading forms of art included drawing, sculpture, printmaking, painting, pottery, quilting, weaving and photography. By 1939, the costly WPA and its projects all were terminated.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1943, [[James Amos Porter|James A.

Influenced by various cultural traditions, including those of [[Africa]], [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]], traditional African-American art forms include the range of [[plastic arts]], from [[basket weaving]], [[pottery]], and [[quilting]] to [[woodcarving]] and [[painting]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-colonial, Antebellum and Civil War eras===\n[[File:John Bush powder horn carving.png|thumb|left|250px|Powder horn carved by John Bush, 1754.]]\n[[Image:PowersBibleQuilt 1898.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Harriet Powers]], ''Bible quilt'', Mixed Media. 1898.]]\nThe earliest evidence of African-American art in the [[United States]] is the work of skilled craftsmen slaves from [[New England]]. Two categories of slave craft items survive from colonial America: articles created for personal use by slaves and articles created for public use. Examples from the period between the 17th century and the early 19th century include:  small drums, quilts, wrought-iron figures, baskets, ceramic vessels, and gravestones.<ref>Sharon F. Patton, ''African-American Art'', Oxford University Press, 1998.</ref><ref name=\"African American Art book\">{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Samella |title=African American Art and Artists |date=2003 |publisher=University of California Press}}</ref>\n\nMany of Africa's most skilled slave artisans were hired out by slave owners. With the consent of their masters, some slave artisans also were able to keep a small percentage of the wages earned in their free time and thereby save enough money to purchase their, and their families', freedom.<ref>Romare Bearden, Harry Henderson, ''A History of African-American Artists. From 1792 to the Present''. New York: [[Pantheon Books]], 1993.</ref>\n\nThe public works of art produced by slave craftsmen were an important contribution to the Colonial economy. In New England and the Mid-Atlantic colonies, slaves were apprenticed as goldsmiths, cabinetmakers, engravers, carvers portrait painters, carpenters, masons and iron workers. \nThe construction and decoration of the Janson House built on the Hudson River in 1712 was the work of African-Americans. Many of the oldest buildings in Louisiana, South Carolina and Georgia were built by craftsmen slaves.<ref name=\"African American Art book\" />\n\nIn the mid-eighteenth century, [[John Bush (provincial soldier)|John Bush]] was a powder horn carver and soldier with the Massachusetts militia fighting with the British in the [[French and Indian War]].<ref>USA Today Magazine. May 2005, Vol. 133 Issue 2720, pp. 48\u201352. 5p.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://journals.psu.edu/wph/article/viewFile/7624/7397|title=The Great Warpaths|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n[[Patrick H. Reason]], [[Joshua Johnson (painter)|Joshua Johnson]], and [[Scipio Moorhead]] were among the earliest known portrait artists, from the period of 1773\u20131887. Patronage by some white families allowed for private tutorship in special cases. Many of these sponsoring whites were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]s.  The artists received more encouragement and were better able to support themselves in cities, of which there were more in the North and border states.\n\n[[Harriet Powers]] (1837\u20131910) was an [[African-American]] folk artist and [[quilt]] maker from rural [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia, United States]], born into slavery. Now nationally recognized for her [[quilts]], she used traditional [[appliqu\u00e9]] techniques to record local legends, Bible stories, and astronomical events on her quilts.  Only two of her late quilts have survived: ''Bible Quilt 1886'' and ''Bible Quilt 1898''. Her quilts are considered among the finest examples of 19th-century Southern quilting,.<ref>Kyra E. Hicks (2009), ''This I Accomplish: Harriet Powers' Bible Quilt and Other Pieces''.</ref><ref>[http://www.earlywomenmasters.net/powers/index.html Harriet Powers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018043355/http://earlywomenmasters.net/powers/index.html |date=2007-10-18 }}, Early Women Masters</ref>\n\nLike Powers, the women of [[Gee's Bend]] developed a distinctive, bold, and sophisticated quilting style based on traditional American (and African-American) quilts, but with a geometric simplicity.  Although widely separated by geography, they have qualities reminiscent of [[Amish]] quilts and [[modern art]]. The [[The Quilts of Gees Bend|women of Gee's Bend]] passed their skills and aesthetic down through at least six generations to the present.<ref>''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040222230415/http://www.quiltsofgeesbend.com/history/ The Quilts of Gees Bend]''.</ref> At one time scholars believed slaves sometimes utilized [[quilt block]]s to alert other slaves about escape plans during the time of the [[Quilts of the Underground Railroad|Underground Railroad]],<ref>Raymond Dobard, Jr., Ph.D., and Jacqueline Tobin, ''Hidden in Plain View'', 1999.{{where|date=January 2011}}</ref> but most historians do not agree. [[African-American Quilts|Quilting]] remains alive as form of artistic expression in the African-American community.\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nAfter the Civil War, it became increasingly acceptable for African American-created works to be exhibited in museums, and artists increasingly produced works for this purpose. These were works mostly in the European romantic and classical traditions of landscapes and portraits. [[Edward Mitchell Bannister]], [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]] and [[Edmonia Lewis]] are the most notable of this time. Others include [[Grafton Tyler Brown]], [[Nelson Primus|Nelson A. Primus]] and [[Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller]].\n\nThe goal of widespread recognition across racial boundaries was first eased within America's big cities, including [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[New Orleans]]. Even in these places, however, there were [[racial discrimination|discriminatory]] limitations. Abroad, however, African Americans were much better received. In Europe \u2014 especially [[Paris, France]] \u2014 these artists could express much more freedom in experimentation and education concerning techniques outside traditional western art. Freedom of expression was much more prevalent in Paris as well as [[Munich]] and [[Rome]] to a lesser extent.\n\n===The Harlem Renaissance to contemporary art===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:sanddunes by tanner.jpg|thumb|''Sand Dunes at Sunset, Atlantic City'' by Henry Ossawa Tanner is in the collection of the [[White House]], and hangs in the [[Green Room (White House)|Green Room]].

Certain freedoms and ideas that were already widespread in many parts of the world at the time had begun to spread into the artistic communities United States during the 1920s. During this period notable artists included [[Richmond Barth\u00e9]], [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Lawrence Harris]], [[Palmer Hayden]], William H. Johnson, [[Sargent Johnson]], [[John T. Biggers]], [[Earle Wilton Richardson]], [[Malvin Gray Johnson]], [[Archibald Motley]], [[Augusta Savage]], [[Hale Woodruff]], and photographer [[James Van Der Zee]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe establishment of the [[Harmon Foundation]] by art patron William E. Harmon in 1922 sponsored many artists through its [[William E. Harmon Foundation award for distinguished achievement among Negroes|Harmon Award]] and annual exhibitions. As it did with many such endeavors, the 1929 [[Great Depression]] largely ended funding for the arts for a time. While the Harmon Foundation still existed in this period, its financial support toward artists ended. The Harmon Foundation, however, continued supporting artists until 1967 by mounting exhibitions and offering funding for developing artists such as [[Jacob Lawrence]].<ref>Driskell, p. 121.</ref>\n\n[[Image:E.J.Martin.1990.jpg|thumb|upright|''Midnight Golfer'' by [[Eugene J. Martin]], mixed media collage on rag paper.]]\nThe [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury Department]]'s [[Public Works of Art Project]] ineffectively attempted to provide support for artists in 1933. In 1935, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] created the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA). The WPA provided for all American artists and proved especially helpful to African-American artists. Artists and writers both gained work that helped them survive the Depression. Among them were [[Jacob Lawrence]] and [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]. Politics, human and social conditions all became the subjects of accepted art forms.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nImportant cities with significant black populations and important African-American art circles included Philadelphia, Boston, [[San Francisco]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] The WPA led to a new wave of important black art professors. Mixed media, abstract art, cubism, and social realism became not only acceptable, but desirable. Artists of the WPA united to form the 1935 [[Harlem Artists Guild]], which developed community art facilities in major cities.  Leading forms of art included drawing, sculpture, printmaking, painting, pottery, quilting, weaving and photography. By 1939, the costly WPA and its projects all were terminated.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1943, [[James Amos Porter|James A. Porter]], a professor in the Department of Art at [[Howard University]], wrote the first major text on African-American art and artists, ''Modern Negro Art''.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==== Mid-20th century ====\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, few African-American artists were widely known or accepted. Despite this, [[The Highwaymen (artists)|The Highwaymen]], a loose association of 26 [[African-American]] artists from [[Fort Pierce, Florida|Fort Pierce]], [[Florida]], created idyllic, quickly realized images of the Florida landscape and peddled some 200,000 of them from the trunks of their cars.

In 2004 the original group of 26 Highwaymen were inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame.<ref>''[http://www.floridahighwaymenpaintings.com The Florida Highwaymen]''</ref> Currently 8 of the 26 are deceased, including A.

It is formed by extending the [[index finger|index]] and [[little finger]]s while holding the [[middle finger|middle]] and [[ring finger]]s down with the [[thumb]].\n\n==Spiritual and superstitious meaning==\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], the hand gesture is known as the \"[[List of mudras (yoga)#Hasta (hand mudras)|Apana yogic mudra]]\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rajinikanth-politics-party-symbol-apana-mudra-detoxification-purification-5007863/|title=Is Rajinikanth\u2019s party symbol the same as Apana Mudra for \u2018detoxification and purification\u2019?|date=January 4, 2018}}</ref> In [[Indian classical dance]] forms the hand gesture symbolises the [[Asiatic lion#In mythology, religion, culture and art|Lion]]<ref name=\"auto\"/>. In [[Buddhism]] it is seen as an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] gesture very commonly used by [[Gautama Buddha]] as \"Karana Mudra\" which is synonymous with [[Exorcism#Buddhism|expulsion of demons]] and removal of obstacles like sickness or negative thoughts.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe [[apotropaic]] usage of the sign can also be seen in [[Italy]] and in other [[Mediterranean]] cultures where, when confronted with unfortunate events, or simply when these events are mentioned, the sign of the horns may be given to ward off bad luck. It is also used traditionally to counter or ward off the \"[[evil eye]]\" (''malocchio'' in Italian). In Italy specifically, the gesture is known as the ''corna''. With fingers pointing down, it is a common Mediterranean apotropaic gesture, by which people seek protection in unlucky situations (it is thus a more Mediterranean equivalent of [[knocking on wood]]). Thus, for example, the [[President of the Italian Republic]], [[Giovanni Leone]], shocked the country when, while in [[Naples]] during an [[outbreak]] of [[cholera]], he shook the hands of [[patient]]s with one hand while with the other behind his back he superstitiously made the ''corna'', presumably to ward off the disease or in reaction to being confronted by such misfortune. This act was well documented by the [[journalist]]s and [[photographer]]s who were right behind him, a fact that had escaped President Leone's mind in that moment.{{cn|date=January 2020}} \n\nIn Italy and other parts of the [[Mediterranean region]], the gesture must usually be performed with the fingers tilting downward to signify the warding off of bad luck; in the same region and elsewhere, the gesture may take a different, offensive and insulting meaning if it is performed with fingers upward or if directed aggressively towards someone in a swiveling motion (see section below). In Italy, one can also \"touch iron\" (''tocca ferro'') or touch one's nose to ward off bad luck. Males in Italy may also grab their [[testicle]]s when confronted by bad luck; however, this is considered more vulgar.\n\nIn [[Peru]] one says ''contra'' (against). In the [[Dominican Republic]] the expression is ''zafa'', said against curses known as ''fuk\u00fa''. All of these gestures are meant to conjure supernatural protection.\n\nThe sign of the horns is used during religious rituals in Wicca, to invoke or represent the [[Horned god]].<ref>''Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner'' by Scott Cunningham, p. 42.</ref>\n\n==Offensive gesture==\nIn many [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]] and Latin countries, such as [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/galleries/Rude-hand-gestures-of-the-world/|title=Rude hand gestures of the world (don't try these on holiday)|date=February 4, 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |title=International field guide to rude hand gestures |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214213945/http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |archivedate=2013-12-14 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/hand-gestures-in-different-cultures.html|title=Hand Gestures in Different Cultures}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHS39OG4GG4C |title=Rude Hand Gestures of the World: A Guide to Offending without Words By Romana Lefevre |isbn=9781452110172 |author1=Lefevre |first1=Romana |date=2011-10-21 }}</ref> when directed towards someone and swiveled back and forth, the sign implies [[cuckold]]ry; the common words for ''cuckolded'' in Italian, Greek and Spanish are {{lang|it|cornuto}}, {{lang|el|\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c2}} ({{lang|el-Latn|keratas}}) and {{lang|es|cornudo}}, respectively, literally meaning \"horned\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reading-body-language.co.uk/gestures2.html |title=Hand Gestures Part Two \u2014 The Cuckold Gesture |publisher=Reading-Body-Language.co.uk}}</ref> During a [[European Union]] meeting in February 2002, then-current Italian prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] was photographed performing this gesture behind the back of [[Josep Piqu\u00e9]], the Spanish foreign minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874139,00.html|title=Top 10 Worst Silvio Berlusconi Gaffes|date=8 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2017|via=content.time.com}}</ref>\n\n==Northwestern European and North American popular culture==\n\n===Contemporary use by musicians and fans===\nThe 1969 back album cover for ''[[Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls]]'' on Mercury Records by Chicago-based psychedelic-occult rock band [[Coven (band)|Coven]], led by singer [[Jinx Dawson]], pictured Coven band members giving the \"sign of the horns\".

Some fans interpreted this as one of the many supposed \"[[Paul is dead]]\" clues. Some may think it is possible that the cartoonist misrepresented the [[ILY sign|sign for \"I love you\"]], which is very similar and more in keeping with the band's public message and image. However, the 1969 cartoon is based on many photos of John Lennon making the hand sign in 1967. One of these photos of Lennon doing the hand sign appears on the cover of a Beatles single release shortly after, making it the first time the hand sign appears on a rock release.\n\nThe sign is also used in various Disney movies. It can be seen in the medieval-style opening sequence of the 1971 British-American Disney movie ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' as a goat-legged figure with a jester's cap leading a procession of outlandish looking figures, flashes the sign.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, the horns were known as the \"P-Funk sign\" to fans of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].

One of his most famous lines is, \" Don't mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns\", flashing the sign of the horns while rotating his wrist.\n\nIn one episode of the popular animated series [[The Simpsons]], a female tramp is seen warding off a male tramp using the sign of the horns using her thumbs and index fingers, screaming 'And you're a three-headed devil dog!

Dio began using the sign soon after joining the metal band [[Black Sabbath]] in 1979. The previous singer in the band, [[Ozzy Osbourne]], was rather well known for using the [[V Sign|\"peace\"]] sign at concerts, raising the index and middle finger in the form of a V. Dio, in an attempt to connect with the fans, wanted to similarly use a hand gesture. However, not wanting to copy Osbourne, he chose to use the sign his grandmother always made.<ref>Ronnie James Dio interview in the 2005 documentary ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]''. In the interview he also ridicules Gene Simmons for taking credit for originating use of the sign in heavy metal, attributing the claim to Simmons' well-known egotism.</ref> The horns became famous in metal concerts very soon after Black Sabbath's first tour with Dio. The sign would later be appropriated by heavy metal fans under the name \"maloik\", a corruption of the original ''malocchio''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n[[Geezer Butler|Terry \"Geezer\" Butler]] of Black Sabbath can be seen \"raising the horns\" in a photograph taken in 1971. The photograph is included in the CD booklet of the ''[[Symptom of the Universe: The Original Black Sabbath 1970\u20131978]]'' compilation album. This would indicate that there had been some association between the \"horns\" and heavy metal before Dio's popularization of it.\n\nWhen asked if he was the one who introduced the hand gesture to metal subculture, Dio said in a 2001 interview with Metal-Rules.com:\n\n{{quote|I doubt very much if I would be the first one who ever did that. That's like saying I invented the wheel, I'm sure someone did that at some other point. I think you'd have to say that I made it fashionable. I used it so much and all the time and it had become my trademark until the [[Britney Spears]] audience decided to do it as well. So it kind of lost its meaning with that. But it was \u2026 I was in Sabbath at the time. It was a symbol that I thought was reflective of what that band was supposed to be all about. It's NOT the devil's sign like we're here with the devil. It's an Italian thing I got from my Grandmother called the \"Malocchio\". It's to ward off the Evil Eye or to give the Evil Eye, depending on which way you do it. It's just a symbol but it had magical incantations and attitudes to it and I felt it worked very well with Sabbath. So I became very noted for it and then everybody else started to pick up on it and away it went. But I would never say I take credit for being the first to do it. I say because I did it so much that it became the symbol of rock and roll of some kind.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metal-rules.com/zine/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=666 |title=Dio - Interviewed By EvilG |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date=March 9, 2001}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Gene Simmons]] of the rock group [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] attempted to claim the \"devil horns\" hand gesture for his own.

Students and alumni of the university employ a greeting consisting of the phrase \"Hook 'em\" or \"Hook 'em Horns\" and also use the phrase as a parting good-bye or as the closing line in a letter or story.  The [[gesture]] is meant to approximate the shape of the head and horns of the [[University of Texas at Austin|UT]] mascot, the [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] [[Bevo (mascot)|Bevo]].\n\nFans of the [[University of South Florida]] Bulls use the same hand sign at their athletic events, except that the hand is turned around and facing the other way.  With the middle and ring finger extending towards the person presenting the \"Go Bulls\" sign.\n\nFans of [[North Dakota State University]] Bison athletics also use a similar hand gesture, known as \"Go Bison!\"  The pinky and index fingers are usually slightly bent, however, to mimic the shape of a [[bison]]'s horns.\n\nFans of [[North Carolina State University]] Wolfpack athletics use a similar gesture with the middle and ring fingers moving up and down over the thumb to mimic a wolf's jaw.\n\nFans of  [[University of California, Irvine]] Anteaters use a similar sign with the middle and ring fingers out to resemble the head of the mighty anteater.\n\nFans of [[University of Nevada, Reno]] Wolf Pack athletics use a similar sign with the middle and ring fingers out to resemble the wolf's snout. \n\nA variation of this hand gesture is also used in the [[professional wrestling]] industry, which fans dub the \"Too Sweet\". It was possibly innovated by [[Scott Hall]] and the other members of [[The Kliq]], and has since been attributed to other wrestling groups such as [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|the nWo]] and [[Bullet Club]], as well as individual wrestlers such as [[Finn B\u00e1lor]].\n\nFans of [[University of Utah]] athletics, particularly football and gymnastics, use a gesture where the index and pinky finger are straight and parallel to each other, forming a block \"U.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.utah.edu/muss/membership/ |title=MUSS - Student Cheer Section for the U of U Utes - University of Utah Alumni Association &#124; MUSS |publisher=Alumni.utah.edu |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref>\n\nFans of [[Northwestern State University]] Demon athletics also use a similar hand gesture, known as \"Fork 'em!\"  The pinky and index fingers are extended but a little more parallel to each other resembling the horns on a demon.\n\n[[Arizona State University]] [[Sun Devil]] fans make a pitchfork sign by extending the index and middle fingers, as well as the pinky. The thumb holds down the ring finger to complete the gesture.\n\nFans of the [[Wichita State University]] Shockers frequently hold up their middle finger in addition to the pointer and pinky fingers as a reference to the [[Shocker (hand gesture)|comic sexual act]].\n\nFans of the [[Grand Canyon University]] Antelopes use this hand gesture with a slight variation by touching the tips of the ring and middle finger with the thumb to form the shape of an antelope and its horns.

It is formed by extending the [[index finger|index]] and [[little finger]]s while holding the [[middle finger|middle]] and [[ring finger]]s down with the [[thumb]].\n\n==Spiritual and superstitious meaning==\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], the hand gesture is known as the \"[[List of mudras (yoga)#Hasta (hand mudras)|Apana yogic mudra]]\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rajinikanth-politics-party-symbol-apana-mudra-detoxification-purification-5007863/|title=Is Rajinikanth\u2019s party symbol the same as Apana Mudra for \u2018detoxification and purification\u2019?|date=January 4, 2018}}</ref> In [[Indian classical dance]] forms the hand gesture symbolises the [[Asiatic lion#In mythology, religion, culture and art|Lion]]<ref name=\"auto\"/>. In [[Buddhism]] it is seen as an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] gesture very commonly used by [[Gautama Buddha]] as \"Karana Mudra\" which is synonymous with [[Exorcism#Buddhism|expulsion of demons]] and removal of obstacles like sickness or negative thoughts.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe [[apotropaic]] usage of the sign can also be seen in [[Italy]] and in other [[Mediterranean]] cultures where, when confronted with unfortunate events, or simply when these events are mentioned, the sign of the horns may be given to ward off bad luck. It is also used traditionally to counter or ward off the \"[[evil eye]]\" (''malocchio'' in Italian). In Italy specifically, the gesture is known as the ''corna''. With fingers pointing down, it is a common Mediterranean apotropaic gesture, by which people seek protection in unlucky situations (it is thus a more Mediterranean equivalent of [[knocking on wood]]). Thus, for example, the [[President of the Italian Republic]], [[Giovanni Leone]], shocked the country when, while in [[Naples]] during an [[outbreak]] of [[cholera]], he shook the hands of [[patient]]s with one hand while with the other behind his back he superstitiously made the ''corna'', presumably to ward off the disease or in reaction to being confronted by such misfortune. This act was well documented by the [[journalist]]s and [[photographer]]s who were right behind him, a fact that had escaped President Leone's mind in that moment.{{cn|date=January 2020}} \n\nIn Italy and other parts of the [[Mediterranean region]], the gesture must usually be performed with the fingers tilting downward to signify the warding off of bad luck; in the same region and elsewhere, the gesture may take a different, offensive and insulting meaning if it is performed with fingers upward or if directed aggressively towards someone in a swiveling motion (see section below). In Italy, one can also \"touch iron\" (''tocca ferro'') or touch one's nose to ward off bad luck. Males in Italy may also grab their [[testicle]]s when confronted by bad luck; however, this is considered more vulgar.\n\nIn [[Peru]] one says ''contra'' (against). In the [[Dominican Republic]] the expression is ''zafa'', said against curses known as ''fuk\u00fa''. All of these gestures are meant to conjure supernatural protection.\n\nThe sign of the horns is used during religious rituals in Wicca, to invoke or represent the [[Horned god]].<ref>''Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner'' by Scott Cunningham, p. 42.</ref>\n\n==Offensive gesture==\nIn many [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]] and Latin countries, such as [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/galleries/Rude-hand-gestures-of-the-world/|title=Rude hand gestures of the world (don't try these on holiday)|date=February 4, 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |title=International field guide to rude hand gestures |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214213945/http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |archivedate=2013-12-14 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/hand-gestures-in-different-cultures.html|title=Hand Gestures in Different Cultures}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHS39OG4GG4C |title=Rude Hand Gestures of the World: A Guide to Offending without Words By Romana Lefevre |isbn=9781452110172 |author1=Lefevre |first1=Romana |date=2011-10-21 }}</ref> when directed towards someone and swiveled back and forth, the sign implies [[cuckold]]ry; the common words for ''cuckolded'' in Italian, Greek and Spanish are {{lang|it|cornuto}}, {{lang|el|\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c2}} ({{lang|el-Latn|keratas}}) and {{lang|es|cornudo}}, respectively, literally meaning \"horned\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reading-body-language.co.uk/gestures2.html |title=Hand Gestures Part Two \u2014 The Cuckold Gesture |publisher=Reading-Body-Language.co.uk}}</ref> During a [[European Union]] meeting in February 2002, then-current Italian prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] was photographed performing this gesture behind the back of [[Josep Piqu\u00e9]], the Spanish foreign minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874139,00.html|title=Top 10 Worst Silvio Berlusconi Gaffes|date=8 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2017|via=content.time.com}}</ref>\n\n==Northwestern European and North American popular culture==\n\n===Contemporary use by musicians and fans===\nThe 1969 back album cover for ''[[Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls]]'' on Mercury Records by Chicago-based psychedelic-occult rock band [[Coven (band)|Coven]], led by singer [[Jinx Dawson]], pictured Coven band members giving the \"sign of the horns\".

Some fans interpreted this as one of the many supposed \"[[Paul is dead]]\" clues. Some may think it is possible that the cartoonist misrepresented the [[ILY sign|sign for \"I love you\"]], which is very similar and more in keeping with the band's public message and image. However, the 1969 cartoon is based on many photos of John Lennon making the hand sign in 1967. One of these photos of Lennon doing the hand sign appears on the cover of a Beatles single release shortly after, making it the first time the hand sign appears on a rock release.\n\nThe sign is also used in various Disney movies. It can be seen in the medieval-style opening sequence of the 1971 British-American Disney movie ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' as a goat-legged figure with a jester's cap leading a procession of outlandish looking figures, flashes the sign.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, the horns were known as the \"P-Funk sign\" to fans of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].

One of his most famous lines is, \" Don't mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns\", flashing the sign of the horns while rotating his wrist.\n\nIn one episode of the popular animated series [[The Simpsons]], a female tramp is seen warding off a male tramp using the sign of the horns using her thumbs and index fingers, screaming 'And you're a three-headed devil dog!

Dio began using the sign soon after joining the metal band [[Black Sabbath]] in 1979. The previous singer in the band, [[Ozzy Osbourne]], was rather well known for using the [[V Sign|\"peace\"]] sign at concerts, raising the index and middle finger in the form of a V. Dio, in an attempt to connect with the fans, wanted to similarly use a hand gesture. However, not wanting to copy Osbourne, he chose to use the sign his grandmother always made.<ref>Ronnie James Dio interview in the 2005 documentary ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]''. In the interview he also ridicules Gene Simmons for taking credit for originating use of the sign in heavy metal, attributing the claim to Simmons' well-known egotism.</ref> The horns became famous in metal concerts very soon after Black Sabbath's first tour with Dio. The sign would later be appropriated by heavy metal fans under the name \"maloik\", a corruption of the original ''malocchio''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n[[Geezer Butler|Terry \"Geezer\" Butler]] of Black Sabbath can be seen \"raising the horns\" in a photograph taken in 1971. The photograph is included in the CD booklet of the ''[[Symptom of the Universe: The Original Black Sabbath 1970\u20131978]]'' compilation album. This would indicate that there had been some association between the \"horns\" and heavy metal before Dio's popularization of it.\n\nWhen asked if he was the one who introduced the hand gesture to metal subculture, Dio said in a 2001 interview with Metal-Rules.com:\n\n{{quote|I doubt very much if I would be the first one who ever did that. That's like saying I invented the wheel, I'm sure someone did that at some other point. I think you'd have to say that I made it fashionable. I used it so much and all the time and it had become my trademark until the [[Britney Spears]] audience decided to do it as well. So it kind of lost its meaning with that. But it was \u2026 I was in Sabbath at the time. It was a symbol that I thought was reflective of what that band was supposed to be all about. It's NOT the devil's sign like we're here with the devil. It's an Italian thing I got from my Grandmother called the \"Malocchio\". It's to ward off the Evil Eye or to give the Evil Eye, depending on which way you do it. It's just a symbol but it had magical incantations and attitudes to it and I felt it worked very well with Sabbath. So I became very noted for it and then everybody else started to pick up on it and away it went. But I would never say I take credit for being the first to do it. I say because I did it so much that it became the symbol of rock and roll of some kind.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metal-rules.com/zine/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=666 |title=Dio - Interviewed By EvilG |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date=March 9, 2001}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Gene Simmons]] of the rock group [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] attempted to claim the \"devil horns\" hand gesture for his own.
