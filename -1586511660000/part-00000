It is one of two leagues at this level, with its counterpart, [[National League 2 North]], covering the north of England. The format of the league was changed at the beginning of the 2009\u201310 season following reorganisation by the [[Rugby Football Union]].\n\nThe champions are promoted to [[National League 1]]. The runners-up play in a promotion play-off with the runners-up of National League 2 North; the team with the best record having home advantage. The bottom three teams are relegated, to either [[South West Premier]] or [[London & South East Premier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfu.com/TheGame/Competitions/SSELeagues|title=SSE National and Divisional Leagues|publisher=RFU|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Current season==\n{{Main|2019\u201320 National League 2 South}}\n\n==Participating teams and locations==\n\nEleven of the teams listed below participated in the [[2018\u201319 National League 2 South]] season.

It is situated south of [[Chiemsee]] and southwest of [[Ruhpolding]] - home of the Biathlon World Cup - in the [[Bavarian Alps]] and facing towards Tyrol. The village lies next to the Austrian states [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]]. [[K\u00f6ssen]] in Tyrol is the next village on the river Lofer, before it joins the confluence of the river [[Tiroler Achen]].  Reit im Winkl has a population of approximately 2,600.\n\nReit im Winkl is well known as both a certified place of restorative and curative air (Luftkurort) and a [[ski resort]], offering [[alpine skiing]], [[cross-country skiing]], both classical and skating, and [[snow-boarding]], as well as mountain trekking and [[hiking]]. It achieved, in 2012, Germany's first-ever Premium Winter Trails Certification.<ref>http://www.reitimwinkl.de/winterwandern-premium-winterwanderwege</ref> Snowfall is always plentiful and predictable (even when surrounding areas are bare of snow, Reit im Winkl can be sure of sufficient snow to create premier skiing conditions - in 2012 Reit im Winkl had the deepest snow of 120&nbsp;cm for a plateau area,<ref>http://www.wetterdienst.de/Deutschlandwetter/Thema_des_Tages/850/deutschlandwetter-im-jahr-2012</ref> which occurred in February, long after snow had melted elsewhere in the region. Reit im Winkl has two alpine skiing areas: 1) Three lifts in the suburb of Blindau (Benzeck) as well as a snow-tubing lift, and the large plateau skiing area at Winklmoos Alm <ref>[http://www.winklmoosalm.de/ www.winklmoosalm.de]</ref> which connects with [[:de:Steinplatte|Steinplatte]] in Austria and is reached by the recently completed, state-of-the-art gondola cableway (bubble lift) from Seegatterl.\n\nIn summer, Reit im Winkl enjoys one of the highest counts of sunny days in Bavaria, and is popular with [[mountain bike]] and [[nordic walking]] enthusiasts.  Visitors can enjoy swimming in either of the three [[alpine lake]]s (Weitsee, Mittersee and Loedensee) northeast of Seegatterl, or try their luck at fishing in the trout lake.\n\nReit im Winkl is popularly known to locals and return visitors as Germany's own Tyrol, and boasts its own home-grown regional specialities such as ''Heumilch'' cheese (cheese made from cows fed exclusively hay pasture), ''heuschnapps'' (a liqueur in which mountain hay and herbs are soaked to produce a distinctive and sweet taste of hay) and ''Reiberdatschi'' (grated potatoes mixed with a little egg and flour and poured as a flat mass into a skillet and fried), popularly eaten with apple mousse.\n\n==Suburbs==\nReit im Winkl is divided into the suburbs Birnbach, Blindau, Entfelden, Groissenbach, Oberbichl, Seegatterl, Unterbichl and Winklmoos Alm.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first signs of settlement in Reit im Winkl are in the 12th century. The date of the foundation is 1160 when Otto de Rute was named in a document. The accuracy of the document is disputed and some historians put the beginning of the settlement to the middle of the 13th century. Since then it has been part of Bavaria.\n\nReit im Winkl was part of the parish of [[Kirchdorf in Tirol]] which was itself part of the [[diocese of Chiemsee]] from 1275 until 1804.\n\nHistorians have assumed the location of the manor of the Herren von Reit (Lords of Reit), on a small hill above the church.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe [[coat of arms]] was created 1929 replacing the old coat of arms which showed a blue chapel on a green hill. The new coat of arms shows the eagle on yellow ground of the diocese of Chiemsee in a corner (Winkl derived from the German word Winkel for corner). The burning log and the sapie (axe like tool to trail logs) on the forest green ground are symbols for the clearing of the forest to create pasture and farm land in 11th and 12th century.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===History===\n\nFormerly, Reit im Winkl was mostly dependent on logging and forestry, because of the brevity of the growing season for agricultural production. Trees were logged in summer and transported to storage places with horses or by hand. Logs were transferred to neighbouring Tyrol for sale: in winter either via sleds with a man sitting in front using his feet to brake and control the sled, which resulted in severe accidents occurring regularly, or via dams which were constructed to hold the meltwater during spring in order to raft the timber down the valley - such a dam can be found on display at Winklmoss Alm. Because the orientation of the valley made it impossible to sell the rafted wood to the [[Saltern|salt works]] of [[Bad Reichenhall]] or [[Traunstein]] - which had an enormous fuel consumption - logs were sent south. In one such contract the wood was sold to the silver works in the Inn valley in Tyrol and as an exchange Tyrol sold logs to the salt works in Bad Reichenhall.\n\n===Today===\n\nThe first tourist to Reit im Winkl, in the year 1858, was King Maximilian II, as reported in the local press. The [[Strength Through Joy]] movement in the Third Reich and the closed borders after the war boosted tourism as the principal source of income in the region. Today, approximately 5000 beds for annual visitor numbers of 90 000 provides an indication of the importance of tourism for Reit im Winkl.\n\n==Transport==\n\n[[File:German Alps Road (B 305), near Reit im Winkl, Germany.JPG|thumb|German Alps Road (B 305), near Reit im Winkl, Germany|280x280px]]\n\nReit im Winkl is located along the Deutschen Alpenstra\u00dfe (B 305) (German Alps Road).  Coming from Munich by car it can be reached either from the Munich-Salzburg highway A8 at [[Bernau am Chiemsee|Bernau]] or [[Chiemsee]] and the [[Tiroler Achen]] valley; coming from Salzburg along the Munich-Salzburg A8 at Siegsdorf or [[Grabenstatt]] via [[Ruhpolding]], or through Bad Reichenhall via [[Berchtesgarden]]. The Maserer pass (B305, direction [[Marquartstein]]) has been renovated and widened (most recently at the end of the 20th century) - during periods of heavy snowfall, [[snow chains]] are recommended. The B305 continues through the village, across the border into Austria and follows the river Lofer river to K\u00f6ssen straight into the Inn valley. Because of the need for transport capacities for the sawmills and logs from the surrounding forest a [[narrow gauge railway]] was built from Ruhpolding to Reit im Winkl in 1923. Following accidents and as a result of the high maintenance costs (winter conditions) the railway was demolished in the 1930s. The [[causeway]] is used as a bicycle trail in summer and for [[nordic skiing]] in the winter.\n\nApart from private car, Reit im Winkl can be reached via public transport - the RVO (Regionalverkehr Oberbayern) runs the following bus services which also connect (in the case of Prien am Chiemsee, Salzburg and Traunstein) with the Deutsche Bahn (train services).\n\n    1. 9505 - Reit im Winkl - Prien am Chiemsee\n    2. 9506 - Reit im Winkl - Inzell\n    3. 9507 - Reit im Winkl - Winklmoos\n    4. 9509 - Reit im Winkl - Traunstein\n    5. 9531 - Oberw\u00f6ssen - \u00dcbersee\n    6. 9535 - Reit im Winkl - Salzburg\n\nReit im Winkl also has one taxi service, a rental car service, and a minibus rental/coach with driver service.\n\n== Personalities ==\n=== Sons and daughters of the community ===\n\n* [[Maria Hellwig]] (1920-2010) and [[Margot Hellwig]] (born 1941), interpreters of popular music\n* [[Rosi Mittermaier]] (born 1950), popular ski racer\n* [[Thomas Klauser]] (born 1964), ski jumper\n\n=== Other personalities linked to Reit im Winkl ===\n\n* [[Dettmar Cramer]] (1925-2015), former German footballer and coach\n* [[Takeo Ischi]] (born 1947), Japanese singer and yodeller\n* [[Evi Mittermaier]] (born 1953), ski racer\n* [[Evi Sachenbacher-Stehle]] (born 1980), cross-country skier and biathlete, active until 2014\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.reitimwinkl.de Reit im Winkl]\n* [http://www.winklmoosalm.de/ Winklmoos Alm]\n* [http://www.biathlon-ruhpolding.de/en Ruhpolding Biathlon World Cup]\n* [http://www.rvo-bus.de/site/rvo__bus/de/fahrplan__information/fahrplaene/suche/rvo__fpl__filter.html?c334544=Reit+im+Winkl&c334552= Regional Bus Routes from Reit im Winkl]\n* [http://www.dasoertliche.de/Themen/Taxi/Reit+im+Winkl.html Taxi/Hire car/bus services in Reit im Winkl]\n* [http://www.reitimwinkl.de/en/wintervacations/accommodation-search Reit im Winkl Tourist Bureau Accommodation List of Hotels, Holiday Apartments, Youth Hostels, Pensions, Camping Grounds and Caravan Parks etc in one star to five star categories]\n* [http://www.hausberg-skischule.de/ Skischool and Snowboardschool Reit im Winkl]\n* [http://skiverleih-reitimwinkl.de/ Ski Rentall Reit im Winkl]\n* [http://www.bergstueberl.de/ Guesthouse Bergst\u00fcberl]\n\n{{Cities and towns in Traunstein (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reit Im Winkl}}\n[[Category:Traunstein (district)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox German location\n|image_coa            = DEU Reit im Winkl COA.svg\n|coordinates       = {{coord|47|41|N|12|28|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|image_plan          = Reit im Winkl in TS.svg\n|image_photo       = Reit im Winkl panorama 1.JPG\n|image_caption     = Reit im Winkl with Unterberg Wilder- and Zahmerkaiser\n|state        = Bayern\n|region  = Oberbayern\n|district         = Traunstein\n|Alpen             = Chiemgauer Alpen\n|elevation          = 696\n|elevationmax       = 1869\n|area            = 70.99\n|population         = 2629\n|Stand             = 2002\n|postal_code               = 83242\n|area_code           = 08640\n|licence               = TS\n|Gemeindeschl\u00fcssel = 03 1 55 007\n|divisions        = 10 [[Ortsteil]]e\n|Stra\u00dfe            = Rathausplatz 1\n|website           = [http://www.reitimwinkl.de Reit im Winkl]\n|mayor     = Josef Heigenhauser\n|party            = FW\n}}\n\n'''Reit im Winkl''' is a small village (locally known as a snow-magnet <ref>http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/ferien-auf-der-hemmersuppenalm--an-deutschlands-erstem-premium-winterwanderweg-zauberhaftes-schneeloch,10810590,10702806.html</ref>) located on the German/Austrian border in the southeastern part of [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]] in the [[Traunstein (district)|Traunstein district]], and was previously an immigration and customs control point (prior to the formation of the [[Schengen Zone]]). It is situated south of [[Chiemsee]] and southwest of [[Ruhpolding]] - home of the Biathlon World Cup - in the [[Bavarian Alps]] and facing towards Tyrol. The village lies next to the Austrian states [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]]. [[K\u00f6ssen]] in Tyrol is the next village on the river Lofer, before it joins the confluence of the river [[Tiroler Achen]].  Reit im Winkl has a population of approximately 2,600.\n\nReit im Winkl is well known as both a certified place of restorative and curative air (Luftkurort) and a [[ski resort]], offering [[alpine skiing]], [[cross-country skiing]], both classical and skating, and [[snow-boarding]], as well as mountain trekking and [[hiking]]. It achieved, in 2012, Germany's first-ever Premium Winter Trails Certification.<ref>http://www.reitimwinkl.de/winterwandern-premium-winterwanderwege</ref> Snowfall is always plentiful and predictable (even when surrounding areas are bare of snow, Reit im Winkl can be sure of sufficient snow to create premier skiing conditions - in 2012 Reit im Winkl had the deepest snow of 120&nbsp;cm for a plateau area,<ref>http://www.wetterdienst.de/Deutschlandwetter/Thema_des_Tages/850/deutschlandwetter-im-jahr-2012</ref> which occurred in February, long after snow had melted elsewhere in the region. Reit im Winkl has two alpine skiing areas: 1) Three lifts in the suburb of Blindau (Benzeck) as well as a snow-tubing lift, and the large plateau skiing area at Winklmoos Alm <ref>[http://www.winklmoosalm.de/ www.winklmoosalm.de]</ref> which connects with [[:de:Steinplatte|Steinplatte]] in Austria and is reached by the recently completed, state-of-the-art gondola cableway (bubble lift) from Seegatterl.\n\nIn summer, Reit im Winkl enjoys one of the highest counts of sunny days in Bavaria, and is popular with [[mountain bike]] and [[nordic walking]] enthusiasts.  Visitors can enjoy swimming in either of the three [[alpine lake]]s (Weitsee, Mittersee and Loedensee) northeast of Seegatterl, or try their luck at fishing in the trout lake.\n\nReit im Winkl is popularly known to locals and return visitors as Germany's own Tyrol, and boasts its own home-grown regional specialities such as ''Heumilch'' cheese (cheese made from cows fed exclusively hay pasture), ''heuschnapps'' (a liqueur in which mountain hay and herbs are soaked to produce a distinctive and sweet taste of hay) and ''Reiberdatschi'' (grated potatoes mixed with a little egg and flour and poured as a flat mass into a skillet and fried), popularly eaten with apple mousse.\n\n==Suburbs==\nReit im Winkl is divided into the suburbs Birnbach, Blindau, Entfelden, Groissenbach, Oberbichl, Seegatterl, Unterbichl and Winklmoos Alm.\n\n==History==\n\nThe first signs of settlement in Reit im Winkl are in the 12th century. The date of the foundation is 1160 when Otto de Rute was named in a document. The accuracy of the document is disputed and some historians put the beginning of the settlement to the middle of the 13th century. Since then it has been part of Bavaria.\n\nReit im Winkl was part of the parish of [[Kirchdorf in Tirol]] which was itself part of the [[diocese of Chiemsee]] from 1275 until 1804.\n\nHistorians have assumed the location of the manor of the Herren von Reit (Lords of Reit), on a small hill above the church.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe [[coat of arms]] was created 1929 replacing the old coat of arms which showed a blue chapel on a green hill. The new coat of arms shows the eagle on yellow ground of the diocese of Chiemsee in a corner (Winkl derived from the German word Winkel for corner). The burning log and the sapie (axe like tool to trail logs) on the forest green ground are symbols for the clearing of the forest to create pasture and farm land in 11th and 12th century.\n\n==Economy==\n\n===History===\n\nFormerly, Reit im Winkl was mostly dependent on logging and forestry, because of the brevity of the growing season for agricultural production. Trees were logged in summer and transported to storage places with horses or by hand. Logs were transferred to neighbouring Tyrol for sale: in winter either via sleds with a man sitting in front using his feet to brake and control the sled, which resulted in severe accidents occurring regularly, or via dams which were constructed to hold the meltwater during spring in order to raft the timber down the valley - such a dam can be found on display at Winklmoss Alm. Because the orientation of the valley made it impossible to sell the rafted wood to the [[Saltern|salt works]] of [[Bad Reichenhall]] or [[Traunstein]] - which had an enormous fuel consumption - logs were sent south. In one such contract the wood was sold to the silver works in the Inn valley in Tyrol and as an exchange Tyrol sold logs to the salt works in Bad Reichenhall.\n\n===Today===\n\nThe first tourist to Reit im Winkl, in the year 1858, was King Maximilian II, as reported in the local press. The [[Strength Through Joy]] movement in the Third Reich and the closed borders after the war boosted tourism as the principal source of income in the region. Today, approximately 5000 beds for annual visitor numbers of 90 000 provides an indication of the importance of tourism for Reit im Winkl.\n\n==Transport==\n\n[[File:German Alps Road (B 305), near Reit im Winkl, Germany.JPG|thumb|German Alps Road (B 305), near Reit im Winkl, Germany|280x280px]]\n\nReit im Winkl is located along the Deutschen Alpenstra\u00dfe (B 305) (German Alps Road).  Coming from Munich by car it can be reached either from the Munich-Salzburg highway A8 at [[Bernau am Chiemsee|Bernau]] or [[Chiemsee]] and the [[Tiroler Achen]] valley; coming from Salzburg along the Munich-Salzburg A8 at Siegsdorf or [[Grabenstatt]] via [[Ruhpolding]], or through Bad Reichenhall via [[Berchtesgarden]]. The Maserer pass (B305, direction [[Marquartstein]]) has been renovated and widened (most recently at the end of the 20th century) - during periods of heavy snowfall, [[snow chains]] are recommended. The B305 continues through the village, across the border into Austria and follows the river Lofer river to K\u00f6ssen straight into the Inn valley. Because of the need for transport capacities for the sawmills and logs from the surrounding forest a [[narrow gauge railway]] was built from Ruhpolding to Reit im Winkl in 1923. Following accidents and as a result of the high maintenance costs (winter conditions) the railway was demolished in the 1930s.

Its affiliate [[EPM Telecomunicaciones]], which operates under the name [[Tigo (Colombia)|UNE]], controls seven other companies in various cities around the country.\n\nOrganized as a state-owned, industrial and commercial enterprise, owned by the municipality of Medellin, EPM provides [[electricity]], [[gas]], [[water]], [[sanitation]], and [[telecommunications]].\n\nEPM is present in following areas in Colombia: [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Manizales]], [[Armenia]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[C\u00facuta]], [[Barranquilla]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Cali]], and [[Quibd\u00f3]].\n\nEPM international: in [[Panama]], the company is implementing the [[Bonyic hydroelectric project]] through its affiliate ''Hidroecol\u00f3gica del Teribe''.  In [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]], it is providing advice and technical assistance for the implementation of potable water, sanitary sewers, and wastewater treatment projects; and it is providing telecommunications services in the United States and Spain under the brand UNE.\n\n[[File:EDIFICIO EPM.jpg|thumb|240px|[[EPM Intelligent Building]], the headquarters of EPM.]].\n\n==Strategic business units==\nElectricity, gas over a pipeline, waters and telecommunications:  EPM has been active in these four areas of public utilities and is currently implementing a number of projects to consolidate its leadership.\n\n===Energy===\nResearch and use of different energy sources, the development of a complete distribution system that reaches every musicality and Antioquia, and the provision of gas over a network are aspects of a company that holds an outstanding place in the Colombian electrical sector, supplying 23.9% share of the demand in the country.\n\nEPM has built the backbone of the hydroelectric system in Colombia.  After many years of experience developing hydroelectric projects, EPM has been advancing for more than a decade with research on the use of other energy sources as a way to contribute to the planet's environmental sustainability and to open new areas for its national and international growth.\n\n* Net effective capacity of EPM's generation system: 2597.6 MW, equivalent to 19.34% of the nation\u2019s installed generation capacity.\n* Distribution system: 22% of the national total.\n* Gas over a pipeline: 9% share in the Colombian market.\n\n====Energy generation====\n* [[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric]] power stations: 24\n* [[Thermopower|Thermoelectric]] power stations: 1 (La Sierra thermoelectric power station, municipality of [[Puerto Nare]], Antioquia)\n* [[Wind Farm]]s: 1 (Jepirachi, in the upper Colombian region Guajira)\n\n[[Porce III Dam|Porce III and Porce IV]], with a capacity of 660 MW and 400 MW respectively, are two of the hydroelectric generation projects currently under construction.\n\nThe first generation unit in Porce III will start producing electrical energy at the end of 2010, and around the same time construction of the first civil works for Porce IV will begin. Operations will start in 2015.\n\nIn Panama, through its affiliate ''Hidrol\u00f3gica del Teribe'' (HET), the Bonyic hydroelectric power station is being built. This power station will be able to generate up to 31.3 MW and will contribute to decrease that country's dependence on imported oil and other fossil fuels that are highly contaminating of the environment.\n\nIn Colombia, EPM is also part of the corporation that is working to develop the [[Ituango Dam|Hidroituango project]], which will have the largest capacity in the country with a total of 2400 MW.\n\nAll these projects that consolidate EPM's important role in the Colombian electrical landscape also indicate the path taken in their research on alternative energy sources. For example, the pioneering experience of [[Renewable_energy_in_Colombia#Wind|Jepirachi]] which uses wind energy, and La Vuelta and La Herradura micro power stations which meet the conditions established by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] as a mechanism for clean development.\n\n====Energy transmission and distribution====\n* Networks: 60,255&nbsp;km\n* Transformers: 90,000\n* Substations: 133\n\nEPM brings the magic of light to thousands of people in Antioquia.  Its energy transmission and distribution strategic business unit (SBU) transports and sells energy, reaching 1,720,000 homes in 123 municipalities around Antioquia, and in one municipality of [[Choc\u00f3]], covering an area of approximately 64,000&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\nIn the rest of Colombia, it provides this utility to 340 municipalities through its affiliates CHEC and EDEQ in the [[Colombian coffee growing axis]], and in the east of the country through two other companies in its portfolio: ESSA and CENS in the [[Santander Department]] and [[Norte de Santander Department]], respectively.

Its affiliate [[EPM Telecomunicaciones]], which operates under the name [[Tigo (Colombia)|UNE]], controls seven other companies in various cities around the country.\n\nOrganized as a state-owned, industrial and commercial enterprise, owned by the municipality of Medellin, EPM provides [[electricity]], [[gas]], [[water]], [[sanitation]], and [[telecommunications]].\n\nEPM is present in following areas in Colombia: [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Manizales]], [[Armenia]], [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[C\u00facuta]], [[Barranquilla]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Cali]], and [[Quibd\u00f3]].\n\nEPM international: in [[Panama]], the company is implementing the [[Bonyic hydroelectric project]] through its affiliate ''Hidroecol\u00f3gica del Teribe''.  In [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]], it is providing advice and technical assistance for the implementation of potable water, sanitary sewers, and wastewater treatment projects; and it is providing telecommunications services in the United States and Spain under the brand UNE.\n\n[[File:EDIFICIO EPM.jpg|thumb|240px|[[EPM Intelligent Building]], the headquarters of EPM.]].\n\n==Strategic business units==\nElectricity, gas over a pipeline, waters and telecommunications:  EPM has been active in these four areas of public utilities and is currently implementing a number of projects to consolidate its leadership.\n\n===Energy===\nResearch and use of different energy sources, the development of a complete distribution system that reaches every musicality and Antioquia, and the provision of gas over a network are aspects of a company that holds an outstanding place in the Colombian electrical sector, supplying 23.9% share of the demand in the country.\n\nEPM has built the backbone of the hydroelectric system in Colombia.  After many years of experience developing hydroelectric projects, EPM has been advancing for more than a decade with research on the use of other energy sources as a way to contribute to the planet's environmental sustainability and to open new areas for its national and international growth.\n\n* Net effective capacity of EPM's generation system: 2597.6 MW, equivalent to 19.34% of the nation\u2019s installed generation capacity.\n* Distribution system: 22% of the national total.\n* Gas over a pipeline: 9% share in the Colombian market.\n\n====Energy generation====\n* [[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric]] power stations: 24\n* [[Thermopower|Thermoelectric]] power stations: 1 (La Sierra thermoelectric power station, municipality of [[Puerto Nare]], Antioquia)\n* [[Wind Farm]]s: 1 (Jepirachi, in the upper Colombian region Guajira)\n\n[[Porce III Dam|Porce III and Porce IV]], with a capacity of 660 MW and 400 MW respectively, are two of the hydroelectric generation projects currently under construction.\n\nThe first generation unit in Porce III will start producing electrical energy at the end of 2010, and around the same time construction of the first civil works for Porce IV will begin. Operations will start in 2015.\n\nIn Panama, through its affiliate ''Hidrol\u00f3gica del Teribe'' (HET), the Bonyic hydroelectric power station is being built. This power station will be able to generate up to 31.3 MW and will contribute to decrease that country's dependence on imported oil and other fossil fuels that are highly contaminating of the environment.\n\nIn Colombia, EPM is also part of the corporation that is working to develop the [[Ituango Dam|Hidroituango project]], which will have the largest capacity in the country with a total of 2400 MW.\n\nAll these projects that consolidate EPM's important role in the Colombian electrical landscape also indicate the path taken in their research on alternative energy sources. For example, the pioneering experience of [[Renewable_energy_in_Colombia#Wind|Jepirachi]] which uses wind energy, and La Vuelta and La Herradura micro power stations which meet the conditions established by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] as a mechanism for clean development.\n\n====Energy transmission and distribution====\n* Networks: 60,255&nbsp;km\n* Transformers: 90,000\n* Substations: 133\n\nEPM brings the magic of light to thousands of people in Antioquia.  Its energy transmission and distribution strategic business unit (SBU) transports and sells energy, reaching 1,720,000 homes in 123 municipalities around Antioquia, and in one municipality of [[Choc\u00f3]], covering an area of approximately 64,000&nbsp;km\u00b2.\n\nIn the rest of Colombia, it provides this utility to 340 municipalities through its affiliates CHEC and EDEQ in the [[Colombian coffee growing axis]], and in the east of the country through two other companies in its portfolio: ESSA and CENS in the [[Santander Department]] and [[Norte de Santander Department]], respectively.  The company is currently serving 12,000,000 Colombians.\n\n===Natural Gas===\n* Steel pipelines: 82.9&nbsp;km\n* Polyethylene pipelines: 3811&nbsp;km\n* Regulation stations: 16\n* Ringed customers: 798,891\n* Connected customers: 474,516\n\nSince 1996, when the pilot stage was implemented, EPM has been providing natural gas service over a pipeline, a safe, economical and environmentally friendly energy alternative which is currently being expanded to the ten municipalities that make up the [[Aburr\u00e1 Valley]], including [[Medellin]], and other locations around Antioquia.\n\nThe service has been diversified to meet the needs of industries, SME's, retailers and transportation providers, in addition to household subscribers. For large industrial companies, EPM expanded its natural gas coverage to the municipalities of [[Guarne]] and [[Rionegro]], in the East of Antioquia.\n\n====Residential natural ga88s====\n* Households served: 448,286\n* SME's and retailers: 6,572\n\nThe expansion into other municipalities in Antioquia started in 2009 using the Compressed Natural Gas system: [[La Ceja]], [[La Uni\u00f3n, Antioquia|La Uni\u00f3n]], and [[El Retiro, Antioquia|El Retiro]].\n\n====Natural gas for vehicles (VNG)====\nA service that is reflected in an improved quality of air for the [[Metropolitan area of Medellin]].\n\n* Vehicles converted to use natural gas in the Aburr\u00e1 Valley: 30,865\n* Service stations: 51\n\n===Water===\n* Potabilization plants: 10\n* Waterworks: 3,580&nbsp;km\n* Waste water collection and transportation networks: 4,315&nbsp;km\n* Coverage: 100% in the urban areas of the Aburr\u00e1 Valley\n\nPotable water, and waste water collection, transportation, and treatment are the services provided by EPM, throughout the ten municipalities of the Aburr\u00e1 Valley: Medellin, [[Bello]], [[Envigado]], [[Itag\u00fc\u00ed]], [[La Estrella]], [[Sabaneta]], [[Copacabana]], [[Girardota]], [[Caldas, Antioquia|Caldas]] and [[Barbosa]], with a total of 919,691 subscribers.\n\n====Regional companies====\nIn addition, in various parts of Antioquia and the country EPM continues to implement the model of regional water systems, with the regional companies for [[Urab\u00e1]], the West, [[Quibd\u00f3]], and the East of Antioquia.\n\nIn an alliance with several institutions in Antioquia, [[Empresas P\u00fablicas de Oriente]] was recently created to provide waterworks, sewer and sanitation services in several rural and suburban areas in the municipalities of Envigado, Rionegro, and El Retiro.\n\n====Cleanup of the Medellin River====\n[[File:R\u00edo Medell\u00edn desde la Avenida 33, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Medellin River.

look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.<ref name=Burghaus2012/> Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWith the increased risk of antipsychotics for people with DLB, educated caregivers are able to act as advocates for the person with DLB.<ref name=LBDACareMeds>{{cite web |url=

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.<ref name=Boot2015/>  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.<ref name=Boot2013/>  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/> placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.<ref name= Taylor2020/> Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/> According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/>\n\nDriving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.<ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/> Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are removed.<ref name=Boot2013/><ref name=LBDAEarlyCare>{{cite web |url= https://www.lbda.org/go/early-stage-lbd-caregiving |title= Early stage LBD caregiving | publisher= [[Lewy Body Dementia

avoid falls.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].<ref name=Mueller2017/> Relative to AD, DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |''APOE'' gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.<ref name=Boot2015/>\n\nCompared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the (possibly delayed) point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a poorer survival rate than in AD.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/> Falls\u2014caused by many factors including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and frailness\u2014increase [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name= Taylor2020/> [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias are as a group the second most

look away or look at something else, focus on or try to touch the hallucination, wait for it to go away on its own, and speak with others about the visualization.<ref name=Burghaus2012/> Delusions and hallucinations may be reduced by increasing lighting in the evening, and making sure there is no light at night when the individual with DLB is sleeping.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWith the increased risk of antipsychotics for people with DLB, educated caregivers are able to act as advocates for the person with DLB.<ref name=LBDACareMeds>{{cite web |url=

'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics\".<ref name=Gomperts2016/>  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.<ref name=Boot2015/>  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.<ref name=Boot2013/>  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\nWhen RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers can be counselled about the need to improve bedroom safety.<ref name=Walker2015/><ref name=StLouisNov2017/> Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by lowering the height of the bed,<ref name= Taylor2020/> placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.<ref name= Taylor2020/> Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/> According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.<ref name=StLouisNov2017/>\n\nDriving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.<ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/> Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are removed.<ref name=Boot2013/><ref name=LBDAEarlyCare>{{cite web |url= https://www.lbda.org/go/early-stage-lbd-caregiving |title= Early stage LBD caregiving | publisher= [[Lewy Body Dementia

avoid falls.<ref name=Boot2013/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].<ref name=Mueller2017/> Relative to AD, DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.<ref name= Tahami2019/> Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,<ref name=Walker2015/> when the [[Apolipoprotein |''APOE'' gene]] is present, or when AD\u2014or its [[biomarker]]s\u2014is also present.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.<ref name=Boot2015/>\n\nCompared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.<ref name=Mueller2017/> There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Tahami<ref name= Tahami2019/> and Mueller, those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate of hospitalization compared to AD is most commonly related to hallucinations and confusion, followed by falls and infection.<ref name= Tahami2019/>  \n\nLife expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.<ref name=Mueller2017/> Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the (possibly delayed) point of diagnosis.<ref name=Mueller2017/>  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&nbsp;years, and a poorer survival rate than in AD.<ref name=Mueller2017/> The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,<ref name=NINDS2019/> though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&nbsp;years.<ref name=NINDS2020Book/> Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.<ref name=Mueller2017/> In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.<ref name=NIH2018Bas/> Falls\u2014caused by many factors including parkinsonism, dysautonomia, and frailness\u2014increase [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]].<ref name= Taylor2020/> [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with the Lewy body dementias.<ref name= Taylor2020/><ref name=Palma2018/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe Lewy body dementias are as a group the second most
