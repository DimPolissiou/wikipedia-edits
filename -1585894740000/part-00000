LeRoy-Ostrander serves 305 students K-12.  Ray Arsenault is the current superintendent that tries to stay awake between naps and being the school boards puppet.  Steve Kasel is the current board chair that makes former board chair Justin Kennedy look good.  Steve spends his time drooling, and attempting to micromanage the district.  Thank goodness LO has an established staff that can survive another corrupt school board that puts zero emphasis on the kids of the district.\nAaron Hungerholt is the principal.<ref>http://www.leroy.k12.mn.us/</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.leroy.k12.mn.us/ http://www.leroy.k12.mn.us/]\n\n[[Category:Public high schools in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Schools in Mower County, Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Public middle schools in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Public elementary schools in Minnesota]]\n\n\n{{Minnesota-school-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2015}}\n\n{{Coord|43|30|48|N|92|30|35|W|display=title}}\n\n'''LeRoy-Ostrander High School''' is a [[high school]] in southeastern [[Minnesota]] located in the town of [[Le Roy, Minnesota]] in the United States.
