LSU opened their next drive with a touchback, and recorded a first down for the first time, but again punted, giving Clemson the ball at their own 25; Clemson punted right back, and LSU took over at their own 29. On this drive, the LSU offense moved the ball seventy yards in just 4 plays, capped by a long [[Joe Burrow]] pass to wide receiver [[Ja'Marr Chase]], tying the game at seven with 2:20 remaining in the opening quarter.

This did not deter the Clemson offense, as they covered the ninety-six yards ahead of them in only four plays, capping the touchdown drive with a long run by [[Tee Higgins]]; this extended Clemson's lead to ten. LSU responded with a quick drive of their own, scoring in five plays to narrow the lead to three. Clemson's next drive ended in a punt, and LSU capitalized with another long touchdown drive to take their first lead of the contest, by four, with just over five minutes until halftime. Clemson was unable to respond on offense; they punted and LSU got the ball on their own 5-yard-line.

For the first time in nearly an entire quarter, the Clemson offense found the end zone, as [[Travis Etienne]] capped a 6 play drive with his first touchdown of the day. Trevor Lawrence completed a pass to Amari Rodgers for the two-point conversion, cutting the LSU lead to three points. Joe Burrow's offense was again unable to produce on offense, and the second half (as did the first half) began with two three-and-outs for LSU. Clemson's next drive finished similarly, as a punt followed four plays totaling 14 yards. LSU took over on their own 32. On the fifth play of LSU's ensuing drive, Clemson starting MLB James Skalski was ejected from the game for a [[Helmet-to-helmet collision|targeting penalty]]; LSU scored on the next play on a touchdown pass from Burrow to Thaddeus Moss (one that gave Burrow sole possession of the FBS record for touchdown passes in a season with 59)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chippin |first1=Alex |title=Burrow breaks FBS single-season TD pass record |url=https://www.thescore.com/ncaaf/news/1926980 |website=theScore.com |accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref> to increase their lead to ten.

After a promising start to their opening drive, Clemson was forced to punt on 4th-and-23, giving LSU the ball on their own 7-yard-line. LSU's opening drive was far less productive, as they punted after three plays totaling a net loss of four yards. Clemson opened their ensuing drive on the LSU 45. A [[three-and-out]] followed, but the Clemson punt coverage team again came up big, downing the ball at the 4-yard-line. While the next LSU drive resulted in positive yards, a punt was the end result, and Clemson took over at their own 33 and scored in five plays, opening the scoring with a [[Trevor Lawrence (American football)|Trevor Lawrence]] rushing touchdown 8:26 into the game. LSU opened their next drive with a touchback, and recorded a first down for the first time, but again punted, giving Clemson the ball at their own 25; Clemson punted right back, and LSU took over at their own 29. On this drive, the LSU offense moved the ball seventy yards in just 4 plays, capped by a long [[Joe Burrow]] pass to wide receiver [[Ja'Marr Chase]], tying the game at seven with 2:20 remaining in the opening quarter. Clemson had possession for the remainder of the quarter, and made it to the LSU 42 before time expired.<ref name=liveupdates>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/lsu-vs-clemson-score-live-updates-college-football-national-championship-2020-game-highlights/live/|title=LSU vs. Clemson score: Live updates, college football national championship 2020 game highlights|first=Barrett|last=Sallee|work=CBS Sports|date=January 13, 2020|accessdate=January 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114041843/https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/lsu-vs-clemson-score-live-updates-college-football-national-championship-2020-game-highlights/live/|archive-date=January 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=PlayByPlay>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/gametracker/playbyplay/NCAAF_20200113_CLEM@LSU/ |title=Clemson Tigers vs. LSU Tigers Play-by-Play |website=[[CBS Sports]] |date=January 13, 2020 |accessdate=January 13, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114042810/https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/gametracker/playbyplay/NCAAF_20200113_CLEM@LSU/ |archive-date=January 14, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nClemson ran three additional plays in the second quarter before settling for a 52-yard field goal, converted by kicker B.T. Potter, giving them a 10\u20137 edge. Following LSU's fourth punt of the evening, Clemson started with their worst field position yet, as they got the ball at their own 4. This did not deter the Clemson offense, as they covered the ninety-six yards ahead of them in only four plays, capping the touchdown drive with a long run by [[Tee Higgins]]; this extended Clemson's lead to ten. LSU responded with a quick drive of their own, scoring in five plays to narrow the lead to three. Clemson's next drive ended in a punt, and LSU capitalized with another long touchdown drive to take their first lead of the contest, by four, with just over five minutes until halftime. Clemson was unable to respond on offense; they punted and LSU got the ball on their own 5-yard-line. Joe Burrow and the LSU offense continued to build their momentum with their third consecutive touchdown drive of 75-plus yards to increase the lead to 11, 28\u201317, heading into halftime.<ref name=liveupdates/><ref name=PlayByPlay/>\n\n[[File:2020-0113-ClydeEdwards-Helaire.jpg|thumb|left|upright|LSU running back [[Clyde Edwards-Helaire]] gives a post-game interview.]]\nLSU opened the second half by receiving the kickoff; their ensuing drive resulted in a three-and-out, and Clemson took over on the 50-yard-line. For the first time in nearly an entire quarter, the Clemson offense found the end zone, as [[Travis Etienne]] capped a 6 play drive with his first touchdown of the day. Trevor Lawrence completed a pass to Amari Rodgers for the two-point conversion, cutting the LSU lead to three points. Joe Burrow's offense was again unable to produce on offense, and the second half (as did the first half) began with two three-and-outs for LSU. Clemson's next drive finished similarly, as a punt followed four plays totaling 14 yards. LSU took over on their own 32. On the fifth play of LSU's ensuing drive, Clemson starting MLB James Skalski was ejected from the game for a [[Helmet-to-helmet collision|targeting penalty]]; LSU scored on the next play on a touchdown pass from Burrow to Thaddeus Moss (one that gave Burrow sole possession of the FBS record for touchdown passes in a season with 59)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chippin |first1=Alex |title=Burrow breaks FBS single-season TD pass record |url=https://www.thescore.com/ncaaf/news/1926980 |website=theScore.com |accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref> to increase their lead to ten. Clemson couldn't produce on their next drive, and punted for the seventh time; LSU got the ball on their own 32. They drove to the Clemson 27 before attempting a 45-yard field goal, which Cade York missed wide right. Lawrence and the Clemson offense were unable to capitalize on the mistake, however; they went three-and-out and punted to the LSU 43. The quarter expired several plays later; LSU entered the fourth quarter leading 35\u201325.<ref name=liveupdates/><ref name=PlayByPlay/>\n\n[[File:2020-0113-OrgeronBurrowQueen.PNG|thumb|right|Orgeron along with Offensive MVP Joe Burrow and Defensive MVP Patrick Queen at the post-game presser.]]\n\nLSU came out firing in the fourth quarter; they scored for just the second time this half on a Joe Burrow pass to [[Terrace Marshall Jr.]], his first receiving touchdown of the contest. For the fourth drive in a row, Clemson punted; the ball was downed at the LSU 10. After taking 5:24 off the clock, LSU punted the ball back, and Clemson took over with just under five minutes left, on their own 15. However, three plays later, Trevor Lawrence fumbled at the end of his rush; it was recovered by LSU's [[Derek Stingley Jr.]] with 3:53 to go.

It was released on August 28, 1973, by the [[Motown Records]] subsidiary label Tamla.\n\nRecording sessions for the album took place during June 1970 to July 1973 at [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] and [[Golden World Studio]] in Detroit, and at [[Hitsville West]] in Los Angeles. Serving as Gaye's first venture into the [[funk]] genre and romance-themed music, ''Let's Get It On'' incorporates [[smooth soul]], [[doo-wop]], and [[quiet storm]]. It has been noted by critics for its sexually suggestive lyrics, and was cited by one writer as \"one of the most sexually charged albums ever recorded\".\n\nFollowing the breakthrough success of his socially conscious album ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' (1971), ''Let's Get It On'' helped establish Gaye as a sex icon and furthered his mainstream appeal. It produced three singles\u2014[[Let's Get It On (song)|the title track]], \"[[Come Get to This]]\", and \"[[You Sure Love to Ball]]\"\u2014that attained ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' chart success. ''Let's Get It On'' became the most commercially successful album of Gaye's recording career, and it further expanded his creative control during his tenure with Motown. Its sexual balladry, [[Multitrack recording|multi-tracking]] of Gaye's vocals, and seductive, funk sound influenced later R&B artists and production.\n\nThe album has been regarded by many music writers and critics as a landmark recording in soul music. It furthered funk music's popularity during the 1970s, and its smooth soul sound marked a change for his record label's previous success with the \"[[Motown Records#Motown Sound|Motown Sound]]\" formula. ''Let's Get It On'' has been ranked on many critics and publications' lists of the best albums of all time. In 2001, it was reissued by Motown Records as a two-disc [[deluxe edition]] release.\n\n== Background ==\nIn the spring of 1972, Marvin Gaye was suffering from writer's block.<ref name=edm7>Edmonds (2001), pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Following the release of his most commercially successful album up to that point, ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' (1971), and the [[Trouble Man (album)|soundtrack album]] to the [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Trouble Man (film)|Trouble Man]]'' (1972), Gaye had struggled to come up with new material after [[Motown Records]] had renegotiated a new contract with him. The contract provided him with more creative control over his recordings. The deal was worth $1 million, making him the highest-earning soul artist, as well as the highest-earning black artist, at the time.<ref name=\"bbc\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A23192868 Marvin Gaye - Singer/Songwriter]. BBC - h2g2. Retrieved on 2008-08-24.</ref> He was also struggling with deciding whether or not to relocate to Los Angeles, following Motown-CEO [[Berry Gordy]]'s move of the record label and replacement of the Detroit-based [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] (Motown Studio A) recording studio with the [[Hitsville West]] studio in Los Angeles. Amid relocation and his lack of material, Gaye was struggling with his conscience, as well as dealing with expectations from his wife, Gordy's sister [[Anna Gordy|Anna]]. Gaye's separation from Gordy pressured him emotionally. During this time, he had also been attempting to cope with past issues that had stemmed from his childhood.<ref name=edm7/>\n\nDuring his childhood, Gaye had been physically abused by his preacher father [[Marvin Gay, Sr.]], who disciplined his son under extremely moralistic and fundamentalist Christian teachings. As a result, the meaning and practice of sex had later become a disturbing question for Gaye. As an adult, he suffered from impotence and became plagued by [[sadomasochistic]] fantasies, which haunted him in his dreams and provoked intense feelings of guilt. According to Gaye's biographer [[David Ritz]], \"his view of sex was unsettled, tormented, riddled with pain\".<ref name=ritz2>Ritz a (2001), p. 2.</ref> Gaye learned to cope with his personal issues with a newly found spirituality. He began incorporating his new outlook into his music, as initially expressed through the socially conscious album ''What's Going On'', along with promotional photos of him wearing a [[kufi]] in honor of [[African traditional religion]]s and his faith.<ref name=edm7/>\n\nBy winning over record executives with the success of ''What's Going On'', Gaye attained more creative control, which he would use, following his brief separation from wife Anna Gordy, to record an album that was meant to surface themes beyond sex.<ref name=ritz2/> As with ''What's Going On'', Gaye wanted to have a deeper meaning than the general theme that was used to portray it; in the case of the former, politics, and with its follow-up effort, love and romance, which would be used by Gaye as a metaphor for God's love.<ref name=ritz2/> In his book ''Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye'', David Ritz wrote of Gaye and the musical inspiration behind Gaye's second landmark record:\n\n{{quote|If the most profound soul songs are prayers in secular dress, Marvin's prayer is to reconcile the ecstasy of his early religious epiphany with a sexual epiphany. The hope for such a reconciliation, the search for sexual healing, is what drives his art&nbsp;... The paradox is this: The sexiest of Marvin Gaye's work is also his most spiritual. That's the paradox of Marvin himself. In his struggle to wed body and soul, in his exploration of sexual passion, he expresses the most human of hungers\u2014the hunger for God. In those songs of loss and lament\u2014the sense of separation is heartbreaking. On one level, the separation is between man and woman. On a deeper level, the separation is between man and God.<ref>Ritz b (1991), p. 203</ref>}}\n\nIn the album's liner notes, Gaye explained his views on the themes of sex and love, stating \"I can't see anything wrong with sex between consenting anybodies. I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially in the area of the psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky.\"<ref>Gaye (2001), liner excerpt</ref>\n\n== Recording ==\nGaye proceeded to record some more politically conscious material at the [[Golden World Records]] studio, known as Motown's Studio B, as well as the preliminary vocals and instrumentation for some of the material to be featured on ''Let's Get It On''.<ref name=\"gworld\"/> Following the earlier sessions in Detroit at Golden World, Gaye recorded at Hitsville West in Los Angeles from February to July 1973.<ref name=\"gworld\"/> Accompanied by an experienced group of session musicians called [[The Funk Brothers]], who had contributed to Gaye's ''What's Going On'', and received their first official credit, Gaye recorded the unreleased songs \"The World is Rated X\" and \"Where Are We Going\" and the single \"[[You're the Man]]\" (1972) at Golden World.<ref name=\"gworld\"/> \"Where Are We Going\" was later covered by trumpeter [[Donald Byrd]]. Gaye had planned the release of an album titled ''You're the Man'', but it was later shelved for unknown reasons. The songs that were to be included on it, along with other unreleased recordings from Hitsville West and Golden World, were later featured on the 2001 re-release of ''Let's Get It On''.<ref name=deluxe>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r551939|pure_url=yes}} allmusic Let's Get It On (Deluxe Edition) - Overview ].

The label's well-known sound, however, was beginning to fade in popularity among the majority of R&B and soul listeners, while experiencing commercial pressure from contemporary styles that incorporated more diverse elements, such as [[Philly soul]] and [[funk]].<ref name=edm15/> The Motown sound was typified by characteristics such as the use of [[tambourine]]s to accent the [[beat (music)|back beat]], prominent and often melodic electric [[bass guitar]] lines, distinctive [[Melody|melodic]] and [[Chord (music)|chord]] structures, and a [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] singing style that originated in [[gospel music]]. In addition, pop production techniques were simpler than that of Gaye's 1970s concept albums. Complex arrangements and elaborate, [[melisma]]tic vocal riffs were avoided by Motown musicians.<ref name=edm15/> Following his breakthrough with ''What's Going On'', an \"experiment in collating a pseudo-classical suite of free-flowing songs\",<ref name=\"slant\">[http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=375 Slant Magazine Music Review: Marvin Gaye: What's Going On] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031219233229/http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=375 |date=2003-12-19 }}.

In contrast to Motown's previously successful process of emphasizing an artist's single releases rather than their album, Gaye and fellow producer Ed Townsend followed a similar formula previously used on ''What's Going On'', in which the album's songs flow together in a suite-form arrangement,<ref name=johnstone>Johnstone (1999), p. 193.</ref> opposing label CEO Berry Gordy's strong emphasis on hit single success.<ref name=\"slant\"/>\n\nThe album also affirmed Gaye's influence over later R&B styles and artists.<ref name=\"Hoard\">Hoard, Christian. \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=lRgtYCC6OUwC&pg=PA324&dq= Review: ''Let's Get It On'']\".

It was released on August 28, 1973, by the [[Motown Records]] subsidiary label Tamla.\n\nRecording sessions for the album took place during June 1970 to July 1973 at [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] and [[Golden World Studio]] in Detroit, and at [[Hitsville West]] in Los Angeles. Serving as Gaye's first venture into the [[funk]] genre and romance-themed music, ''Let's Get It On'' incorporates [[smooth soul]], [[doo-wop]], and [[quiet storm]]. It has been noted by critics for its sexually suggestive lyrics, and was cited by one writer as \"one of the most sexually charged albums ever recorded\".\n\nFollowing the breakthrough success of his socially conscious album ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' (1971), ''Let's Get It On'' helped establish Gaye as a sex icon and furthered his mainstream appeal. It produced three singles\u2014[[Let's Get It On (song)|the title track]], \"[[Come Get to This]]\", and \"[[You Sure Love to Ball]]\"\u2014that attained ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' chart success. ''Let's Get It On'' became the most commercially successful album of Gaye's recording career, and it further expanded his creative control during his tenure with Motown. Its sexual balladry, [[Multitrack recording|multi-tracking]] of Gaye's vocals, and seductive, funk sound influenced later R&B artists and production.\n\nThe album has been regarded by many music writers and critics as a landmark recording in soul music. It furthered funk music's popularity during the 1970s, and its smooth soul sound marked a change for his record label's previous success with the \"[[Motown Records#Motown Sound|Motown Sound]]\" formula. ''Let's Get It On'' has been ranked on many critics and publications' lists of the best albums of all time. In 2001, it was reissued by Motown Records as a two-disc [[deluxe edition]] release.\n\n== Background ==\nIn the spring of 1972, Marvin Gaye was suffering from writer's block.<ref name=edm7>Edmonds (2001), pp. 7\u20138.</ref> Following the release of his most commercially successful album up to that point, ''[[What's Going On (Marvin Gaye album)|What's Going On]]'' (1971), and the [[Trouble Man (album)|soundtrack album]] to the [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Trouble Man (film)|Trouble Man]]'' (1972), Gaye had struggled to come up with new material after [[Motown Records]] had renegotiated a new contract with him. The contract provided him with more creative control over his recordings. The deal was worth $1 million, making him the highest-earning soul artist, as well as the highest-earning black artist, at the time.<ref name=\"bbc\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A23192868 Marvin Gaye - Singer/Songwriter]. BBC - h2g2. Retrieved on 2008-08-24.</ref> He was also struggling with deciding whether or not to relocate to Los Angeles, following Motown-CEO [[Berry Gordy]]'s move of the record label and replacement of the Detroit-based [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] (Motown Studio A) recording studio with the [[Hitsville West]] studio in Los Angeles. Amid relocation and his lack of material, Gaye was struggling with his conscience, as well as dealing with expectations from his wife, Gordy's sister [[Anna Gordy|Anna]]. Gaye's separation from Gordy pressured him emotionally. During this time, he had also been attempting to cope with past issues that had stemmed from his childhood.<ref name=edm7/>\n\nDuring his childhood, Gaye had been physically abused by his preacher father [[Marvin Gay, Sr.]], who disciplined his son under extremely moralistic and fundamentalist Christian teachings. As a result, the meaning and practice of sex had later become a disturbing question for Gaye. As an adult, he suffered from impotence and became plagued by [[sadomasochistic]] fantasies, which haunted him in his dreams and provoked intense feelings of guilt. According to Gaye's biographer [[David Ritz]], \"his view of sex was unsettled, tormented, riddled with pain\".<ref name=ritz2>Ritz a (2001), p. 2.</ref> Gaye learned to cope with his personal issues with a newly found spirituality. He began incorporating his new outlook into his music, as initially expressed through the socially conscious album ''What's Going On'', along with promotional photos of him wearing a [[kufi]] in honor of [[African traditional religion]]s and his faith.<ref name=edm7/>\n\nBy winning over record executives with the success of ''What's Going On'', Gaye attained more creative control, which he would use, following his brief separation from wife Anna Gordy, to record an album that was meant to surface themes beyond sex.<ref name=ritz2/> As with ''What's Going On'', Gaye wanted to have a deeper meaning than the general theme that was used to portray it; in the case of the former, politics, and with its follow-up effort, love and romance, which would be used by Gaye as a metaphor for God's love.<ref name=ritz2/> In his book ''Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye'', David Ritz wrote of Gaye and the musical inspiration behind Gaye's second landmark record:\n\n{{quote|If the most profound soul songs are prayers in secular dress, Marvin's prayer is to reconcile the ecstasy of his early religious epiphany with a sexual epiphany. The hope for such a reconciliation, the search for sexual healing, is what drives his art&nbsp;... The paradox is this: The sexiest of Marvin Gaye's work is also his most spiritual. That's the paradox of Marvin himself. In his struggle to wed body and soul, in his exploration of sexual passion, he expresses the most human of hungers\u2014the hunger for God. In those songs of loss and lament\u2014the sense of separation is heartbreaking. On one level, the separation is between man and woman. On a deeper level, the separation is between man and God.<ref>Ritz b (1991), p. 203</ref>}}\n\nIn the album's liner notes, Gaye explained his views on the themes of sex and love, stating \"I can't see anything wrong with sex between consenting anybodies. I think we make far too much of it. After all, one's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially in the area of the psyche. I don't believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you're lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky.\"<ref>Gaye (2001), liner excerpt</ref>\n\n== Recording ==\nGaye proceeded to record some more politically conscious material at the [[Golden World Records]] studio, known as Motown's Studio B, as well as the preliminary vocals and instrumentation for some of the material to be featured on ''Let's Get It On''.<ref name=\"gworld\"/> Following the earlier sessions in Detroit at Golden World, Gaye recorded at Hitsville West in Los Angeles from February to July 1973.<ref name=\"gworld\"/> Accompanied by an experienced group of session musicians called [[The Funk Brothers]], who had contributed to Gaye's ''What's Going On'', and received their first official credit, Gaye recorded the unreleased songs \"The World is Rated X\" and \"Where Are We Going\" and the single \"[[You're the Man]]\" (1972) at Golden World.<ref name=\"gworld\"/> \"Where Are We Going\" was later covered by trumpeter [[Donald Byrd]]. Gaye had planned the release of an album titled ''You're the Man'', but it was later shelved for unknown reasons.

In addition, pop production techniques were simpler than that of Gaye's 1970s concept albums.

In contrast to Motown's previously successful process of emphasizing an artist's single releases rather than their album, Gaye and fellow producer Ed Townsend followed a similar formula previously used on ''What's Going On'', in which the album's songs flow together in a suite-form arrangement,<ref name=johnstone>Johnstone (1999), p. 193.</ref> opposing label CEO Berry Gordy's strong emphasis on hit single success.<ref name=\"slant\"/>\n\nThe album also affirmed Gaye's influence over later R&B styles and artists.<ref name=\"Hoard\">Hoard, Christian. \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=lRgtYCC6OUwC&pg=PA324&dq= Review: ''Let's Get It On'']\".
