His father was Ludwig Wissel, a helmsman, his mother was Ulrike, n\u00e9e Klimmet. He went to school in [[Bremen]] from 1876-83. In 1883, he started an apprenticeship as a mechanical engineer.

In 1890, he brought the ''Fachverein'' into the newly founded ''[[Deutscher Metallarbeiter-Verband]]''. From 1891-3, he served in a Prussian [[Grenadier]] regiment stationed in [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]]. Following military service, Wissell worked as a lathe operator at [[Kiel]] and for the ''Metallarbeiter-Verband'' from 1893-1901. He also attended courses in law.

In the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|German Revolution]], Wissell became ''Zweiter Vorsitzender'' (deputy chairman) of the ''Generalkommission'' where he opposed the formation of a [[Soviet republic (system of government)|government based on workers' and soldiers' councils]] and argued for an agreement with employers. He supported the foundation of the ''[[Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund]]'' (ADG).<ref name=\"DHM\"/>\n\nOne result of his arguments was the conclusion of the Stinnes-Legien Agreement, which meant that the employer's associations for the first time recognised the trade unions as the representatives of the workers.\n\nOn 28 December 1918, the three representatives of the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (USPD) withdrew from the [[Council of the People's Deputies]], the de facto government of Germany, and Wissell along with [[Gustav Noske]] became members.<ref name=\"DHM\"/>\n\n== Weimar Republic ==\nIn January 1919, Wissel was elected for the SPD to the [[Weimar National Assembly|National Assembly]]. One and a half years later, in June 1920, he was elected to the first [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] of the Weimar Republic. He was re-elected seven times from 1924 to 1933, and was a member of the German parliament for almost exactly 13 years, from June 1920 to June 1933.\n\nApart from his work as a member of the Reichstag, Wissell filled various high public offices in the 1920s. From February to July 1919, he was the first ''Reichswirtschaftsminister'' (Minister for Economic Affairs) of the republic. In this function in the cabinets of [[Philipp Scheidemann]] and [[Gustav Bauer]], he opposed the left-wing councils and worked towards a socially controlled economy for the benefit of the community.

In this position, he opposed all strikes to help overcome the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"DHM\"/>\n\nAs a politician engaged in social policy, Wissell was a member of the executive committee of the ADG from 1919 to 1924. From 1924 to 1932, he was also an arbitrator in pay negotiations in Berlin and Brandenburg. In 1929, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Kiel]] due to his public service.<ref name=\"DHM\"/>\n\n== Nazi Germany ==\nThe important parliamentary activities that Wissell participated in during his time in the Reichstag included the vote on the [[Enabling Act]] in March 1933: here, he was one of 94 members who voted against the law that created the legal foundations for the Nazi dictatorship. It was passed by 444 votes to 94.\n\nAfter the Nazis' rise to power in early 1933, Wissell was expelled from public life, being a prominent Social Democrat.

Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger\u2014come to life and influence her ways of doing things via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important \"core memories\" are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves with her parents to San Francisco for her father's new job. Riley's first experiences are not good; the new house is cramped and old, the local pizza parlour only serves broccoli as a topping, her father is under stress from his job, and due to a mix-up the moving van with their belongings gets lost and won't arrive for weeks. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and sent to long-term memory storage.\n\nIn Joy's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are left in control, with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.\n\nWhile navigating through the vast maze-like long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Their route to the train station is fraught with close calls and mishaps as more personality islands crumble. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when \"Honesty Island\" collapses with Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.\n\nJoy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. By preventing Riley from feeling sad, Joy was also keeping her from feeling happiness. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to fly high enough, as the wagon is too heavy with both of them in it. On their final attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, then fades away.\n\nJoy reunites with Sadness and manages to return to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it, and so make Riley sad that she is leaving her parents, and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015

The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted [[Paul Ekman]], a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and [[Dacher Keltner]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions\u2014anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were [[schadenfreude]], [[boredom|ennui]], pride, and hope.<ref name=\"McKittrick\">{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/is-this-the-best-story-we-can-tell-inside-out/|title=\"Is this the best story we can tell?\" \u2013 Inside Out|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|date=February 16, 2016|work=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.<ref name=science/>\n\nThe smash success of Docter's 2009 film [[Up (2009 film)|''Up'']] encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> ''Inside Out'' is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who was focused on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at the time of its production.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making ''Inside Out'', but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Story===\nDocter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nThe film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's \"Brain Trust\", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of ''Inside Out'' created before it even went into production.<ref name=\"hr\"/> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<ref name=\"iw\"/> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of \"happy feelings\".<ref name=\"vul\"/> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a \"social storm\" for Riley.<ref name=\"mf\"/> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too \"bizarre\" and it was replaced.<ref name=\"sf\"/>\n\nDocter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of \"personality islands\" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into \"Idea Fields\", where they would \"cultivate new ideas\", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<ref name=\"sf\"/> The character of Bing Bong\u2014a discarded old imaginary friend\u2014came about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite news|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|date=June 19, 2015|title='Inside Out' Producer Jonas Rivera Reveals Versions of the Movie You'll Never See|author=Drew Taylor|work=MovieFone|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015859/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an evaluation screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that he might get fired. He took a long walk one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/06/10/413273007/its-all-in-your-head-director-pete-docter-gets-emotional-in-inside-out|title=It's All in Your Head: Director Pete Docter Gets Emotional In 'Inside Out'|author=Terry Gross|work=[[Fresh Air]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}</ref> While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all.

Within her mind's Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions\u2014Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger\u2014come to life and influence her ways of doing things via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important \"core memories\" are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a ''de facto'' leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness's purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.\n\nAt the age of 11, Riley moves with her parents to San Francisco for her father's new job. Riley's first experiences are not good; the new house is cramped and old, the local pizza parlour only serves broccoli as a topping, her father is under stress from his job, and due to a mix-up the moving van with their belongings gets lost and won't arrive for weeks. When Sadness begins touching Riley's happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Riley's first day at her new school, Sadness causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating Riley's first sad core memory. Joy tries to dispose of it but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and sent to long-term memory storage.\n\nIn Joy's absence, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are left in control, with disastrous results, distancing Riley from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall into the \"Memory Dump\", where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota, believing it will restore her happiness.\n\nWhile navigating through the vast maze-like long-term memory area, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Riley's childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the \"train of thought\" back to Headquarters. Their route to the train station is fraught with close calls and mishaps as more personality islands crumble. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when \"Honesty Island\" collapses with Riley's theft of her mother's credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a \"recall tube\" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.\n\nJoy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory that turned happy when Riley's parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally understands Sadness's purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. By preventing Riley from feeling sad, Joy was also keeping her from feeling happiness. Joy and Bing Bong try to use Bing Bong's old wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump but are unable to fly high enough, as the wagon is too heavy with both of them in it. On their final attempt, Bing Bong jumps out to allow Joy to escape, then fades away.\n\nJoy reunites with Sadness and manages to return to Headquarters, only to discover that Anger's idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to reactivate it, and so make Riley sad that she is leaving her parents, and prompt Riley to return to her new home. As Sadness reinstalls the core memories, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they also miss Minnesota. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new core memory; a new island forms, representing Riley's acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while acquiring a few new ones. Inside Headquarters, her emotions admire Riley's new personality islands, and all work together on a newly expanded console with room for them all.\n\n==Voice cast==\n[[File:Cannes 2015

reserved, and that, frankly, triggered a lot of my own insecurities and fears,\" he said.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> He imagined what happens in the human mind when emotions set in. The idea to depict it through animation excited Docter, who felt it the ideal form to portray \"strong, opinionated, caricatured personalities\".<ref name=\"npr\"/> He began researching information about the mind, alongside Jonas Rivera, a producer, and Ronnie del Carmen, a secondary director. They consulted [[Paul Ekman]], a well-known psychologist who studies emotions, and [[Dacher Keltner]], a professor of psychology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Ekman had early in his career identified six core emotions\u2014anger, fear, sadness, disgust, joy, and [[Surprise (emotion)|surprise]]. Docter found surprise and fear to be too similar, which left him with five emotions to build characters around.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Other emotions considered for inclusion during the development process were [[schadenfreude]], [[boredom|ennui]], pride, and hope.<ref name=\"McKittrick\">{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/is-this-the-best-story-we-can-tell-inside-out/|title=\"Is this the best story we can tell?\" \u2013 Inside Out|last=McKittrick|first=Christopher|date=February 16, 2016|work=Creative Screenwriting|accessdate=February 16, 2016}}</ref> Keltner focused on sadness being an emotion that strengthens relationships.<ref name=\"npr\"/> Both emphasized how emotions organize social lives and the structuring of interpersonal interactions.<ref name=science/>\n\nThe smash success of Docter's 2009 film [[Up (2009 film)|''Up'']] encouraged those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with a more sophisticated story.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> ''Inside Out'' is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]], who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer [[John Lasseter]], who was focused on restructuring [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] at the time of its production.<ref name=\"nyt\"/> Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making ''Inside Out'', but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.<ref name=\"lat\"/>\n\n===Story===\nDocter recruited a story crew to help develop the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, in an attempt to have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. Initial ideas for the film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nThe film was first storyboarded over a period of two to three years, all the while undergoing screenings for Pixar's \"Brain Trust\", a small group of creative leaders at Pixar who oversee development on all films. After multiple screenings and suggestions from other filmmakers, the picture was put into production. It was again evaluated three months into that process. Kevin Nolting, editor of the film, estimated there were seven versions of ''Inside Out'' created before it even went into production.<ref name=\"hr\"/> The story team attempted to create as much contrast with characters as possible.<ref name=\"iw\"/> They found Joy the most complex character to write for, as she illustrates a broad range of \"happy feelings\".<ref name=\"vul\"/> The earliest idea present in the final film is that Joy holds onto youth too long, setting about a \"social storm\" for Riley.<ref name=\"mf\"/> It was not until several screenings later that they came upon the concept of moving to a new place, which created an external conflict that made the story easier to write. Initially, this crisis was to be set at a [[Thanksgiving Day]] pageant, in which Riley was hoping to be cast as its lead role, the turkey. Docter later deemed this idea too \"bizarre\" and it was replaced.<ref name=\"sf\"/>\n\nDocter estimated it took four years of development for the film to achieve success in marrying the architecture of Riley's mind and her personal troubles. The concept of \"personality islands\" helped develop the film's emotional stakes, as they directly affect events inside her mind and in her life. In one draft, the characters fell into \"Idea Fields\", where they would \"cultivate new ideas\", much like a farmer would cultivate crop.<ref name=\"sf\"/> The character of Bing Bong\u2014a discarded old imaginary friend\u2014came about in one draft of the film as part of a refugee camp inside Riley's mind. It was difficult to achieve the correct tone for the film; for example, viewers could not be distracted by Joy's nature or feel negative about the mess she helps steer Riley into. Rivera credited the casting of Amy Poehler, in addition to the idea of moving, with helping the film find the right tone.<ref name=\"mf\">{{cite news|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|date=June 19, 2015|title='Inside Out' Producer Jonas Rivera Reveals Versions of the Movie You'll Never See|author=Drew Taylor|work=MovieFone|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015859/http://news.moviefone.com/2015/06/19/inside-out-producer-jonas-rivera-alternate-versions/|archive-date=June 21, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAn early version of the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as it seemed to be the most humorous choice.

The narrative has frequent digressions, either in terms of stories related to the pair (including the story of the [[Our Lady of Guadeloupe]] and the murder of an oppressive Spanish priest at [[Acoma Pueblo]]) or through their recollections. The narrator is in third-person omniscient style. Cather includes many fictionalized accounts of actual historical figures, including [[Kit Carson]], [[Manuel Antonio Chaves]] and [[Pope Gregory XVI]].\n\nIn the prologue, Bishop Montferrand, a French bishop who works in the New World, solicits three cardinals at Rome to pick his candidate for the newly created diocese of New Mexico (which has recently passed into American hands). Bishop Montferrand is successful in getting his candidate, the Auvergnat Jean-Marie Latour, recommended by the cardinals over the recommendation of the Bishop of Durango (whose territory New Mexico had previously fallen under). One of the cardinals, a Spaniard named Allende, alludes to a painting by El Greco taken from his family by a missionary to the New World and lost, and asks for the new Bishop to search for it.\n\nThe action then switches to the primary character, Bishop Jean Marie Latour, who travels with his friend and vicar Joseph Vaillant from [[Sandusky, Ohio]] to [[New Mexico]]. At the time of Latour's departure for New Mexico, Cincinnati is the end of the railway line west, so Latour must travel by riverboat to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and thence overland to New Mexico, a journey which takes an entire year (and includes losing most of his supplies in a shipwreck at Galveston).  The names given to the main proponents reflect their characters. Vaillant, ''valiant'', is fearless in his promulgation of the faith, whereas Latour, ''the tower'', is more intellectual and reserved than his comrade. Vaillant, described as being ugly but purpose-filled, is given the nickname \"Blanchet\" (\"Whitey\") as well as \"Trompe-la-morte\" (\"Death-cheater\") for his complexion and his numerous instances of bad health, respectively. While the narrative speaks of Vaillant positively, it also alludes to his willingness to acquire (he \"forces the hand\" of a landowner into giving him and Latour two prize mules, Angelica and Contento, chastises the widow Dona Isabella Olivares for refusing to assert her rights under her husband's will and thereby blocking the church from its testamentary share, and goes on frank \"begging trips\" to acquire money) and near the end of the novel his questionable financial behaviour receives an investigation from Rome. Latour, again presented favourably, nevertheless does operate with a view to politics: he successfully canvasses donations to build a Romanesque cathedral in Santa Fe according to his own desires (he chooses the stone and brings the architect Molny from France to complete it), and bides his time to remove dissenting priests and help  a poor Mexican slave-woman named Sada until he is in a position of political strength (his help of Sada is never described in the novel). The novel ends with the death of (retired) Archbishop Latour in Santa Fe: Vaillant has pre-deceased Latour as the first Bishop of Colorado after the Colorado gold rush (in reality Machebeuf was the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Denver).\n\nNear the beginning of the novel, Latour and Vaillant are saved from being murdered by the villainous Buck Scales (at whose house they have sought shelter for the night) by Scales's abused wife Magdalena. All three escape, and Scales is hanged for the murder of four of his former guests, while Magdalena ultimately serves nuns whom Latour brings from Europe and who run a school in Santa Fe.\nWhile some of the clergy already established in New Mexico are portrayed favourably (such as the Padre of Isleta Pueblo, the blind priest Father Jesus de Baca, who collects parrots), several of the entrenched priests are depicted as examples of greed, avarice, and gluttony. The priest of Albuquerque, Father Gallegos, is removed for not being devout enough (he dances and enjoys fine food and hunting), replaced by Vaillant. Father Martinez at Taos is removed for denying the necessity of priestly celibacy (and having children, although he is also described as starting a revolt and then profiting from the executions of the rebels to seize their property) and his friend Father Lucero at Arroyo Hondo (described as a miser) is also removed when he joins Father Martinez's new church (Martinez dies an apostate while Lucero receives absolution from Vaillant after repenting near death).\n\nCather portrays the aboriginal people of the Pueblos, the [[Hopi]] and the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] sympathetically, including a discussion of the [[Long Walk of the Navajo]] (mentioned as a reminiscence of the dying Latour of his Navajo friend Eusabio and the Navajo leader [[Manuelito]]). Latour reflects that the removal of the Navajos was a wrong comparable to \"black slavery,\" and the narrator describes Kit Carson's actions with the Navajo as \"misguided\" and \"a soldier's brutal work.\" Cather's characters express the near futility of overlaying their religion on a millennia-old native culture. For example, while caught in a snowstorm with his native guide Jacinto (who dwells in the Pecos Pueblo, which in reality was already deserted by the time of Lamy), Latour and Jacinto are forced to spend the night in a cave sacred to Jacinto's people. Latour initially finds a disagreeable smell, and the unexplained actions of Jacinto with regard to the place make him uneasy.\n\n==Historical background==\nThe novel is based on the life of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamy]] (1814-1888), and partially chronicles the construction of the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi]]. The capture of the Southwest by the United States in the Mexican\u2013American War is the catalyst for the plot.\n\n\"The Padre of Isleta\",<ref>Keleher and Chant. ''The Padre of Isleta''.

(Eponymous bands are generally not separated; thus [[Charlie Daniels]] is not counted as a one-hit wonder for \"[[Uneasy Rider]]\" and the hits of the [[Charlie Daniels Band]] are credited to him.)\n\n[[Fred Bronson]], a journalist and former writer for ''Billboard'' magazine, in his book ''Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits'', uses the criterion that an artist is ineligible to be categorized as a \"one-hit wonder\" if they have a second song listed on the Billboard Hot 100.{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=219\u201320}}\n\nIn both cases, the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] was used as an objective standard for one-hit wonder status, since ''Billboard'' magazine published the books.\n\nDisc jockey and music writer Brent Mann points out how some artists have been called a \"one-hit wonder\" despite having other charting singles; in these cases, one [[signature song]] so overshadows the rest of the artist's discography that only that song remains familiar to later audiences. As an example, English-born singer [[Albert Hammond]] enjoyed success with \"[[It Never Rains in Southern California]]\" (1972) rising to number 5 in the US, but his follow-up single, \"[[I'm a Train]]\" was dismissed by Mann as \"totally forgotten\" even though it charted at number 31 in 1974.{{sfn|Mann|2003|p=165}} In another case, Scottish rockers [[Simple Minds]] followed their big hit \"[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]\" (appearing in the opening and closing scenes of the film ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'') with \"[[Alive and Kicking (song)|Alive and Kicking]]\" which peaked at number 3 in the US, and \"[[Sanctify Yourself]]\" (''Billboard'' Top 100 number 14), yet the band is remembered primarily for the first song.<ref name=\"Simple Minds\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-one-hit-wonders-2018-5|title=The 57 best one-hit wonders of all time|first=Gabbi|last=Shaw|website=Thisisinsider.com|accessdate=December 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226232753/https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-one-hit-wonders-2018-5|archive-date=December 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, some artists with long, successful careers have been identified as one-hit wonders by virtue of having reached the Top 40 of the Hot 100 only once. ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' editor Matt Melis lists [[Beck]] (\"[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]]\") and the [[Grateful Dead]] (\"[[Touch of Grey]]\") as \"technically\" being one-hit wonders despite their large bodies of work.{{sfn|Melis|2016|p=1}} ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' mentions prolific artist [[Frank Zappa]] as a one-hit wonder because his only Top 40 hit was \"[[Valley Girl (song)|Valley Girl]]\" in 1982.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2009}}\n\nChris Molanphy says that an artist can only be seen as a \"one hit wonder\" if they have never had a second Billboard top 10 hit, if any subsequent top 40 singles were released within six months of their first big hit, and if the artist has not had three or more top 10 or Platinum albums.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226175321/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/09/carly_rae_jepsen_one_hit_wonder.php?page=all|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/09/carly_rae_jepsen_one_hit_wonder.php?page=all|title=100 & Single: Three Rules To Define The Term \"One-Hit Wonder\" In 2012|author=Chris Molanphy|archive-date=February 26, 2013|access-date=August 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/dont_call_them_one_hit_wonders/|title=Don't call them \"one-hit wonders\"|author=Annie Zaleski|access-date=August 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803151256/https://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/dont_call_them_one_hit_wonders/|archive-date=August 3, 2019|url-status=live|date=September 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Multiple appearances==\nBritish musician [[Tony Burrows]] sang the lead vocal on five one-hit wonders: [[Edison Lighthouse]]'s \"[[Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)]]\" (February 1970); [[White Plains (band)|White Plains]]' \"[[My Baby Loves Lovin']]\" (March 1970); [[the Pipkins]]' \"[[Gimme Dat Ding (song)|Gimme Dat Ding]]\" (April 1970); [[the First Class]]' \"[[Beach Baby]]\" (July 1974); and \"[[United We Stand (song)|United We Stand]]\" (1970) by the first incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Man]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-30/entertainment/ca-38886_1_tony-burrows|title=From Bankable Burrows to One-Hit Wonders|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|date=August 30, 1996|accessdate=November 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |title=Rhino Gets Nostalgic With DeFrancos and Turtles in First (We Hope Not Last) Retrofest |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |date=August 28, 1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18 |page=18 |volume=111 |number=35 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\n[[Joey Levine]], American session singer best known for his prolific work in the [[bubblegum pop]] and commercial [[jingle]] genera, who had recorded hits for [[the Ohio Express]] (\"[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]\"), also sang hits for [[The Third Rail (band)|the Third Rail]], the [[Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus]] (\"Quick Joey Small\") and Reunion (\"[[Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)]]\").<ref>Cooper, Kim (April 26, 2006).

artist who is remembered for only one hit despite other successes.{{sfn|Mann|2003|p=165}}{{sfn|Melis|2016|p=1}} This list contains artists known primarily for one hit song in the United States, who are described as one-hit wonders by the media.\n\n==Criteria==\nMusic reviewers and journalists sometimes describe a musical artist as a one-hit wonder, based on their professional assessment of chart success, sales figures and fame.\n\nFor the purpose of his book ''The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders'', music journalist Wayne Jancik defines a one-hit wonder as \"an act that has won a position on ''Billboard''{{'}}s national, pop, [[Top 40]] just once.\" In his definition of an \"act\", Jancik distinguishes between a solo performer and any group he or she may have performed in (thus, for example, [[Roger Daltrey]]'s \"[[Without Your Love (Roger Daltrey song)|Without Your Love]]\" is counted despite Daltrey's numerous hits as frontman for [[the Who]]), and a number of musicians appear multiple times, either with multiple bands or as a member of a band and as a solo artist. (Eponymous bands are generally not separated; thus [[Charlie Daniels]] is not counted as a one-hit wonder for \"[[Uneasy Rider]]\" and the hits of the [[Charlie Daniels Band]] are credited to him.)\n\n[[Fred Bronson]], a journalist and former writer for ''Billboard'' magazine, in his book ''Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits'', uses the criterion that an artist is ineligible to be categorized as a \"one-hit wonder\" if they have a second song listed on the Billboard Hot 100.{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=219\u201320}}\n\nIn both cases, the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] was used as an objective standard for one-hit wonder status, since ''Billboard'' magazine published the books.\n\nDisc jockey and music writer Brent Mann points out how some artists have been called a \"one-hit wonder\" despite having other charting singles; in these cases, one [[signature song]] so overshadows the rest of the artist's discography that only that song remains familiar to later audiences. As an example, English-born singer [[Albert Hammond]] enjoyed success with \"[[It Never Rains in Southern California]]\" (1972) rising to number 5 in the US, but his follow-up single, \"[[I'm a Train]]\" was dismissed by Mann as \"totally forgotten\" even though it charted at number 31 in 1974.{{sfn|Mann|2003|p=165}} In another case, Scottish rockers [[Simple Minds]] followed their big hit \"[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]\" (appearing in the opening and closing scenes of the film ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'') with \"[[Alive and Kicking (song)|Alive and Kicking]]\" which peaked at number 3 in the US, and \"[[Sanctify Yourself]]\" (''Billboard'' Top 100 number 14), yet the band is remembered primarily for the first song.<ref name=\"Simple Minds\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-one-hit-wonders-2018-5|title=The 57 best one-hit wonders of all time|first=Gabbi|last=Shaw|website=Thisisinsider.com|accessdate=December 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226232753/https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-one-hit-wonders-2018-5|archive-date=December 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, some artists with long, successful careers have been identified as one-hit wonders by virtue of having reached the Top 40 of the Hot 100 only once. ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' editor Matt Melis lists [[Beck]] (\"[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]]\") and the [[Grateful Dead]] (\"[[Touch of Grey]]\") as \"technically\" being one-hit wonders despite their large bodies of work.{{sfn|Melis|2016|p=1}} ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' mentions prolific artist [[Frank Zappa]] as a one-hit wonder because his only Top 40 hit was \"[[Valley Girl (song)|Valley Girl]]\" in 1982.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2009}}\n\nChris Molanphy says that an artist can only be seen as a \"one hit wonder\" if they have never had a second Billboard top 10 hit, if any subsequent top 40 singles were released within six months of their first big hit, and if the artist has not had three or more top 10 or Platinum albums.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226175321/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/09/carly_rae_jepsen_one_hit_wonder.php?page=all|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/09/carly_rae_jepsen_one_hit_wonder.php?page=all|title=100 & Single: Three Rules To Define The Term \"One-Hit Wonder\" In 2012|author=Chris Molanphy|archive-date=February 26, 2013|access-date=August 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/dont_call_them_one_hit_wonders/|title=Don't call them \"one-hit wonders\"|author=Annie Zaleski|access-date=August 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803151256/https://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/dont_call_them_one_hit_wonders/|archive-date=August 3, 2019|url-status=live|date=September 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Multiple appearances==\nBritish musician [[Tony Burrows]] sang the lead vocal on five one-hit wonders: [[Edison Lighthouse]]'s \"[[Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)]]\" (February 1970); [[White Plains (band)|White Plains]]' \"[[My Baby Loves Lovin']]\" (March 1970); [[the Pipkins]]' \"[[Gimme Dat Ding (song)|Gimme Dat Ding]]\" (April 1970); [[the First Class]]' \"[[Beach Baby]]\" (July 1974); and \"[[United We Stand (song)|United We Stand]]\" (1970) by the first incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Man]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-30/entertainment/ca-38886_1_tony-burrows|title=From Bankable Burrows to One-Hit Wonders|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|date=August 30, 1996|accessdate=November 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |title=Rhino Gets Nostalgic With DeFrancos and Turtles in First (We Hope Not Last) Retrofest |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |date=August 28, 1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18 |page=18 |volume=111 |number=35 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\n[[Joey Levine]], American session singer best known for his prolific work in the [[bubblegum pop]] and commercial [[jingle]] genera, who had recorded hits for [[the Ohio Express]] (\"[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]\"), also sang hits for [[The Third Rail (band)|the Third Rail]], the [[Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus]] (\"Quick Joey Small\") and Reunion (\"[[Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)]]\").<ref>Cooper, Kim (April 26, 2006).

From 1923 to 1924/1925, he was Minister of the Interior and Vice-Chancellor of Germany. Jarres was also the long-serving mayor of [[Duisburg]] from 1914 to 1933. After the [[Nazis]] deposed him, he started a career in industry.\n\n==Early life==\nKarl Jarres was born on 21 September 1874 in [[Remscheid]], in the Prussian [[Rhine Province]]. His father, Rudolf Jarres (1842-1922) was a merchant. His mother was Maria Jarres (1849-1936), n\u00e9e Busch (daughter of merchant and Remscheid city treasurer Robert Busch). Karl studied law at London, Paris, Bonn and Berlin, and was awarded a Dr. iur. in 1897 at the [[University of Erlangen]]. After his legal clerkship, Jarres started working in municipal administration. He was ''Stadtassessor'' (1901) and then ''Beigeordneter'' (1903) at [[D\u00fcren]]. In 1907, he became ''Beigeordneter'' at [[Cologne]]. In 1910, he was elected mayor of Remscheid.<ref name=Bio1>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz37036.html|title=Biografie Karl Jarres (German)|publisher=Bayerische Nationalbibliothek|accessdate=26 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nJarres was married in D\u00fcren in 1903, to Freya (1880-1945), n\u00e9e Sch\u00fcll, daughter of a paper manufacturer. They had two daughters.<ref name=\"Bio1\"/>\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1911, Jarres became ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' (Chief Burgomaster) of Remscheid. After 1914, he was the ''Oberb\u00fcrgermeister'' of [[Duisburg]], located in the [[Ruhr]] region, a position he held until 1933.<ref name=\"Bio1\"/> As representative for Duisburg, Jarres was a member of the Prussian upper chamber \u2014 the ''[[Prussian House of Lords|Herrenhaus]]'' \u2014 from 1914-18.<ref name=DHM>{{cite web|url=https://www.dhm.de/lemo/Biografie/karl-jarres|title=Biografie Karl Jarres (German)|publisher=Deutsches Historisches Museum|accessdate=26 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]] he was successful in securing food supplies for the city. During and after the [[German Revolution of 1918-19|Revolution]] he opposed the establishment of a far-left ''R\u00e4teherrschaft'' (rule by workers' and soldiers' councils), at the cost of being at times subject to physical violence. He joined the [[German People's Party]] (DVP) when it was created in 1918 (he was previously a member of the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]]) and remained a member until the DVP was dissolved in 1933. However, Jarres never played a leading role in the party.<ref name=\"Bio1\"/> From 1919 to 1933, Jarre was a member of the [[Prussian State Council]].<ref name=\"DHM\"/> He was also active in the Prussian ''St\u00e4dtetag'' (later ''[[Deutscher St\u00e4dtetag]]'').<ref name=\"Bio2\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] in 1923 he was deposed as mayor by the military authorities and served a deportation order by the Belgians. Since he ignored it, a military court sentenced him to two months in prison. After he was released, the Prussian and Reich governments appointed him ''Vertrauensmann'' for the occupied territory. He had become known nationwide for his steadfast stance against the occupation. Strongly nationalistic feeling (he was a [[Burschenschaft]] member) and a dedication to liberty made him one of the most ardent supporters of the ''Versackungspolitik'' (leaving sole responsibility for the Ruhr to the occupiers).<ref name=\"Bio2\"/><ref name=\"Bio1\"/>\n\nOn 11 November 1923, Jarres followed the invitation by [[Gustav Stresemann]] and became Minister of the Interior in the second Stresemann cabinet. He kept that position under Chancellor [[Wilhelm Marx]] until 1925. In the first and second Marx cabinets, Jarres was also Vice-Chancellor. After the Ruhr crisis was over, Jarres loyally supported the policies of Stresemann (now Foreign Minister).<ref name=\"Bio1\"/> The second Marx cabinet resigned on 15 December 1924, and was replaced on 15 January 1925 by the first cabinet of [[Hans Luther]].\n\nAgain urged by Stresemann, Jarres became the candidate of the DVP in the [[1925 German presidential election|1925 German Presidential election]], the first direct election to the office of [[Reichspr\u00e4sident|President of the Reich]] (''Reichspr\u00e4sident''), following [[Friedrich Ebert]]'s death.<ref name=\"Bio1\"/>\n\nIn the first round of the election he received the largest number of votes with over ten million and his [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] was at nearly 39%. The next major candidates were [[Otto Braun]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] with nearly eight million votes (29%) and [[Wilhelm Marx]] of the [[Catholic Center Party]] with nearly four million votes (14.5%). Jarres withdrew his candidacy in the second round of voting in favor of [[Paul von Hindenburg]] who would go on to win the closely fought second round of elections against Marx and [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann]], the candidate of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] ([[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]]).\n\nReturning from Berlin to Duisburg in 1925, he worked towards a substantial increase in the size of the city in the territorial restructuring of the Ruhr, but achieved only the merger with Hamborn in 1929 (only in 1975 did Duisburg grow to the size he had envisaged). When the [[Great Depression]] hit the city, relying mostly on heavy industry (coal and steel), was severely affected and Jarres could do little to prevent unemployment from rising.<ref name=\"Bio1\"/>\n\n==After 1933==\nReelected in 1930, Jarres was deposed as mayor by the [[Nazis]] in May 1933 and in November retired from public life (''im Ruhestand''). He spent the rest of his career in private industry, as a member of the supervisory board or management board of well-known Duisburg companies such as [[Demag]].

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

From January 1916 to November 1918 he served as finance minister of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. He was elected a member of the [[Weimar National Assembly]] in 1919. He continued to serve as a delegate in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] until 1930. In 1922/1923 he was [[List of German economics ministers|Minister of Economics]], under Chancellor [[Wilhelm Cuno]], during the onset of [[hyperinflation]].\n\n==Life and career==\nJohann Baptist (also: Johannes) Becker was born on 3 February 1869 at [[Ludwigsh\u00f6he]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] (present-day [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], Germany). His father, Franz Becker, was a builder and [[winemaker]] from a peasant family. His mother was Elisabetha, n\u00e9e Schaad.<ref name=Bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd116104120.html|title=Biografie Johann Baptist Becker (German)|publisher=Bayerische Nationalbibliothek|accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> \n\nBecker married Johanna Caroline Hartmann on 4 September 1895 at [[Gie\u00dfen]]. They had one daughter.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nHe studied at Gie\u00dfen, Leipzig, Munich and Berlin. He then joined the civil service of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] where he advanced rapidly. From January 1916 to November 1918, he was the Hessian minister of finance. His achievements in Hesse included the reform of the tax system (1899) which eliminated the ''Realsteuern'' and brought the system into line with that of [[Prussia]]. He also was the main inspiration behind the reform of the Hessian communal tax system (1911). In addition, Becker was very interested in the set-up and running of the railway system.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nIn 1919, he was elected to the [[Weimar National Assembly]], the new republic's constituent assembly. From 1920 to 1930, Becker was a member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] for the [[German People's Party]] (DVP). He was also member of the board of directors of the ''Rheinische Stahlwerke'' Duisburg-Meiderich.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nOn the suggestion of [[Gustav Stresemann]] and [[Rudolf Heinze]], Becker was made ''Reichswirtschaftsminister'' (minister of economics) when the cabinet of [[Wilhelm Cuno]] was formed in November 1922. Due to his connections with Rhenish industry he was attacked by the parties of the left but did not exert any influence to further the interest of heavy industry whilst in office.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> \n\nAfter the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]], he remained a supporter of \"passive resistance\" against the French and Belgian occupation forces until the end, even as it caused the German economy to spiral downward and [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|inflation to accelerate]].

From January 1916 to November 1918 he served as finance minister of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. He was elected a member of the [[Weimar National Assembly]] in 1919. He continued to serve as a delegate in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] until 1930. In 1922/1923 he was [[List of German economics ministers|Minister of Economics]], under Chancellor [[Wilhelm Cuno]], during the onset of [[hyperinflation]].\n\n==Life and career==\nJohann Baptist (also: Johannes) Becker was born on 3 February 1869 at [[Ludwigsh\u00f6he]] in the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] (present-day [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], Germany). His father, Franz Becker, was a builder and [[winemaker]] from a peasant family.

They had one daughter.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nHe studied at Gie\u00dfen, Leipzig, Munich and Berlin. He then joined the civil service of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] where he advanced rapidly. From January 1916 to November 1918, he was the Hessian minister of finance. His achievements in Hesse included the reform of the tax system (1899) which eliminated the ''Realsteuern'' and brought the system into line with that of [[Prussia]]. He also was the main inspiration behind the reform of the Hessian communal tax system (1911). In addition, Becker was very interested in the set-up and running of the railway system.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nIn 1919, he was elected to the [[Weimar National Assembly]], the new republic's constituent assembly. From 1920 to 1930, Becker was a member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] for the [[German People's Party]] (DVP). He was also member of the board of directors of the ''Rheinische Stahlwerke'' Duisburg-Meiderich.<ref name=\"Bio\"/>\n\nOn the suggestion of [[Gustav Stresemann]] and [[Rudolf Heinze]], Becker was made ''Reichswirtschaftsminister'' (minister of economics) when the cabinet of [[Wilhelm Cuno]] was formed in November 1922. Due to his connections with Rhenish industry he was attacked by the parties of the left but did not exert any influence to further the interest of heavy industry whilst in office.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> \n\nAfter the [[Occupation of the Ruhr]], he remained a supporter of \"passive resistance\" against the French and Belgian occupation forces until the end, even as it caused the German economy to spiral downward and [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|inflation to accelerate]].

On 7 March 1885, the Kansas Volunteer Militia became the [[Kansas National Guard]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Philippine\u2013American War ===\n\n[[John W. Leedy]], the governor of Kansas, issued a call for volunteers to fight in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] on 26 April 1898, as soon as war was declared. The regiment was reorganized and officially mustered into service between 9 May and 13 May at [[Topeka]], Kansas, as the 20th Kansas Volunteer Infantry. At the time of mustering in, the regiment consisted of 46 officers and 964 enlisted men.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/20thkansashistory.htm|title=20th Kansas history|first=Patrick|last=McSherry|website=www.spanamwar.com}}</ref> On 16 May, the regiment left for [[Camp Merritt, California]], and due to disease, the regiment was forced to relocate to [[Camp Merriam (San Francisco)|Camp Merriam]], just north of the Presidio of San Francisco on 5 August. The regiment was still there when an armistice was signed on 12 August.\n\nThe 20th Kansas was slated to take part in the Fifth Philippine Expedition on 27 October 1898, and 2nd and 3rd Battalions arrived in [[Manila]] on 5 December, and the 1st Battalion arrived on 6 December.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The Spanish\u2013American War officially ended on 10 December, with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]]. The 20th Kansas had not seen combat against the [[Spaniards]] and were camped in tobacco warehouses in Manila until February 1899 when the [[Philippine Insurrection]] began. They advanced on, and were the first to enter, [[Caloocan]] on 10 February.<ref name=\"auto\"/> On 25 March, the regiment swam the [[Tullahan River]], captured a [[Blockhouse]], and then was involved in the engagements of Malinta and [[Meycauayan]] three days later. On 28 March, some of the Kansans swam another river, capturing eighty prisoners among the men occupying the earthworks on the opposite side.<ref name=\"auto\"/> On 31 March, the regiment entered [[Malolos]], the capital of the [[First Philippine Republic]]. On 24 April, the 20th Kansas was involved in the advance against [[Calumpit, Bulacan|Calumpit]], and in the next month, against San Thomas.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOn 6 September 1899, the 20th Kansas Volunteer Infantry boarded transports and steamed for the US, arriving on 10 October. On 28 October, the regiment was mustered out of service.<ref name=\"auto\"/> At the time of mustering out, the regiment had decreased in size, including 46 officers and 720 enlisted men. During its wartime service, the regiment had 3 officers and 19 enlisted men killed in action.

This surprise attack was so successful that the 35th Division was not used, and it was soon headed for the greatest American battle of the war. 25 September found the 137th Infantry in position facing Vauquois Hill, an impregnable natural fortress the Germans had held over four years.<ref name=\"oclc.org\" /> In the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], a 6-hour barrage was launched on this hill and was taken by the Kansas soldiers in their first attempt on 26 September, and their trial by fire began; an ordeal that was to last six days and six nights, with little or no food, only snatches of sleep, and an uninterrupted rain of shells, gas, and bullets from infantry, [[artillery]] and warplanes. The 137th Infantry took every objective assigned it, but in the taking suffered casualties of nearly 1,300 men out of the 2,800 combatants engaged; 46%.<ref name=\"oclc.org\" /> The regiment was relieved by the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] on 1 October 1918, and after resting in the rear for 10 days, the regiment moved to [[Verdun]] and remained in the fighting until 4 November. They were in the thick of fighting until 9 November when they were relieved. The [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] finally stopped the fighting, after which the regiment returned to Kansas, where it demobilized at [[Camp Funston]] between 9 and 11 May 1919.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Interwar period ===\nThe former 1st Infantry Regiment of the Kansas National Guard was consolidated with the 4th Infantry Regiment, organized in 1918, to become the 137th Infantry of the 35th Division on 4 November 1921.<ref name=\":0\" /> The regiment was headquartered at [[Horton, Kansas|Horton]].

Both the 1st and 3rd Battalions provided relief between 13 and 16 July 1924 after a tornado struck [[Augusta, Kansas|Augusta]]. After the escape of criminals from the [[Kansas State Penitentiary]], the 2nd Battalion was called up to perform road patrols and block bridges between 19 and 20 January 1934.

It is a part of the [[Kansas Army National Guard]] and has served with distinction in the [[Philippine Insurrection]], [[World War I]], and [[World War II]].  Today, only the 2nd Battalion (2\u2013137) exists as the '''2\u2013137th Combined Arms Battalion''', and is a component of the [[635th Regional Support Group]].\n\n== History ==\nThe regiment traces its history back to the organization of the 1st Infantry Regiment of the Kansas Volunteer Militia from pre-existing companies on 17 May 1879. On 7 March 1885, the Kansas Volunteer Militia became the [[Kansas National Guard]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Philippine\u2013American War ===\n\n[[John W. Leedy]], the governor of Kansas, issued a call for volunteers to fight in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] on 26 April 1898, as soon as war was declared. The regiment was reorganized and officially mustered into service between 9 May and 13 May at [[Topeka]], Kansas, as the 20th Kansas Volunteer Infantry. At the time of mustering in, the regiment consisted of 46 officers and 964 enlisted men.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/20thkansashistory.htm|title=20th Kansas history|first=Patrick|last=McSherry|website=www.spanamwar.com}}</ref> On 16 May, the regiment left for [[Camp Merritt, California]], and due to disease, the regiment was forced to relocate to [[Camp Merriam (San Francisco)|Camp Merriam]], just north of the Presidio of San Francisco on 5 August. The regiment was still there when an armistice was signed on 12 August.\n\nThe 20th Kansas was slated to take part in the Fifth Philippine Expedition on 27 October 1898, and 2nd and 3rd Battalions arrived in [[Manila]] on 5 December, and the 1st Battalion arrived on 6 December.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The Spanish\u2013American War officially ended on 10 December, with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]]. The 20th Kansas had not seen combat against the [[Spaniards]] and were camped in tobacco warehouses in Manila until February 1899 when the [[Philippine Insurrection]] began. They advanced on, and were the first to enter, [[Caloocan]] on 10 February.<ref name=\"auto\"/> On 25 March, the regiment swam the [[Tullahan River]], captured a [[Blockhouse]], and then was involved in the engagements of Malinta and [[Meycauayan]] three days later. On 28 March, some of the Kansans swam another river, capturing eighty prisoners among the men occupying the earthworks on the opposite side.<ref name=\"auto\"/> On 31 March, the regiment entered [[Malolos]], the capital of the [[First Philippine Republic]]. On 24 April, the 20th Kansas was involved in the advance against [[Calumpit, Bulacan|Calumpit]], and in the next month, against San Thomas.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nOn 6 September 1899, the 20th Kansas Volunteer Infantry boarded transports and steamed for the US, arriving on 10 October. On 28 October, the regiment was mustered out of service.<ref name=\"auto\"/> At the time of mustering out, the regiment had decreased in size, including 46 officers and 720 enlisted men. During its wartime service, the regiment had 3 officers and 19 enlisted men killed in action. An additional 11 enlisted men died of wounds received in battle. 35 enlisted men died from disease, and 145 more were discharged on disability. 4 enlisted men were [[court-martial]]ed, and 4 men deserted.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=== World War I ===\nSimultaneously with its mustering out from Federal service, the 20th Kansas was consolidated with the 1st Regiment of Infantry (Provisional), as the 1st Infantry Regiment of the Kansas National Guard. The regiment served the state government until mustered into Federal Service at Fort Riley for duty on the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]], under the orders of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], on 27 June 1916.

On 5 August, the 137th Infantry Regiment was drafted into Federal service. On 1 October it was consolidated with the [[2nd Infantry Regiment, Kansas National Guard|2nd Infantry Regiment]] of the Kansas National Guard to become the 137th Infantry, part of the [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th Division]].<ref name=\":0\" /> They subsequently set sail for Europe, entering the frontline on 18 June 1918. The 137th was stationed in the [[Metz]] area and successfully repulsed a German raid on the night of 22\u201323 June. On 20 July, Company C put on a successful raid of its own against the enemy.<ref name=\"oclc.org\" />\n\n1 September saw the regiment moved by truck from the [[Vosges]] Mountains to [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and then into reserve for the [[Saint-Mihiel]] attack of 12\u201316 September. This surprise attack was so successful that the 35th Division was not used, and it was soon headed for the greatest American battle of the war. 25 September found the 137th Infantry in position facing Vauquois Hill, an impregnable natural fortress the Germans had held over four years.<ref name=\"oclc.org\" /> In the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], a 6-hour barrage was launched on this hill and was taken by the Kansas soldiers in their first attempt on 26 September, and their trial by fire began; an ordeal that was to last six days and six nights, with little or no food, only snatches of sleep, and an uninterrupted rain of shells, gas, and bullets from infantry, [[artillery]] and warplanes. The 137th Infantry took every objective assigned it, but in the taking suffered casualties of nearly 1,300 men out of the 2,800 combatants engaged; 46%.<ref name=\"oclc.org\" /> The regiment was relieved by the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] on 1 October 1918, and after resting in the rear for 10 days, the regiment moved to [[Verdun]] and remained in the fighting until 4 November. They were in the thick of fighting until 9 November when they were relieved. The [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] finally stopped the fighting, after which the regiment returned to Kansas, where it demobilized at [[Camp Funston]] between 9 and 11 May 1919.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Interwar period ===\nThe former 1st Infantry Regiment of the Kansas National Guard was consolidated with the 4th Infantry Regiment, organized in 1918, to become the 137th Infantry of the 35th Division on 4 November 1921.<ref name=\":0\" /> The regiment was headquartered at [[Horton, Kansas|Horton]].

During the interwar period, the regiment conducted annual summer training mostly at Fort Riley. Both the 1st and 3rd Battalions provided relief between 13 and 16 July 1924 after a tornado struck [[Augusta, Kansas|Augusta]]. After the escape of criminals from the [[Kansas State Penitentiary]], the 2nd Battalion was called up to perform road patrols and block bridges between 19 and 20 January 1934. Between 8 and 27 June of that year, it also provided riot control during labor troubles at copper mines in [[Baxter Springs, Kansas|Baxter Springs]].

On 9 July, the 137th relieved the [[119th Infantry Regiment (United States)|119th Infantry Regiment]] of the [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Infantry Division]]. The 1st attack the 137th made was on the morning of 11 July 1944, and they made small gains at the cost of 12 killed, 96 wounded, and 18 missing. 12 July saw another attack toward the town of [[Saint-Gilles, Manche|St. Gilles]] with the 2nd (2\u2013137) and 3rd (3\u2013137) Battalions in the lead.

The Germans launched [[Operation L\u00fcttich]], a counterattack against Mortain, to contain the Allied breakout from [[Normandy]], and they met heavy opposition from the American forces. The 137th fought here from 7\u201313 August, and they suffered 23 killed, 140 wounded, and 40 missing in action.<ref name=\"coulthart.com1\"/> The German counterattack was beaten back. The regiment continued on through the Allied breakout and pushed east to the city of [[Orl\u00e9ans]] and then onto [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] which they captured after heavy resistance. After beating back a fierce German counterattack in the Gremercey Forest, the regiment moved north to Metz. After minor patrolling in [[Alsace-Lorraine]], they moved north to fight in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] on 26 December 1944.
