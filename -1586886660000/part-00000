His other vocalists included Frank Sylvano, Billy Scott, and Arthur Jarrett. In 1932, he added Joe Martin, another of the band's violinists, as a frequent vocalist. In April that year, young [[Bing Crosby]] recorded two sessions with Jones's group which included \"[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]\".

They recorded \"experimental\" songs for RCA Victor in which Jones began to fuse jazz and early swing music. They recorded \"Where? (I Wonder Where?)\" and \"What Would Happen to Me If Something Happened to You.\" His Victor releases had an almost symphonic sound, often with a strong use of tuba. During his Victor period, he recorded two long playing \"Program Transcription\" records as part of Victor's unsuccessful 33 1/3 RPM series.

After he left Decca in 1936, he again retired and his orchestra was taken over by band member [[Woody Herman]].

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

Following the demolition of old [[Beijing-Hankou Railway]], the city of [[Wuhan]] planned to utilize the corridor to construct the city's first rapid transit rail line. In September 1992, the [[Wuhan Metro Construction Group]] was established by [[Wuhan Municipal Construction Commission]] and a supervision group, led by the mayor [[Qian Yunlu]], was subsequently formed in 1993 to facilitate the project's funding, planning, logistics, and organization. Yet, it was seven years before the city was able to fund construction.\n\nIn October 1999, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|National Planning Commission]] (predecessor of the National Development and Reform Commission) approved the Wuhan \"Light Rail\" project (Line 1, phase 1), signaling the start of serious work on the rail transit project. On October 2, 2000, the [[Wuhan|Wuhan Municipal Government]] ratified the establishment of the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]]., and contracted construction, operation, administration and related real estate development to the corporation.\n\nIn December 2000, the National Planning Commission accepted a feasibility report on the project and approved construction on phase 1 of Line 1. On December 23, 2000, the project broke ground and comprehensive construction began.\n\nIn 2002, with the anticipation of an economic boom and increasing demand for urban rail transit, Wuhan Municipal Government approved the city's first long-term rail transit master plan. On July 28, 2004, the ten-station long \"light rail\" line was opened to the public and entered revenue service in August. However, low ridership discouraged the city from funding the extension project, for which ground had been broken on December 15, 2005, and a 4-year delay in construction ensued. In April, 2006, the [[National Development and Reform Commission|NDRC]] ratified a six-year construction/operation plan, but it was not until a year later on April 9, 2007 that NDRC accepted the feasibility report for line 1, phase 2 (the extension project) and approved construction on the project.\n\nIn the interim, construction began on the [[Fanhu station]] of the fully underground line 2 on November 16, 2006, as a response to the six-year plan adopted by NDRC earlier. Construction also began on the underground line 4 stations of [[Wuchang railway station]] in June, and [[Wuhan railway station]] in September, as parts of the integral capital project to revamp and construct the [[Wuhan Railway Hub System|Wuhan Railway Hub]].\n\nIn May 2007, the [[Hubei Provincial Development and Reform Commission]] (HDRC) approved preliminary designs on the Line 1, phase 2, and comprehensive construction subsequently commenced in June. On May 15, the city government approved the establishment of [[Wuhan Metro Co., Ltd]]., which would replace the [[Wuhan Rail Transit Co., Ltd]] and assume its responsibilities and benefits.\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the NDRC accepted the feasibility report to Line 2, phase 1, and preliminary designs were approved by the HDRC in December 2007. However, it was not until September 2008 that land purchases and funding were facilitated and comprehensive construction began to take place. In October 2009, drilling of the [[Yangtze River]] tunnel started.\n\nOn March 13, 2009, the NDRC accepted feasibility report to Line 4, phase 1. On May 13, 2009, the HDRC ratified preliminary designs on Line 4, phase 1. Comprehensive construction ensued on the [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] segment of Line 4. A more ambitious urban rapid transit plan was submitted for NDRC review in October, 2009, and in late November, on-site panel investigations were conducted by [[China International Engineering Consulting Corporation]].\n\nIn February 2010 (Wuhan Metro)'s first commercial property topped out in [[Hanxi 1st Road station]]. On July 29, Line 1 phase 2 entered revenue service from [[Dijiao station|Dijiao]] to [[Dongwu Boulevard station|Dongwu Boulevard]]. Despite plans to extend the westernmost terminus to [[Jinshan Avenue]] in [[Dongxihu District]], the station was never built. A short stub with crossover tracks was constructed behind Dongwu Boulevard. [[Zhuyehai]], a station in [[Qiaokou District]], remained non-operational in spite of the existence of complete platforms. Neither exits nor staircases had been built yet. It was due to open when the Wuhan [[IKEA]] store was completed in late 2014.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=zh:\u8f7b\u8f68\u4e8c\u671f\u589e\u8bbe\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9 |url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20090531/000131.htm |language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nA revised and more detailed construction plan was accepted by the NDRC on January 31, 2011. The plan specified the city's plan to complete construction on Line 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 before 2017. Beginning on March 1, Line 1 subdivided its fare zones from 3 to 5 and lowered maximum fare from 5 CNY / ride to 4 CNY / ride.

A feasibility report to Line 6\u2014the second Hankou-Hanyang connection\u2014was also approved by the NDRC on December 21, 2012. Seven days later, line 2 entered revenue service, connecting some of the most populated areas of Hankou, Wuchang, and the [[Optics Valley of China|Optics Valley]].\n\nOn April 12, 2013, the NDRC granted acceptance to a feasibility report of Line 8, phase 1, which connects Hankou and Wuchang via the [[Second Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge|Second Yangtze River Bridge]] corridor. Construction began in June 2013 and was completed in December 2017.\n\n===Timeline of service expansion===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Segment description\n!Date opened\n!Station(s)\n!# of new stations\n!Length (km)\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 1\n|{{date|2004-7-28}}\n|Zongguan \u2014 Huangpu Road\n|10{{NoteTag|in which Taipingyang Station was postponed to open on {{date|2006-4-8}}.}}\n|9.769\n|-\n|Phase \u2161 of Line 1\n|{{date|2010-7-29}}\n| Dongwu Boulevard \u2014 Zongguan;<br> Huangpu Road \u2014 Dijiao\n|16{{NoteTag|in which Zhuyehai Station was postponed to open on {{date|2014-9-17}}.<ref>[http://qzgh.qiaokou.gov.cn/qkxw/bmdt/201409/t20140917_139172.shtml \u8f7b\u8f68\u7af9\u53f6\u6d77\u7ad9\u5b9c\u5bb6\u8054\u5eca\u6865\u6295\u5165\u4f7f\u7528 (Zhuyehai station opened)]</ref>}}\n|18.494\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 2\n|{{date|2012-12-28}}\n| Jinyintan \u2014 Optics Valley Square\n|21\n|27.152\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 4<ref>[http://cjweek.cjn.cn/html/2013-12/27/content_5269051.htm Section one of Metro Line 4 opens]</ref>\n|{{date|2013-12-28}}\n| Wuchang Railway Station \u2014 Wuhan Railway Station\n|15\n|17.974\n|-\n|Hankou North extension of Line 1\n|{{date|2014-5-28}}\n|  Dijiao \u2014 Hankou North\n|3\n|5.555 \n|-\n|Phase \u2161 of Line 4\n|{{date|2014-12-28}}\n| Huangjinkou \u2014 Wuchang Railway Station\n|13\n|15.429\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 3<ref name=\"Line 3\">{{cite news|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u5373\u5c06\u5730\u94c1\u6210\u73af \"\u73af\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3\"\u91cd\u6784\u5546\u4e1a\u5730\u7406  |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/house/wh/2015-12/24/c_1117562445.htm |work=\u957f\u6c5f\u65e5\u62a5 |language=Chinese |date=2015-12-24 |accessdate=2015-12-24 }}</ref>\n|{{date|2015-12-28}}\n|Zhuanyang Boulevard \u2014 Hongtu Boulevard\t\n|24\n|29.660\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 6\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{date|2016-12-28}}<ref name=\"\u6b66\u6c49\u5730\u94c1\u673a\u573a\u7ebf\u53ca6\u53f7\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a \u6e56\u5317\u79fb\u52a8\u5168\u9762\u5e03\u5c40\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\">[http://tech.cnr.cn/techgd/20161228/t20161228_523405232.shtml  \u6b66\u6c49\u5730\u94c1\u673a\u573a\u7ebf\u53ca6\u53f7\u7ebf\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a \u6e56\u5317\u79fb\u52a8\u5168\u9762\u5e03\u5c40\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6]</ref>\n|Jinyinhu Park \u2014 Dongfeng Motor Corporation\t\n|27\n|35.512\n|-\n|Northern extension of Line 2{{NoteTag|also known as Airport Line }}\n|Tianhe International Airport \u2014 Jinyintan\t\n|7\n|19.957\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 8\n| rowspan=\"3\"|{{date|2017-12-26}}\n|Jintan Road \u2014 Liyuan\t\n|12\n|16.204\n|-\n|Yangluo Line\n|Houhu Boulevard \u2014 Jintai\n|16\n|34.575\n|-\n|Jinghe extension of Line 1\n|Dongwu Boulevard \u2014 Jinghe\n|3\n|4.118\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 7\n| rowspan=\"2\"|{{date|2018-10-1}}<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://hb.qq.com/a/20181001/003195.htm#p=1|website=www.xinhuanet.com|script-title=zh:\u6b66\u6c49\u957f\u6c5f\u516c\u94c1\u96a7\u9053\u4eca\u65e5\u5f00\u901a 7\u53f7\u7ebf\u300111\u53f7\u7ebf\u8bd5\u8fd0\u8425|access-date=2017-12-26}}</ref>\n|Garden Expo North \u2014 Yezhihu\n|19\n|30.413\n|-\n|Phase \u2160 of Line 11\n|Optics Valley Railway Station \u2014 Zuoling\n|13\n|18.744\n|-\n|Southern extension of Line 7\n|{{date|2018-12-28}}\n|Yezhihu \u2014 Qinglongshan Ditiexiaozhen\n|7\n|16.550\n|-\n|Southern extension of Line 2\n|{{date|2019-2-19}}\n|Optics Valley Square \u2014 Fozuling\n|10\n|13.195\n|-\n|Wsetern extension of Line 4<ref name=cjn201909>{{cite web|url=http://news.cjn.cn/sywh/201909/t3460424.htm|title=\u5b9a\u4e86\uff01\u5730\u94c1\u8521\u7538\u7ebf25\u65e5\u4e0a\u53489\u65f6\u5f00\u901a|date=2019-09-23}}</ref>\n|{{date|2019-9-25}}\n|Bailin \u2014 Huangjinkou\n|9\n|16.288\n|-\n|Phase \u2162 of Line 8<ref name=Wuhan8-3>{{cite web|url=https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3LnB6Rl_lBp71IWU5fBITA|title=\u660e\u65e59\u70b9\uff0c\u6b66\u6c49\u8f68\u9053\u4ea4\u901a8\u53f7\u7ebf\u4e09\u671f\u5de5\u7a0b\u5f00\u901a\u8bd5\u8fd0\u8425|work=Wuhan Metro Operation|date=2019-11-05}}</ref>\n|{{date|2019-11-6}}\n|Yezhihu \u2014 Military Athletes' Village\n|3\n|4.832\n|}\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==Lines==\n{{center|[[File:Wuhan Metro System Map.svg|750px]]}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;text-align:center\"\n|-\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"100\" style=\"width:450px; \"|Current system\n|-\n! data-sort-type=\"text\"|Line Name\n! class=\"unsortable\" colspan=\"2\"|Termini\n!

The film stars [[Nayanthara]] in the lead role alongside a supporting cast including [[Yogi Babu]], [[Saranya Ponvannan]], [[R. S. Shivaji]], [[Charles Vinoth]], and [[Hareesh Peradi]]. [[Anirudh Ravichander]] composes the film's music. The film was released on 17 August 2018 to positive response and become a commercial success.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with the killing of a police officer by cocaine mafia lord Bhai ([[Hareesh Peradi]]) and his henchmen. Kokila ([[Nayanthara]]) struggles to find a job to take care of her parents and sister. She stumbles on the cocaine smuggling business of Mohan. When her mother is diagnosed with lung cancer, Kokila is forced to work for Mohan. Her cunning earns her a name in the business. The new inspector Guru is a no-nonsense cop and cracks down on drug dealers. Kokila is almost caught a couple of times but manages to evade the authorities. She convinces Mohan to kill two of his henchmen suspected of leaking information and then decides to quit the business. Mohan seemingly accepts but tries to rape her. She beats him up and tries to flee with her family but is caught by Bobi, who had recruited her initially. He demands that she deliver a one last consignment of 100 kilos to Alphonse. Kokila is forced to accept and enlists the help of her family. Shekhar and Lakshman Kumar join them unaware of their smuggling. She delivers the load, but it is revealed that she switched most of it for salt. She then tricks Bobi to double-cross Bhai and then frames him for swindling Bhai. She has him killed and continues the shipment run. On the way, she is caught by the police, who were Alphonse's men in disguise. She manages to avoid getting raped and kills off her captors with the help of her family. Guru tracks her down and arrests her. Kokila makes a deal with him to nab Bhai and bring the whole drug business down. The plan works out, Bhai is shot dead, and Kokila and her family escape punishment. In the end, the family starts a business of Kolam powder, calling it 'Kokila Kolamavu'.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*   [[Nayanthara]] as Kokila\n*   [[Yogi Babu]] as Shekhar\n*   [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as Kokila's mother \n*   [[R.

The film stars [[Nayanthara]] in the lead role alongside a supporting cast including [[Yogi Babu]], [[Saranya Ponvannan]], [[R. S. Shivaji]], [[Charles Vinoth]], and [[Hareesh Peradi]]. [[Anirudh Ravichander]] composes the film's music. The film was released on 17 August 2018 to positive response and become a commercial success.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film opens with the killing of a police officer by cocaine mafia lord Bhai ([[Hareesh Peradi]]) and his henchmen. Kokila ([[Nayanthara]]) struggles to find a job to take care of her parents and sister. She stumbles on the cocaine smuggling business of Mohan. When her mother is diagnosed with lung cancer, Kokila is forced to work for Mohan. Her cunning earns her a name in the business. The new inspector Guru is a no-nonsense cop and cracks down on drug dealers. Kokila is almost caught a couple of times but manages to evade the authorities. She convinces Mohan to kill two of his henchmen suspected of leaking information and then decides to quit the business. Mohan seemingly accepts but tries to rape her. She beats him up and tries to flee with her family but is caught by Bobi, who had recruited her initially. He demands that she deliver a one last consignment of 100 kilos to Alphonse. Kokila is forced to accept and enlists the help of her family. Shekhar and Lakshman Kumar join them unaware of their smuggling. She delivers the load, but it is revealed that she switched most of it for salt. She then tricks Bobi to double-cross Bhai and then frames him for swindling Bhai. She has him killed and continues the shipment run. On the way, she is caught by the police, who were Alphonse's men in disguise. She manages to avoid getting raped and kills off her captors with the help of her family. Guru tracks her down and arrests her. Kokila makes a deal with him to nab Bhai and bring the whole drug business down. The plan works out, Bhai is shot dead, and Kokila and her family escape punishment. In the end, the family starts a business of Kolam powder, calling it 'Kokila Kolamavu'.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*   [[Nayanthara]] as Kokila\n*   [[Yogi Babu]] as Shekhar\n*   [[Saranya Ponvannan]] as Kokila's mother \n*   [[R.

In practice and in its aims, program management is often closely related to [[systems engineering]], [[industrial engineering]], [[change management]], and [[business transformation]]. In the defense sector, it is the dominant approach to managing very large projects. Because major defense programs entail working with contractors, it is often called acquisition management, indicating that the government buyer acquires goods and services by means of contractors. \n\nThe program manager has oversight of the purpose and status of the projects in a program and can use this oversight to support project-level activity to ensure the program goals are met by providing a decision-making capacity that cannot be achieved at project level or by providing the [[project manager]] with a program perspective when required, or as a sounding board for ideas and approaches to solving project issues that have program impacts. The program manager may be well placed to provide this insight by actively seeking out such information from the project managers although in large and/or complex projects, a specific role may be required. However this insight arises, the program manager needs this in order to be comfortable that the overall program goals are achievable.\n\n== Overview and definition ==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}\nMany programs focus on delivering a capability to change, and are normally designed to deliver the organisation's strategy or business transformation. Program management also emphasizes the coordinating and prioritizing of [[Resource (project management)|resources]] across projects, managing links between the projects and the overall costs and risks of the program.\n\nAccording to one source, \"a Program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits and control NOT available from managing them individually.  Programs may include elements of related [[Work (project management)|work]] outside of the [[Scope (project management)|scope]] of the discrete projects in the program...  Some projects within a program can deliver useful incremental benefits to the organization before the program itself has completed.\"<ref>{{cite book | title=The Standard for Program Management, Second Edition | publisher=Project Management Institute | year=2011}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative source (the UK Office  of Government Commerce) uses the following definition, \"a programme is a temporary flexible organisation structure created to coordinate, direct and oversee the implementation of a set of related projects and activities in order to deliver outcomes and benefits related to an organisations strategic objectives. A programme is likely to have a life that spans several years. \"<ref>{{cite book | title=Managing Successful Programmes, 2011| publisher= TSO | year=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe different spellings are relevant, Program is the US spelling and Programme is the UK spelling. The differences are far greater than spelling and reflect different philosophies. The US approach is focused on internal controls and delivery of complex projects and has grown our of the project industry, the UK approach is more focused on the achievement of all aspects of achieving a strategic objective and has grown out of the strategic change industry. This leads to inherent differences in the approach.There is no suggestion that either approach is right or wrong, in fact, they are complimentary in many ways.\n\nProgram management may provide a layer above the management of projects and focuses on selecting the best group of projects, defining them in terms of their objectives and providing an environment where projects can be run successfully. Program managers should not micromanage, but should leave project management to the project managers.  However, program management might need to deal with interdependencies, conflicts and resource or knowledge sharing among the projects it manages.\n\nIn public sector work in  [[Europe]], the term normally refers to multiple change projects: projects that are designed to deliver benefits to the host organization. For example, the [[Office of Government Commerce]] for the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government]]. An alternative to the Office of Government Commerce's methodology for program management is that of the private sector [[Project Management Institute]].\n\nMany organizations only run one program at a time, a program containing all their projects. In [[Project Management Institute]] terminology, this is more likely to be a project portfolio than a program.   Some larger organizations may have multiple programs each designed to deliver a range of improvements. Some organizations use the concept of [[Systems engineering|Systems Engineering]] where others use program management.\n\n==Key factors==\n;Benefits: The key difference between a project and a programme is that benefits are delivering within the programme lifecycle compared to a project when they are delivered after the project has finished, this  is a vital distinction as benefits management is the driving force within successful programmes.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p75</ref>\n;Governance: The structure, process, and procedure to control internal operations and changes to performance objectives. Governance must include a set of metrics to indicate the health and progress of the program in the most vital areas.\n;Alignment: The program must support a higher level vision, goals and objectives. These are set out in the programme Vision and blueprint, which defines the future state for the organisation, sector or community that will be significantly changed, Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p107</ref>\n;Transformation: A programme will deliver major change, whether it is within an organisation, an sector or a community. As such the management of change and transition is a key characteristic of a programme, not just the building a major capability.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p107</ref>\n;Assurance: Verify and validate the program, ensuring adherence to standards and alignment with the vision. Programmes should always have an Assurance Strategy.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p162</ref>\n;Management: Ensure there are regular reviews, there is [[accountability]], and that management of projects, [[Project stakeholders|stakeholders]] and suppliers is in place.\n;Integration: Ensure that component parts fit together properly to make the intended whole. Optimize performance across the program [[value chain]], functionally and technically.\n;Finances: Track basic costs together with wider costs of administering the program and also the costs of change and transition to achieve benefits.\n;Infrastructure: Allocation of resources influences the cost and success of the program. Infrastructure might cover offices, [[version control]], and IT.\n;Planning: Develop the plan bringing together the information on projects, resources, timescales, monitoring and control.<ref>''Managing Successful Programmes'', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p107</ref>\n;Improvement: Continuously assess performance; research and develop new capabilities; and systemically apply learning and knowledge to the program.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p155</ref>\n\n== Comparison with project management==\nThere are the two different views of how programs differ from projects. In one view, projects deliver outputs, discrete parcels or \"chunks\" of change;<ref>''All Change'' Eddie Obeng Financial Times Publishing 1994</ref> programs create outcomes.<ref>The Gower Handbook of Programme Management</ref> In this view, a project might deliver a new factory, hospital or IT system. By combining these projects with other [[deliverable]]s and changes, their programs might deliver increased income from a new product, shorter waiting lists at the hospital or reduced operating costs due to improved technology. The other view<ref>The Definitive Guide to Project Management. Nokes, Sebastian. London (Financial Times / Prentice Hall): 2007</ref> is that a program is nothing more than either a large project or a set (or portfolio) of projects. In this second view, the point of having a program is to exploit economies of scale and to reduce coordination costs and risks. The project manager's job is to ensure that their project succeeds. The program manager, on the other hand, is concerned with the aggregate outcome(s) or end-state result(s) of the collection of projects in a particular program. For example, in a financial institution a program may include one project that is designed to take advantage of a rising market and another that is designed to protect against the downside of a falling market. The former seeks to leverage the potential upside; the latter to limit the possible downside. Consider a simple analogy: Fix-A-Flat\u00ae.  This highly pressurized aerosol product injects a leak sealant into a punctured tire to stop the outflow of air (project A) and concurrently re-inflates the tire (project B), resulting together in the outcome that is a tire that is once again functional (the program comprised projects A and B).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.project-laneways.com.au/certification-courses/programme-management/financial-programme-management | title=How Project Managers Deal With Opposing Projects in a Financial Programme | publisher=Project Laneways | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the view that programs deliver outcomes but projects deliver outputs, program management is concerned with doing the right projects. The program manager has been described as 'playing chess' and keeping the overview in mind, with the pieces to be used or sacrificed being the projects.<ref>''Putting Strategy to Work'' Eddie Obeng Financial Times Publishing 1996</ref>  In contrast, [[project management]] is about doing projects right. And also according to this view, successful projects deliver on time, to budget and to specification, whereas successful programs deliver long term improvements to an organization. Improvements are usually identified through benefits. An organization should select the group of programs that most take it towards its strategic aims while remaining within its capacity to deliver the changes. On the other hand, the view that programs are simply large projects or a set of projects allows that a program may need to deliver tangible benefits quickly.\n\nAccording to one source, the key difference between a program and a project is the finite nature of a project<ref name=\"PMH\">Prieto, Robert, [http://www.pmhut.com/how-program-management-differs-from-project-management How Program Management Differs from Project Management], PM Hut. Accessed 17. Oct 2009.</ref> - a project must always have a specific end date, else it is an ongoing program.\n\nOne view of the differences between a program and a project in business is that:\n# A project is unique and is of definite [[Duration (project management)|duration]]. A program is ongoing and implemented within a business to consistently achieve certain results for the business.\n# A project is designed to deliver an output or deliverable and its success will be in terms of delivering the right output at the right time and to the right cost.\n# Program management includes management of projects which, together, improve the performance of the organization. A program's success will be measured in terms of benefits.\n# Benefits are the measures of improvement of an organization and might include increased income, increased profits, decreased costs, improved market position (ability to compete), reduced wastage or environmental damage, more satisfied customers. In central or local government organizations, benefits might include providing a better service to the community.\n# In the course of achieving required results, business programs will normally understand related business constraints and determine the processes required to achieve results based on resources allocated.  Improvement of processes is a continuous operation that very much contrasts a program from a project.\n# At the lowest level project managers co-ordinate individual projects. They are overseen by the program manager who accounts to the [[Executive sponsor|program sponsor]] (or board).\n# There will normally be a process to change the predetermined scope of a project. Programs often have to react to changes in strategy and changes in the environment in which the organization changes.\n\nAnother view and another successful way of managing does not see any of the factors listed above as distinguishing projects from programs, but rather sees the program as being about portfolio management. On this view, program management is about selecting projects, adjusting the speed at which they run, and adjusting their scope, in order to the maximize the value of the portfolio as a whole, and as economic or other external conditions change. Still, some emphasize that whereas a portfolio consists of independent projects, a program is a collection of interdependent projects, adding a dimension of complexity to the management task.\n\nYet another view is that a program management is nothing more than a large, complex project, where the integration aspect of project management is more important than in smaller projects. Integration management is a key feature of the [[Project Management Institute]]'s approach to project management. Yet again, some accept there is a distinction related to interdependencies between the elements of a project and a program. In this view, a program is a comparably loosely coupled system, whereas large, complex projects are tightly coupled. This difference makes the project program a more ambiguous task to manage, with more uncertainty, reflecting a higher degree of freedom and a management task more open to exploit opportunities as they arise or the program management becomes aware of them.\n\nIn practice it is not clear that there is a clear-cut distinction. Projects (or programs) vary from small and simple to large and complex; what needs to be a managed as a program in one culture or organization may be managed as a project in another.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cost overrun]]\n* [[List of project management topics]]\n* [[Project Management Institute]]\n* [[Systems engineering]]\n* [[Comparison of project management software]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nManaging Successful Programmes, Rod Sowden et al.

(TSO, 2011), p107</ref>\n;Transformation: A programme will deliver major change, whether it is within an organisation, an sector or a community. As such the management of change and transition is a key characteristic of a programme, not just the building a major capability.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p107</ref>\n;Assurance: Verify and validate the program, ensuring adherence to standards and alignment with the vision. Programmes should always have an Assurance Strategy.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p162</ref>\n;Management: Ensure there are regular reviews, there is [[accountability]], and that management of projects, [[Project stakeholders|stakeholders]] and suppliers is in place.\n;Integration: Ensure that component parts fit together properly to make the intended whole. Optimize performance across the program [[value chain]], functionally and technically.\n;Finances: Track basic costs together with wider costs of administering the program and also the costs of change and transition to achieve benefits.\n;Infrastructure: Allocation of resources influences the cost and success of the program. Infrastructure might cover offices, [[version control]], and IT.\n;Planning: Develop the plan bringing together the information on projects, resources, timescales, monitoring and control.<ref>''Managing Successful Programmes'', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p107</ref>\n;Improvement: Continuously assess performance; research and develop new capabilities; and systemically apply learning and knowledge to the program.', Rod Sowden et al. (TSO, 2011), p155</ref>\n\n== Comparison with project management==\nThere are the two different views of how programs differ from projects. In one view, projects deliver outputs, discrete parcels or \"chunks\" of change;<ref>''All Change'' Eddie Obeng Financial Times Publishing 1994</ref> programs create outcomes.<ref>The Gower Handbook of Programme Management</ref> In this view, a project might deliver a new factory, hospital or IT system. By combining these projects with other [[deliverable]]s and changes, their programs might deliver increased income from a new product, shorter waiting lists at the hospital or reduced operating costs due to improved technology. The other view<ref>The Definitive Guide to Project Management. Nokes, Sebastian. London (Financial Times / Prentice Hall): 2007</ref> is that a program is nothing more than either a large project or a set (or portfolio) of projects. In this second view, the point of having a program is to exploit economies of scale and to reduce coordination costs and risks. The project manager's job is to ensure that their project succeeds. The program manager, on the other hand, is concerned with the aggregate outcome(s) or end-state result(s) of the collection of projects in a particular program. For example, in a financial institution a program may include one project that is designed to take advantage of a rising market and another that is designed to protect against the downside of a falling market. The former seeks to leverage the potential upside; the latter to limit the possible downside. Consider a simple analogy: Fix-A-Flat\u00ae.  This highly pressurized aerosol product injects a leak sealant into a punctured tire to stop the outflow of air (project A) and concurrently re-inflates the tire (project B), resulting together in the outcome that is a tire that is once again functional (the program comprised projects A and B).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.project-laneways.com.au/certification-courses/programme-management/financial-programme-management | title=How Project Managers Deal With Opposing Projects in a Financial Programme | publisher=Project Laneways | accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the view that programs deliver outcomes but projects deliver outputs, program management is concerned with doing the right projects. The program manager has been described as 'playing chess' and keeping the overview in mind, with the pieces to be used or sacrificed being the projects.<ref>''Putting Strategy to Work'' Eddie Obeng Financial Times Publishing 1996</ref>  In contrast, [[project management]] is about doing projects right. And also according to this view, successful projects deliver on time, to budget and to specification, whereas successful programs deliver long term improvements to an organization. Improvements are usually identified through benefits. An organization should select the group of programs that most take it towards its strategic aims while remaining within its capacity to deliver the changes. On the other hand, the view that programs are simply large projects or a set of projects allows that a program may need to deliver tangible benefits quickly.\n\nAccording to one source, the key difference between a program and a project is the finite nature of a project<ref name=\"PMH\">Prieto, Robert, [http://www.pmhut.com/how-program-management-differs-from-project-management How Program Management Differs from Project Management], PM Hut. Accessed 17. Oct 2009.</ref> - a project must always have a specific end date, else it is an ongoing program.\n\nOne view of the differences between a program and a project in business is that:\n# A project is unique and is of definite [[Duration (project management)|duration]]. A program is ongoing and implemented within a business to consistently achieve certain results for the business.\n# A project is designed to deliver an output or deliverable and its success will be in terms of delivering the right output at the right time and to the right cost.\n# Program management includes management of projects which, together, improve the performance of the organization. A program's success will be measured in terms of benefits.\n# Benefits are the measures of improvement of an organization and might include increased income, increased profits, decreased costs, improved market position (ability to compete), reduced wastage or environmental damage, more satisfied customers. In central or local government organizations, benefits might include providing a better service to the community.\n# In the course of achieving required results, business programs will normally understand related business constraints and determine the processes required to achieve results based on resources allocated.  Improvement of processes is a continuous operation that very much contrasts a program from a project.\n# At the lowest level project managers co-ordinate individual projects. They are overseen by the program manager who accounts to the [[Executive sponsor|program sponsor]] (or board).\n# There will normally be a process to change the predetermined scope of a project. Programs often have to react to changes in strategy and changes in the environment in which the organization changes.\n\nAnother view and another successful way of managing does not see any of the factors listed above as distinguishing projects from programs, but rather sees the program as being about portfolio management. On this view, program management is about selecting projects, adjusting the speed at which they run, and adjusting their scope, in order to the maximize the value of the portfolio as a whole, and as economic or other external conditions change. Still, some emphasize that whereas a portfolio consists of independent projects, a program is a collection of interdependent projects, adding a dimension of complexity to the management task.\n\nYet another view is that a program management is nothing more than a large, complex project, where the integration aspect of project management is more important than in smaller projects. Integration management is a key feature of the [[Project Management Institute]]'s approach to project management. Yet again, some accept there is a distinction related to interdependencies between the elements of a project and a program. In this view, a program is a comparably loosely coupled system, whereas large, complex projects are tightly coupled. This difference makes the project program a more ambiguous task to manage, with more uncertainty, reflecting a higher degree of freedom and a management task more open to exploit opportunities as they arise or the program management becomes aware of them.\n\nIn practice it is not clear that there is a clear-cut distinction. Projects (or programs) vary from small and simple to large and complex; what needs to be a managed as a program in one culture or organization may be managed as a project in another.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cost overrun]]\n* [[List of project management topics]]\n* [[Project Management Institute]]\n* [[Systems engineering]]\n* [[Comparison of project management software]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nManaging Successful Programmes, Rod Sowden et al.
