Held on [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]], the race has been a tradition for rowers in the [[Philadelphia]] region ever since, with the exception of two years during [[World War I]] and two years during World War II. It begins at [[Malta Boat Club]] on [[Kelly Drive]], and continues over 5 5/8 miles of hilly terrain. The runners go inbound on [[Kelly Drive]] to the traffic light in front of Lloyd Hall, turn left and go up Lemon Hill and over the Girard Avenue Bridge, then right onto Lansdowne Avenue. Just past Sweetbriar Cutoff, the course turns right and starts the true \u201ccross country\u201d segment across grassy surfaces. Runners go to the General Meade Monument, then follow to the Pagoda entrance gate to Belmont Plateau, up the hill to Belmont Mansion, and return by way of Brewery Hill down Kelly Drive back to Malta Boat Club.\n\nAny and all members of The Schuylkill Navy clubs and its affiliates are eligible to compete, as well as friend and family guest runners. The classifications include the following categories: Open, Masters, Juniors, Guests, and Novices.<ref>{{Cite web |last=DeLorenzo |first=Jim |title=Over 200 Runners Set for the 107th Schuylkill Navy Run in Philadelphia Thanksgiving Day |url=http://myemail.constantcontact.com/Over-200-Runners-Set-for-the-107th-Schuylkill-Navy-Run-in-Philadelphia-Thanksgiving-Day.html?soid=1101417167175&aid=EbtegBdrNrc |accessdate=7 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Member clubs==\n\n===Current members===\n[[File:FairmountRA2010.jpg|thumb|200 x 50px|Fairmount Rowing Association]]\n;[[Fairmount Rowing Association]]\nEstablished in 1877 and located at No. 2 Boathouse Row, [[Fairmount Rowing Association|Fairmount]] is on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"NRHP Focus\" /> [[Fairmount Rowing Association|Fairmount]] gained admission to the Schuylkill Navy in 1916 after it had been rejected for decades.<ref name=fairmountrowing /> In 1945 the boathouse underwent a huge expansion in which it merged with what was No. 3 on Boathouse Row to create the current [[Fairmount Rowing Association]] boathouse.<ref name=fairmountrowing/> Fairmount has called itself the \"premiere club for Masters rowing in the mid-Atlantic region\".<ref name=fairmountrowing/> Recently the club has produced several world class rowers.<ref name=\"Teresa Z.
