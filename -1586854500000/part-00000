The partnership was initially created for the purpose of returning Aston Martin to [[sports car racing]] with the [[Aston Martin DBR9|DBR9]], a heavily modified variant of the [[Aston Martin DB9]].  Since the DBR9's racing debut in 2005, Aston Martin Racing has expanded to build a variety of cars available to customers, as well as development of Aston Martin's [[V12 engine]] for [[Le Mans Prototype]] use.  Aston Martin Racing's program has earned several successes over the years.\n\nAlthough all cars are built by Prodrive at their factory, Aston Martin plays an integral part in designing the race cars, as well as integrating elements of the race cars back into Aston Martin's road cars.\n\nOn 23 April 2009, Aston Martin chairman and Prodrive founder [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]] announced his intent to return to [[Formula One]] in {{F1|2010}} with the possibility of using the Aston Martin name,<ref name=\"Richards keen on Formula 1 return\">{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8014273.stm | title = Richards keen on Formula One return | work=BBC News | date=2009-04-23 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref> however this never materialised. Aston Martin had previously raced in the 1959 and 1960 Formula One seasons but failed to score points in either year.\n\n==Cars==\nAston Martin Racing builds cars for international [[grand tourer]] classes.  The team itself run a squad of DBR9s in the former top class, GT1, while other cars were offered to customers.  The GTE class (formerly GT2) became their next target after the failure of the 2011 season, and the car is based on the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|V8 Vantage]].  The V8 Vantage is also featured in GT3 and GT4 classes.  Before GT3 Vantage was introduced the [[Aston Martin DBRS9|DBRS9]] was also solely racing in GT3.\n\nIn 2008, Aston Martin Racing began their entry into the [[Le Mans Prototype]] category with the aid of [[Charouz Racing System]], installing a DBR9 V12 into a [[Lola B08/60]] LMP1 prototype.\n\nOn 27 January 2009, the team announced a full works entry in the [[Le Mans Prototype]] category for the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]]<ref name=\"AML 2009 Entry to Le Mans\">{{cite web | url = http://www.astonmartinracing.com/eng/news?a=05eff989-79e7-4dcc-9857-e9312652746e | title = Aston Martin to challenge for overall Le Mans win | publisher = [[Aston Martin]] | date = 2009-01-27 | accessdate = 2009-01-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090131005425/http://astonmartinracing.com/eng/news?a=05eff989-79e7-4dcc-9857-e9312652746e| archivedate= 31 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> with the [[Lola-Aston Martin B09/60]]. The entry marks the 50th anniversary of its last outright win at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]]. The 2009 programme got off to an unfortunate start at the pre season Paul Ricard test on 8 March when [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge]] destroyed the 007 car in an accident. Aston Martin Racing subsequently took delivery of a new Lola to replace the written off chassis.<ref>{{cite news |title=What economic downturn?

The aim was to emulate the achievements of the [[1959 24 Hours of Le Mans|1959]] race win with the [[Aston Martin DBR1|DBR1]] driven by [[Carroll Shelby]] and [[Roy Salvadori]]. At Le Mans the AMR Eastern Europe 007 car of [[Jan Charouz]], [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge]] and [[Stefan Mucke|Stefan M\u00fccke]] finished fourth behind the factory entries of Peugeot and Audi, as well as being the highest finishing petrol-fuelled car. The 008 car was running as high as 3rd overall in the morning until Anthony Davidson had a collision with a GT1 Aston. Subsequent repairs and a 5-minute stop and go penalty\u2014for causing the collision\u2014dropped the car out of contention. The 009 car was retired after 252 laps.\n\nThree cars were also entered in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]], although only the 007 and 009 cars were run by Aston Martin Racing; the 008 car was run by the French team [[Signature-Plus]]. Both the 008 and 009 cars suffered from problems and had to be retired, leaving only the 007 to finish 6th overall and completing 365 laps, less than it did in 2009.\n\nIn 2011 the B09/60 was succeeded by the [[Aston Martin AMR-One]], powered by a downsized, 2.0 litre turbocharged straight six petrol engine. Initially, the car was running very poorly. In its first racing event, the [[2011 6 Hours of Castellet]], it was only as fast as some of the LMP2 cars in qualifying and was plagued with mechanical issues. It completed only 96 laps. They then decided not to race it in the rounds of the [[2011 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup|Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] leading up to [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] so they can continue private testing with the troubled car in order to sort out the mechanical issues. So around came Le Mans and despite the testing and extra car, they were still lapping in the middle of the LMP2 pack in qualifying and in the race it was much a much worse scenario. Car #009 retired after only two laps around the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] and car #007 retired two laps later on lap four. Both cars completed a combined six laps at the 79th Grand Prix of Endurance. After this shocking result, the team raced the old B09/60 for the remainder of the season although a much downgraded version in order to comply with the new 2011 regulations.\n\nFor 2012, Aston Martin Racing returned to GT racing with the [[Aston Martin Vantage GT2|V8 Vantage GT2]]. They entered two cars at the [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans]] with one in the LMGTE-Pro class and one in the LMGTE-Am class. They also had a third Vantage in the GTE-Pro class as a reserve entrant. One of the existing AMR-One's has been sold to [[Pescarolo Sport]] who are set to compete with that car and naming it the '''Pescarolo 03'''. They will use an engine from [[Judd (engine)|Judd Power]] rather than the Aston Martin powerplant. The other AMR-One has formed the base for the new [[DeltaWing]] project which debuted at Le Mans in 2012 with [[Highcroft Racing]]. The DeltaWing uses the AMR-One's carbon fibre tub.\n\nIn 2013 to celebrate the centenary of the marque, the team will be entering two 2013 specification Aston Martin [[Aston Martin Vantage GT2|Vantage GTE]]'s in the LMGTE PRO class and two 2012 specification [[Aston Martin Vantage GT2|Vantage GTE]]'s in LMGTE AM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2013/02/2013-24-hours-of-le-mans-entry-list/|title=2013 24 Hours of Le Mans Entry List|date=4 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref> The team will also compete in the full season of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] with the same cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2013/02/aston-martin-racing-unveil-strong-wec-line-up|title=Aston Martin Racing Unveil Strong WEC Line-Up  - 24 Hours of Le Mans, American Le Mans Series, FIA WEC - The Checkered Flag|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref> Ex-[[Formula 1]] driver [[Bruno Senna]] will join the team for the season<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2013/02/bruno-senna-hunting-race-wins-with-aston-martin-racing-move/|title=Bruno Senna Hunting Race Wins With Aston Martin Racing Move - 24 Hours of Le Mans, FIA WEC - The Checkered Flag|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref> in the one of the GTE Pro cars partnered by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Makowiecki]] and Robert Bell. The main GTE Pro car will feature AMR regulars  [[Darren Turner]] and [[Stefan M\u00fccke]] and will be joined by [[Peter Dumbreck]] for the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] and the Six hours of Spa-Franchorchamps.\n\nOn the 21st November 2017 Aston Martin revealed the new Vantage: a dynamic successor to the biggest-selling road car in the British marque's history. This evening, in an unprecedented synchronised launch, Aston Martin Racing revealed the new 2018 Vantage GTE: the spectacular new FIA World Endurance Championship challenger poised to replace the team's most successful competition car of all-time, the multiple Le Mans-winning V8 Vantage GTE.\nAston Martin Racing has confirmed it will race two brand new Vantage GTEs in the GTE Pro category of the 2018/19 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) Super Season.\n\n==Results==\nSince the team's debut at the [[2005 12 Hours of Sebring]], Aston Martin Racing has earned several important victories in their career.  Their very first race actually earned them their first victory, defeating the [[Corvette Racing]] squad at Sebring.  The [[RAC Tourist Trophy]] was also won later that year.\n\nFor 2006, Aston Martin Racing entered the full [[American Le Mans Series]] season, earning five victories including the [[Petit Le Mans]], and finishing second in the GT1 championship, three points shy of Corvette Racing.  In 2007, Aston Martin earned their first victory at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] since the company's overall win in {{24hLM|1959}} by overcoming the Corvette squad.  This feat was repeated once more in {{24hLM|2008}} in GT1, while the team also had involvement in the [[Lola B08/60]] LMP1 Coupe run under the Charouz Racing banner\n\nFor 2009 Aston Martin Racing entered two of their new prototypes along with Aston Martin Racing Eastern Europe which completed the works trio of [[Aston Martin DBR1-2|DBR1-2]] or [[Lola-Aston Martin B09/60]]. The team's greatest success with the new prototype came with the [[2009 Le Mans Series season|2009 Le Mans Series]] (LMS) where in the first round in Barcelona the team won the 1000&nbsp;km de Catalunya outright and with a string of podiums and a 1-2-3 sweep of the ADAC 1000&nbsp;km N\u00fcrburgring and a podium at the [[Autosport]] [[1000 km Silverstone|1000&nbsp;km of Silverstone]] sealed the 2009 drivers title for 007 and [[Jan Charouz]], [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge]], [[Stefan Mucke]] and the constructors title for Aston Martin-LOLA as well as the team title for Aston Martin Racing.\n\nSince 2012 Aston Martin Racing has been racing in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] with the [[Aston Martin Vantage GTE (disambiguation)|Aston Martin Vantage GTE]], earning them several wins and titles. During the inaugural season of the [[2012 FIA World Endurance Championship|FIA World Endurance Championship]] in 2012 Aston Martin Racing finished runner-up in the LMGTE Pro Trophy. In 2014 they won the FIA Endurance Trophy for LMGTE Am Teams and Drivers with Danish duo [[Kristian Poulsen]] and [[David Heinemeier Hansson]]. During the season they also won the [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in the LMGTE Am category. In 2016 Aston Martin Racing managed to take the crown in the World Endurance Cup for GT Drivers with [[Nicki Thiim]] and [[Marco S\u00f8rensen]]. They also won the LMGTE Pro Teams\u2019 championship. The 2017 season saw them win both the Drivers\u2019 and Teams\u2019 Championship in the GTE Am category. In June 2017 Aston Martin Racing also won the [[2017 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in GTE Pro with [[Darren Turner]], [[Jonathan Adam]] and [[Daniel Serra]] driving the winning Aston Martin Vantage GTE.\n\n[[File:Aston Martin Vantage GTE 2016.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Aston Martin Vantage GTE running in the [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans]]]]\n\n===24 Hours of Le Mans results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

The partnership was initially created for the purpose of returning Aston Martin to [[sports car racing]] with the [[Aston Martin DBR9|DBR9]], a heavily modified variant of the [[Aston Martin DB9]].  Since the DBR9's racing debut in 2005, Aston Martin Racing has expanded to build a variety of cars available to customers, as well as development of Aston Martin's [[V12 engine]] for [[Le Mans Prototype]] use.  Aston Martin Racing's program has earned several successes over the years.\n\nAlthough all cars are built by Prodrive at their factory, Aston Martin plays an integral part in designing the race cars, as well as integrating elements of the race cars back into Aston Martin's road cars.\n\nOn 23 April 2009, Aston Martin chairman and Prodrive founder [[David Richards (racing)|David Richards]] announced his intent to return to [[Formula One]] in {{F1|2010}} with the possibility of using the Aston Martin name,<ref name=\"Richards keen on Formula 1 return\">{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8014273.stm | title = Richards keen on Formula One return | work=BBC News | date=2009-04-23 | accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref> however this never materialised. Aston Martin had previously raced in the 1959 and 1960 Formula One seasons but failed to score points in either year.\n\n==Cars==\nAston Martin Racing builds cars for international [[grand tourer]] classes.  The team itself run a squad of DBR9s in the former top class, GT1, while other cars were offered to customers.  The GTE class (formerly GT2) became their next target after the failure of the 2011 season, and the car is based on the [[Aston Martin V8 Vantage (2005)|V8 Vantage]].  The V8 Vantage is also featured in GT3 and GT4 classes.  Before GT3 Vantage was introduced the [[Aston Martin DBRS9|DBRS9]] was also solely racing in GT3.\n\nIn 2008, Aston Martin Racing began their entry into the [[Le Mans Prototype]] category with the aid of [[Charouz Racing System]], installing a DBR9 V12 into a [[Lola B08/60]] LMP1 prototype.\n\nOn 27 January 2009, the team announced a full works entry in the [[Le Mans Prototype]] category for the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]]<ref name=\"AML 2009 Entry to Le Mans\">{{cite web | url = http://www.astonmartinracing.com/eng/news?a=05eff989-79e7-4dcc-9857-e9312652746e | title = Aston Martin to challenge for overall Le Mans win | publisher = [[Aston Martin]] | date = 2009-01-27 | accessdate = 2009-01-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090131005425/http://astonmartinracing.com/eng/news?a=05eff989-79e7-4dcc-9857-e9312652746e| archivedate= 31 January 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> with the [[Lola-Aston Martin B09/60]]. The entry marks the 50th anniversary of its last outright win at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]]. The 2009 programme got off to an unfortunate start at the pre season Paul Ricard test on 8 March when [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge]] destroyed the 007 car in an accident. Aston Martin Racing subsequently took delivery of a new Lola to replace the written off chassis.<ref>{{cite news |title=What economic downturn?

At Le Mans the AMR Eastern Europe 007 car of [[Jan Charouz]], [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge]] and [[Stefan Mucke|Stefan M\u00fccke]] finished fourth behind the factory entries of Peugeot and Audi, as well as being the highest finishing petrol-fuelled car. The 008 car was running as high as 3rd overall in the morning until Anthony Davidson had a collision with a GT1 Aston. Subsequent repairs and a 5-minute stop and go penalty\u2014for causing the collision\u2014dropped the car out of contention. The 009 car was retired after 252 laps.\n\nThree cars were also entered in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]], although only the 007 and 009 cars were run by Aston Martin Racing; the 008 car was run by the French team [[Signature-Plus]]. Both the 008 and 009 cars suffered from problems and had to be retired, leaving only the 007 to finish 6th overall and completing 365 laps, less than it did in 2009.\n\nIn 2011 the B09/60 was succeeded by the [[Aston Martin AMR-One]], powered by a downsized, 2.0 litre turbocharged straight six petrol engine. Initially, the car was running very poorly. In its first racing event, the [[2011 6 Hours of Castellet]], it was only as fast as some of the LMP2 cars in qualifying and was plagued with mechanical issues. It completed only 96 laps. They then decided not to race it in the rounds of the [[2011 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup|Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] leading up to [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] so they can continue private testing with the troubled car in order to sort out the mechanical issues. So around came Le Mans and despite the testing and extra car, they were still lapping in the middle of the LMP2 pack in qualifying and in the race it was much a much worse scenario. Car #009 retired after only two laps around the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] and car #007 retired two laps later on lap four. Both cars completed a combined six laps at the 79th Grand Prix of Endurance. After this shocking result, the team raced the old B09/60 for the remainder of the season although a much downgraded version in order to comply with the new 2011 regulations.\n\nFor 2012, Aston Martin Racing returned to GT racing with the [[Aston Martin Vantage GT2|V8 Vantage GT2]]. They entered two cars at the [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans]] with one in the LMGTE-Pro class and one in the LMGTE-Am class. They also had a third Vantage in the GTE-Pro class as a reserve entrant. One of the existing AMR-One's has been sold to [[Pescarolo Sport]] who are set to compete with that car and naming it the '''Pescarolo 03'''. They will use an engine from [[Judd (engine)|Judd Power]] rather than the Aston Martin powerplant. The other AMR-One has formed the base for the new [[DeltaWing]] project which debuted at Le Mans in 2012 with [[Highcroft Racing]]. The DeltaWing uses the AMR-One's carbon fibre tub.\n\nIn 2013 to celebrate the centenary of the marque, the team will be entering two 2013 specification Aston Martin [[Aston Martin Vantage GT2|Vantage GTE]]'s in the LMGTE PRO class and two 2012 specification [[Aston Martin Vantage GT2|Vantage GTE]]'s in LMGTE AM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2013/02/2013-24-hours-of-le-mans-entry-list/|title=2013 24 Hours of Le Mans Entry List|date=4 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref> The team will also compete in the full season of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] with the same cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2013/02/aston-martin-racing-unveil-strong-wec-line-up|title=Aston Martin Racing Unveil Strong WEC Line-Up  - 24 Hours of Le Mans, American Le Mans Series, FIA WEC - The Checkered Flag|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref> Ex-[[Formula 1]] driver [[Bruno Senna]] will join the team for the season<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2013/02/bruno-senna-hunting-race-wins-with-aston-martin-racing-move/|title=Bruno Senna Hunting Race Wins With Aston Martin Racing Move - 24 Hours of Le Mans, FIA WEC - The Checkered Flag|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref> in the one of the GTE Pro cars partnered by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Makowiecki]] and Robert Bell. The main GTE Pro car will feature AMR regulars  [[Darren Turner]] and [[Stefan M\u00fccke]] and will be joined by [[Peter Dumbreck]] for the [[24 hours of Le Mans]] and the Six hours of Spa-Franchorchamps.\n\nOn the 21st November 2017 Aston Martin revealed the new Vantage: a dynamic successor to the biggest-selling road car in the British marque's history. This evening, in an unprecedented synchronised launch, Aston Martin Racing revealed the new 2018 Vantage GTE: the spectacular new FIA World Endurance Championship challenger poised to replace the team's most successful competition car of all-time, the multiple Le Mans-winning V8 Vantage GTE.\nAston Martin Racing has confirmed it will race two brand new Vantage GTEs in the GTE Pro category of the 2018/19 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) Super Season.\n\n==Results==\nSince the team's debut at the [[2005 12 Hours of Sebring]], Aston Martin Racing has earned several important victories in their career.  Their very first race actually earned them their first victory, defeating the [[Corvette Racing]] squad at Sebring.  The [[RAC Tourist Trophy]] was also won later that year.\n\nFor 2006, Aston Martin Racing entered the full [[American Le Mans Series]] season, earning five victories including the [[Petit Le Mans]], and finishing second in the GT1 championship, three points shy of Corvette Racing.  In 2007, Aston Martin earned their first victory at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] since the company's overall win in {{24hLM|1959}} by overcoming the Corvette squad.  This feat was repeated once more in {{24hLM|2008}} in GT1, while the team also had involvement in the [[Lola B08/60]] LMP1 Coupe run under the Charouz Racing banner\n\nFor 2009 Aston Martin Racing entered two of their new prototypes along with Aston Martin Racing Eastern Europe which completed the works trio of [[Aston Martin DBR1-2|DBR1-2]] or [[Lola-Aston Martin B09/60]]. The teams greatest success with the new prototype came with the [[2009 Le Mans Series season|2009 Le Mans Series]] (LMS) where in the first round in Barcelona the team won the 1000&nbsp;km de Catalunya outright and with a string of podiums and a 1-2-3 sweep of the ADAC 1000&nbsp;km N\u00fcrburgring and a podium at the [[Autosport]] [[1000 km Silverstone|1000&nbsp;km of Silverstone]] sealed the 2009 drivers title for 007 and [[Jan Charouz]], [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Enge]], [[Stefan Mucke]] and the constructors title for Aston Martin-LOLA as well as the team title for Aston Martin Racing.\n\nSince 2012 Aston Martin Racing has been racing in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] with the [[Aston Martin Vantage GTE (disambiguation)|Aston Martin Vantage GTE]], earning them several wins and titles. During the inaugural season of the [[2012 FIA World Endurance Championship|FIA World Endurance Championship]] in 2012 Aston Martin Racing finished runner-up in the LMGTE Pro Trophy. In 2014 they won the FIA Endurance Trophy for LMGTE Am Teams and Drivers with Danish duo [[Kristian Poulsen]] and [[David Heinemeier Hansson]]. During the season they also won the [[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in the LMGTE Am category. In 2016 Aston Martin Racing managed to take the crown in the World Endurance Cup for GT Drivers with [[Nicki Thiim]] and [[Marco S\u00f8rensen]]. They also won the LMGTE Pro Teams\u2019 championship. The 2017 season saw them win both the Drivers\u2019 and Teams\u2019 Championship in the GTE Am category. In June 2017 Aston Martin Racing also won the [[2017 24 Hours of Le Mans]] in GTE Pro with [[Darren Turner]], [[Jonathan Adam]] and [[Daniel Serra]] driving the winning Aston Martin Vantage GTE.\n\n[[File:Aston Martin Vantage GTE 2016.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Aston Martin Vantage GTE running in the [[2016 24 Hours of Le Mans]]]]\n\n===24 Hours of Le Mans results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

[[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th\u201319th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commissioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.\n\n=== Brunner Mond ===\n[[File:Miller's Dale - Monsal Trail view of Lime Kilns - geograph.org.uk - 945731.jpg|thumb|Victorian lime kilns on the Midland line to Buxton]]\nIn 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone. Soda ash (or washing soda) was used for producing soaps, for dying textiles and for making glass.\n\nThe [[Brunner Mond]] company was formed in 1873 by [[Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet|John Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]]. In 1874 they started using the Solvay process to make soda ash at [[Winnington]] works in [[Northwich]], from the large local salt deposits and with limestone from Derbyshire. The soda ash was needed for the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry and for glass manufacture in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brunner,_Mond_and_Co|title=Brunner, Mond and Co \u2013 Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgthome.co.uk/SGTNews/2004/SGTN04_15-18.pdf|title=ALKALIS FOR THE ST HELENS GLASSMAKER THROUGH THE AGES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Society of Glass Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Buxton Lime Firms ===\n[[File:Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington 1964.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Limestone%20train%20from%20Tunstead%20to%20ICI%20Winnington%201964.jpg|thumb|'''Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington, 1964''']]\nThe arrival of the main railway lines from [[Manchester]] and [[London]] to Buxton in the 1860s prompted the opening of many further quarries: Victory in 1863, Ashwood Dale in 1864, Great Rocks in 1869, Peak Dale in 1877, Oldham Lime in 1878, East Buxton in 1880, Hindlow in 1882 and Buxton Central in 1885.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBuxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 competing quarry owners in 1891.

It produced 360,000 tons of limestone and 280,000 tons of lime per year. Larger, more advanced kilns were now in use and firebricks were introduced into kilns from 1907. By 1915 BLF had developed or acquired an additional 9 quarries including the opening of: Small Dale in 1891, Dowlow in 1898, Buxton South in 1900, Topley Pike in 1907, Brier Low in 1907, Cowdale in 1908.

Erosion of the younger sandstones exposed the limestone [[Stratum|strata]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leach|first=John|title=The Book of Buxton|publisher=Baracuda Books Limited|year=1987|isbn=0 86023 286 7|location=|pages=14-15, 83-91}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLimestone has been quarried as building stone in the Buxton area for centuries.\n\nLime (also known as [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]]) is produced easily by heating limestone and it has been used for thousands of years. [[Lime mortar]] (a mix of lime, sand and water) has been used since ancient times for fixing together the stone blocks of buildings. Lime became used as a soil improver in agriculture since the late [[Middle Ages]]. Before electric lights, lime was burnt to light theatrical shows, putting the stage performers 'in the limelight'. Traditional round 'pudding pie' [[Lime kiln|lime kilns]] were built around Buxton to burn limestone that was layered with wood, coal or coke. The lime powder was drawn from the bottom of the kiln, after it had burnt for 3 to 5 days and then cooled for a further 2 days. The process generated huge quantities of burnt waste material, taking 3 tonnes of limestone and 3 tonnes of coal to make 1 tonne of lime powder.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Grin Low ===\n[[File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Remains_of_a_lime_kiln_at_Grin_Low.jpg|thumb|Remains of a lime kiln at Grin Low]]\nGrin Low was the main location in Buxton for the early lime industry. It was an extensive area of limestone quarrying and was licensed for lime burning from 1662 by the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|1st Duke Of Devonshire]]. Demand for lime grew dramatically during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. There are widespread remains of over 100 large lime kilns, built of earth and rock, which date from the 17th\u201319th centuries. The land is also covered in spoil heaps of waste material. Coal came from local collieries at [[Axe Edge Moor|Axe Edge]] and Goyts Moss. In 1820 the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke of Devonshire]] commissioned the 'Grin Plantation' (now the wooded Buxton Country Park) to shield the scarred lime-burning landscape from visitors to the spa town of Buxton. In the 1850s lime production at Grin Low moved to a new large quarry on the south side of the hill (which was operated until its closure in 1952). In 1890 Grin Low produced 90,000 tonnes of lime.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDR371&resourceID=1023|title=Grin Low Lime Kilns, Buxton (HER No.2896)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.heritagegateway.org.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nGrin Low Wood is a designated [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://designatedsites.naturalengland.org.uk/PDFsForWeb/Citation/1001269.pdf|title=Poole\u2019s Cavern and Grin Low Wood|last=|first=|date=|website=Natural England|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLime burning had also taken place at [[Dove Holes]] since 1650. The opening of the [[Cromford and High Peak Railway]] in 1831 generated expansion of quarrying around Buxton, with 4 new quarries: [[Harpur Hill Quarry]] in 1835, Perseverance in 1847, and Holderness and Bold Venture in 1857 at Dove Holes.\n\n=== Brunner Mond ===\n[[File:Miller's Dale - Monsal Trail view of Lime Kilns - geograph.org.uk - 945731.jpg|thumb|Victorian lime kilns on the Midland line to Buxton]]\nIn 1861 Belgian chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] developed the [[Solvay process]] (also called the ammonia-soda process) for the production of [[Sodium carbonate|soda ash]] (sodium carbonate) from salt brine and limestone. Soda ash (or washing soda) was used for producing soaps, for dying textiles and for making glass.\n\nThe [[Brunner Mond]] company was formed in 1873 by [[Sir John Brunner, 1st Baronet|John Brunner]] and [[Ludwig Mond]]. In 1874 they started using the Solvay process to make soda ash at [[Winnington]] works in [[Northwich]], from the large local salt deposits and with limestone from Derbyshire. The soda ash was needed for the [[Lancashire]] cotton industry and for glass manufacture in [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Brunner,_Mond_and_Co|title=Brunner, Mond and Co \u2013 Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgthome.co.uk/SGTNews/2004/SGTN04_15-18.pdf|title=ALKALIS FOR THE ST HELENS GLASSMAKER THROUGH THE AGES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=Society of Glass Technology|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Buxton Lime Firms ===\n[[File:Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington 1964.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Limestone%20train%20from%20Tunstead%20to%20ICI%20Winnington%201964.jpg|thumb|'''Limestone train from Tunstead to ICI Winnington, 1964''']]\nThe arrival of the main railway lines from [[Manchester]] and [[London]] to Buxton in the 1860s prompted the opening of many further quarries: Victory in 1863, Ashwood Dale in 1864, Great Rocks in 1869, Peak Dale in 1877, Oldham Lime in 1878, East Buxton in 1880, Hindlow in 1882 and Buxton Central in 1885.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBuxton Lime Firms (BLF) was formed by 13 competing quarry owners in 1891. BLF controlled the price of stone and lime from its 17 initial quarries. BLF owned over 1500 acres of land with about 100 lime kilns and 3 collieries. It produced 360,000 tons of limestone and 280,000 tons of lime per year. Larger, more advanced kilns were now in use and firebricks were introduced into kilns from 1907. By 1915 BLF had developed or acquired an additional 9 quarries including the opening of: Small Dale in 1891, Dowlow in 1898, Buxton South in 1900, Topley Pike in 1907, Brier Low in 1907, Cowdale in 1908.
