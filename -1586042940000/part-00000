Sikorski's [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator II]] crashed off Gibraltar almost immediately after take off, with the plane's pilot being the only survivor. The catastrophe, while officially classified as an accident, has led to several [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] that persist to this day, and often propose that the crash was an assassination, which has variously been blamed on the Soviets, British, and even Nazis. The incident is still described by some historians as mysterious, and was investigated by the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]]. They concluded that the injuries sustained were consistent with a plane crash and that there was not enough evidence to support or reject the theory that the plane was deliberately sabotaged.\n\n==Death of Sikorski==\n{{main|1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash}}\n[[File:SikorskiPlane 1943.jpg|thumb|Sikorski's [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]], lying on its back in the sea just off [[Gibraltar]] following the crash]]\n[[File:General Sikorski's funeral in Gibraltar (cropped).jpg|thumb|Sikorski's body being carried onto a ship at the Gibraltar Naval Base after his funeral]]\nIn late May 1943, Sikorski  went to inspect [[Polish Army in the West|Polish forces]] stationed in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=\"psb475\"/> He was inspecting the forces and raising morale of the Polish troops there.

The mail bag was in the cargo compartment and was blown out of the aircraft through the side hatch (which in normally configured Liberators would have served to protect the machine gun position) by a strong airflow rushing through the nose gear door.<ref name=\"mysterious\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe crash of Sikorski's Liberator is portrayed in the 1958 film ''[[The Silent Enemy (1958 film)|The Silent Enemy]]'', in which the team of Royal Navy divers charged with retrieving Sikorski's briefcase from the wrecked aircraft is led by [[Lionel Crabb|Lionel \"Buster\" Crabb]], himself later to disappear in 1956 in mysterious circumstances while diving in the vicinity of a visiting [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] warship.<ref name=\"Sydney Knowles\"/>\n\nIn 1968, the play ''[[Soldiers (play)|Soldaten. Nekrolog auf Genf]]'' (''Soldiers, An obituary for Geneva'') by German writer [[Rolf Hochhuth]] debuted in London. The play partially drew on the work of [[David Irving]] and contained the sensational allegation that Winston Churchill had been in on the plot.<ref name=\"psb475\"/><ref name=\"Times\"/> In Hochhuth's play, Sikorski and other passengers were murdered by axe-wielding British commandos.<ref name=polityka/> Hochhuth, unaware that the plane's pilot [[Eduard Prchal]] was still alive, accused him of participating in the plot. Prchal won a libel case that seriously affected the London theatre which staged the play.<ref>[http://www.firstthings.com/article/2004/04/001-the-end-of-the-pius-wars \"''The End of the Pius Wars''\"], [[Joseph Bottum (author)|Joseph Bottum]], [[First Things]] Magazine, April 2004, retrieved 1 July 2009</ref> Hochhuth never paid the 50,000 British pounds imposed on him by the court and subsequently avoided returning to the UK.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.zeit.de/2016/29/rolf-hochhuth-stoerenfried-sachbuch-birgit-lahann|title=Rolf Hochhuth: Immobilien-Wessi|last=Naumann|first=Michael|date=2016-07-23|work=|newspaper=[[Die Zeit]]|language=German|author-link=Michael Naumann|access-date=2016-07-24|via=}}</ref> In 2011, he revealed his source for Churchill's involvement as Jane Ledig-Rowohlt, the British wife of his publisher [[Heinrich Maria Ledig-Rowohlt]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moz.de/artikel-ansicht/dg/0/1/293866|title=Hochhuth benennt Zeugen f\u00fcr Mord an Sikorski|last=|first=|date=2011-04-28|website=|publisher=M\u00e4rkische Oderzeitung / dpa|language=German|access-date=2016-07-24}}</ref> (n\u00e9e Jane Scatcherd).

Sikorski's [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator II]] crashed off Gibraltar almost immediately after take off, with the plane's pilot being the only survivor. The catastrophe, while officially classified as an accident, has led to several [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] that persist to this day, and often propose that the crash was an assassination, which has variously been blamed on the Soviets, British, and even Nazis. The incident is still described by some historians as mysterious, and was investigated by the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]]. They concluded that the injuries sustained were consistent with a plane crash and that there was not enough evidence to support or reject the theory that the plane was deliberately sabotaged.\n\n==Death of Sikorski==\n{{main|1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash}}\n[[File:SikorskiPlane 1943.jpg|thumb|Sikorski's [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Liberator]], lying on its back in the sea just off [[Gibraltar]] following the crash]]\n[[File:General Sikorski's funeral in Gibraltar (cropped).jpg|thumb|Sikorski's body being carried onto a ship at the Gibraltar Naval Base after his funeral]]\nIn late May 1943, Sikorski  went to inspect [[Polish Army in the West|Polish forces]] stationed in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=\"psb475\"/> He was inspecting the forces and raising morale of the Polish troops there.

The plaque notes that \"the cause of this mysterious accident has never been ascertained; a fact which has given rise to many speculations, doubts and rumours.\"]]A British Court of Inquiry convened on July 7 that year investigated the crash of Sikorski's [[B-24 Liberator|Liberator II]] serial ''AL 523'', but was unable to determine the cause, finding only that it was an accident and \"due to jamming of elevator controls\", noting that \"it has not been possible to determine how the jamming occurred but it has been established that there was no sabotage.\"<ref name=\"Peszke2005-102\"/> The Polish government refused to endorse the report, due to the contradiction about the cause not being determined but sabotage being ruled out, and pursued its own investigation, which suggested that the cause of the accident cannot be easily determined.<ref name=\"Peszke2005-103\"/> The political context of the event, coupled with a variety of circumstances, immediately gave rise to much speculation that Sikorski's death had been no accident, and may have been the direct result of a German, Soviet, British, or even Polish [[Cabal|conspiracy]].<ref name=\"psb475\"/><ref name=\"polityka\"/><ref name=\"Stanczyk\"/><ref name=\"Burnett2006\"/><ref name=\"AtkinBiddiss2011\"/><ref name=\"Davies2008\"/>\n\nSome of the earliest suggestions of a conspiracy were popularized by [[Nazi propaganda]], which suggested that Sikorski's death was the result of a British-Soviet conspiracy.<ref name=polityka/> Some modern sources still note that the accident is not fully explained; for example [[Jerzy Jan Lerski]] in his ''Historical Dictionary of Poland'' (1996), entry on the \"Gibraltar, Catastrophe of\", notes that \"there are several theories explaining the event, but the mystery was never fully solved.\"<ref name=\"Lerski1996\"/> As [[Roman Wapi\u0144ski]] noted in his biographical entry on Sikorski in the [[Polish Biographical Dictionary]] in 1997, no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing has been found, and Sikorski's death is officially classified as an accident.<ref name=\"psb475\"/> The unresolved questions surrounding his death have led to a number of publications, in historical and mainstream press, in Poland and abroad.<ref name=polityka/> Commenting on them in 2009, Polish historian [[Andrzej Garlicki]], building on a similar argument by historian [[Marian Kukiel]], stated that all conspiracy theories about Sikorski's deaths are irresponsible fiction.<ref name=polityka/>\n\nIn 2008, the Polish [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (IPN) began an official inquiry into the incident.<ref name=\"ipn\"/> Sikorski was exhumed and his remains were examined by Polish scientists, who in 2009 concluded that he died due to injuries consistent with an air crash, and that there was no evidence that Sikorski was murdered, ruling out theories that he was shot or strangled before the incident; however they did not rule out the possibility of [[sabotage]].<ref name=\"tvn\"/><ref name=\"gazeta\"/><ref name=\"Telegraph0\"/><ref name=\"Probe into Poland WWII PM death\"/> One of the IPN historians, [[Maciej Korku\u0107]], has stated that \"many facts suggest an assassination\", although another, [[Andrzej Chwalba]], notes that there is insufficient evidence to support this claim.

Sikorski was caused by a half-empty mail bag jammed between the horizontal stabilizer and the elevator, thus \"freezing\" the controls and preventing F/Lt Prchal from gaining altitude after takeoff. The mail bag was in the cargo compartment and was blown out of the aircraft through the side hatch (which in normally configured Liberators would have served to protect the machine gun position) by a strong airflow rushing through the nose gear door.<ref name=\"mysterious\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe crash of Sikorski's Liberator is portrayed in the 1958 film ''[[The Silent Enemy (1958 film)|The Silent Enemy]]'', in which the team of Royal Navy divers charged with retrieving Sikorski's briefcase from the wrecked aircraft is led by [[Lionel Crabb|Lionel \"Buster\" Crabb]], himself later to disappear in 1956 in mysterious circumstances while diving in the vicinity of a visiting [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] warship.<ref name=\"Sydney Knowles\"/>\n\nIn 1968, the play ''[[Soldiers (play)|Soldaten. Nekrolog auf Genf]]'' (''Soldiers, An obituary for Geneva'') by German writer [[Rolf Hochhuth]] debuted in London. The play partially drew on the work of [[David Irving]] and contained the sensational allegation that Winston Churchill had been in on the plot.<ref name=\"psb475\"/><ref name=\"Times\"/> In Hochhuth's play, Sikorski and other passengers were murdered by axe-wielding British commandos.<ref name=polityka/> Hochhuth, unaware that the plane's pilot [[Eduard Prchal]] was still alive, accused him of participating in the plot.

The protagonist is Julia Martin, Rhys's fictional counterpart. Julia's three romantic figures Rhys calls \"Mr\" (Mr Mackenzie, Mr Horsfield and Mr James).\n\nThe title is a reversal of premise: Mr Mackenzie has left Julia Martin rather than vice-versa. Themes include the lot of the outsider, the plight of the underdog, rich versus poor, female alienation, loneliness, destitution, death, grief, nostalgia for childhood and the quest for love.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mellown|first=Elgin W.|date=1972|title=Character and Themes in the Novels of Jean Rhys|journal=Contemporary Literature|volume=13|issue=4|pages=458\u2013475|doi=10.2307/1207442|jstor=1207442|issn=0010-7484}}</ref> The novel is in three parts''',''' each subdivided into numbered, titled chapters.\n\n== Plot ==\n'''Part One''' \n\nFrom her cheap hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, Julia Martin inhabits ''[[Rive Gauche]]'' Paris, lunching alone in a German restaurant in the [[rue de la Huchette]], drinking [[Pernod Ricard|Pernod]], wine and anything else. Locked in her room, she reads most of the time.\n\nThough attractive at thirty-six, she feels past her prime, fatigued and fatalistic. After a failed early marriage roaming Europe and the death of a baby, she had drifted to Paris during the ''[[Ann\u00e9es folles]]''. She has survived for six months on 300 [[French franc|francs]] a week from ex-lover Mr Mackenzie, posted each Tuesday by high-handed solicitor Henri Legros. One Tuesday Ma\u00eetre Legros writes informing Julia he is instructed to terminate the allowance, enclosing final payment of 1,500 francs. That evening she follows Mr Mackenzie down the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] to Restaurant Albert. She sits at his table, pours herself wine from his carafe and confronts him. She ends saying she doesn't want his severance cheque, slaps him lightly around the face [[Duel|with her glove]] and walks out.\n\nFrom a nearby table Englishman George Horsfield has watched the incident. When Julia exits, Mr Horsfield follows and befriends her, buys her a drink in another caf\u00e9 and takes her to a cinema. Afterwards, seeing her cry, the awkward Mr Horsfield invites her to his hotel to talk. He pours whiskey and she describes fragments of her life since leaving London the February after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|1918 armistice]] a decade or so earlier. When Mr Horsfield asks if she is stuck for money, she takes from her purse two ten franc notes and some coins, saying that is all she has. She recounts to him her rejection of Mr Mackenzie's severance cheque (which Mr Horsfield had witnessed in Restaurant Albert). Mr Horsfield gives her another 1,500 francs, suggests she visit London and jots down his address there.\n\n'''Part Two''' \n\nIn London Julia books into at a drab [[Bloomsbury]] hotel. The first morning she walks aimlessly, reminiscing. In [[Woburn Square]] a familiar old flower seller man ignores her when she buys his violets. On [[Tottenham Court Road]] she envisages a ghost of her younger self emerge from the fog. She crosses [[Tottenham Court Road|Oxford Street]] into [[Charing Cross Road]], gets lost in [[Soho]] and stops at a [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons tea shop]], overhearing patrons chatter while a band plays military music.\n\nReunions with her dour Uncle Griffiths and disapproving sister Norah are tense. At his [[Bayswater]] [[boarding house]] Uncle Griffiths says she should have secured a settlement from her ex-husband, prior to Mr Mackenzie. He gives her a pound note but wants little more contact. Living in [[Acton, London|Acton]], Norah has devoted her life to their sick mother, now dying, so is unsympathetic to Julia's plight. Their mother dies during Julia's London visit. Julia attends the funeral at [[Golders Green Crematorium]], causes a scene at the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] and is asked to leave.\n\nShe looks up W. Neil James Esq, her rich and generous first love from when she was nineteen. Ushered into his study, Julia sees Mr James is different. He says he has forty-five minutes. She hints at hardship, but to him this is an old story. He asks to change the subject, looks at the clock, shows her his art collection and sees her out. He posts her twenty pounds, stressing there can be no more. Some of it she spends on new clothes, some on second hand ones. She moves to a boarding house in cheaper [[Notting Hill]].\n\nMr Horsfield, also back in London, takes her for outings, meals and drinks, but withdraws his support as his interest in the troubled Julia wanes. Retreating to his [[Holland Park]] house, he promises to visit her in Paris in a week or ten days.\n\n'''Part Three''' \n\nJulia is back in her cheap Paris hotel on the Quay des Grands Augustins, overlooking the [[\u00cele de la Cit\u00e9]]. On the eleventh day she receives a letter from Mr Horsfield explaining he is unable to visit as soon as he had hoped. Enclosing ten pounds, he writes he cannot send more as times are hard. He closes by wishing her the best of luck.\n\nIn the late afternoon, from inside a caf\u00e9 on the [[rue Dauphine]], Mr Mackenzie notices Julia approach on the street. He shields his face so as not to be seen, but she sees him anyway, looks away and passes aimlessly with her head down. Having second thoughts, he leaves and catches up with her at a kerb where she waits to cross. He invites her for a drink, takes her to a caf\u00e9 and buys her a Pernod. She drinks it quickly and asks him to lend her 100 francs. Flustered, he pushes some cash across the table, which she puts in to her bag uncounted. She looks untidy, set to continue in the downward spiral of other Rhys heroines, but accepts Mr Mackenzie's offer of a second drink. He buys her another Pernod and leaves.\n\n== Background ==\nJean Rhys's material for this novel was drawn partly from her late 1927 visit to London for her mother's last days and funeral at Golders Green Crematorium. There, aged thirty-seven, she encountered estranged relatives including her aunt and sisters. This humiliating funeral scene is depicted in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''.<ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's disapproval extended back to Rhys's [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] chorus girl career, which she embarked on against parental wishes after exiting Cambridge's [[Perse School for Girls]] to enrol at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]], where she lasted just two terms.<ref>Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref> Showbusiness led to her [[Demimonde|demimondaine]] phase, financed by wealthy first lover Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, until he ended the affair. A backstreet abortion followed, with Smith subsidising her London boarding house life. She became a nude art model in the prelude to [[World War I]]. Her post-war Europe jaunts with first husband Jean Lenglet ended when he served prison time in France and was deported to Holland. Rhys's failure to keep their daughter Maryvonne,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Jean-Rhys/6000000056987680063|title=Jean Rhys|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> who spent much of her infancy in care, seemed another stain on her character. Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved into Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris. She stayed in the Hotel Henri IV behind the Quay des Grands Augustins, inhabiting the world of ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''<nowiki/>'s Julia Martin who lives in the same hotel. Julia read most of the time.

It is terrible, but it is superb.\"<ref>West, Rebecca, ''The Pursuit of Misery in Some New Novels'', Books of the Day, The Daily Telegraph, 30 January 1931, 7</ref>\n\n[[Gerald Gould]] in ''[[The Observer]]'' called the novel: \"A hard, clean, dry, desperate book, so rigid in its economy that its impressiveness seems almost contemptuous.\" Deeming it not a \"pleasant\" novel, Gould wrote \"it has more important merits.\" He concluded: \"Of its kind, and within its limits, this book is a flawless work of art.\"<ref>Gould, Gerald, ''All Sorts of Societies'', New Novels, The Observer 7289, 8 February 1931</ref><ref>{{Cite thesis|title=The mirror image: The representation of social roles for women in novels by Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Kate Chopin, Edith Wharton and Jean Rhys|url=https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/nl/publications/the-mirror-image(843bf106-13d1-4fb0-b3e0-146f6b1fd32d).html|publisher=University of Groningen|date=2011|language=English|first=G.

It is no defect in the work\". Impressed by the economy of Rhys's style, he added: \"Julia\u2019s existence and the existence of those with whom she came in contact are somehow made meaningful by these very meaningless odds and ends of observation.\"<ref>Stone, Geoffrey, ''Bookman'', 74, New York, September 1931, 84</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* [[Carole Angier|Angier, Carole]], ''Jean Rhys: Life and Work'', London, Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, 1990\n* Pizzichini, Lilian, ''The Blue Hour: A Life of Jean Rhys'', New York, W.

Her extramarital affair in Paris with [[Ford Madox Ford]] compounded this. The Ford affair's aftermath is what ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' explores, with Julia Martin lightly slapping her ex-lover's face with an empty glove in a Paris bar, as Rhys had to Ford.<ref name=pizz2020 /><ref name=ang09 />\n\nHer family's indifference to the publication of ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]'', and to her grief at the death of first baby William Owen Lenglet, felt unjust to Rhys, who hints at bourgeois prejudice and hypocrisy in this and most of her novels.\n\nOn the same late 1927 London visit, she met for the last time with Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, who for the last time lent her money (as with old flame Mr James in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''). Smith, like others, was tired of her suffering.\n\nBesides visiting London for these purposes, getting ''Quartet'' published necessitated her presence there. A literary agent, divorcee Leslie Tilden Smith, had offered help. In May 1928 she moved into Tilden Smith's Holland Park house (located as per Mr Horsfield's in ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'') and began a relationship with him, formalising her separation from Lenglet on 19 June. Tilden Smith would become Rhys's second husband in 1934, the year after her divorce from Lenglet. By the time of ''Quartet''<nowiki/>'s release in September 1928, Rhys was writing ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie'' with Tilden Smith's full-time support. She wrote in bed while he did the housework and proofread her pages.\n\nIn 1928 she persuaded Tilden Smith to finance a writing trip for her, alone in ''Rive Gauche'' Paris. She stayed in the Hotel Henri IV behind the Quay des Grands Augustins, inhabiting the world of ''After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie''<nowiki/>'s Julia Martin who lives in the same hotel. Julia read most of the time.

Founded in 1891, it is one of the original 19 land-grant colleges and universities established by the second [[Morrill Act]] of 1890, which evolved as a diverse and inclusive campus. Following desegregation, WVSU's student population slowly became more white than black. As of 2017, WSVU is 75% white and only 8% African-American.<ref>{{Cite web | title = College Navigator - West Virginia State University|url=https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=West+Virginia+state&s=all&id=237899#enrolmt| accessdate = February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe university's Gus R. Douglass Land-Grant Institute is divided into three programmatic divisions: WVSU Extension Service, WVSU Agricultural and Environmental Research Station, and The Center for the Advancement of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (CASTEM). The WVSU Extension Service (1890 Extension) provides community and agricultural outreach throughout West Virginia via 4-H Youth Development, Agriculture and Natural Resources, Community and Economic Development, and [[Family and consumer sciences|Family and Consumer Sciences]] programs. The WVSU Agricultural and Environmental Research Station (1890 Research) focuses on [[Aquaculture]], [[Environmental microbiology|Environmental Microbiology]] & [[Biotechnology]], [[Horticulture|Horticultural Crops & Production Systems]], [[Urban forestry|Urban Forestry]] & [[Natural resource management|Natural Resource Management]], and [[Plant breeding|Vegetable Genomics & Plant Breeding]] research programs. CASTEM programs encourage the state's youth to pursue careers in [[Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network]] (STEM) fields to become engineers, scientists, researchers, teachers, and leaders.\n\n==History==\nWVSU is located on land once occupied by Mound Builder Native Americans. The British government granted the site to George Washington for his service in the British military during the [[French and Indian War]]. It was subsequently sold and operated as plantation using enslaved labor. During the early 19th century, the son of Virginia Governor [[William H. Cabell]], [[Samuel I. Cabell]], moved to the [[Kanawha River]] valley and married, Mary Barnes, (a former slave), who bore thirteen children. He bought the property in 1853 and much to the displeasure of white neighbors, took elaborate precautions to ensure that Mary, his wife, and his descendants would inherit his wealth and not be sold into slavery, including officially emancipating Mary and their then-alive children in 1858.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh32-2a.html|title=The Murder of Samuel I. Cabell|website=www.wvculture.org}}</ref> Sam Cabell was murdered shortly after the [[American Civil War]] and the creation of the state of West Virginia. Two decades later, his daughter Maria Cabell-Hurt sold some land to the new state to permit creation of the ''West Virginia Colored Institute'', since Sam's descendants and neighbors had to send their children across the [[Ohio River]] to Ohio for higher education. Sam and Mary Cabell and their children are buried on the campus; some descendants continue to live nearby.\n\n===Early history===\nThe school was established as the '''West Virginia Colored Institute''' in 1891 under the second [[Morrill Act]], which provided for [[land-grant university|land-grant institutions]] for [[African American|black]] students in the 17 states that had segregated schools. The school opened its doors in May 1892 and had an enrollment of over 40 students. The faculty consisted of President [[James Edwin Campbell (poet)|James Edwin Campbell]], [[Byrd Prillerman]], and T.C. Friend. The curriculum consisted of courses in agriculture, horticulture, mechanical arts, and domestic science. Teacher education (\"normal\") courses were added in 1893. Military education became an integral part of the school, and in 1899 West Virginia's legislature passed a bill to admit up to 60 cadets. In 1909, African-American educator and statesman, [[Booker T. Washington]] recommended his friend, Byrd Prillerman, become the institution's president.<ref name=\"History\">{{citation|title=Vision 2020: State's Roadmap to the Future|publisher=West Virginia State University}}</ref> Washington had been instrumental in locating the institution located in the Kanawha Valley, visited the campus often and spoke at its first commencement exercise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvstateu.edu/news/default.aspx?news=233|title=Booker T.

In 1915, it became the '''West Virginia Collegiate Institute''' and began to offer college degrees. In 1919, [[John W. Davis]] became president of the institute. A [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]] graduate, Davis recruited highly qualified faculty and focused on curriculum development. He persuaded noted historian [[Carter G. Woodson]] to assist him as academic dean. In 1927, the school was accredited by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]], making it the first of 17 original black land-grand schools to be certified by a regional association and one of only four black colleges to gain such status. It also became the first public college in West Virginia to be accredited by North Central. In 1929, the name was changed to '''West Virginia State College'''. With an enrollment of 1,000 students, the college contained divisions of Applied Arts and Sciences; Languages, Literature and Fine Arts; Natural Sciences and Mathematics; and Social Sciences and Philosophy.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn 1939, West Virginia State College became the first of six historically black colleges to be authorized by the [[Civil Aeronautics Authority]] to establish an aviation program. Benefiting from the presence of the Wertz Field airport adjacent to campus, the program prepared many African American pilots to the U.S. Army Air Corps in [[World War II]]. Several college aviators joined the famed [[99th Fighter Squadron]] and [[332nd Fighter Group]] (the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]) that served with distinction in the [[European Theater]].<ref name=\"History\"/> One of the original graduates of the aviation program, [[Rose Agnes Rolls Cousins]], was the first African American woman to become a solo pilot in the Civilian Pilot Training Program. During World War II, West Virginia State College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"wv-v-12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh53-7.html |title=On the Homefront in World War II: Soldier-Scholars at West Virginia State College, Volume 53 |publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History, pp. 119-132 |last=Louis E. |first=Keefer |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |year=1994}}</ref> In 1942, a college [[ROTC]] program was established as an artillery unit. The ROTC tradition continues today, and the school has claimed 15 general officers who have graduated from West Virginia State, including Major General [[Charles C. Rogers]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Desegregation===\nWest Virginia State College underwent a significant transformation under the guidance of president [[William J.L. Wallace]]. In 1954, following the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' to desegregate public education, and the initiation of the G.I. Bill, the college transformed from diversifying its college with an influx of predominantly Caucasian commuter students because of the excellent educational reputation and affordability. This unique case of diversity garnered national attention. President Wallace hailed it as \"a tribute to the character and courage of the people of Kanawha Valley.\" As a result, West Virginia State adopted the motto \"A Living Laboratory of Human Relations.\" Enrollment substantially increased after the removal of racial barriers and veterans seeking educational advancement.\n\nIn 1957, the school forfeited its land grant status. The West Virginia Board of Education voted to end state funding needed to match federal land-grant aid to West Virginia State. Although land-grant university funding is governed by federal laws, the federal aid is conditioned upon matching state funds. Under the leadership of President [[Hazo W. Carter]], Jr., a 12-year quest was begun to restore the land-grant designation. The first step toward regaining the status came when Gov. [[Gaston Caperton]] signed a bill on Feb. 12, 1991, that had been passed by the Legislature to recognize the land-grant status on the state level. With the advocacy of Alumni, university leadership and assistance from West Virginia's U.S. Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]], the U.S. Congress fully restored land-grant status in 2001. West Virginia State's birthright was restored and is recognized as an 1890 land-grant institution with recognition at the Federal level along with funding to carry out the mission of teaching, research, and public service. The land-grant institution of WVSU is named the Gus R. Douglass Land-Grant Institution.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===University status===\nIn 2003, the school's [[community college]], established in 1953, was separately accredited as the West Virginia State Community and Technical College but remained administratively linked to West Virginia State College. In 2008, the legislature fully separated the community and technical college. However, both schools continued to share the same campus. In 2009, the Community and Technical College went through a name change and it was announced on April 20, 2009, as Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College. In the fall of 2012, KVCTC moved its campus to [[South Charleston, West Virginia]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn 2004, under President Carter's leadership, West Virginia State College gained University status, becoming '''West Virginia State University''' and began to offer graduate degrees in Biotechnology and Media Studies. In the fall of 2011, WVSU began to offer a graduate degree in Law Enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201103160781|title=WVSU to offer new law enforcement master's degree|date=2011-03-16|last=White|first=Davin|publisher=[[Charleston Gazette]]|accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> In the spring of 2014, WVSU began offering a graduate degree in education.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.wvstateu.edu/announcement/2013/09/17/WVSU-to-Offer-New-Master-of-Education-Degree-Begin.aspx|title=WVSU to Offer New Master of Education Degree Beginning Spring 2014|date=September 17, 2013|publisher=West Virginia State University|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>  Under President Brian O.

McNeill (1973\u201381), Thomas W. Cole, Jr. (1982\u201386), Hazo W. Carter, Jr. (1986\u20132012), and Brian O'Harold Hemphill (2012\u201316). Several buildings on campus are named after them: Campbell Conference Center, Hill Hall, Jones Hall, Prillerman Hall, Davis Fine Arts Building, Wallace Hall, McNeill Facilities Building, and Cole Complex.<ref name=\"past presidents\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wvstateu.edu/Administration/Office-of-the-President/History-and-Past-Presidents.aspx|title=History and Past Presidents |publisher=West Virginia State University|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nJames Edwin Campbell was a poet, free-lance writer, and mathematician from [[Pomeroy, Ohio]]. Following Campbell was John H. Hill, who was a lawyer, teacher, administrator, and soldier, who oversaw the university's first commencement. He resigned to fight in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and later returned as an instructor. James McHenry Jones was responsible for adding teacher education (a \"normal\" department), and is buried on campus. Before becoming the fourth president, Byrd Prillerman was a faculty member and one of those responsible for locating the school in the Kanawha Valley. During his tenure, academic programs were expanded and the institution was renamed the \"West Virginia Collegiate Institute\". John Warren Davis focused on recruiting the best black faculty members he could find and developing the curriculum. He persuaded noted historian [[Carter G. Woodson]] to assist him as Academic Dean. During his tenure, the school was first accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1927, and became West Virginia State College in 1929. Davis is the longest-serving president, having served for thirty-four years.<ref name=\"past presidents\"/>\n\nWilliam James Lord Wallace's greatest challenge of his presidency came following the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 ruling, ''Brown v. Board of Education'', which declared segregated schools to be unconstitutional. Following that, the historically black West Virginia State College opened its doors to all students. Dr. Wallace not only met the challenge but set an example for the world to follow. During Harold M. McNeill's tenure, the community college component was established; a building was erected for community college programs, and Ferrell Hall and the Drain-Jordan Library were renovated. During Thomas Winston Cole, Jr.'s administration, he made several organizational changes in the institution, creating new academic divisions and establishing a planning and advancement unit. Cole left West Virginia State in 1986 to become Chancellor of the West Virginia Board of Regents.<ref name=\"past presidents\"/>\n\nShortly after he became the ninth president in September 1987, Dr. Hazo W. Carter, Jr. began a 12-year quest to regain the college's land-grant status that had been transferred in the 1950s. Since \"State\" was the only institution to have the status removed, there was no precedent for recovering it. After this status was restored, a quest then began for West Virginia State to be designated a university, which became a reality in 2004; he became the first president to serve under the \"university\" status. These achievements, accompanied by two highly successful accreditation's by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and the addition of graduate programs, highlight his administration.<ref name=\"past presidents\"/> In August 2011, the faculty voted no confidence in Carter's leadership, and Carter retired on June 30, 2012. He then became [[President Emeritus|president emeritus]] until his death in February 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/WVSU_President_Confident_that_No_Confidence_Vote_Wont_Impact_his_Job_127791363.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325101615/http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/WVSU_President_Confident_that_No_Confidence_Vote_Wont_Impact_his_Job_127791363.html |archive-date=March 25, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Other===\n[[East Hall (Institute, West Virginia)|East Hall]] and the [[Canty House]], home of \"Colonel\" James Munroe Canty, were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\nWVSU's [[Autumn|Fall]] and [[Spring (season)|Spring]] [[Graduation|Commencement Ceremonies]] were held in December and May, respectively, at the [[Charleston Civic Center]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]]. Until 2009, WVSU and WVSCTC had joint commencement ceremonies. To cut back on spending, WVSU now holds its commencement ceremonies on campus. Until the completion of the new convocation center, the December commencement was held in the P.A. Williams Auditorium of Ferrell Hall, while the May commencement was either on the large lawn in the center of campus (also called the quad), or in the P.A. Williams Auditorium, pending weather. Commencements are now held in the D. Stephen and Diane H. Walker Convocation Center (Walker Convocation Center for short), a new addition/renovation to Fleming Hall. The Spring 2014 commencement was the first commencement held in the Walker Convocation Center.\n\n==Student activities==\n===Athletics===\n{{main|West Virginia State Yellow Jackets}}\n\nThe athletic teams are known as the '''Yellow Jackets'''. WVSU athletic teams include men's football, baseball, basketball, golf, and tennis, and women's basketball, golf, softball, tennis, volleyball and soccer. During the segregation era, the school competed in athletics as \"West Virginia\" and played other segregated schools as a member of the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association. After desegregation, the school withdrew from the CIAA (today's [[Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]) and competed as \"West Virginia State\" to avoid confusion with [[West Virginia University]]. The school then moved to the formerly all-white [[West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (WVIAC), which competed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]]. After the dissolution of the WVIAC, WVSU joined the new [[Mountain East Conference]] in 2013, which is also part of NCAA Division II.\n\nDuring the segregation era, black high schools were barred from competition in the [[West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission]], and State therefore sponsored an unofficial \"state colored championship\" from 1932 to 1959.\n\n===Music===\n\n====Instrumental ensembles====\nIn the mid-late 1990s, the band saw a period of resurgence under the direction of Chris Card. From 1995 until 2000, the band had an enrollment of between 35-50 members. Many of the members during this time period were scholarship recipients, and the band often contained 5-10 veterans or active members of Drum Corps International. The band was known for its small size and huge sound. The band marches in a \"corps-style\" fashion, the only band of its type at an HBCU, as most have a \"show-style\" band. The band tries to do a different marching show at every home football game, with the exception of homecoming.\n\nThe Yellow Jacket Marching Band, also known as the \"Marching Swarm\", performs in one parade unless invited to others: the WVSU Homecoming Parade. In 2018, the band performed in [[Welch, West Virginia|Welch, WV]]'s 100th Veteran's Day Parade, the longest ongoing Veteran's Day parade in the nation. The band has also played for the president's \"State of the University Address\", the Founder's Day ceremony, and annually for WVSU's [[ROTC]] Hall of Fame Ceremony. They have served as the exhibition band at high school marching band festivals, including [[Nicholas County, West Virginia|Nicholas County's]] Mountain Band Spectacular (2008\u20132010), [[Poca High School]]'s Heritage Day Festival in [[Poca, West Virginia|Poca]] (2009\u20132016, 2018\u2013present), the 2013 WV Marching Band Invitational in Charleston, the 2015 [[Sissonville High School]] Cavalcade of Bands Band Festival in Sissonville, and the [[Boone County, West Virginia|Boone County]] Coal Classic, hosted by [[Scott High School (West Virginia)|Scott High School]] in [[Madison, West Virginia|Madison]] (2018\u2013present). On October 12, 2013, WVSU, in co-sponsorship with the [[St. Albans High School]] Music Department, hosted the Cavalcade of Bands Southwest Regional Band Festival, and hosted it again in 2014. In 2008, the band was invited to go to Chicago with the football team for the Chicago Football Classic to participate in the Battle of the Bands competition; the only competition the band has competed in.\n\nThe Wind Ensemble has performed at WVSU's commencement ceremonies. Students of the Advanced Conducting studio may also conduct on a concert. The Advanced Conducting studio is a unique feature of WVSU as not many colleges offer it at the undergraduate level. In the spring of 2015, the Symphonic Wind Ensemble performed at [[Hamilton Crowne Plaza|The Hamilton]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] as part of D.C.'s 153rd [[Emancipation Day#Washington, D.C.|Emancipation Day]] Celebrations, and for the 150th Anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Assassination. Beginning with the fall of 2015, WVSU offers a chamber orchestra, named the Charleston Chamber Orchestra, under the baton of Dr. Scott Woodard. On their debut concert, the ensemble performed a world premiere of a piece by local composer Matthew Jackfert.

In addition, WVSU is home to the Montclaire String Quartet, the Quartet in Residence at WVSU, composed of the principle string players of the [[West Virginia Symphony Orchestra]].\n\n====Vocal ensembles====\nIn addition to the instrumental ensembles, WVSU also features the WVSU Concert Choir, the \"State\" Singers, a female vocal ensemble, and a male vocal ensemble. The State Singers consists of eight to ten vocalists with a required audition. The State Singers also perform as the WVSU Vocal Jazz Choir. The State Singers act as ambassadors for the University and frequently perform off campus for important community and cultural events. Every spring, the State Singers go on tour. Recent tours have taken the group to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Virginia Beach]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]], and [[New York City]]. On April 13 and 14, 2012, the Concert Choir had the unique opportunity of singing the music of \"[[Queen (band)|Queen]]\" with the [[West Virginia Symphony Orchestra]]. The Concert Choir again sang with the WVSO for the symphony's 2012 holiday concerts, and have continued since. In March 2016, the Concert Choir again joined the symphony, along with three other West Virginia collegiate choirs, to perform the [[Brahms Requiem]]. Dr. Dirk Johnson is the Director of Choral Activities for WVSU and has been at that position since the fall of 2009.\n\n===Student life===\nMany of the students who live in dorms on campus are from large urban areas outside of West Virginia or from the rural counties in the state.

Founded in 1891, it is one of the original 19 land-grant colleges and universities established by the second [[Morrill Act]] of 1890, which evolved as a diverse and inclusive campus. Following desegregation, WVSU's student population slowly became more white than black. As of 2017, WSVU is 75% white and only 8% African-American.<ref>{{Cite web | title = College Navigator - West Virginia State University|url=https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=West+Virginia+state&s=all&id=237899#enrolmt| accessdate = February 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe university's Gus R. Douglass Land-Grant Institute is divided into three programmatic divisions: WVSU Extension Service, WVSU Agricultural and Environmental Research Station, and The Center for the Advancement of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (CASTEM). The WVSU Extension Service (1890 Extension) provides community and agricultural outreach throughout West Virginia via 4-H Youth Development, Agriculture and Natural Resources, Community and Economic Development, and [[Family and consumer sciences|Family and Consumer Sciences]] programs. The WVSU Agricultural and Environmental Research Station (1890 Research) focuses on [[Aquaculture]], [[Environmental microbiology|Environmental Microbiology]] & [[Biotechnology]], [[Horticulture|Horticultural Crops & Production Systems]], [[Urban forestry|Urban Forestry]] & [[Natural resource management|Natural Resource Management]], and [[Plant breeding|Vegetable Genomics & Plant Breeding]] research programs. CASTEM programs encourage the state's youth to pursue careers in [[Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network]] (STEM) fields to become engineers, scientists, researchers, teachers, and leaders.\n\n==History==\nWVSU is located on land once occupied by Mound Builder Native Americans. The British government granted the site to George Washington for his service in the British military during the [[French and Indian War]]. It was subsequently sold and operated as plantation using enslaved labor. During the early 19th century, the son of Virginia Governor [[William H. Cabell]], [[Samuel I. Cabell]], moved to the [[Kanawha River]] valley and married, Mary Barnes, (a former slave), who bore thirteen children. He bought the property in 1853 and much to the displeasure of white neighbors, took elaborate precautions to ensure that Mary, his wife, and his descendants would inherit his wealth and not be sold into slavery, including officially emancipating Mary and their then-alive children in 1858.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh32-2a.html|title=The Murder of Samuel I. Cabell|website=www.wvculture.org}}</ref> Sam Cabell was murdered shortly after the [[American Civil War]] and the creation of the state of West Virginia. Two decades later, his daughter Maria Cabell-Hurt sold some land to the new state to permit creation of the ''West Virginia Colored Institute'', since Sam's descendants and neighbors had to send their children across the [[Ohio River]] to Ohio for higher education. Sam and Mary Cabell and their children are buried on the campus; some descendants continue to live nearby.\n\n===Early history===\nThe school was established as the '''West Virginia Colored Institute''' in 1891 under the second [[Morrill Act]], which provided for [[land-grant university|land-grant institutions]] for [[African American|black]] students in the 17 states that had segregated schools. The school opened its doors in May 1892 and had an enrollment of over 40 students. The faculty consisted of President [[James Edwin Campbell (poet)|James Edwin Campbell]], [[Byrd Prillerman]], and T.C. Friend. The curriculum consisted of courses in agriculture, horticulture, mechanical arts, and domestic science. Teacher education (\"normal\") courses were added in 1893. Military education became an integral part of the school, and in 1899 West Virginia's legislature passed a bill to admit up to 60 cadets. In 1909, African-American educator and statesman, [[Booker T. Washington]] recommended his friend, Byrd Prillerman, become the institution's president.<ref name=\"History\">{{citation|title=Vision 2020: State's Roadmap to the Future|publisher=West Virginia State University}}</ref> Washington had been instrumental in locating the institution located in the Kanawha Valley, visited the campus often and spoke at its first commencement exercise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvstateu.edu/news/default.aspx?news=233|title=Booker T.

In 1915, it became the '''West Virginia Collegiate Institute''' and began to offer college degrees. In 1919, [[John W. Davis]] became president of the institute. A [[Morehouse College|Morehouse]] graduate, Davis recruited highly qualified faculty and focused on curriculum development. He persuaded noted historian [[Carter G. Woodson]] to assist him as academic dean. In 1927, the school was accredited by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]], making it the first of 17 original black land-grand schools to be certified by a regional association and one of only four black colleges to gain such status. It also became the first public college in West Virginia to be accredited by North Central. In 1929, the name was changed to '''West Virginia State College'''. With an enrollment of 1,000 students, the college contained divisions of Applied Arts and Sciences; Languages, Literature and Fine Arts; Natural Sciences and Mathematics; and Social Sciences and Philosophy.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn 1939, West Virginia State College became the first of six historically black colleges to be authorized by the [[Civil Aeronautics Authority]] to establish an aviation program. Benefiting from the presence of the Wertz Field airport adjacent to campus, the program prepared many African American pilots to the U.S. Army Air Corps in [[World War II]]. Several college aviators joined the famed [[99th Fighter Squadron]] and [[332nd Fighter Group]] (the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]) that served with distinction in the [[European Theater]].<ref name=\"History\"/> One of the original graduates of the aviation program, [[Rose Agnes Rolls Cousins]], was the first African American woman to become a solo pilot in the Civilian Pilot Training Program. During World War II, West Virginia State College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"wv-v-12\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh53-7.html |title=On the Homefront in World War II: Soldier-Scholars at West Virginia State College, Volume 53 |publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History, pp. 119-132 |last=Louis E. |first=Keefer |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |year=1994}}</ref> In 1942, a college [[ROTC]] program was established as an artillery unit. The ROTC tradition continues today, and the school has claimed 15 general officers who have graduated from West Virginia State, including Major General [[Charles C. Rogers]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===Desegregation===\nWest Virginia State College underwent a significant transformation under the guidance of president [[William J.L. Wallace]]. In 1954, following the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' to desegregate public education, and the initiation of the G.I. Bill, the college transformed from diversifying its college with an influx of predominantly Caucasian commuter students because of the excellent educational reputation and affordability. This unique case of diversity garnered national attention. President Wallace hailed it as \"a tribute to the character and courage of the people of Kanawha Valley.\" As a result, West Virginia State adopted the motto \"A Living Laboratory of Human Relations.\" Enrollment substantially increased after the removal of racial barriers and veterans seeking educational advancement.\n\nIn 1957, the school forfeited its land grant status. The West Virginia Board of Education voted to end state funding needed to match federal land-grant aid to West Virginia State. Although land-grant university funding is governed by federal laws, the federal aid is conditioned upon matching state funds. Under the leadership of President [[Hazo W. Carter]], Jr., a 12-year quest was begun to restore the land-grant designation. The first step toward regaining the status came when Gov. [[Gaston Caperton]] signed a bill on Feb. 12, 1991, that had been passed by the Legislature to recognize the land-grant status on the state level. With the advocacy of Alumni, university leadership and assistance from West Virginia's U.S. Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]], the U.S. Congress fully restored land-grant status in 2001. West Virginia State's birthright was restored and is recognized as an 1890 land-grant institution with recognition at the Federal level along with funding to carry out the mission of teaching, research, and public service. The land-grant institution of WVSU is named the Gus R. Douglass Land-Grant Institution.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n===University status===\nIn 2003, the school's [[community college]], established in 1953, was separately accredited as the West Virginia State Community and Technical College but remained administratively linked to West Virginia State College. In 2008, the legislature fully separated the community and technical college. However, both schools continued to share the same campus. In 2009, the Community and Technical College went through a name change and it was announced on April 20, 2009, as Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College. In the fall of 2012, KVCTC moved its campus to [[South Charleston, West Virginia]].<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn 2004, under President Carter's leadership, West Virginia State College gained University status, becoming '''West Virginia State University''' and began to offer graduate degrees in Biotechnology and Media Studies. In the fall of 2011, WVSU began to offer a graduate degree in Law Enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201103160781|title=WVSU to offer new law enforcement master's degree|date=2011-03-16|last=White|first=Davin|publisher=[[Charleston Gazette]]|accessdate=2012-07-01}}</ref> In the spring of 2014, WVSU began offering a graduate degree in education.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.wvstateu.edu/announcement/2013/09/17/WVSU-to-Offer-New-Master-of-Education-Degree-Begin.aspx|title=WVSU to Offer New Master of Education Degree Beginning Spring 2014|date=September 17, 2013|publisher=West Virginia State University|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>  Under President Brian O.

Hill (1894\u201398), James McHenry Jones (1898\u20131909), Byrd Prillerman (1909\u201319), John W. Davis (1919\u201353), William J.L. Wallace (1953\u201373), Harold M. McNeill (1973\u201381), Thomas W. Cole, Jr. (1982\u201386), Hazo W. Carter, Jr. (1986\u20132012), and Brian O'Harold Hemphill (2012\u201316). Several buildings on campus are named after them: Campbell Conference Center, Hill Hall, Jones Hall, Prillerman Hall, Davis Fine Arts Building, Wallace Hall, McNeill Facilities Building, and Cole Complex.<ref name=\"past presidents\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wvstateu.edu/Administration/Office-of-the-President/History-and-Past-Presidents.aspx|title=History and Past Presidents |publisher=West Virginia State University|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nJames Edwin Campbell was a poet, free-lance writer, and mathematician from [[Pomeroy, Ohio]]. Following Campbell was John H. Hill, who was a lawyer, teacher, administrator, and soldier, who oversaw the university's first commencement. He resigned to fight in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and later returned as an instructor. James McHenry Jones was responsible for adding teacher education (a \"normal\" department), and is buried on campus. Before becoming the fourth president, Byrd Prillerman was a faculty member and one of those responsible for locating the school in the Kanawha Valley. During his tenure, academic programs were expanded and the institution was renamed the \"West Virginia Collegiate Institute\". John Warren Davis focused on recruiting the best black faculty members he could find and developing the curriculum. He persuaded noted historian [[Carter G. Woodson]] to assist him as Academic Dean. During his tenure, the school was first accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1927, and became West Virginia State College in 1929. Davis is the longest-serving president, having served for thirty-four years.<ref name=\"past presidents\"/>\n\nWilliam James Lord Wallace's greatest challenge of his presidency came following the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 ruling, ''Brown v. Board of Education'', which declared segregated schools to be unconstitutional. Following that, the historically black West Virginia State College opened its doors to all students. Dr. Wallace not only met the challenge but set an example for the world to follow. During Harold M. McNeill's tenure, the community college component was established; a building was erected for community college programs, and Ferrell Hall and the Drain-Jordan Library were renovated. During Thomas Winston Cole, Jr.'s administration, he made several organizational changes in the institution, creating new academic divisions and establishing a planning and advancement unit. Cole left West Virginia State in 1986 to become Chancellor of the West Virginia Board of Regents.<ref name=\"past presidents\"/>\n\nShortly after he became the ninth president in September 1987, Dr. Hazo W. Carter, Jr. began a 12-year quest to regain the college's land-grant status that had been transferred in the 1950s. Since \"State\" was the only institution to have the status removed, there was no precedent for recovering it. After this status was restored, a quest then began for West Virginia State to be designated a university, which became a reality in 2004; he became the first president to serve under the \"university\" status. These achievements, accompanied by two highly successful accreditation's by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and the addition of graduate programs, highlight his administration.<ref name=\"past presidents\"/> In August 2011, the faculty voted no confidence in Carter's leadership, and Carter retired on June 30, 2012. He then became [[President Emeritus|president emeritus]] until his death in February 2014.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/WVSU_President_Confident_that_No_Confidence_Vote_Wont_Impact_his_Job_127791363.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 21, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325101615/http://www.wsaz.com/news/headlines/WVSU_President_Confident_that_No_Confidence_Vote_Wont_Impact_his_Job_127791363.html |archive-date=March 25, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Other===\n[[East Hall (Institute, West Virginia)|East Hall]] and the [[Canty House]], home of \"Colonel\" James Munroe Canty, were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\nWVSU's [[Autumn|Fall]] and [[Spring (season)|Spring]] [[Graduation|Commencement Ceremonies]] were held in December and May, respectively, at the [[Charleston Civic Center]] in [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]]. Until 2009, WVSU and WVSCTC had joint commencement ceremonies. To cut back on spending, WVSU now holds its commencement ceremonies on campus. Until the completion of the new convocation center, the December commencement was held in the P.A. Williams Auditorium of Ferrell Hall, while the May commencement was either on the large lawn in the center of campus (also called the quad), or in the P.A. Williams Auditorium, pending weather. Commencements are now held in the D. Stephen and Diane H. Walker Convocation Center (Walker Convocation Center for short), a new addition/renovation to Fleming Hall. The Spring 2014 commencement was the first commencement held in the Walker Convocation Center.\n\n==Student activities==\n===Athletics===\n{{main|West Virginia State Yellow Jackets}}\n\nThe athletic teams are known as the '''Yellow Jackets'''. WVSU athletic teams include men's football, baseball, basketball, golf, and tennis, and women's basketball, golf, softball, tennis, volleyball and soccer. During the segregation era, the school competed in athletics as \"West Virginia\" and played other segregated schools as a member of the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association. After desegregation, the school withdrew from the CIAA (today's [[Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]) and competed as \"West Virginia State\" to avoid confusion with [[West Virginia University]]. The school then moved to the formerly all-white [[West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (WVIAC), which competed in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]]. After the dissolution of the WVIAC, WVSU joined the new [[Mountain East Conference]] in 2013, which is also part of NCAA Division II.\n\nDuring the segregation era, black high schools were barred from competition in the [[West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission]], and State therefore sponsored an unofficial \"state colored championship\" from 1932 to 1959.\n\n===Music===\n\n====Instrumental ensembles====\nIn the mid-late 1990s, the band saw a period of resurgence under the direction of Chris Card. From 1995 until 2000, the band had an enrollment of between 35-50 members. Many of the members during this time period were scholarship recipients, and the band often contained 5-10 veterans or active members of Drum Corps International. The band was known for its small size and huge sound. The band marches in a \"corps-style\" fashion, the only band of its type at an HBCU, as most have a \"show-style\" band. The band tries to do a different marching show at every home football game, with the exception of homecoming.\n\nThe Yellow Jacket Marching Band, also known as the \"Marching Swarm\", performs in one parade unless invited to others: the WVSU Homecoming Parade.
