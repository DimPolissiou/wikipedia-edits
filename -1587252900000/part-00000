Universally agreed as the by far the worst season, many fans concluded that Benioff and Weiss rushed the conclusion of the saga in order to work on more financially lucrative work at the expense of the quality of the show. As a result, the show ultimately ended on a low note, with many fans turned off by the lazy writing and poor storytelling. Unlike the first six seasons, which consisted of ten episodes each, and the [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|seventh season]], which consisted of seven episodes, the eighth season consists of only six episodes.\n\nThe final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. The first half of the season involves many of the main characters converging at Winterfell with their armies in an effort to repel the [[Night King]] and his army of [[White Walkers]] and wights. The second half of the season resumes the war for the throne as [[Daenerys Targaryen]] assaults King's Landing in an attempt to unseat [[Cersei Lannister]] as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nThe season was filmed from October 2017 to July 2018 and largely consists of original content not found in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, while also incorporating material that Martin has revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series, ''[[The Winds of Winter]]'' and ''[[A Dream of Spring]]''. The season was adapted for television by [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]].<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\nThe season was met with mixed reviews from critics, in contrast to the widespread acclaim of previous seasons, and is the lowest-rated of the series on the website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Criticism was mainly directed at the writing and shorter runtime of the season, as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners; though the acting, production, and musical score continued to receive praise.\n\nThe season received 32 nominations at the [[71st Primetime Emmy Awards]], the most for a single season of television in history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/awards/emmy-nominations-2019-game-of-thrones-analysis-netflix-hbo-1203268722/ |title=Emmys 2019 Nominations: HBO Back at the Top, as 'Game of Thrones' Makes History |work=Variety |first=Michael |last=Schneider |date=July 16, 2019 |accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref> It won twelve, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] for [[Peter Dinklage]].\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--Summaries should not be over 200 words per WP:TVPLOT.

Unlike the first six seasons, which consisted of ten episodes each, and the [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|seventh season]], which consisted of seven episodes, the eighth season consists of only six episodes.\n\nThe final season depicts the culmination of the series' two primary conflicts: the Great War against the Army of the Dead, and the Last War for control of the Iron Throne. The first half of the season involves many of the main characters converging at Winterfell with their armies in an effort to repel the [[Night King]] and his army of [[White Walkers]] and wights. The second half of the season resumes the war for the throne as [[Daenerys Targaryen]] assaults King's Landing in an attempt to unseat [[Cersei Lannister]] as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nThe season was filmed from October 2017 to July 2018 and largely consists of original content not found in [[George R. R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, while also incorporating material that Martin has revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series, ''[[The Winds of Winter]]'' and ''[[A Dream of Spring]]''. The season was adapted for television by [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]].<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\nThe season was met with mixed reviews from critics, in contrast to the widespread acclaim of previous seasons, and is the lowest-rated of the series on the website [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Criticism was mainly directed at the writing and shorter runtime of the season, as well as numerous creative decisions made by the showrunners; though the acting, production, and musical score continued to receive praise.\n\nThe season received 32 nominations at the [[71st Primetime Emmy Awards]], the most for a single season of television in history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/awards/emmy-nominations-2019-game-of-thrones-analysis-netflix-hbo-1203268722/ |title=Emmys 2019 Nominations: HBO Back at the Top, as 'Game of Thrones' Makes History |work=Variety |first=Michael |last=Schneider |date=July 16, 2019 |accessdate=July 17, 2019}}</ref> It won twelve, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]] and [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] for [[Peter Dinklage]].\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--Summaries should not be over 200 words per WP:TVPLOT.

At House Umber's seat of Last Hearth, Tormund and Beric encounter Edd and other Night's Watch members. They find the castle's occupants dead, and the wight of Ned Umber is left as a gruesome message.

He is imprisoned for treason to await execution. Arya and Tyrion separately warn Jon that Daenerys is a threat to House Stark and the people. Jon confronts Daenerys. Unable to halt her destructive path, an agonized Jon kills her. Drogon melts the Iron Throne, then gently carries Daenerys' body away. Tyrion proposes that all future monarchs be chosen by Westerosi leaders, rather than through familial succession. Bran Stark is proclaimed king, titled ''Bran the Broken''.

Also, once the series ran out of book material as a source, Hill noted that \"special niche interest in weirdos wasn't as effective as it had been\". However, Hill was \"not dissatisfied on the whole\" regarding the series.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hibberd |first1=James |title=Game of Thrones actor on his surprise death: 'Nothing could console me' |url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/12/game-of-thrones-varys-interview/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 12, 2019 |accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLena Headey had a \"mixed\" initial reaction to the manner of death of Cersei Lannister, the character she played. Headey would rather have Cersei die by \"some big piece or fight with somebody\". Eventually, fellow actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau persuaded Headey on how to appreciate the scene, and she said her eventual belief that \"it seemed like the perfect end for\" Cersei because Cersei and Jaime \"came into the world together and now they leave together\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hibberd |first1=James |title=Game of Thrones: Lena Headey reacts to that King's Landing battle ending |url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/12/game-thrones-cersei-kings-landing-battle-interview/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 12, 2019 |accessdate=May 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{see also|List of awards and nominations received by Game of Thrones}}\nWith 32 nominations, ''Game of Thrones'' broke the record of the most nominations received by a regular TV show in a single year.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!

It was originally named 'Ondolind\u00eb'. According to ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] [[Ulmo]], the Lord of Waters, revealed the location of the Vale of Tumladen to Turgon in a dream. Under this divine guidance, Turgon travelled from his kingdom in Nevrast and found the vale. Within the Echoriath, the Encircling Mountains, lay a round level plain with sheer walls on all sides and a ravine and tunnel leading out to the southwest known as the Hidden Way. In the middle of the vale there was a steep hill which was called Amon Gwareth, the \"Hill of Watch\". There Turgon decided to found a city, designed after the city of Tirion in [[Valinor]] that the [[Noldor]] had left.\n\nTurgon and his people built Gondolin in secret. After it was completed, he took with him to dwell in the hidden city his entire people in Nevrast\u2014almost a third of the Noldor of [[Fingolfin]]'s House\u2014as well as nearly three quarters of the northern [[Sindar]].\n\n=== The seven gates of the city ===\nThe Hidden Pass was protected by seven gates, all constantly guarded; the first of wood, then stone, bronze, iron, silver, gold, and steel, perhaps based on [[Herodotus]]'s description of the [[Medes|Medean]] city of [[Ecbatana]].  The seven gates of [[Minas Tirith]] echoed this notion of a layered defence on a hill.\n\n=== The fall of the city ===\nThe city stood for nearly 400 years until it was betrayed to [[Morgoth]] by Maeglin, Turgon's nephew. Maeglin was captured while mining outside the Encircling Mountains (against Turgon's orders). Maeglin betrayed the location of Gondolin after being promised Lordship and Turgon's daughter Idril.  Morgoth then sent an army over the Crissaegrim, the northernmost precipitous and dangerous portion of the Encircling Mountains, during [[The Gates of Summer]] (a great Gondolin festival), catching them unawares and sacking the city with relative ease.  In addition to [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]], [[Balrog]]s and [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragons]], Melkor's (Morgoth's) army, in early versions of the story, included iron machines (tanks) powered by \"internal fires\" and used as personnel carriers, to surmount difficult geographic obstacles and to defeat fortifications.\n\nThe Fall of Gondolin closely resembles that of [[Troy]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Mythlore]]|first=Alexander M.|last=Bruce|year=2012|volume=30|issue=3-4|title=The Fall of Gondolin and the Fall of Troy: Tolkien and Book II of the Aeneid|publisher=[[Mythopoeic Society]]|location=East Lansing, Michigan}}</ref>\n\n=== The seven names of Gondolin ===\n\nAccording to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the city had seven names: \"\u2019Tis said and \u2019tis sung: '''Gondobar''' am I called and '''Gondothlimbar''', City of Stone and City of the Dwellers in Stone; '''Gondolin''' the Stone of Song and '''Gwarestrin''' am I named, the Tower of the Guard, '''Gar Thurion''' or the Secret Place, for I am hidden from the eyes of Melko; but they who love me most greatly call me '''Loth''', for like a flower am I, even '''Lothengriol''' the flower that blooms on the plain.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=J.R.R.|last=Tolkien|authorlink=J.R.R.

Thus the city was usually called ''Gondolin'' (from Q.'' Ondolin(d\u00eb)'') with simple replacement of ''g-'', not ''Goenlin'' or ''Goenglin'' [as it would have been in standard [[Sindarin]]]\".<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, \"Words, Phrases and Passages\", ''Parma Eldalamberon 17'', p. 29</ref> The common or standard Sindarin tongue was not used in Gondolin.\n\n===Weaponry===\nThe smiths of Gondolin, using Elven techniques and magics, made powerful magic blades.  In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the swords [[Orcrist]], [[Glamdring]] and a long dagger later named [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]] were found in a Rhudaur Troll-Hoard. Each of these weapons had the ability to detect Orcs in the immediate vicinity by glowing blue. They also had the property of striking fear in the hearts of Orcs when used against them in combat.  All were well-crafted, and extraordinarily sharp.  Apparently, Gondolinian weapons were impervious to rust and corrosion, as the examples found in the trolls' lair were over 6,000 years old and had been hanging in the lair for an indeterminate length of time, yet were sharp and ready for use when unsheathed.\n\nThe dagger Sting was known to have special powers against giant spiders (distant offspring of [[Ungoliant]]) and could cut their webs with ease. It also was highly effective against [[Shelob]], cutting the spider's eyes and wounding her sufficiently that she fled in pain.  Whether the longer Gondolin swords mentioned in Tolkien's works had similar powers versus spiders is unknown.  Such creatures were common in the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] south of Gondolin.\n\n==Origin and publication history==\nTolkien began writing the story that would become ''The Fall of Gondolin'' in 1917 in an army barracks on the back of a sheet of military [[marching music]]. It is the first traceable story of his Middle-earth [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]] that he wrote down on paper.<ref name=\"BBC1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43726236|title=J.R.R.

''[[The Book of Lost Tales]], Part II.'' p. 147.</ref>\n\nTolkien was constantly revising his [[First Age]] stories; however, the narrative he wrote in 1917, published posthumously in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', remains the only full account of the fall of [[Gondolin|the city]]. The narrative in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' was the result of the editing by his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] using that story (minus some elements all too obviously evocative of [[World War I]] warfare) and compressed versions from the different versions of the ''Annals'' and ''Quentas'' as various sources. The later ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' and the ''[[Grey Annals|Grey Annals of Beleriand]]'', the main sources for much of the published ''Silmarillion'', both stop before the beginning of the [[Tuor]] story.\n\nA partial later version of ''The Fall of Gondolin'' was published in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' under the title \"Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin\". Originally titled \"Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin,\" this narrative shows a great expansion of the earlier tale. [[Christopher Tolkien]] retitled the story before including it in ''Unfinished Tales'', because it ends at the point of Tuor's arrival in Gondolin, and does not depict the actual Fall.\n\nThere is also an unfinished poem, ''The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin'', of which a few verses are quoted in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]''. In 130 verses Tolkien reaches the point where [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragons]] attack the city.\n\n==Stand-alone book==\nOn 30 August 2018,<ref name=\"TolkienSociety100418\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2018/04/the-fall-of-gondolin-to-be-published/|title=The Fall of Gondolin to be published|date=10 April 2018|first=Daniel|last=Helen|publisher=Tolkien Society|accessdate=18 April 2018|quote=HarperCollins has announced that it will, for the very first time, publish The Fall of Gondolin on 30 August this year.

''The Fall of Gondolin'' tells of the founding of the city; of the arrival there of [[Tuor]], a prince of [[Edain|Men]]; of the betrayal of the city to [[Morgoth]] by the king's nephew, Maeglin; and of its subsequent catastrophic destruction by Morgoth's armies. It also relates the flight of the fugitives to the [[Havens of Sirion]], the wedding of Tuor and Idril, as well as the childhood of [[E\u00e4rendil]].\n\n==Gondolin==\n{{redirect|Gondolin|the South African fossil site|Gondolin Cave}}\nGondolin<ref>\"Tolkien explained its origin in his \"Name-list to \"The Fall of Gondolin\" thus: \"''Gondolin'' meaneth in [[Gnomish]] 'stone of song' (whereby figuratively the Gnomes meant stone that was carven and wrought to great beauty)\".

It was originally named 'Ondolind\u00eb'. According to ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] [[Ulmo]], the Lord of Waters, revealed the location of the Vale of Tumladen to Turgon in a dream. Under this divine guidance, Turgon travelled from his kingdom in Nevrast and found the vale. Within the Echoriath, the Encircling Mountains, lay a round level plain with sheer walls on all sides and a ravine and tunnel leading out to the southwest known as the Hidden Way. In the middle of the vale there was a steep hill which was called Amon Gwareth, the \"Hill of Watch\". There Turgon decided to found a city, designed after the city of Tirion in [[Valinor]] that the [[Noldor]] had left.\n\nTurgon and his people built Gondolin in secret. After it was completed, he took with him to dwell in the hidden city his entire people in Nevrast\u2014almost a third of the Noldor of [[Fingolfin]]'s House\u2014as well as nearly three quarters of the northern [[Sindar]].\n\n=== The seven gates of the city ===\nThe Hidden Pass was protected by seven gates, all constantly guarded; the first of wood, then stone, bronze, iron, silver, gold, and steel, perhaps based on [[Herodotus]]'s description of the [[Medes|Medean]] city of [[Ecbatana]].  The seven gates of [[Minas Tirith]] echoed this notion of a layered defence on a hill.\n\n=== The fall of the city ===\nThe city stood for nearly 400 years until it was betrayed to [[Morgoth]] by Maeglin, Turgon's nephew. Maeglin was captured while mining outside the Encircling Mountains (against Turgon's orders). Maeglin betrayed the location of Gondolin after being promised Lordship and Turgon's daughter Idril.  Morgoth then sent an army over the Crissaegrim, the northernmost precipitous and dangerous portion of the Encircling Mountains, during [[The Gates of Summer]] (a great Gondolin festival), catching them unawares and sacking the city with relative ease.  In addition to [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]], [[Balrog]]s and [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragons]], Melkor's (Morgoth's) army, in early versions of the story, included iron machines (tanks) powered by \"internal fires\" and used as personnel carriers, to surmount difficult geographic obstacles and to defeat fortifications.\n\nThe Fall of Gondolin closely resembles that of [[Troy]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Mythlore]]|first=Alexander M.|last=Bruce|year=2012|volume=30|issue=3-4|title=The Fall of Gondolin and the Fall of Troy: Tolkien and Book II of the Aeneid|publisher=[[Mythopoeic Society]]|location=East Lansing, Michigan}}</ref>\n\n=== The seven names of Gondolin ===\n\nAccording to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the city had seven names: \"\u2019Tis said and \u2019tis sung: '''Gondobar''' am I called and '''Gondothlimbar''', City of Stone and City of the Dwellers in Stone; '''Gondolin''' the Stone of Song and '''Gwarestrin''' am I named, the Tower of the Guard, '''Gar Thurion''' or the Secret Place, for I am hidden from the eyes of Melko; but they who love me most greatly call me '''Loth''', for like a flower am I, even '''Lothengriol''' the flower that blooms on the plain.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=J.R.R.|last=Tolkien|authorlink=J.R.R.

Thus the city was usually called ''Gondolin'' (from Q.'' Ondolin(d\u00eb)'') with simple replacement of ''g-'', not ''Goenlin'' or ''Goenglin'' [as it would have been in standard [[Sindarin]]]\".<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, \"Words, Phrases and Passages\", ''Parma Eldalamberon 17'', p. 29</ref> The common or standard Sindarin tongue was not used in Gondolin.\n\n===Weaponry===\nThe smiths of Gondolin, using Elven techniques and magics, made powerful magic blades.  In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the swords [[Orcrist]], [[Glamdring]] and a long dagger later named [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]] were found in a Rhudaur Troll-Hoard. Each of these weapons had the ability to detect Orcs in the immediate vicinity by glowing blue. They also had the property of striking fear in the hearts of Orcs when used against them in combat.  All were well-crafted, and extraordinarily sharp.  Apparently, Gondolinian weapons were impervious to rust and corrosion, as the examples found in the trolls' lair were over 6,000 years old and had been hanging in the lair for an indeterminate length of time, yet were sharp and ready for use when unsheathed.\n\nThe dagger Sting was known to have special powers against giant spiders (distant offspring of [[Ungoliant]]) and could cut their webs with ease. It also was highly effective against [[Shelob]], cutting the spider's eyes and wounding her sufficiently that she fled in pain.  Whether the longer Gondolin swords mentioned in Tolkien's works had similar powers versus spiders is unknown.  Such creatures were common in the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] south of Gondolin.\n\n==Origin and publication history==\nTolkien began writing the story that would become ''The Fall of Gondolin'' in 1917 in an army barracks on the back of a sheet of military [[marching music]]. It is the first traceable story of his Middle-earth [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]] that he wrote down on paper.<ref name=\"BBC1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-43726236|title=J.R.R.

''[[The Book of Lost Tales]], Part II.'' p. 147.</ref>\n\nTolkien was constantly revising his [[First Age]] stories; however, the narrative he wrote in 1917, published posthumously in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', remains the only full account of the fall of [[Gondolin|the city]]. The narrative in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' was the result of the editing by his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] using that story (minus some elements all too obviously evocative of [[World War I]] warfare) and compressed versions from the different versions of the ''Annals'' and ''Quentas'' as various sources. The later ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' and the ''[[Grey Annals|Grey Annals of Beleriand]]'', the main sources for much of the published ''Silmarillion'', both stop before the beginning of the [[Tuor]] story.\n\nA partial later version of ''The Fall of Gondolin'' was published in the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' under the title \"Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin\". Originally titled \"Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin,\" this narrative shows a great expansion of the earlier tale. [[Christopher Tolkien]] retitled the story before including it in ''Unfinished Tales'', because it ends at the point of Tuor's arrival in Gondolin, and does not depict the actual Fall.\n\nThere is also an unfinished poem, ''The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin'', of which a few verses are quoted in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]''. In 130 verses Tolkien reaches the point where [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragons]] attack the city.\n\n==Stand-alone book==\nOn 30 August 2018,<ref name=\"TolkienSociety100418\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2018/04/the-fall-of-gondolin-to-be-published/|title=The Fall of Gondolin to be published|date=10 April 2018|first=Daniel|last=Helen|publisher=Tolkien Society|accessdate=18 April 2018|quote=HarperCollins has announced that it will, for the very first time, publish The Fall of Gondolin on 30 August this year.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330. The crew asked to remain at FL 330 and the air traffic controller approved this request, moving the other flight to FL 350.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330. The crew asked to remain at FL 330 and the air traffic controller approved this request, moving the other flight to FL 350.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.
