The line runs in an orbital north to south route following the alignment of the [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA). Although it has the characteristics of [[light rail]], such as with the type of [[Railroad car|rolling stock]] used, it is more akin to a [[rapid transit]] system owing to its total [[grade separation]] and high passenger throughput.\n\nEnvisioned in the 1970s as part of the Metropolitan Manila Strategic Mass Rail Transit Development Plan, the thirteen-station, {{convert|16.9|km|mi|sp = us|adj = on}} line was the second rapid transit line to be built in Metro Manila when it started full operations in 2000 under a 25-year concession agreement between its private owners and the Philippine government's [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] (DOTr).\n\nThe line is owned by the [[Metro Rail Transit Corporation]] (MRTC), a private company operating in partnership with the DOTr under a [[Build-Operate-Transfer|Build-Lease-Transfer]] agreement.\nServing close to 550,000 passengers on a daily basis when MRTC's maintenance provider, [[Sumitomo Corporation|Sumitomo Corp.]] of Japan, was handling the maintenance of the system, the line is the busiest among Metro Manila's three rapid transit lines, built with essential standards such as [[barrier-free|barrier-free access]] and the use of contact-less card tickets to better facilitate passenger access. Total ridership significantly exceeds its built maximum capacity of 350,000 passengers a day, with various solutions being proposed or implemented to alleviate chronic congestion in addition to the procurement of new rolling stock.\n\nSince 2006, the system's private owners had been offering various capacity expansion proposals to the DOTC. In 2014, after the DOTC's handling of the line's maintenance for two years amid questions about the line's structural integrity owing to the poor maintenance and the pronouncements that the system, in general, was safe, experts from [[MTR|MTR HK]] were commissioned to review the system. MTR HK made the opinion that the rail system was compromised due to the DOTC's poor maintenance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joeam.com/2016/01/31/on-a-clear-day-you-can-see-the-mrt/|title=On a clear day you can see the MRT|last=Salazar|first=Irineo B.

Although the line is aimed at reducing traffic congestion and travel time along EDSA, the transportation system has only been partially successful due to the DOTC's inaction on the private sector's proposals to expand the capacity of the system to take up to 1.1 million passengers a day. Expanding the network's capacity to accommodate the rising number of passengers is currently set on tackling this problem.\n\n==Route==\n[[Image:MRT-3 Manila train towards Ayala Station.jpg|thumb|A Class 3000 train approaching [[Ayala station]].]]\nThe line serves 13 stations on {{convert|16.9|km|mi|sp=us}} of line,<ref name=\"stations\">{{cite web|url=http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=7 |title=About Us \u2013 MRT3 Stations |publisher=Metro Rail Transit |accessdate=June 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122003116/http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=7 |archivedate=January 22, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"line\">{{cite web |url=http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=4 |title=About Us \u2013 Background |publisher=Metro Rail Transit |accessdate=June 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508151958/http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=4 |archivedate=May 8, 2014 }}</ref> spaced on average around {{convert|1300|m|ft}} apart.<ref name=\"y2k\" />  The rails are mostly elevated and erected either over or along the roads covered, with sections below ground before and after [[Buendia station|Buendia]] and [[Ayala station|Ayala]] stations, the only underground stations on the line. The southern terminus of the line is the [[Taft Avenue station]] at the intersection between [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] and [[Taft Avenue]], while the northern terminus is the [[North Avenue station (Line 3)|North Avenue station]] along [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] in Barangay Bagong Pag-asa, [[Quezon City]].  The rail line serves the cities that [[Circumferential Road 4]] ([[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]]) passes through: [[Pasay]], [[Makati]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[Quezon City]]. The line crosses [[South Luzon Expressway]] (SLEX) at [[Magallanes Interchange]] in Makati.\n\nThree stations currently serve as interchanges between the lines operated by the MRTC, [[Light Rail Transit Authority]] (LRTA), and [[Philippine National Railways]] (PNR). [[Magallanes station]] is near the PNR's [[EDSA railway station|EDSA station]], while [[Araneta Center-Cubao station (Line 3)|Araneta Center-Cubao]] Station is connected by a covered walkway to its [[Araneta Center\u2013Cubao station (Line 2)|namesake]] station of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]], and [[Taft Avenue station]] is connected via a covered walkway to the [[EDSA station (Line 1)|EDSA station]] of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|Line 1]]. No stations are connected to other rapid transit lines within the paid areas, though that is set to change with the connection of Line 1 to, the subsequent opening and connection of [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 7|Line 7]] to and the construction of a new concourse for [[North Avenue Grand Central station|North Avenue station]] which accommodates interchange within the paid area.\n\nEarly on during the construction of the line, a plan was drafted for a spur line towards the [[Makati Central Business District]], built between Ayala and Buendia stations. This was subsequently abandoned and rail tracks never laid down. The remaining evidence of this abandoned plan is an underground viaduct between Buendia and Ayala station turning right.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! colspan=\"2\" | Distance (km)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Transfers\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Location\n|-\n!

Due to the very high patronage of the line, part of the platform corresponding to the front car of the train is cordoned off for the use of women, children, elderly and disabled passengers.\n\nThe stations are also designed to occupy the entire span of EDSA, allowing passengers to safely cross between one end of the road and the other.<ref name=\"y2k\" />\n\n===Shops and services===\nInside the concourse of all stations are stalls or shops where people can buy food or drinks.

The expansion has been shelved by then President [[Gloria Arroyo]] in favor of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|Line 1]]'s extension from [[Monumento station|Monumento]] to a new [[North Avenue Grand Central station|common station]] that it will share with at North Avenue, thus closing the loop.  However, this move of President Arroyo to take away Phase 2 had proven to be ill-advised as the ridership is very low at only about 30,000 passengers a day. The southern terminus of the [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 7|Line 7]] (originally Line 4 along Quezon Avenue., but had since changed route several times), which will link [[Quezon City]], [[Caloocan|Caloocan (north)]], and [[San Jose del Monte|San Jose del Monte City]], [[Bulacan]] will be sharing the same station.\n\nThe [[National Economic and Development Authority (Philippines)|National Economic and Development Authority]] as well as then President Arroyo herself have said that the link at North Avenue is a national priority, since it would not only provide seamless service between the Lines 1 and 3, but would also help decongest Metro Manila.<ref name=\"neda\">{{Cite news | author=Torres, Ted P. | title=LRT-MRT link is nat'l priority \u2013 NEDA | url=http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_092104_LrtMrtLinkIsNationalPriority.htm | work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. | date=September 21, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040925141346/http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_092104_LrtMrtLinkIsNationalPriority.htm | archivedate=September 25, 2004 }}</ref>  It is estimated that by 2010, when the extension is completed, some 684,000 commuters would use the line every day from the present 400,000, and traffic congestion on EDSA would be cut by as much as 50%.<ref name=\"commuters\">{{cite press release | title=After gov't takeover of NAIA Terminal 3, PGMA orders immediate completion of EDSA MRT3 extension | publisher=[[Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] | date=January 4, 2005 | url=http://www.dotc.gov.ph/actioncenter/articles/2005_jan/articles_010405.htm | accessdate=May 19, 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nProposals to fully unite Lines 1 and 3 operations, trains and systems have been pitched but has not been pursued so far. Feasibility tests for this proposition included Line 1 trains visiting Line 3 depot facilities and running them on the entire line. It has since been shelved for undisclosed reasons, but may be a possibility should Manny Pangilinan's Metro Pacific attempts to purchase the entire system succeed. If and when this happens, the system may be theoretically controlled or connected to Line 1's current operating concessionaire, LRMC (Light Rail Manila Consortium), of whom Pangilinan has a controlling stake, paving the way to a possible line merger.\n\n====Transfer of operations from MRTC to LRTA====\nRecently, a new study for the Metro Manila Rail Network has been unveiled by DOTC Undersecretary for Public Information Dante Velasco that Lines 1, 2, and 3 will be under one management, the [[Light Rail Transit Authority]]. This is due to maintenance cost issues for Line 1's maintenance cost, which is approximately \u20b135 million, along with Line 2's \u20b125 million and Line 3's \u20b154 million maintenance costs. Another reason for this study is for the unification of the lines. According to DOTC Undersecretary for Rails Glicerio Sicat, the transfer was set by the government in June 2011.<ref name=\"operations\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/business-columns/36361-govt-creates-team-for-mrt-3-due-diligence-sets-june-takeover|title=Govt creates team for MRT-3 due diligence, sets June takeover|author=Amojelar, Darwin G.|date=December 28, 2010|work=[[The Manila Times]]|accessdate=January 15, 2011|publisher=Manila Times Publishing Corporation}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>  However, it is unlikely that the private owners, MRTC, will approve this plan.\n\nOn January 13, 2011, [[Light Rail Transit Authority]] Chief Rafael S.

The line runs in an orbital north to south route following the alignment of the [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (EDSA). Although it has the characteristics of [[light rail]], such as with the type of [[Railroad car|rolling stock]] used, it is more akin to a [[rapid transit]] system owing to its total [[grade separation]] and high passenger throughput.\n\nEnvisioned in the 1970s as part of the Metropolitan Manila Strategic Mass Rail Transit Development Plan, the thirteen-station, {{convert|16.9|km|mi|sp = us|adj = on}} line was the second rapid transit line to be built in Metro Manila when it started full operations in 2000 under a 25-year concession agreement between its private owners and the Philippine government's [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] (DOTr).\n\nThe line is owned by the [[Metro Rail Transit Corporation]] (MRTC), a private company operating in partnership with the DOTr under a [[Build-Operate-Transfer|Build-Lease-Transfer]] agreement.\nServing close to 550,000 passengers on a daily basis when MRTC's maintenance provider, [[Sumitomo Corporation|Sumitomo Corp.]] of Japan, was handling the maintenance of the system, the line is the busiest among Metro Manila's three rapid transit lines, built with essential standards such as [[barrier-free|barrier-free access]] and the use of contact-less card tickets to better facilitate passenger access. Total ridership significantly exceeds its built maximum capacity of 350,000 passengers a day, with various solutions being proposed or implemented to alleviate chronic congestion in addition to the procurement of new rolling stock.\n\nSince 2006, the system's private owners had been offering various capacity expansion proposals to the DOTC. In 2014, after the DOTC's handling of the line's maintenance for two years amid questions about the line's structural integrity owing to the poor maintenance and the pronouncements that the system, in general, was safe, experts from [[MTR|MTR HK]] were commissioned to review the system. MTR HK made the opinion that the rail system was compromised due to the DOTC's poor maintenance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joeam.com/2016/01/31/on-a-clear-day-you-can-see-the-mrt/|title=On a clear day you can see the MRT|last=Salazar|first=Irineo B.

Although the line is aimed at reducing traffic congestion and travel time along EDSA, the transportation system has only been partially successful due to the DOTC's inaction on the private sector's proposals to expand the capacity of the system to take up to 1.1 million passengers a day. Expanding the network's capacity to accommodate the rising number of passengers is currently set on tackling this problem.\n\n==Route==\n[[Image:MRT-3 Manila train towards Ayala Station.jpg|thumb|A Class 3000 train approaching [[Ayala station]].]]\nThe line serves 13 stations on {{convert|16.9|km|mi|sp=us}} of line,<ref name=\"stations\">{{cite web|url=http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=7 |title=About Us \u2013 MRT3 Stations |publisher=Metro Rail Transit |accessdate=June 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122003116/http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=7 |archivedate=January 22, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"line\">{{cite web |url=http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=4 |title=About Us \u2013 Background |publisher=Metro Rail Transit |accessdate=June 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508151958/http://dotcmrt3.gov.ph/about.php?route=4 |archivedate=May 8, 2014 }}</ref> spaced on average around {{convert|1300|m|ft}} apart.<ref name=\"y2k\" />  The rails are mostly elevated and erected either over or along the roads covered, with sections below ground before and after [[Buendia station|Buendia]] and [[Ayala station|Ayala]] stations, the only underground stations on the line. The southern terminus of the line is the [[Taft Avenue station]] at the intersection between [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] and [[Taft Avenue]], while the northern terminus is the [[North Avenue station (Line 3)|North Avenue station]] along [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] in Barangay Bagong Pag-asa, [[Quezon City]].  The rail line serves the cities that [[Circumferential Road 4]] ([[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]]) passes through: [[Pasay]], [[Makati]], [[Mandaluyong]], [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[Quezon City]]. The line crosses [[South Luzon Expressway]] (SLEX) at [[Magallanes Interchange]] in Makati.\n\nThree stations currently serve as interchanges between the lines operated by the MRTC, [[Light Rail Transit Authority]] (LRTA), and [[Philippine National Railways]] (PNR). [[Magallanes station]] is near the PNR's [[EDSA railway station|EDSA station]], while [[Araneta Center-Cubao station (Line 3)|Araneta Center-Cubao]] Station is connected by a covered walkway to its [[Araneta Center\u2013Cubao station (Line 2)|namesake]] station of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|Line 2]], and [[Taft Avenue station]] is connected via a covered walkway to the [[EDSA station (Line 1)|EDSA station]] of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|Line 1]]. No stations are connected to other rapid transit lines within the paid areas, though that is set to change with the connection of Line 1 to, the subsequent opening and connection of [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 7|Line 7]] to and the construction of a new concourse for [[North Avenue Grand Central station|North Avenue station]] which accommodates interchange within the paid area.\n\nEarly on during the construction of the line, a plan was drafted for a spur line towards the [[Makati Central Business District]], built between Ayala and Buendia stations. This was subsequently abandoned and rail tracks never laid down. The remaining evidence of this abandoned plan is an underground viaduct between Buendia and Ayala station turning right.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name\n! colspan=\"2\" | Distance (km)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Transfers\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Location\n|-\n!

Due to the very high patronage of the line, part of the platform corresponding to the front car of the train is cordoned off for the use of women, children, elderly and disabled passengers.\n\nThe stations are also designed to occupy the entire span of EDSA, allowing passengers to safely cross between one end of the road and the other.<ref name=\"y2k\" />\n\n===Shops and services===\nInside the concourse of all stations are stalls or shops where people can buy food or drinks. Stalls vary by station, and some have fast food stalls.

The expansion has been shelved by then President [[Gloria Arroyo]] in favor of the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|Line 1]]'s extension from [[Monumento station|Monumento]] to a new [[North Avenue Grand Central station|common station]] that it will share with at North Avenue, thus closing the loop.  However, this move of President Arroyo to take away Phase 2 had proven to be ill-advised as the ridership is very low at only about 30,000 passengers a day. The southern terminus of the [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 7|Line 7]] (originally Line 4 along Quezon Avenue., but had since changed route several times), which will link [[Quezon City]], [[Caloocan|Caloocan (north)]], and [[San Jose del Monte|San Jose del Monte City]], [[Bulacan]] will be sharing the same station.\n\nThe [[National Economic and Development Authority (Philippines)|National Economic and Development Authority]] as well as then President Arroyo herself have said that the link at North Avenue is a national priority, since it would not only provide seamless service between the Lines 1 and 3, but would also help decongest Metro Manila.<ref name=\"neda\">{{Cite news | author=Torres, Ted P. | title=LRT-MRT link is nat'l priority \u2013 NEDA | url=http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_092104_LrtMrtLinkIsNationalPriority.htm | work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. | date=September 21, 2004 | accessdate=May 12, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040925141346/http://www.lrta.gov.ph/news/news_item_092104_LrtMrtLinkIsNationalPriority.htm | archivedate=September 25, 2004 }}</ref>  It is estimated that by 2010, when the extension is completed, some 684,000 commuters would use the line every day from the present 400,000, and traffic congestion on EDSA would be cut by as much as 50%.<ref name=\"commuters\">{{cite press release | title=After gov't takeover of NAIA Terminal 3, PGMA orders immediate completion of EDSA MRT3 extension | publisher=[[Department of Transportation and Communications (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] | date=January 4, 2005 | url=http://www.dotc.gov.ph/actioncenter/articles/2005_jan/articles_010405.htm | accessdate=May 19, 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nProposals to fully unite Lines 1 and 3 operations, trains and systems have been pitched but has not been pursued so far. Feasibility tests for this proposition included Line 1 trains visiting Line 3 depot facilities and running them on the entire line. It has since been shelved for undisclosed reasons, but may be a possibility should Manny Pangilinan's Metro Pacific attempts to purchase the entire system succeed. If and when this happens, the system may be theoretically controlled or connected to Line 1's current operating concessionaire, LRMC (Light Rail Manila Consortium), of whom Pangilinan has a controlling stake, paving the way to a possible line merger.\n\n====Transfer of operations from MRTC to LRTA====\nRecently, a new study for the Metro Manila Rail Network has been unveiled by DOTC Undersecretary for Public Information Dante Velasco that Lines 1, 2, and 3 will be under one management, the [[Light Rail Transit Authority]]. This is due to maintenance cost issues for Line 1's maintenance cost, which is approximately \u20b135 million, along with Line 2's \u20b125 million and Line 3's \u20b154 million maintenance costs. Another reason for this study is for the unification of the lines. According to DOTC Undersecretary for Rails Glicerio Sicat, the transfer was set by the government in June 2011.<ref name=\"operations\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/business-columns/36361-govt-creates-team-for-mrt-3-due-diligence-sets-june-takeover|title=Govt creates team for MRT-3 due diligence, sets June takeover|author=Amojelar, Darwin G.|date=December 28, 2010|work=[[The Manila Times]]|accessdate=January 15, 2011|publisher=Manila Times Publishing Corporation}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>  However, it is unlikely that the private owners, MRTC, will approve this plan.\n\nOn January 13, 2011, [[Light Rail Transit Authority]] Chief Rafael S.

2020}} This was O'Sullivan's third Masters title in four years, having also won in [[2014 Masters (snooker)|2014]] and [[2016 Masters (snooker)|2016]]. He reached the final again in [[2019 Masters (snooker)|2019]], extending his record number of appearances in the final to 13, in 25 overall appearances at the Masters tournament; however, he was outplayed by [[Judd Trump]] who claimed his first Masters title with a solid 10\u20134 victory.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Format ==\nThe format has been largely unchanged since [[1984 Masters (snooker)|1984]] and the tournament generally involves the leading 16 players in the [[Snooker world rankings|world rankings]].<ref name=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/> There was a wild-card round from 1990 to 2010.\n\nThe defending Masters champion is seeded 1 while the current World Champion is seeded 2 (assuming that it is a different player). The remaining places are then allocated to the top players in the world rankings, seeded in order of those rankings. Since the defending champion and current World Champion are normally ranked in the top 16, the field generally consists of the top 16 ranked players. The exceptions have been:\n*In [[2006 Masters (snooker)|2006]], [[2005 World Snooker Championship|World Champion]] [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]] was ranked 21 so that [[Ian McCulloch (snooker player)|Ian McCulloch]], ranked 16, was not automatically invited. McCulloch was, however, the wild-card choice.\n*In [[2013 Masters (snooker)|2013]], [[Stephen Lee (snooker player)|Stephen Lee]], ranked 9, did not play because he was suspended<ref>{{cite web|title=WPBSA Statement \u2013 Stephen Lee Appeal Dismissed |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/page/NewsArticles/0,,13165~2958763,00.html |work=worldsnooker.com |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |accessdate=25 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026045957/http://www.worldsnooker.com/page/NewsArticles/0%2C%2C13165~2958763%2C00.html |archivedate=26 October 2012 }}</ref> and so [[Mark Davis (snooker player)|Mark Davis]], ranked 17, was invited.

With the introduction of the wild-card round in 1990, this system meant that seeds 15 and 16 needed to win a match to reach the last 16, where they would immediately play either of the first two seeds, generally the defending Masters champion and the World Champion. A change was introduced in 1991 so that seeds 9 to 16 were randomly drawn to play seeds 1 to 8.\n\nIn 1996 the last-16 and quarter-final rounds were extended from 9 to 11 frames while the final was extended from 17 to 19 frames. Wild-card matches were extended from 9 to 11 frames in 1999.\n\n== Winners ==\n<ref name=cajt.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/><ref>{{cite web|title=The Masters \u2013

There were also two selections in 2007 when the wild-card round was extended to three matches.\n\nThe inclusion of wild-card players meant that there were an additional two or three matches to be arranged. The tournament continued to be played over 8 days but three matches were played on Sunday and Monday instead of the usual two (and Tuesday in 2007), so that the last-16 round was still completed on Wednesday. In 2007 all three wild-card matches were played on the first Sunday so that the last-16 round did not start until Monday.\n\nThere were a total of 43 wild-card matches. In 19 of these matches the seeded player played the winner of the Qualifying Event. In the remaining 24 matches the seed played a selected wild-card. The players selected as wild-card were [[Jimmy White]] (5), [[Ding Junhui]] (3), [[Steve Davis]] (2), [[Marco Fu]] (2), [[James Wattana]] (2), [[Ken Doherty]], [[Peter Ebdon]], [[Andy Hicks]], [[Alex Higgins]], [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]], [[Paul Hunter (snooker player)|Paul Hunter]], [[Stephen Maguire]], [[Ian McCulloch (snooker player)|Ian McCulloch]], [[Ricky Walden]] and [[Gary Wilkinson (snooker player)|Gary Wilkinson]].\n\nNone of the players who played in the wild-card round won the tournament although two players, John Higgins (in [[1995 Masters (snooker)|1995]]) and Ding Junhui (in [[2007 Masters (snooker)|2007]]) reached the final. Both these players were wild-card selections. Two seeded players who played in the wild-card round reached the semi-final, Jimmy White (in [[2004 Masters (snooker)|2004]]) and [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] (in [[2010 Masters (snooker)|2010]]). The winner of the Qualifying Event never got beyond the last-16 round.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Masters (snooker)}}\n{{Snooker tournaments}}\n\n[[Category:Masters (snooker)| ]]\n[[Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1975]]\n[[Category:1975 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Snooker non-ranking competitions]]\n[[Category:Snooker competitions in England]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in London]]\n[[Category:Annual events in London]]\n[[Category:January sporting events]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=April 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2018}}\n{{Infobox Snooker tournament\n|tournament_name = The Masters\n|image = [[File:Dafabet Masters Logo.png|250px]]\n|venue = [[Alexandra Palace]] (since 2012)\n|location = London\n|country = England\n|establishment = 1975\n|organisation = [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]]\n|format = Non-[[Snooker world rankings|ranking]] event\n|prizefund = [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]600,000<ref>{{cite web|last=Kalb|first=Rolf|title=Snooker \u2013 Die Turnier-Infos zum Masters|url=https://de.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/international-championship-turnier-info-masters-141613975--spt.html|publisher=[[Eurosport|Yahoo Eurosport]]|date=6 January 2015|accessdate=15 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118193545/https://de.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/international-championship-turnier-info-masters-141613975--spt.html|archivedate=18 January 2015}}</ref>\n|Current Champion = {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Stuart Bingham]]\n|Recent edition =[[2020 Masters (snooker)|2020]]\n}}\n\n'''The Masters''' is a professional invitational [[snooker]] tournament.

With the introduction of the wild-card round in 1990, this system meant that seeds 15 and 16 needed to win a match to reach the last 16, where they would immediately play either of the first two seeds, generally the defending Masters champion and the World Champion.

There were also two selections in 2007 when the wild-card round was extended to three matches.\n\nThe inclusion of wild-card players meant that there were an additional two or three matches to be arranged. The tournament continued to be played over 8 days but three matches were played on Sunday and Monday instead of the usual two (and Tuesday in 2007), so that the last-16 round was still completed on Wednesday. In 2007 all three wild-card matches were played on the first Sunday so that the last-16 round did not start until Monday.\n\nThere were a total of 43 wild-card matches. In 19 of these matches the seeded player played the winner of the Qualifying Event. In the remaining 24 matches the seed played a selected wild-card.

Strongly linked to the [[Maserati]] and [[Ferrari]] brands, AF Corse currently competes in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], [[European Le Mans Series]], [[Asian Le Mans Series]], and [[International GT Open]], and are four-time champions of the GT2 class of the former [[FIA GT Championship]].<ref name=\"2007 Champions\">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2007 | title = 2007 Champions | publisher = [[FIA GT Championship]] | accessdate = 2008-03-24| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080327221247/http://fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2007| archive-date= 27 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>  The team has also entered cars under Advanced Engineering, AT Racing, Pecom Racing, Spirit of Race, Formula Racing and [[Enzo Potolicchio|8Star Motorsports]], and in association with [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] (AF Waltrip).\n\n==History==\nIn 1995, Amato Ferrari (no relation to the family of [[Enzo Ferrari]] and his [[Ferrari]] car company) retired from driving and chose to concentrate on team management, initially entering the [[Italian Superturismo Championship]].  Following the series' demise in 1999, Ferrari launched a new team known as AF Corse, named for his initials.  The team turned to [[sports car racing]], and within a year was contracted by [[Maserati]].  AF Corse was tasked with the development, maintenance, and transport of the Trofeo Cup, a [[One-Design|one-make series]] based on the [[Maserati Coup\u00e9]].  The company would continue in this position until 2005.\n\nDuring 2004, Maserati approached AF Corse about running their latest development in sports car racing: the new [[Maserati MC12]] for the international [[FIA GT Championship]].  The team aided Maserati in testing and developing the car before running the two new racers in their home event at [[2004 FIA GT Imola 500 km|Imola]].  Drivers Fabrizio de Simone, [[Andrea Bertolini]], [[Mika Salo]], and [[Johnny Herbert]] were all be assigned to the team, eventually earning AF Corse two victories before the season ended.<ref name=\"AF Corse\">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiagt.com/teambio.php?countkey=0 | title = Team Biography: AF Corse Motorola | publisher =  [[FIA GT Championship]] | accessdate = 2008-03-24| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080312004742/http://www.fiagt.com/teambio.php?countkey=0| archive-date= 12 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>  Once the development of the MC12 was satisfied, the company returned to running the Trofeo Cup, as well as running a Maserati Light in the 2005 [[Italian GT Championship]].\n\n[[File:AF Corse F430.jpg|thumb|left|One of AF Corse's [[Ferrari F430]] GT2s]]\n\nAF Corse returned to the FIA GT Championship in 2006.  This time however they would be running the latest Ferrari offering, the [[Ferrari F430]], as well as competing in the series' lower category, the GT2 class.  Salo was retained in the driving line-up, while newcomers [[Rui \u00c1guas (racing driver)|Rui \u00c1guas]], [[Jaime Melo]], and [[Matteo Bobbi]] completed the standard line-up.  Victory was earned in the team's debut at [[2006 FIA GT Tourist Trophy|Silverstone]], and another two were earned over the season, including at the [[Spa 24 Hours]].  AF Corse won the class championship, beating fellow Ferrari competitor Scuderia Ecosse.<ref name=\"2006 Champions\">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2006 | title = 2006 Champions | publisher = [[FIA GT Championship]] | accessdate = 2008-03-24| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080327221242/http://fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2006| archive-date= 27 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>  The company retained their connection to Maserati however, entering a trio of cars in the new [[FIA GT3 European Championship]].\n\nAs defending champions, AF Corse remained in the FIA GT Championship in 2007, although much on the team changed.  While the Ferrari F430s remained, all new drivers were introduced to the team.  [[Dirk M\u00fcller (racing driver)|Dirk M\u00fcller]], [[Toni Vilander]], [[Gianmaria Bruni]], and [[Stephane Ortelli]] took over driving duties for the season, while [[Motorola]] announced their full sponsorship of the squad.  The two cars dominated the [[2007 FIA GT Championship season|2007 season]], winning nine of the ten events on the schedule and wrapping up another championship.<ref name=\"2007 Champions\" />\n\nFor 2008, AF Corse expanded to a three car team in the GT2 class.  Vilander and Bruni are retained in the lead car, while Biagi returns to the squad to be joined by Christian Montanari in the second entry.  The third car will be run under the Advanced Engineering name, with [[Argentinian]] [[Mat\u00edas Russo]] and [[Lu\u00eds P\u00e9rez Companc]].\n\n[[File:51 AF Corse 01 1600.jpg|thumb|right|AF Corse's Ferrari F458 Italia GT2 at [[Zhuhai International Circuit]].]]\n\nIn 2010, the [[FIA GT Championship]] was dissolved and two new championships were born from it. The GT1 class of the former series became the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]] while the GT2 class formed the [[FIA GT2 European Championship]]. The GT2 series was suspended due to lack of entries. As a result, the AF Corse team joined the [[Le Mans Series]]. For the [[2010 Le Mans Series season|2010 season]], the team fielded three Ferrari F430 GT2s for the series' GT2 class. Drivers [[Mat\u00edas Russo]] and [[Lu\u00eds P\u00e9rez Companc]] campaigned the #94 Ferrari with [[Toni Vilander]] and former Grand Prix drivers [[Jean Alesi]] and [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] in the #95. [[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]] regulars, with the [[Risi Competizione]] team, [[Jaime Melo]] and [[Gianmaria Bruni]] drove the Ferrari #96.\n\nIn 2011 AF Corse entered the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] with brand new Ferrari 458 Italia GT2s as well as the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] with Ferrari 458 Italia GT3s. AF Corse won the ILMC in the GTE-Pro category, including the final round at [[Petit Le Mans]]. It also won the FIA GT3 driver's championship with [[Francisco Catellaci]] and [[Federico Leo]].\n\nThe team also joined the [[International GT Open]] for the [[2010 International GT Open season|2010 season]] in the Super GT class, which is largely reminiscent of the GT2 rules in the [[Le Mans Series]]. The team fields two Ferrari GT2 cars for drivers [[Jack Gerber]] & [[Rui \u00c1guas (racing driver)|Rui \u00c1guas]] in the #6 car and [[Pierre Kaffer]] and [[\u00c1lvaro Barba]] in the #8 Ferrari. AF Corse will also field a third Ferrari (#7) for the [[AT Racing]] team with drivers [[Alexander Talkanitsa]] and his son [[Alexander Talkanitsa Jr]].\n\nFor 2012, AF Corse competed in a variety of sports car championships throughout Europe and globally, including the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] and [[GT1 World Championship]] with Ferrari F458 Italia GT2s and Ferrari F458 Italia GT3s, including a co-branded for GTE-Am class car with [[Michael Waltrip Racing]], AF Waltrip.  At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, amateur driver [[Piergiuseppe Perazzini]] collided with the No. 8 Toyota driven by overall-contender [[Anthony Davidson]], sending the Toyota airborne at the Mulsanne Corner.  Perazzini's Ferrari also flipped and landed on its roof after hitting the tyre barrier. Davidson suffered two broken vertebrae in the crash but was able to pull himself from the car in the immediate aftermath of the accident - though of course he was forced to abandon the race.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/motorsport/18474792 | title = Anthony Davidson breaks back after Le Mans 24 Hour accident | publisher = [[BBC]] | work = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 17 June 2012 | accessdate =25 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===24 Hours of Le Mans results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

[[Piacenza]].  Strongly linked to the [[Maserati]] and [[Ferrari]] brands, AF Corse currently competes in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], [[European Le Mans Series]], [[Asian Le Mans Series]], and [[International GT Open]], and are four-time champions of the GT2 class of the former [[FIA GT Championship]].<ref name=\"2007 Champions\">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2007 | title = 2007 Champions | publisher = [[FIA GT Championship]] | accessdate = 2008-03-24| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080327221247/http://fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2007| archive-date= 27 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>  The team has also entered cars under Advanced Engineering, AT Racing, Pecom Racing, Spirit of Race, Formula Racing and [[Enzo Potolicchio|8Star Motorsports]], and in association with [[Michael Waltrip Racing]] (AF Waltrip).\n\n==History==\nIn 1995, Amato Ferrari (no relation to the family of [[Enzo Ferrari]] and his [[Ferrari]] car company) retired from driving and chose to concentrate on team management, initially entering the [[Italian Superturismo Championship]].  Following the series' demise in 1999, Ferrari launched a new team known as AF Corse, named for his initials.  The team turned to [[sports car racing]], and within a year was contracted by [[Maserati]].  AF Corse was tasked with the development, maintenance, and transport of the Trofeo Cup, a [[One-Design|one-make series]] based on the [[Maserati Coup\u00e9]].  The company would continue in this position until 2005.\n\nDuring 2004, Maserati approached AF Corse about running their latest development in sports car racing: the new [[Maserati MC12]] for the international [[FIA GT Championship]].  The team aided Maserati in testing and developing the car before running the two new racers in their home event at [[2004 FIA GT Imola 500 km|Imola]].  Drivers Fabrizio de Simone, [[Andrea Bertolini]], [[Mika Salo]], and [[Johnny Herbert]] were all be assigned to the team, eventually earning AF Corse two victories before the season ended.<ref name=\"AF Corse\">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiagt.com/teambio.php?countkey=0 | title = Team Biography: AF Corse Motorola | publisher =  [[FIA GT Championship]] | accessdate = 2008-03-24| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080312004742/http://www.fiagt.com/teambio.php?countkey=0| archive-date= 12 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>  Once the development of the MC12 was satisfied, the company returned to running the Trofeo Cup, as well as running a Maserati Light in the 2005 [[Italian GT Championship]].\n\n[[File:AF Corse F430.jpg|thumb|left|One of AF Corse's [[Ferrari F430]] GT2s]]\n\nAF Corse returned to the FIA GT Championship in 2006.  This time however they would be running the latest Ferrari offering, the [[Ferrari F430]], as well as competing in the series' lower category, the GT2 class.  Salo was retained in the driving line-up, while newcomers [[Rui \u00c1guas (racing driver)|Rui \u00c1guas]], [[Jaime Melo]], and [[Matteo Bobbi]] completed the standard line-up.  Victory was earned in the teams debut at [[2006 FIA GT Tourist Trophy|Silverstone]], and another two were earned over the season, including at the [[Spa 24 Hours]].  AF Corse won the class championship, beating fellow Ferrari competitor Scuderia Ecosse.<ref name=\"2006 Champions\">{{cite web | url = http://www.fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2006 | title = 2006 Champions | publisher = [[FIA GT Championship]] | accessdate = 2008-03-24| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080327221242/http://fiagt.com/champions.php?season=2006| archive-date= 27 March 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status= live}}</ref>  The company retained their connection to Maserati however, entering a trio of cars in the new [[FIA GT3 European Championship]].\n\nAs defending champions, AF Corse remained in the FIA GT Championship in 2007, although much on the team changed.  While the Ferrari F430s remained, all new drivers were introduced to the team.  [[Dirk M\u00fcller (racing driver)|Dirk M\u00fcller]], [[Toni Vilander]], [[Gianmaria Bruni]], and [[Stephane Ortelli]] took over driving duties for the season, while [[Motorola]] announced their full sponsorship of the squad.  The two cars dominated the [[2007 FIA GT Championship season|2007 season]], winning nine of the ten events on the schedule and wrapping up another championship.<ref name=\"2007 Champions\" />\n\nFor 2008, AF Corse expanded to a three car team in the GT2 class.  Vilander and Bruni are retained in the lead car, while Biagi returns to the squad to be joined by Christian Montanari in the second entry.  The third car will be run under the Advanced Engineering name, with [[Argentinian]] [[Mat\u00edas Russo]] and [[Lu\u00eds P\u00e9rez Companc]].\n\n[[File:51 AF Corse 01 1600.jpg|thumb|right|AF Corse's Ferrari F458 Italia GT2 at [[Zhuhai International Circuit]].]]\n\nIn 2010, the [[FIA GT Championship]] was dissolved and two new championships were born from it. The GT1 class of the former series became the [[FIA GT1 World Championship]] while the GT2 class formed the [[FIA GT2 European Championship]]. The GT2 series was suspended due to lack of entries. As a result, the AF Corse team joined the [[Le Mans Series]]. For the [[2010 Le Mans Series season|2010 season]], the team fielded three Ferrari F430 GT2s for the series' GT2 class. Drivers [[Mat\u00edas Russo]] and [[Lu\u00eds P\u00e9rez Companc]] campaigned the #94 Ferrari with [[Toni Vilander]] and former Grand Prix drivers [[Jean Alesi]] and [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] in the #95. [[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]] regulars, with the [[Risi Competizione]] team, [[Jaime Melo]] and [[Gianmaria Bruni]] drove the Ferrari #96.\n\nIn 2011 AF Corse entered the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] with brand new Ferrari 458 Italia GT2s as well as the [[FIA GT3 European Championship]] with Ferrari 458 Italia GT3s. AF Corse won the ILMC in the GTE-Pro category, including the final round at [[Petit Le Mans]]. It also won the FIA GT3 driver's championship with [[Francisco Catellaci]] and [[Federico Leo]].\n\nThe team also joined the [[International GT Open]] for the [[2010 International GT Open season|2010 season]] in the Super GT class, which is largely reminiscent of the GT2 rules in the [[Le Mans Series]]. The team fields two Ferrari GT2 cars for drivers [[Jack Gerber]] & [[Rui \u00c1guas (racing driver)|Rui \u00c1guas]] in the #6 car and [[Pierre Kaffer]] and [[\u00c1lvaro Barba]] in the #8 Ferrari. AF Corse will also field a third Ferrari (#7) for the [[AT Racing]] team with drivers [[Alexander Talkanitsa]] and his son [[Alexander Talkanitsa Jr]].\n\nFor 2012, AF Corse competed in a variety of sports car championships throughout Europe and globally, including the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]] and [[GT1 World Championship]] with Ferrari F458 Italia GT2s and Ferrari F458 Italia GT3s, including a co-branded for GTE-Am class car with [[Michael Waltrip Racing]], AF Waltrip.  At the 24 Hours of Le Mans, amateur driver [[Piergiuseppe Perazzini]] collided with the No. 8 Toyota driven by overall-contender [[Anthony Davidson]], sending the Toyota airborne at the Mulsanne Corner.  Perazzini's Ferrari also flipped and landed on its roof after hitting the tyre barrier. Davidson suffered two broken vertebrae in the crash but was able to pull himself from the car in the immediate aftermath of the accident - though of course he was forced to abandon the race.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/motorsport/18474792 | title = Anthony Davidson breaks back after Le Mans 24 Hour accident | publisher = [[BBC]] | work = [[BBC Sport]] | date = 17 June 2012 | accessdate =25 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===24 Hours of Le Mans results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

The show had an [[ensemble cast]] that featured [[Bob Denver]], [[Alan Hale Jr.]], [[Jim Backus]], [[Natalie Schafer]], [[Russell Johnson]], [[Tina Louise]], and [[Dawn Wells]]. It aired for three seasons on the [[CBS]] network from September 26, 1964, to April 17, 1967. The series followed the comic adventures of seven castaways as they attempted to survive on an island on which they had been shipwrecked. Most episodes revolve around the dissimilar castaways' conflicts and their unsuccessful attempts, for whose failure Gilligan was frequently responsible, to escape their plight.<ref name = \"GI Me\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metvnetwork.com/shows/gilligans-island|title=MeTV Network - Shows - Gilligan's Island|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''Gilligan's Island'' ran for 98 episodes. All thirty-six episodes of the first season were filmed in black and white and were later [[Film colorization|colorized]] for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. The show's second and third seasons (62 episodes) and the three television movie sequels (aired between 1978 and 1982) were filmed in color.\n\nThe show received solid ratings during its original run, then grew in popularity during decades of syndication, especially in the 1970s and 1980s when many markets ran the show in the late afternoon. Today, the title character of [[Gilligan]] is widely recognized as an American [[cultural icon]].\n\n==Premise==\nThe two-man crew of the charter boat [[S. S. Minnow|SS ''Minnow'']] and five passengers on a \"three-hour tour\" from [[Honolulu]] run into a tropical storm and are shipwrecked on an uncharted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Their efforts to be rescued are typically thwarted by the inadvertent conduct of the [[first mate]], Gilligan.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Gilligan's Island characters}}\n* [[Bob Denver]] as [[Gilligan (Gilligan's Island)|Gilligan]], the inept, accident-prone [[Chief mate|first mate]] of the S.S. ''Minnow''\n* [[Alan Hale Jr.]] as [[The Skipper|Captain Jonas \"The Skipper\" Grumby]], the [[Sea captain|captain]] of the S.S. ''Minnow''\n* [[Jim Backus]] as [[Thurston Howell III]], a [[Wall Street]] millionaire\n* [[Natalie Schafer]] as [[Lovey Howell|\"Lovey\" Wentworth-Howell]], Thurston's wife\n* [[Tina Louise]] as [[Ginger Grant]], a [[Hollywood]] [[Actor|movie star]]\n* [[Russell Johnson]] as [[The Professor (Gilligan's Island)|Professor Roy Hinkley, Ph.D.]] \n* [[Dawn Wells]] as [[Mary Ann Summers]], a wholesome farm-girl from Winfield Kansas who won the trip and tour in a lottery\n* [[Charles Maxwell (actor)|Charles Maxwell]] (uncredited) as the voice of the recurring radio announcer\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Gilligan's Island episodes}}\n{{:List of Gilligan's Island episodes}}\n\n===Pilot episode===\nThe [[television pilot|pilot episode]], titled \"Marooned\", was filmed in November 1963. The pilot featured seven characters (as in the series), but only four of the characters\u2014and their associated actors\u2014were carried forward into the series: Gilligan (Denver), the Skipper (Hale), and the Howells (Backus and Schafer).\n\nBecause of the three significant character and casting changes between the pilot episode and the first series episode, the pilot was not shown before the series first aired on September 26, 1964. The original pilot eventually aired over 29 years later on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]].\n\nThe three characters who did not carry forward from the pilot were two secretaries and a high school teacher. In the pilot, the scientifically inclined Professor was instead a high school teacher played by [[John Gabriel (actor)|John Gabriel]]. Ginger the movie star was still red-haired Ginger, but worked as a secretary, played by Kit Smythe. Mary Ann the Kansas farm girl was instead Bunny, Ginger's co-worker, played as a cheerful \"[[Blonde stereotype#Dumb blonde|dumb blonde]]\" by [[Nancy McCarthy]].\n\nThe pilot's opening and ending songs were two similar [[Calypso music|Calypso]]-styled tracks written by [[John Williams]] and performed by Sherwood Schwartz impersonating singer [[Sir Lancelot (singer)|Sir Lancelot]]. The lyrics of both were quite different from those of the TV series and the pilot's opening theme song was longer. The short scenes during this initial music include Gilligan taking the Howells' luggage to the boat before cast-off and Gilligan attempting to give a cup of coffee to the Skipper during the storm that would ultimately maroon the boat.\n\nAfter the opening theme song and credits end, the pilot proper begins with the seven castaways waking up on the beached SS ''Minnow'' and continues with them performing various tasks, including exploring the island, attempting to fix the transmitter, building huts, and finding food. Contrary to some descriptions, the pilot's [[narrative thread|storylines]] contained no detailed accounts of the pilot characters' backgrounds. The pilot concludes with the ending theme song and credits. The background music and even the [[laugh track]]s of the pilot appear all but identical to those used during the series.\n\n===First broadcast episode===\nThe first episode actually broadcast, \"Two on a Raft\", is sometimes wrongly referred to as the series pilot. This episode begins with the same scene of Gilligan and the Skipper awakening on the boat as in the pilot (though slightly differently cut, to eliminate most shots of the departed actors) and continues with the characters sitting on the beach listening to a radio news report about their disappearance. No equivalent scene or background information is in the pilot, except for the description of the passengers in the original theme song. Rather than reshooting the rest of the pilot story for broadcast, the show just proceeded on. The plot thus skips over the topics of the pilot; the bulk of the episode tells of Gilligan and the Skipper setting off on a raft to try to bring help, but unknowingly landing back on the other side of the same island.\n\nThe scene with the radio report is one of two scenes that reveal the names of the Skipper (Jonas Grumby) and the Professor (Roy Hinkley); the names are used in a similar radio report early in the series. The name Jonas Grumby appears nowhere else in the series except for an episode in which the Maritime Board of Review blames the Skipper for the loss of the ''Minnow''. The name Roy Hinkley is used one other time when Mr. Howell introduces the Professor as Roy Huntley and the professor corrects him, to which Mr. Howell replies, \"[[Huntley-Brinkley Report|Brinkley]], Brinkley.\"\n\nThe plot for the pilot episode was eventually recycled into that season's Christmas episode, \"Birds Gotta Fly, Fish Gotta Talk\", in which the story of the pilot episode, concerning the practical problems on landing, is related through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. Footage featuring characters that had been recast was reshot using the current actors. For scenes including only Denver, Hale, Backus, and Schafer, the original footage was reused.\n\n===Last broadcast episode===\nThe last episode of the show, \"[[Gilligan's Island (season 3)#Episodes|Gilligan the Goddess]]\", aired on April 17, 1967, and ended just like the rest, with the castaways still stranded on the island. It was not known at the time that it would be the series finale, as a fourth season was expected but then cancelled.{{Sfn | Stoddard | 1996 | pp = 306\u20137}}\n\nIn its last year, ''Gilligan's Island'' was the lead-in program for the CBS Monday night schedule. It was followed for the first 16 weeks by the sitcom ''[[Run, Buddy, Run]]''. The time slot from 7:30 to 8:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern was filled in the 1967\u20131968 season by ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', moved from its traditional Saturday 10&nbsp;p.m. time slot.\n\n==Typical plots==\nThe shipwrecked castaways desperately want to leave the remote island, and various opportunities frequently present themselves, but always fail, usually due to some bumbling error committed by Gilligan. Sometimes this would result in Gilligan saving the others from some unforeseen flaw in their plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metvnetwork.com/shows/gilligans-island/trivia|title=MeTV Network -|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMost episodes of ''Gilligan's Island'' used variations on five recurring basic plots:\n\n* Life on the island. A [[running gag]] is the castaways' ability to fashion a vast array of useful objects from [[bamboo]], [[gourds]], vines and other local materials. Some are simple everyday things, such as eating and cooking utensils, while others (such as a remarkably efficient [[lie detector]] apparatus) are stretches of the imagination (How the Professor was able to build all of these ingenious gadgets, but apparently unable to repair the damaged ''Minnow'' or construct a seaworthy raft is puzzling).  Russell Johnson noted in his autobiography that the production crew enjoyed the challenge of building these props. These bamboo items include [[Tiki culture|framed huts]] with thatched grass sides and roofs, along with bamboo closets strong enough to withstand hurricane-force winds and rain; the communal dining table and chairs, pipes for Gilligan's hot water, a [[stethoscope]], and a pedal-powered car.\n* Visitors to the uncharted island. Another challenge to a viewer's [[suspension of disbelief]] is the remarkable frequency with which the island is visited by an assortment of people who repeatedly fail to assist the castaways in leaving the island.\n* [[Dream sequence]]s in which one of the castaways dreams he or she is some character related to that week's storyline. All of the castaways appeared as other characters within the dream. In later interviews and memoirs, nearly all of the actors stated that the dream episodes were among their personal favorites.\n* A piece of news concerning the castaways arrives from the outside world via the radio and causes distress or discord among them.\n* The appearance or arrival of strange objects to the island, such as a [[World War II]] [[naval mine]], a radio that had been swallowed by a fish, a crate of radioactive vegetable seeds, [[plastic explosives]], a [[robot]], a live [[lion]],  a [[Jet pack]], or a \"Mars Rover\" that the scientists back in the United States think is sending them pictures of [[Mars]].\n\nMost of the slapstick comedic sequences between Hale and Denver were heavily inspired by [[Laurel and Hardy]], particularly by Hale breaking the [[fourth wall]] by looking directly into the camera expressing his frustration with Denver's clumsiness as [[Oliver Hardy]] often did.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/arts/television/07denver.html | title = Denver | newspaper = The New York Times | date = September 7, 2005}}.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe show was filmed at the [[CBS]] [[CBS Studio Center|Radford Studios]] complex in [[Studio City, Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/TVstudios/CBSstudioCenter.shtml |title=CBS Studio Center |publisher=Seeing-stars.com |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref> The same stage was later used for ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and ''[[Roseanne]]'', which featured ''Gilligan's Island'' prominently on one episode. The lagoon was drained and used as a parking lot during the show's off-season and was the last surviving element of the show when it was demolished in 1997 as part of an expansion project.<ref>{{cite web|last1=WALSTAD|first1=DAVID|title=Civilization Takes Over 'Gilligan's' Lagoon :  Television: The set of the 1960s sitcom is turned into an employee parking lot as CBS Studio Center adds production facilities.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-07/entertainment/ca-32412_1_cbs-studio-center|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=February 4, 2017|date=August 7, 1995}}</ref>\n\nFour boats played the part of the SS ''Minnow''. One was used in the opening credits and rented in Ala Wai Yacht Harbor in [[Honolulu]]. Another boat, the ''Bluejacket'', was used in the opening credits shown during the second and third seasons and eventually turned up for sale on [[Vancouver Island]] in August 2006, after running aground on a reef in the [[Hecate Strait]] on the way south from Alaska. One boat was used for beach scenes after being towed to [[Kauai]] in Hawaii. The fourth ''Minnow'' was built on the CBS Studios set in the second season.<ref name=\"CBC Arts\">{{cite news| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2006/08/28/minnow-sale.html| title = Gilligan's Minnow no longer lost| publisher = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]| accessdate = August 28, 2006| date=August 28, 2006}}</ref> The ''Minnow'' was named in reference to [[Newton N.

Retrieved on November 6, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard]] occasionally received telegrams from concerned citizens, who apparently did not realize it was a scripted show, pleading for them to rescue the people on the deserted island. The Coast Guard simply forwarded these telegrams to producer Sherwood Schwartz.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medialit.org/reading-room/escape-gilligans-island |title=Escape From Gilligan's Island |author=Fore, William F|year=1987 |work=medialit.org |publisher= |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref> In homage to those telegrams, the film ''Rescue from Gilligan's Island'' showed the successful rescue where Gilligan lights a fire aboard the castaways' makeshift raft and is chastised for a thoughtless, dangerous action by the others. However, the resultant smoke attracts the attention of a US Coast Guard helicopter, whose pilot commends Gilligan's fire; otherwise, the castaways would have been adrift and unnoticed.\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Bob Denver]] was not the first choice to play Gilligan; actor [[Jerry Van Dyke]] was offered the role, but he turned it down, believing that the show would never be successful. He chose instead to play the lead in ''[[My Mother the Car]]'', which premiered the following year (and is generally considered to be one of the worst TV programs of all time) and was canceled after one season. The producers looked to Bob Denver, the actor who had played [[Maynard G. Krebs]], the goofy but lovable [[beatnik]] in ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Natalie Schafer]] had it written into her contract that no close-ups would be made of her, but after a while in the series it was forgotten. Schafer was 63 when the pilot was shot, although reportedly no one on the set or in the cast knew her real age and she refused to divulge it. Originally, she only accepted the role because the pilot was filmed on location in Hawaii. She looked at the job as nothing more than a free vacation, as she was convinced that a show this silly would \"never go\".{{Sfn | Stoddard | 1996 | p = 190}}\n\n[[Tina Louise]] clashed with producer Sherwood Schwartz because she believed that she was hired as the central character. Her character was originally written as a hard-nosed, sharp-tongued temptress, but Louise argued that this portrayal was too harsh and refused to play it as written. A compromise was reached; Louise agreed to play her as a [[Marilyn Monroe]]/[[Jayne Mansfield]] type. Her Diva-like attitude and egotistical manner made her difficult to work with, but to her credit, when it came time to shoot she was a professional and did her job. Louise continued to clash with producers over her role and was the only cast member who refused to return for any of the post-series TV movies, saying that the role had killed her career as a serious actress. She did, however, appear in a reunion of the cast on a late-night television talk show in 1988 and on an episode of ''[[Roseanne]]'' in 1995 when the ''Roseanne'' cast re-enacted ''Gilligan's Island''. In the pilot episode, the character of Ginger was played by actress Kit Smythe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[John Gabriel (actor)|John Gabriel]] was originally cast as the Professor, but the network thought he looked too young to have all the degrees attributed to the character. [[Russell Johnson]], who served as a bombardier in the Pacific during World War II, stated that he had some difficulty remembering his more technically oriented lines. Originally, he was not interested in the role and was waiting for a TV show of his own, but his agent talked him into auditioning.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Dawn Wells]] was a former [[Miss Nevada]] when she auditioned for the Mary Ann role. Her competition included [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Pat Priest (actress)|Pat Priest]]. The pilot episode featured a different character (\"Bunny\") played by actress [[Nancy McCarthy]]. After it was shot, the network decided to recast the roles of the Professor and the two young women. Mary Ann became a simple farm girl from [[Winfield, Kansas]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Theme song===\nThe music and lyrics for the theme song, \"The Ballad of Gilligan\u2019s Isle\", were written by Sherwood Schwartz and [[George Wyle]]. One version was used for the first season and another for the second and third seasons. In the original song, the Professor and Mary Ann, originally considered \"second-billed co-stars\", were referred to as \"the rest\", but with the growing popularity of those characters, their names were inserted into the lyrics in the second season. The ''Gilligan'' theme song underwent this one major change because star Bob Denver personally asked studio executives to add Johnson and Wells to the song.<ref name=\"shales\">{{Citation | first = Tom | last = Shales | title = Hey, little buddy!

The TV series [[ALF (TV series)|ALF]] had a 2-part episode \"Somewhere Over the Rerun\"/\"The Ballad of Gilligan's Island\" in which ALF dreams he's on Gilligan's Island; guest stars Bob Denver; Alan Hale; Dawn Wells; and Russell Johnson reprise their Gilligan Island roles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Cancellation==\nDuring the 1966\u20131967 television season, ''Gilligan's Island'' aired on Monday nights at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Though the sitcom's ratings had fallen well out of the top-30 programs, during the last few weeks of its third season, the series was still winning its timeslot against its main competition, ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'', which aired at the same time on [[NBC]]-TV. Therefore, CBS assured Sherwood Schwartz that ''Gilligan's Island'' would definitely be picked up for a fourth year.\n\nCBS, however, had signaled its intention to cancel the long-running Western series ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', which had been airing late on Saturday nights during the 1966\u20131967 TV season. Under pressure from CBS network president [[William S. Paley]] and his wife Babe (''Gunsmoke'' was reportedly her favorite program) along with many network affiliates and longtime fans of ''Gunsmoke'', CBS rescheduled the Western to an earlier time slot on Monday evenings at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. As a result, ''Gilligan's Island'' was quietly canceled at practically the last minute, while most of the cast members were away on vacation. Some of the cast had even bought houses nearer the set, based on Sherwood Schwartz's verbal confirmation that the series would be renewed for a fourth season.{{Sfn | Stoddard | 1996 | p = 306}}\n\n==Nielsen ratings/television schedule==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Season\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Ep#\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Season premiere\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Season finale\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Time slot\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n!

During a reunion cruise on the first Christmas after their rescue, fate intervenes and they find themselves wrecked on the same island at the end of the film. It starred the original cast, except for Tina Louise, who refused to participate because of her disputes with the producers and who was replaced by [[Judith Baldwin]]. The plot involved Soviet agents seeking a memory disc from a spy satellite that landed on the island and facilitated their rescue.\n\nIn a 1979 sequel, ''[[The Castaways on Gilligan's Island]]'', they are rescued once again, and the Howells convert the island into a getaway resort with the other five castaways as \"silent partners\". Ginger was again played by Judith Baldwin.\n\nIn a second sequel, ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island]]'' (1981), villains played by [[Martin Landau]] and then-wife [[Barbara Bain]] try to take over the island to gain access to a vein of \"supremium\", a valuable but volatile [[fictional element]]. This time, Ginger was played by [[Constance Forslund]]. They are thwarted by the timely intervention of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. [[Jim Backus]], who was in poor health at the time, was written out of the script by saying Thurston Howell III was tending to Howell Industries back on the mainland. [[David Ruprecht]] played the role of his son, Thurston Howell IV, who was asked to manage the resort. However, Backus insisted on keeping continuity, and made a cameo appearance at the end of the film.\n\n==Spin-offs and timelines==\n''[[The New Adventures of Gilligan]]'' was a [[Filmation]]-produced animated remake that aired on ABC on Saturday mornings from September 7, 1974, to September 4, 1977, for 24 episodes (16 installments airing in 1974\u201375 and eight new ones combined with repeats in 1975\u201376). The voices were provided by the original cast except for Ginger and Mary Ann (both were voiced by [[Jane Webb]]). Dawn Wells could not participate because she was in an on-the-road play.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} An additional character was Gilligan's pet, Snubby the [[Monkey]].\n\n''[[Gilligan's Planet]]'' was an animated science-fiction version produced by Filmation and starring the voices of the ''Gilligan's Island'' cast, save for Tina Louise (Dawn Wells voiced both Mary Ann and Ginger). In a follow-up to ''The New Adventures of Gilligan'', the castaways escape from the island by building a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]], and get shipwrecked on a distant planet. Only 12 episodes aired on CBS between September 18, 1982, and September 3, 1983. In the episode \"Let Sleeping Minnows Lie\", they travel to an island, get shipwrecked there, and Gilligan observes, \"First we were stranded on an island, then we were stranded on a planet, and now we're stranded on an island on a planet.\"\n\n==Reunions and documentaries==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n''[[Good Morning America]]'' featured a ''Gilligan's Island'' reunion presided over by guest host [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] on November 26, 1982. The entire cast was present, except for Jim Backus who was unable to attend but appeared via a live video remote from Los Angeles.\n\nAll seven of the original cast members (along with Sherwood Schwartz) reunited on television for one last time on a 1988 episode of ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'' with [[Ross Shafer]].\n\n''Gilligan's Island: Underneath the Grass Skirt'' is a 1999 documentary featuring Denver and Louise.\n\n''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'' presented a backstage history of the show in 2000, featuring interviews with some of the stars or their widows.\n\n''[[Surviving Gilligan's Island]]'' (2001) was a [[docudrama]] in which Bob Denver, Dawn Wells, and Russell Johnson reminisce about the show.\n\n==Related productions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n* ''Gilligan's Island: The Musical'' was first produced in the early 1990s, with a script by Lloyd Schwartz, Sherwood Schwartz's son, and songs by Schwartz's daughter and son-in-law, Hope and [[Laurence Juber]].\n* ''[[Gilligan's Wake]]'' is a 2003 parallel novel loosely based on the 1960s CBS sitcom, from the viewpoints of the seven major characters, written by ''Esquire'' film and television critic Tom Carson. The title is derived from the title of the TV show and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', the seminal work of Irish novelist James Joyce.\n* On November 30, 2004, the TBS network launched a reality series titled ''[[The Real Gilligan's Island]]'', which placed two groups of people on an island, leaving them to fend for themselves in the manner of ''[[Survivor (franchise)|Survivor]]''&nbsp;\u2013 the catch being that each islander matched a character type established in the original series (a klutz, a sea captain, a movie star, a millionaire's wife, etc.). While heavily [[marketing|marketed]] by TBS, the show turned out to be a flop with a very ''Survivor''-like feel, but little of its success. A second season began June 8, 2005, with two-hour episodes for four weeks. TBS announced in July 2005 that a third season of the show would not be produced.\n\n==Syndication==\nSyndication is handled by [[Warner Bros. Television]] (under [[Turner Entertainment Co.]], which in 1986 acquired [[United Artists Television]]'s share of the series as part of the classic pre-1986 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] library). It has aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] from 1990 to 2003, where it also aired with colorization on season one for a while. [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] aired it at some point in the 1990s, and also aired the colorized season one. [[Nick at Nite]] later aired the series from 2000 to 2001. It then shifted to [[TV Land]], where it aired from 2001 to 2003 (and again from January to June 2014). Then, in 2004, it aired on [[Hallmark Channel]].\n\nAs of 2015, the show aired nationally on both [[TV Land]] and [[MeTV]].<ref name = \"GI Me\" />\n\nWarner/Turner also handles the two Filmation-produced animated sequel series. The three TV movie sequels are handled by other companies.\n\nIn the UK Gilligan's Island had a very brief run on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in April 1965  but was dropped after 13 episodes.\n\n==Home media==\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all three seasons of ''Gilligan's Island'' on DVD in Region 1 between 2004 and 2005. ''The Complete First Season'' features all 36 episodes unedited with the original theme song. And, unlike other releases of older sitcoms, the episodes are in their original black-and-white format. The special features include the rare pilot episode with commentary with creator Sherwood Schwartz and three other featurettes.\n\n''The Complete Second Season'' includes all 32 season-two episodes in color. Bonuses for this set include: a season-two introduction with Russell Johnson and Sherwood Schwartz and audio commentary on the season's third episode, \"[[List of Gilligan's Island episodes#Season 2|The Little Dictator]]\".\n\n''The Complete Third Season'' includes all 30 season-three episodes. Special features include a season introduction with Russell Johnson and Sherwood Schwartz, commentary on the season's fourth episode, \"[[The Producer]]\", guest-starring [[Phil Silvers]], and a 15-minute documentary entitled ''Gilligan's Island: A Pop Culture Phenomenon''.\n\n''The Complete Series Collection'' contains all the same bonuses and featurettes, no added features for a complete series box set. In April 2012, the series was reissued in new DVD releases.\n\nThe series is also available at the [[iTunes Store]].<ref name=\"iTunes Store download\">{{cite web|title=Gilligan's Island: The Complete Series|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/gilligans-island-the-complete-series/id1272284481|publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (US)|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!DVD name\n!Ep#\n!Release date\n|-\n|''The Complete First Season''\n| 36\n| February 3, 2004\n|-\n|''The Complete Second Season''\n| 32\n| January 11, 2005\n|-\n|''The Complete Third Season''\n| 30\n| July 26, 2005\n|-\n|''The Complete Series Collection''\n| 98\n| November 6, 2007\n|}\n\n==Digitally remastered in high definition==\nIn August 2006, an executive at Warner Bros. announced plans that ''Gilligan's Island'', in addition to other classic TV series owned by the studio, would be digitally re-mastered in HD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/08/18/gilligans-island-coming-to-hd/|title=\"Gilligan's Island\" coming to HD?|publisher=}}</ref> The original TV series was shot on high-resolution film but scaled down for broadcast.\n\nOn January 20, 2014, [[TV Land]] became the first network to air theatrical-style widescreen HD remastered episodes of ''Gilligan's Island''.

The show had an [[ensemble cast]] that featured [[Bob Denver]], [[Alan Hale Jr.]], [[Jim Backus]], [[Natalie Schafer]], [[Russell Johnson]], [[Tina Louise]], and [[Dawn Wells]]. It aired for three seasons on the [[CBS]] network from September 26, 1964, to April 17, 1967. The series followed the comic adventures of seven castaways as they attempted to survive on an island on which they had been shipwrecked. Most episodes revolve around the dissimilar castaways' conflicts and their unsuccessful attempts, for whose failure Gilligan was frequently responsible, to escape their plight.<ref name = \"GI Me\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metvnetwork.com/shows/gilligans-island|title=MeTV Network - Shows - Gilligan's Island|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''Gilligan's Island'' ran for 98 episodes. All thirty-six episodes of the first season were filmed in black and white and were later [[Film colorization|colorized]] for [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. The show's second and third seasons (62 episodes) and the three television movie sequels (aired between 1978 and 1982) were filmed in color.\n\nThe show received solid ratings during its original run, then grew in popularity during decades of syndication, especially in the 1970s and 1980s when many markets ran the show in the late afternoon. Today, the title character of [[Gilligan]] is widely recognized as an American [[cultural icon]].\n\n==Premise==\nThe two-man crew of the charter boat [[S. S. Minnow|SS ''Minnow'']] and five passengers on a \"three-hour tour\" from [[Honolulu]] run into a tropical storm and are shipwrecked on an uncharted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Their efforts to be rescued are typically thwarted by the inadvertent conduct of the [[first mate]], Gilligan.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Gilligan's Island characters}}\n* [[Bob Denver]] as [[Gilligan (Gilligan's Island)|Gilligan]], the inept, accident-prone [[Chief mate|first mate]] of the S.S. ''Minnow''\n* [[Alan Hale Jr.]] as [[The Skipper|Captain Jonas \"The Skipper\" Grumby]], the [[Sea captain|captain]] of the S.S. ''Minnow''\n* [[Jim Backus]] as [[Thurston Howell III]], a [[Wall Street]] millionaire\n* [[Natalie Schafer]] as [[Lovey Howell|\"Lovey\" Wentworth-Howell]], Thurston's wife\n* [[Tina Louise]] as [[Ginger Grant]], a [[Hollywood]] [[Actor|movie star]]\n* [[Russell Johnson]] as [[The Professor (Gilligan's Island)|Professor Roy Hinkley, Ph.D.]] \n* [[Dawn Wells]] as [[Mary Ann Summers]], a wholesome farm-girl from Winfield Kansas who won the trip and tour in a lottery\n* [[Charles Maxwell (actor)|Charles Maxwell]] (uncredited) as the voice of the recurring radio announcer\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Gilligan's Island episodes}}\n{{:List of Gilligan's Island episodes}}\n\n===Pilot episode===\nThe [[television pilot|pilot episode]], titled \"Marooned\", was filmed in November 1963. The pilot featured seven characters (as in the series), but only four of the characters\u2014and their associated actors\u2014were carried forward into the series: Gilligan (Denver), the Skipper (Hale), and the Howells (Backus and Schafer).\n\nBecause of the three significant character and casting changes between the pilot episode and the first series episode, the pilot was not shown before the series first aired on September 26, 1964. The original pilot eventually aired over 29 years later on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]].\n\nThe three characters who did not carry forward from the pilot were two secretaries and a high school teacher. In the pilot, the scientifically inclined Professor was instead a high school teacher played by [[John Gabriel (actor)|John Gabriel]]. Ginger the movie star was still red-haired Ginger, but worked as a secretary, played by Kit Smythe. Mary Ann the Kansas farm girl was instead Bunny, Ginger's co-worker, played as a cheerful \"[[Blonde stereotype#Dumb blonde|dumb blonde]]\" by [[Nancy McCarthy]].\n\nThe pilot's opening and ending songs were two similar [[Calypso music|Calypso]]-styled tracks written by [[John Williams]] and performed by Sherwood Schwartz impersonating singer [[Sir Lancelot (singer)|Sir Lancelot]]. The lyrics of both were quite different from those of the TV series and the pilot's opening theme song was longer. The short scenes during this initial music include Gilligan taking the Howells' luggage to the boat before cast-off and Gilligan attempting to give a cup of coffee to the Skipper during the storm that would ultimately maroon the boat.\n\nAfter the opening theme song and credits end, the pilot proper begins with the seven castaways waking up on the beached SS ''Minnow'' and continues with them performing various tasks, including exploring the island, attempting to fix the transmitter, building huts, and finding food. Contrary to some descriptions, the pilot's [[narrative thread|storylines]] contained no detailed accounts of the pilot characters' backgrounds. The pilot concludes with the ending theme song and credits. The background music and even the [[laugh track]]s of the pilot appear all but identical to those used during the series.\n\n===First broadcast episode===\nThe first episode actually broadcast, \"Two on a Raft\", is sometimes wrongly referred to as the series pilot. This episode begins with the same scene of Gilligan and the Skipper awakening on the boat as in the pilot (though slightly differently cut, to eliminate most shots of the departed actors) and continues with the characters sitting on the beach listening to a radio news report about their disappearance. No equivalent scene or background information is in the pilot, except for the description of the passengers in the original theme song. Rather than reshooting the rest of the pilot story for broadcast, the show just proceeded on. The plot thus skips over the topics of the pilot; the bulk of the episode tells of Gilligan and the Skipper setting off on a raft to try to bring help, but unknowingly landing back on the other side of the same island.\n\nThe scene with the radio report is one of two scenes that reveal the names of the Skipper (Jonas Grumby) and the Professor (Roy Hinkley); the names are used in a similar radio report early in the series. The name Jonas Grumby appears nowhere else in the series except for an episode in which the Maritime Board of Review blames the Skipper for the loss of the ''Minnow''. The name Roy Hinkley is used one other time when Mr. Howell introduces the Professor as Roy Huntley and the professor corrects him, to which Mr. Howell replies, \"[[Huntley-Brinkley Report|Brinkley]], Brinkley.\"\n\nThe plot for the pilot episode was eventually recycled into that season's Christmas episode, \"Birds Gotta Fly, Fish Gotta Talk\", in which the story of the pilot episode, concerning the practical problems on landing, is related through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]]. Footage featuring characters that had been recast was reshot using the current actors. For scenes including only Denver, Hale, Backus, and Schafer, the original footage was reused.\n\n===Last broadcast episode===\nThe last episode of the show, \"[[Gilligan's Island (season 3)#Episodes|Gilligan the Goddess]]\", aired on April 17, 1967, and ended just like the rest, with the castaways still stranded on the island. It was not known at the time that it would be the series finale, as a fourth season was expected but then cancelled.{{Sfn | Stoddard | 1996 | pp = 306\u20137}}\n\nIn its last year, ''Gilligan's Island'' was the lead-in program for the CBS Monday night schedule. It was followed for the first 16 weeks by the sitcom ''[[Run, Buddy, Run]]''. The time slot from 7:30 to 8:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern was filled in the 1967\u20131968 season by ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', moved from its traditional Saturday 10&nbsp;p.m. time slot.\n\n==Typical plots==\nThe shipwrecked castaways desperately want to leave the remote island, and various opportunities frequently present themselves, but always fail, usually due to some bumbling error committed by Gilligan. Sometimes this would result in Gilligan saving the others from some unforeseen flaw in their plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metvnetwork.com/shows/gilligans-island/trivia|title=MeTV Network -|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMost episodes of ''Gilligan's Island'' used variations on five recurring basic plots:\n\n* Life on the island. A [[running gag]] is the castaways' ability to fashion a vast array of useful objects from [[bamboo]], [[gourds]], vines and other local materials. Some are simple everyday things, such as eating and cooking utensils, while others (such as a remarkably efficient [[lie detector]] apparatus) are stretches of the imagination (How the Professor was able to build all of these ingenious gadgets, but apparently unable to repair the damaged ''Minnow'' or construct a seaworthy raft is puzzling).  Russell Johnson noted in his autobiography that the production crew enjoyed the challenge of building these props. These bamboo items include [[Tiki culture|framed huts]] with thatched grass sides and roofs, along with bamboo closets strong enough to withstand hurricane-force winds and rain; the communal dining table and chairs, pipes for Gilligan's hot water, a [[stethoscope]], and a pedal-powered car.\n* Visitors to the uncharted island. Another challenge to a viewer's [[suspension of disbelief]] is the remarkable frequency with which the island is visited by an assortment of people who repeatedly fail to assist the castaways in leaving the island.\n* [[Dream sequence]]s in which one of the castaways dreams he or she is some character related to that week's storyline. All of the castaways appeared as other characters within the dream. In later interviews and memoirs, nearly all of the actors stated that the dream episodes were among their personal favorites.\n* A piece of news concerning the castaways arrives from the outside world via the radio and causes distress or discord among them.\n* The appearance or arrival of strange objects to the island, such as a [[World War II]] [[naval mine]], a radio that had been swallowed by a fish, a crate of radioactive vegetable seeds, [[plastic explosives]], a [[robot]], a live [[lion]],  a [[Jet pack]], or a \"Mars Rover\" that the scientists back in the United States think is sending them pictures of [[Mars]].\n\nMost of the slapstick comedic sequences between Hale and Denver were heavily inspired by [[Laurel and Hardy]], particularly by Hale breaking the [[fourth wall]] by looking directly into the camera expressing his frustration with Denver's clumsiness as [[Oliver Hardy]] often did.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/arts/television/07denver.html | title = Denver | newspaper = The New York Times | date = September 7, 2005}}.</ref>\n\n==Production==\nThe show was filmed at the [[CBS]] [[CBS Studio Center|Radford Studios]] complex in [[Studio City, Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seeing-stars.com/TVstudios/CBSstudioCenter.shtml |title=CBS Studio Center |publisher=Seeing-stars.com |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref> The same stage was later used for ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and ''[[Roseanne]]'', which featured ''Gilligan's Island'' prominently on one episode. The lagoon was drained and used as a parking lot during the show's off-season and was the last surviving element of the show when it was demolished in 1997 as part of an expansion project.<ref>{{cite web|last1=WALSTAD|first1=DAVID|title=Civilization Takes Over 'Gilligan's' Lagoon :  Television: The set of the 1960s sitcom is turned into an employee parking lot as CBS Studio Center adds production facilities.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-08-07/entertainment/ca-32412_1_cbs-studio-center|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=February 4, 2017|date=August 7, 1995}}</ref>\n\nFour boats played the part of the SS ''Minnow''. One was used in the opening credits and rented in Ala Wai Yacht Harbor in [[Honolulu]]. Another boat, the ''Bluejacket'', was used in the opening credits shown during the second and third seasons and eventually turned up for sale on [[Vancouver Island]] in August 2006, after running aground on a reef in the [[Hecate Strait]] on the way south from Alaska. One boat was used for beach scenes after being towed to [[Kauai]] in Hawaii. The fourth ''Minnow'' was built on the CBS Studios set in the second season.<ref name=\"CBC Arts\">{{cite news| url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2006/08/28/minnow-sale.html| title = Gilligan's Minnow no longer lost| publisher = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]| accessdate = August 28, 2006| date=August 28, 2006}}</ref> The ''Minnow'' was named in reference to [[Newton N. Minow|Newton Minow]], chairman of the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]], in response to Minow's landmark 1961 speech \"[[Television and the Public Interest]]\"; the speech lambasted television producers for producing, among other things, \"formula comedies about totally unbelievable\" characters (not unlike ''Gilligan's Island'') and creating a \"vast wasteland\" of bad television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/jarvis.htm|title=Legal Tales from Gilligan's Island|publisher=Santa Clara Law Review & Jamail Center for Legal Research | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828151410/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/jarvis.htm | archive-date=August 28, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nThe final day of filming the pilot was Friday, November 22, 1963, the day of the [[Assassination of John F.

The Coast Guard simply forwarded these telegrams to producer Sherwood Schwartz.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medialit.org/reading-room/escape-gilligans-island |title=Escape From Gilligan's Island |author=Fore, William F|year=1987 |work=medialit.org |publisher= |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref> In homage to those telegrams, the film ''Rescue from Gilligan's Island'' showed the successful rescue where Gilligan lights a fire aboard the castaways' makeshift raft and is chastised for a thoughtless, dangerous action by the others. However, the resultant smoke attracts the attention of a US Coast Guard helicopter, whose pilot commends Gilligan's fire; otherwise, the castaways would have been adrift and unnoticed.\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[Bob Denver]] was not the first choice to play Gilligan; actor [[Jerry Van Dyke]] was offered the role, but he turned it down, believing that the show would never be successful. He chose instead to play the lead in ''[[My Mother the Car]]'', which premiered the following year and was canceled after one season. The producers looked to Bob Denver, the actor who had played [[Maynard G. Krebs]], the goofy but lovable [[beatnik]] in ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Natalie Schafer]] had it written into her contract that no close-ups would be made of her, but after a while in the series it was forgotten. Schafer was 63 when the pilot was shot, although reportedly no one on the set or in the cast knew her real age and she refused to divulge it. Originally, she only accepted the role because the pilot was filmed on location in Hawaii. She looked at the job as nothing more than a free vacation, as she was convinced that a show this silly would \"never go\".{{Sfn | Stoddard | 1996 | p = 190}}\n\n[[Tina Louise]] clashed with producer Sherwood Schwartz because she believed that she was hired as the central character. Her character was originally written as a hard-nosed, sharp-tongued temptress, but Louise argued that this portrayal was too harsh and refused to play it as written. A compromise was reached; Louise agreed to play her as a [[Marilyn Monroe]]/[[Jayne Mansfield]] type. Her Diva-like attitude and egotistical manner made her difficult to work with, but to her credit, when it came time to shoot she was a professional and did her job. Louise continued to clash with producers over her role and was the only cast member who refused to return for any of the post-series TV movies, saying that the role had killed her career as a serious actress. She did, however, appear in a reunion of the cast on a late-night television talk show in 1988 and on an episode of ''[[Roseanne]]'' in 1995 when the ''Roseanne'' cast re-enacted ''Gilligan's Island''. In the pilot episode, the character of Ginger was played by actress Kit Smythe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[John Gabriel (actor)|John Gabriel]] was originally cast as the Professor, but the network thought he looked too young to have all the degrees attributed to the character. [[Russell Johnson]], who served as a bombardier in the Pacific during World War II, stated that he had some difficulty remembering his more technically oriented lines. Originally, he was not interested in the role and was waiting for a TV show of his own, but his agent talked him into auditioning.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n[[Dawn Wells]] was a former [[Miss Nevada]] when she auditioned for the Mary Ann role. Her competition included [[Raquel Welch]] and [[Pat Priest (actress)|Pat Priest]]. The pilot episode featured a different character (\"Bunny\") played by actress [[Nancy McCarthy]]. After it was shot, the network decided to recast the roles of the Professor and the two young women. Mary Ann became a simple farm girl from [[Winfield, Kansas]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Theme song===\nThe music and lyrics for the theme song, \"The Ballad of Gilligan\u2019s Isle\", were written by Sherwood Schwartz and [[George Wyle]]. One version was used for the first season and another for the second and third seasons. In the original song, the Professor and Mary Ann, originally considered \"second-billed co-stars\", were referred to as \"the rest\", but with the growing popularity of those characters, their names were inserted into the lyrics in the second season. The ''Gilligan'' theme song underwent this one major change because star Bob Denver personally asked studio executives to add Johnson and Wells to the song.<ref name=\"shales\">{{Citation | first = Tom | last = Shales | title = Hey, little buddy! 'Gilligan' DVD drifts into port | newspaper = The Washington Post | date = February 8, 2004 | page = N1 | quote = To his credit, star Bob Denver lobbied Schwartz and others to change the lyrics to the theme song after the second season, so all the characters and not just most of them were listed. Instead of the chorus singing 'the movie star, and the rest,' they sang, 'the movie star, the professor and Mary Ann, here on Gilligan's isle!'}}</ref> When the studio at first refused, saying it would be too expensive to reshoot, Denver insisted, even going so far as to state that if Johnson and Wells were not included, he wanted his name out of the song as well.

Therefore, CBS assured Sherwood Schwartz that ''Gilligan's Island'' would definitely be picked up for a fourth year.\n\nCBS, however, had signaled its intention to cancel the long-running Western series ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', which had been airing late on Saturday nights during the 1966\u20131967 television season. Under pressure from CBS network president [[William S. Paley]] and his wife Babe, along with many network affiliates and longtime fans of ''Gunsmoke'', CBS rescheduled the Western to an earlier time slot on Monday evenings at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. As a result, ''Gilligan's Island'' was quietly canceled at practically the last minute, while the cast members were all on vacation. Some of the cast had bought houses near the set, based on Sherwood Schwartz's verbal confirmation that the series would be renewed for a fourth season.{{Sfn | Stoddard | 1996 | p = 306}}\n\n==Nielsen ratings/television schedule==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Season\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Ep#\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Season premiere\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Season finale\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Time slot\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n!

During a reunion cruise on the first Christmas after their rescue, fate intervenes and they find themselves wrecked on the same island at the end of the film. It starred the original cast, except for Tina Louise, who refused to participate because of her disputes with the producers and who was replaced by [[Judith Baldwin]]. The plot involved Soviet agents seeking a memory disc from a spy satellite that landed on the island and facilitated their rescue.\n\nIn a 1979 sequel, ''[[The Castaways on Gilligan's Island]]'', they are rescued once again, and the Howells convert the island into a getaway resort with the other five castaways as \"silent partners\". Ginger was again played by Judith Baldwin.\n\nIn a second sequel, ''[[The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island]]'' (1981), villains played by [[Martin Landau]] and then-wife [[Barbara Bain]] try to take over the island to gain access to a vein of \"supremium\", a valuable but volatile [[fictional element]]. This time, Ginger was played by [[Constance Forslund]]. They are thwarted by the timely intervention of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. [[Jim Backus]], who was in poor health at the time, was written out of the script by saying Thurston Howell III was tending to Howell Industries back on the mainland. [[David Ruprecht]] played the role of his son, Thurston Howell IV, who was asked to manage the resort. However, Backus insisted on keeping continuity, and made a cameo appearance at the end of the film.\n\n==Spin-offs and timelines==\n''[[The New Adventures of Gilligan]]'' was a [[Filmation]]-produced animated remake that aired on ABC on Saturday mornings from September 7, 1974, to September 4, 1977, for 24 episodes (16 installments airing in 1974\u201375 and eight new ones combined with repeats in 1975\u201376). The voices were provided by the original cast except for Ginger and Mary Ann (both were voiced by [[Jane Webb]]). Dawn Wells could not participate because she was in an on-the-road play.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} An additional character was Gilligan's pet, Snubby the [[Monkey]].\n\n''[[Gilligan's Planet]]'' was an animated science-fiction version produced by Filmation and starring the voices of the ''Gilligan's Island'' cast, save for Tina Louise (Dawn Wells voiced both Mary Ann and Ginger). In a follow-up to ''The New Adventures of Gilligan'', the castaways escape from the island by building a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]], and get shipwrecked on a distant planet. Only 12 episodes aired on CBS between September 18, 1982, and September 3, 1983. In the episode \"Let Sleeping Minnows Lie\", they travel to an island, get shipwrecked there, and Gilligan observes, \"First we were stranded on an island, then we were stranded on a planet, and now we're stranded on an island on a planet.\"\n\n==Reunions and documentaries==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n''[[Good Morning America]]'' featured a ''Gilligan's Island'' reunion presided over by guest host [[Kathie Lee Gifford]] on November 26, 1982. The entire cast was present, except for Jim Backus who was unable to attend but appeared via a live video remote from Los Angeles.\n\nAll seven of the original cast members (along with Sherwood Schwartz) reunited on television for one last time on a 1988 episode of ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'' with [[Ross Shafer]].\n\n''Gilligan's Island: Underneath the Grass Skirt'' is a 1999 documentary featuring Denver and Louise.\n\n''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'' presented a backstage history of the show in 2000, featuring interviews with some of the stars or their widows.\n\n''[[Surviving Gilligan's Island]]'' (2001) was a [[docudrama]] in which Bob Denver, Dawn Wells, and Russell Johnson reminisce about the show.\n\n==Related productions==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\n* ''Gilligan's Island: The Musical'' was first produced in the early 1990s, with a script by Lloyd Schwartz, Sherwood Schwartz's son, and songs by Schwartz's daughter and son-in-law, Hope and [[Laurence Juber]].\n* ''[[Gilligan's Wake]]'' is a 2003 parallel novel loosely based on the 1960s CBS sitcom, from the viewpoints of the seven major characters, written by ''Esquire'' film and television critic Tom Carson. The title is derived from the title of the TV show and ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', the seminal work of Irish novelist James Joyce.\n* On November 30, 2004, the TBS network launched a reality series titled ''[[The Real Gilligan's Island]]'', which placed two groups of people on an island, leaving them to fend for themselves in the manner of ''[[Survivor (franchise)|Survivor]]''&nbsp;\u2013 the catch being that each islander matched a character type established in the original series (a klutz, a sea captain, a movie star, a millionaire's wife, etc.). While heavily [[marketing|marketed]] by TBS, the show turned out to be a flop with a very ''Survivor''-like feel, but little of its success. A second season began June 8, 2005, with two-hour episodes for four weeks. TBS announced in July 2005 that a third season of the show would not be produced.\n\n==Syndication==\nSyndication is handled by [[Warner Bros. Television]] (under [[Turner Entertainment Co.]], which in 1986 acquired [[United Artists Television]]'s share of the series as part of the classic pre-1986 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] library). It has aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] from 1990 to 2003, where it also aired with colorization on season one for a while. [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] aired it at some point in the 1990s, and also aired the colorized season one. [[Nick at Nite]] later aired the series from 2000 to 2001. It then shifted to [[TV Land]], where it aired from 2001 to 2003 (and again from January to June 2014). Then, in 2004, it aired on [[Hallmark Channel]].\n\nAs of 2015, the show aired nationally on both [[TV Land]] and [[MeTV]].<ref name = \"GI Me\" />\n\nWarner/Turner also handles the two Filmation-produced animated sequel series. The three TV movie sequels are handled by other companies.\n\nIn the UK Gilligan's Island had a very brief run on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in April 1965  but was dropped after 13 episodes.\n\n==Home media==\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all three seasons of ''Gilligan's Island'' on DVD in Region 1 between 2004 and 2005. ''The Complete First Season'' features all 36 episodes unedited with the original theme song. And, unlike other releases of older sitcoms, the episodes are in their original black-and-white format. The special features include the rare pilot episode with commentary with creator Sherwood Schwartz and three other featurettes.\n\n''The Complete Second Season'' includes all 32 season-two episodes in color. Bonuses for this set include: a season-two introduction with Russell Johnson and Sherwood Schwartz and audio commentary on the season's third episode, \"[[List of Gilligan's Island episodes#Season 2|The Little Dictator]]\".\n\n''The Complete Third Season'' includes all 30 season-three episodes. Special features include a season introduction with Russell Johnson and Sherwood Schwartz, commentary on the season's fourth episode, \"[[The Producer]]\", guest-starring [[Phil Silvers]], and a 15-minute documentary entitled ''Gilligan's Island: A Pop Culture Phenomenon''.\n\n''The Complete Series Collection'' contains all the same bonuses and featurettes, no added features for a complete series box set. In April 2012, the series was reissued in new DVD releases.\n\nThe series is also available at the [[iTunes Store]].<ref name=\"iTunes Store download\">{{cite web|title=Gilligan's Island: The Complete Series|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/gilligans-island-the-complete-series/id1272284481|publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (US)|accessdate=March 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!DVD name\n!Ep#\n!Release date\n|-\n|''The Complete First Season''\n| 36\n| February 3, 2004\n|-\n|''The Complete Second Season''\n| 32\n| January 11, 2005\n|-\n|''The Complete Third Season''\n| 30\n| July 26, 2005\n|-\n|''The Complete Series Collection''\n| 98\n| November 6, 2007\n|}\n\n==Digitally remastered in high definition==\nIn August 2006, an executive at Warner Bros. announced plans that ''Gilligan's Island'', in addition to other classic TV series owned by the studio, would be digitally re-mastered in HD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/08/18/gilligans-island-coming-to-hd/|title=\"Gilligan's Island\" coming to HD?|publisher=}}</ref> The original TV series was shot on high-resolution film but scaled down for broadcast.\n\nOn January 20, 2014, [[TV Land]] became the first network to air theatrical-style widescreen HD remastered episodes of ''Gilligan's Island''.

The console features a dull green [[Dot-matrix display|dot-matrix screen]] with adjustable contrast dial, five control buttons (a [[d-pad|directional pad]], two game buttons, and \"start\" and \"select\"), a single speaker with adjustable volume dial, and, like its rivals, uses [[Game cartridge|cartridges]] as physical media for games. The color scheme is made from two tones of grey with accents of black, blue, and dark [[magenta]]. All the corners of the portrait-oriented rectangular unit are softly rounded, save for the bottom right, which is curved. At launch, it was sold either as a standalone unit, or [[Pack-in game|bundled]] with one of several games, namely ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' or ''[[Tetris (Game Boy)|Tetris]]''. Several accessories were also developed, including a carrying pouch and printer.\n\nDespite being technologically inferior to its [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|fourth-generation]] competitors ([[Sega]]'s [[Game Gear]], [[Atari]]'s [[Atari Lynx|Lynx]], and [[NEC]]'s [[TurboExpress]]), the Game Boy received praise for its [[battery life]] and durability in its construction.

This new line of colored Game Boys set a precedent for later Nintendo handhelds; every one of them since has been available in more than one color. Play It Loud! units were manufactured in red, green, black, yellow, white, blue, and clear (transparent) or sometimes called X-Ray in the UK. Most common are the yellow, red, clear and black, Green is fairly scarce but blue and white are the rarest. Blue was a Europe and Japan only release, White was a Japanese majority release with UK Toys R Us stores also getting it as an exclusive edition to them.  The white remains the rarest of all the Play it Loud colors. A rare, limited edition [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] Game Boy is red, with the logos of the team emblazoned on it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} It was released simultaneously with the Play it Loud! handhelds in the United Kingdom.

The Pocket has a smaller link port, which requires an adapter to link with the older Game Boy. The port design is used on all subsequent Game Boy models, excluding the [[Game Boy Micro]]. The screen was changed to a true black-and-white display, rather than the \"pea soup\" monochromatic display of the original Game Boy.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Game Boy Relaunched|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=20 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=August 1996 |page=26}}</ref> Also, the Game Boy Pocket (GBP) has a larger screen than the Game Boy Color (GBC) that later superseded it.

Although like its predecessor, the Game Boy Pocket has no backlight to allow play in a darkened area, it did notably improve visibility and pixel response-time (mostly eliminating [[Motion blur|ghosting]]).<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Pocket Cool |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=89 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=December 1996|page=204}}</ref> The first version did not have a power LED.

What Yokoi's team did was create a hybrid of the NES and the Game & Watch systems.}}</ref><ref name=\"okada\">{{cite web|url=http://www.japanesenintendo.com/post/155107688449|title=Satoru Okada talks Game & Watch, Game Boy and Nintendo DS development|year=2016|work=Issue 163|publisher=[[Retro Gamer]] Magazine|accessdate=January 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101232208/http://www.japanesenintendo.com/post/155107688449|archive-date=January 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nNintendo's second handheld game console, the Game Boy combines features from both the NES home system and Game & Watch hardware. The console features a dull green [[Dot-matrix display|dot-matrix screen]] with adjustable contrast dial, five control buttons (a [[d-pad|directional pad]], two game buttons, and \"start\" and \"select\"), a single speaker with adjustable volume dial, and, like its rivals, uses [[Game cartridge|cartridges]] as physical media for games. The color scheme is made from two tones of grey with accents of black, blue, and dark [[magenta]]. All the corners of the portrait-oriented rectangular unit are softly rounded, save for the bottom right, which is curved. At launch, it was sold either as a standalone unit, or [[Pack-in game|bundled]] with one of several games, namely ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' or ''[[Tetris (Game Boy)|Tetris]]''. Several accessories were also developed, including a carrying pouch and printer.\n\nDespite being technologically inferior to its [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|fourth-generation]] competitors ([[Sega]]'s [[Game Gear]], [[Atari]]'s [[Atari Lynx|Lynx]], and [[NEC]]'s [[TurboExpress]]), the Game Boy received praise for its [[battery life]] and durability in its construction.
