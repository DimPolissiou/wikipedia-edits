He finished his career in 1965 with the [[New York Mets]] and the [[San Francisco Giants]]. With 363 wins, Spahn is the 6th most winning pitcher in history, trailing only [[Cy Young]] (511), [[Walter Johnson]] (417), [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]] (373), [[Christy Mathewson]] (373), and [[Pud Galvin]] (364) on MLB's all-time list. He led the league in wins eight times (1949\u201350, 1953, 1957\u201361, each season with 20+ wins) and won at least 20 games an additional five times (1947, 1951, 1954, 1956, 1963).\n\nSpahn also threw two [[no-hitter]]s (in 1960 and 1961, at ages 39 and 40), won 3&nbsp;[[Earned run average|ERA]] titles (1947, 1953, and 1961), and four strikeout crowns (1949\u201352). He appeared in 14 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]], the most of any pitcher in the 20th century. He won the [[Major League Baseball Player of the Month|NL Player of the Month Award]] in August 1960 (6\u20130, 2.30 ERA, 32 SO) and August 1961 (6\u20130, 1.00 ERA, 26 SO)\n\nSpahn acquired the nickname \"Hooks\", not so much because of his pitching, but due to the prominent shape of his nose. He had once been hit in the face by a thrown ball that he was not expecting, and his broken nose settled into a hook-like shape. In Spahn's final season, during his stint with the Mets, [[Yogi Berra]] came out of retirement briefly and caught 4&nbsp;games, one of them with Spahn pitching. Yogi later told reporters, \"I don't think we're the oldest [[Battery (baseball)|battery]], but we're certainly the ugliest.\"\n\nSpahn was known for a very high leg kick in his delivery, as was his later Giants teammate [[Juan Marichal]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Photo sequences show that this high kick served a specific purpose. As a left-hander, Spahn was able not only to watch any runner on first base, but also to not telegraph whether he was delivering to the plate or to first base, thereby forcing the runner to stay close to the bag. As his fastball waned, Spahn adapted, and relied more on location, changing speeds and a good screwball. He led or shared the lead in the NL in wins in 1957\u201361 (age 36 through 40).\n\nSpahn was also a good hitter, hitting at least one home run in 17 straight seasons, and finishing with an NL career record for pitchers, with 35 home runs. [[Wes Ferrell]], who spent most of his time in the American League, holds the overall record for pitchers, with 37. Spahn posted a .194 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (363-for-1872) with 141 [[run (baseball)|runs]], 57 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 6 [[triple (baseball)|triples]], 94 [[bases on balls]] and 189 [[RBI]]. He also drove in 10 or more runs nine times, with a career high 18 in 1951. In 1958 he batted a strong .333 (36-for-108). In eight World Series games, he batted .200 (4-for-20) with 4 RBI and 1 walk.<ref name=\"BR\" />\n\n===Brief call-up===\nFirst signed by the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] before the 1940 season, Spahn reached the major leagues in [[1942 in baseball|1942]] at the age of 20.<ref name=BR/> He clashed with Braves manager [[Casey Stengel]], who sent him to the minors after Spahn refused to throw at [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodger]] batter [[Pee Wee Reese]] in an exhibition game.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Richard|title=Warren Spahn, 82, Dies; Left-Handed Craftsman of the Baseball Mound for 21 Seasons|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/25/sports/warren-spahn-82-dies-left-handed-craftsman-of-the-baseball-mound-for-21-seasons.html|accessdate=August 18, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 25, 2003}}</ref> Spahn had pitched in only 4 games, allowing 15 runs (10 earned) in {{frac|15|2|3}}&nbsp;innings. \n\nStengel later said that it was the worst managing mistake he had ever made: ''I said \"no guts\" to a kid who went on to become a war hero and one of the greatest lefthanded pitchers you ever saw. You can't say I don't miss 'em when I miss 'em''. The 1942 Braves finished next to last, and Stengel was fired the following year. Spahn was reunited with his first manager 23 years later, for the even more woeful last-place New York Mets, and\u2014referring to Stengel's success with the 1949\u201360 [[New York Yankees]]\u2014later quipped, \"I'm probably the only guy who played for Casey before and after he was a genius.\"<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n===World War II===\nAlong with many other major leaguers, Spahn chose to enlist in the [[United States Army]], after finishing the 1942 season in the minors. He served with distinction, and was awarded a [[Purple Heart]].<ref name=\"Warren Spahn at the Baseball Hall of Fame\"/><ref name=autogenerated1/> He saw action in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] and at the [[Ludendorff Bridge]] as a [[Combat engineering|combat engineer]], and was awarded a [[battlefield commission]].<ref name=\"Warren Spahn at the Baseball Hall of Fame\"/><ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\nSpahn returned to the major leagues in [[1946 in baseball|1946]] at the age of 25, having missed three full seasons. Had he played, it is possible that Spahn would have finished his career behind only [[Walter Johnson]] and [[Cy Young]] in all-time wins.<ref name=\"bullock2004\">{{cite book|title=Playing for Their Nation: Baseball and the American Military during World War II|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|author=Bullock, Steven R.|pages=134\u2013135|year=2004|isbn=0-8032-1337-9}}</ref> Spahn was unsure of the war's impact on his career:\n<blockquote>People say that my absence from the big leagues may have cost me a chance to win 400 games. But I don't know about that. I matured a lot in three years, and I think I was better equipped to handle major league hitters at 25 than I was at 22. Also, I pitched until I was 44.

The team swept a [[Labor Day]] [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]], with Spahn throwing a complete 14-inning win in the opener, and Sain pitching a shutout in the second game. Following two off days, it did rain. Spahn won the next day, and Sain won the day after that. Three days later, Spahn won again. Sain won the next day. After one more off day, the two pitchers were brought back, and won another doubleheader.

This was exemplified by his start on July 2, 1963. Facing the [[San Francisco Giants]], the 42-year-old Spahn became locked into a storied pitchers' duel with 25-year-old [[Juan Marichal]]. The score was still 0\u20130 after more than four hours when Willie Mays hit a game-winning solo home run off Spahn with one out in the bottom of the 16th inning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/box-scores/boxscore.php?boxid=196307020SFN|title=Milwaukee Braves vs San Francisco Giants July 2, 1963 Box Score|date=July 2, 1963|work=Baseball-Almanac.com|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=August 20, 2009}}</ref> Marichal's manager, [[Alvin Dark]], visited the mound in the 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and 14th innings, and was talked out of removing Marichal each time.

He pitched his second no-hitter the following year on April 28, 1961, against the Giants. By the last two seasons of his career, Spahn was the oldest active player in baseball.

He appeared in 14 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]], the most of any pitcher in the 20th century. He won the [[Major League Baseball Player of the Month|NL Player of the Month Award]] in August 1960 (6\u20130, 2.30 ERA, 32 SO) and August 1961 (6\u20130, 1.00 ERA, 26 SO)\n\nSpahn acquired the nickname \"Hooks\", not so much because of his pitching, but due to the prominent shape of his nose. He had once been hit in the face by a thrown ball that he was not expecting, and his broken nose settled into a hook-like shape. In Spahn's final season, during his stint with the Mets, [[Yogi Berra]] came out of retirement briefly and caught 4&nbsp;games, one of them with Spahn pitching. Yogi later told reporters, \"I don't think we're the oldest [[Battery (baseball)|battery]], but we're certainly the ugliest.\"\n\nSpahn was known for a very high leg kick in his delivery, as was his later Giants teammate [[Juan Marichal]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Photo sequences show that this high kick served a specific purpose. As a left-hander, Spahn was able not only to watch any runner on first base, but also to not telegraph whether he was delivering to the plate or to first base, thereby forcing the runner to stay close to the bag. As his fastball waned, Spahn adapted, and relied more on location, changing speeds and a good screwball. He led or shared the lead in the NL in wins in 1957\u201361 (age 36 through 40).\n\nSpahn was also a good hitter, hitting at least one home run in 17 straight seasons, and finishing with an NL career record for pitchers, with 35 home runs. [[Wes Ferrell]], who spent most of his time in the American League, holds the overall record for pitchers, with 37. Spahn posted a .194 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (363-for-1872) with 141 [[run (baseball)|runs]], 57 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 6 [[triple (baseball)|triples]], 94 [[bases on balls]] and 189 [[RBI]]. He also drove in 10 or more runs nine times, with a career high 18 in 1951. In 1958 he batted a strong .333 (36-for-108). In eight World Series games, he batted .200 (4-for-20) with 4 RBI and 1 walk.<ref name=\"BR\" />\n\n===Brief call-up===\nFirst signed by the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] before the 1940 season, Spahn reached the major leagues in [[1942 in baseball|1942]] at the age of 20.<ref name=BR/> He clashed with Braves manager [[Casey Stengel]], who sent him to the minors after Spahn refused to throw at [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodger]] batter [[Pee Wee Reese]] in an exhibition game.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Richard|title=Warren Spahn, 82, Dies; Left-Handed Craftsman of the Baseball Mound for 21 Seasons|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/25/sports/warren-spahn-82-dies-left-handed-craftsman-of-the-baseball-mound-for-21-seasons.html|accessdate=August 18, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 25, 2003}}</ref> Spahn had pitched in only 4 games, allowing 15 runs (10 earned) in {{frac|15|2|3}}&nbsp;innings. \n\nStengel later said that it was the worst managing mistake he had ever made: ''I said \"no guts\" to a kid who went on to become a war hero and one of the greatest lefthanded pitchers you ever saw. You can't say I don't miss 'em when I miss 'em''. The 1942 Braves finished next to last, and Stengel was fired the following year. Spahn was reunited with his first manager 23 years later, for the even more woeful last-place New York Mets, and\u2014referring to Stengel's success with the 1949\u201360 [[New York Yankees]]\u2014later quipped, \"I'm probably the only guy who played for Casey before and after he was a genius.\"<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n===World War II===\nAlong with many other major leaguers, Spahn chose to enlist in the [[United States Army]], after finishing the 1942 season in the minors.

But I don't know about that. I matured a lot in three years, and I think I was better equipped to handle major league hitters at 25 than I was at 22. Also, I pitched until I was 44.

Mays had begun his career 0-for-12, and Spahn responded to reporters after the game, citing the distance between home plate and the pitcher's mound of 60 feet, 6&nbsp;inches, \"Gentlemen, for the first 60 feet, that was a hell of a pitch.\" Spahn joked a long time later, \"I'll never forgive myself. We might have gotten rid of Willie forever if I'd only struck him out.\" (In 1962, another Hall of Famer hit his first career home run off Spahn: [[Sandy Koufax]], who only hit one other.)\n\n===\"Pray for rain\"===\n[[File:Johnny Sain and Warren Spahn.png|thumb|210px|Spahn (right) with [[Johnny Sain]]]]\nSpahn's teammate [[Johnny Sain]] was the ace of the pennant-winning 1948 Braves staff, with a win-loss record of 24\u201315.

Hern wrote this poem which the popular media eventually condensed to \"Spahn and Sain and Pray for Rain\":<ref>According to the ''Baseball Almanac'', the original doggerel appeared in Hern's [[Boston Post]] column on September 14, 1948.</ref>\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em\">\nFirst we'll use Spahn\nthen we'll use Sain\nThen an off day\nfollowed by rain\nBack will come Spahn\nfollowed by Sain\nAnd followed\nwe hope\nby two days of rain.\n</poem>\n\nThe poem was inspired by the performance of Spahn and Sain during the Braves' 1948 pennant drive. The team swept a [[Labor Day]] [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]], with Spahn throwing a complete 14-inning win in the opener, and Sain pitching a shutout in the second game. Following two off days, it did rain. Spahn won the next day, and Sain won the day after that. Three days later, Spahn won again. Sain won the next day. After one more off day, the two pitchers were brought back, and won another doubleheader. The two pitchers had gone 8\u20130 in 12 days' time.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballhistorian.com/html/american_heroes.cfm?page=57 |title=Warren Spahn... 1942-1965 |website=baseballhistorian.com}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230030303/http://www.baseballhistorian.com/html/american_heroes.cfm?page=57 |date=December 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOther sayings have been derived from \"Spahn and Sain and pray for rain.\" For example, some referred to the [[1993 San Francisco Giants season|1993 San Francisco Giants]]' imbalanced rotation as \"[[John Burkett|Burkett]] and [[Bill Swift|Swift]] and pray for snow drift.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&dat=19930817&id=tH1OAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4BQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2019,322587&hl=en |title=Giants fans have no reason to fear the Braves |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |last=Nevius |first=C.W. |date=August 17, 1993 |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Milwaukee Braves===\nIn 1957, Spahn was the ace of the champion Milwaukee Braves. Spahn pitched on two other Braves pennant winners, in 1948 and 1958. Spahn led the NL in strikeouts for four consecutive seasons, from 1949 to 1952 (tied with Don Newcombe in 1951), which includes a single game high of 18 strike outs (then the NL record) in a 15-inning appearance on June 14, 1952. \n\n[[File:Warren Spahn 1958.png|thumb|180px|Spahn in 1958.]]\nSpahn maintained that \"A pitcher needs two pitches&nbsp;\u2014 one they're looking for, and one to cross 'em up.\" He was thus able to maintain his position as one of the game's top pitchers until his 19th season in the sport. This was exemplified by his start on July 2, 1963. Facing the [[San Francisco Giants]], the 42-year-old Spahn became locked into a storied pitchers' duel with 25-year-old [[Juan Marichal]]. The score was still 0\u20130 after more than four hours when Willie Mays hit a game-winning solo home run off Spahn with one out in the bottom of the 16th inning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/box-scores/boxscore.php?boxid=196307020SFN|title=Milwaukee Braves vs San Francisco Giants July 2, 1963 Box Score|date=July 2, 1963|work=Baseball-Almanac.com|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=August 20, 2009}}</ref> Marichal's manager, [[Alvin Dark]], visited the mound in the 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and 14th innings, and was talked out of removing Marichal each time. During the 14th-inning visit, Marichal told Dark, \"Do you see that man pitching for the other side? Do you know that man is 42 years old? I'm only 25.

Hall of Famer [[Carl Hubbell]], who was in attendance that night, said of Spahn, \"He ought to will his body to medical science.\"\n\nSpahn threw his first no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 16, 1960, when he was 39. He pitched his second no-hitter the following year on April 28, 1961, against the Giants. By the last two seasons of his career, Spahn was the oldest active player in baseball. He lost this distinction for a single day: September 25, 1965, when 58-year-old [[Satchel Paige]] pitched three innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/box-scores/boxscore.php?boxid=196509250KC1|title=Boston Red Sox vs Kansas City Athletics September 25, 1965 Box Score|date=September 25, 1965|work=Baseball-Almanac.com|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=August 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSpahn's seemingly ageless ability caused [[Stan Musial]] to quip, \"[Spahn] will never get into the Hall of Fame.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

He signed a six-month contract.<ref>[http://veriafc.gr/index.php/2012-10-10-16-37-41/662-paiktis-tis-verias-o-darcy-dolce-neto \u03a0\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0392\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bf Darcy Dolce Neto]</ref> He made his official debut in a 0\u20132 away win against [[Levadiakos F.C.]].

[[Toy Biz]]:\n| 2002\u20132006\n|-\n! [[Hasbro]]:\n| 2006\u2013Present\n|}\n'''Marvel Legends''' is an [[action figure]] line based on the characters of [[Marvel Comics]], initially produced by [[Toy Biz]], then by [[Hasbro]]. This line is in the {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} scale, with spin-off lines in the {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}}, {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}}, and {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} scale.\n\nThe line initially began as a spin-off of the [[Spider-Man Classics]] line, which were also produced by Toy Biz. At its inception in 2002, the Marvel Legends line copied the clam-shell packaging and the included comic book that had shipped with the Spider-Man Classics line. Beginning January 1, 2007, Hasbro became the new license holder to the rights to produce toys and games based upon the Marvel Universe. The new Hasbro packaging did not include a comic book and the new molds eliminated finger joints, which were a mainstay during the Toy Biz era, but the company did continue with the theme of Build-A-Figure pieces. During the late 2000s, production on the Marvel Legends line slowed down to the point where it was rumored that it may be cancelled, but Hasbro revealed (at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]) that due to fan requests and the upcoming movies based on Marvel characters, the line would be making a comeback in 2012, and in January 2012, Marvel Legends returned to store shelves.\n\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Hasbro announced that Marvel Legends would be given a new start as the ''Marvel Legends Infinite Series'' starting with the [[Mandroid]] series. Initially, the Marvel Legends line has used the \"chase\" concept to introduce figures based on less popular or recognisable characters. These got their nickname by being shipped in fewer quantities than the rest of the figures, thus causing collectors to ''chase'' after them. Eventually, rather than entirely new figures, the chase concept evolved into variants (such as an alternate head or a different colour scheme) of a figure released in that same series. These figures retained being sought-after by collectors. A Marvel Legends [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]] \"figure\" was included as a joke cut-out in the GLX-Mas Special (2005). It featured \"infinite\" points of articulation and three action phrases (to be said with one's own voice).\n\n==Toy Biz==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!width=5%|'''Series'''\n!width=5%|'''Release'''\n!width=15%|'''Figure'''\n!width=25%|'''Accessories'''\n!width=25%|'''Description'''\n!width=25%|'''Comic'''\n|-\n|rowspan=7|1\n|rowspan=7|May 2002\n|[[Captain America]]\n|destroyed building and American flag display\n|\n|Captain America (1968) #109\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Hulk]]\n|rowspan=2|destroyed wall stand\n|bendable fingers\n|rowspan=2|Incredible Hulk (1968) #314\n|-\n|straight fingers and white shirt variant\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[Iron Man]]\n|rowspan=3|[[Stark Industries]] sign stand\n|Model 3 armor\n|rowspan=3|Iron Man (1968) #149\n|-\n|Model 2 (horned) gold\n|-\n|Stealth armor\n|-\n|[[Toad (comics)|Toad]]\n|swamp stand\n|frog permanently in hand, from the unreleased \"Evolution of X\" two-pack from ''[[X-Men (2000 film)]]''\n|Uncanny X-Men (1963) #4\n|-\n|rowspan=8|2\n|rowspan=8|September 2002\n|-\n|[[Doctor Doom]]\n|rowspan=2|castle tower stand\n|\n|rowspan=2|Fantastic Four (1961) #247\n|-\n|[[Doombot]]\n|removable mask\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Human Torch]]\n|rowspan=2|Flame stand from pre-Legends ''Marvel's Most Wanted'' [[Nate Grey|X-Man]] figure\n|''4'' on chest\n|rowspan=2|Fantastic Four (1961) #233\n|-\n|no \"4\"\n|-\n|[[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner\n|trident and water stand\n|\n|The Sub-Mariner (1968) #67\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Thing (comics)|Thing]]\n|Yancy Street wall display\n|\n|rowspan=2|Fantastic Four (1961) #263\n|-\n|Trenchcoat, sunglasses, Yancy Street wall display\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=6|3\n|rowspan=6|December 2002\n|[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]\n|church window stand\n|[[Daredevil (film)]] version\n|Daredevil (1964) #164\n|-\n|[[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)]]\n|Motorcycle\n|\n|Ghost Rider (1973) #2\n|-\n|[[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]]\n|disembodied Sentinel head base\n|\n|X-Men (1991) #2\n|-\n|[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]\n|stand\n|\n|Thor (1966) #39\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]\n|rowspan=2|[[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] guards stand\n|Masked<br />Retool of \"Evolution of X\" two-pack from ''[[X-Men (2000 film)]]''\n|rowspan=2|Uncanny X-Men (1963) #133\n|-\n|unmasked\n|-\n|rowspan=6|4\n|rowspan=6|June 2003\n|[[Beast (comics)|Beast]]\n|pull up bar base\n|\n|X-Men (1991) #3\n|-\n|[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]\n|2 swords, 2 sai, back scabbards and samurai stand\n|\n|Daredevil (1964) #176\n|-\n|[[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]\n|flaming cards, staff and Sentinel right hand stand\n|\n|X-Men (1991) #4\n|-\n|[[Hank Pym|Goliath (Pym)]], [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man (Lang)]], and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]\n|\n|repaint of ''Avengers'' #1 (Non-Legends) Giant-Man, Ant-Man and Wasp mini-figures\n|The Avengers (1963) #28\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Punisher]]\n|rowspan=2|guns and War Zone stand\n|white belt\n|rowspan=2|Punisher War Zone (1992) #1\n|-\n|black belt\n|-\n|rowspan=7|5\n|rowspan=7|November 2003\n|[[Blade (comics)|Blade]]\n|sword, gun and motorcycle\n|[[Blade II]] version\n|originally ''Tomb of Dracula'' (1972) #45, then poster book of ''Blade II''\n|-\n|[[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]\n|disembodied Sentinel torso stand\n|\n|Uncanny X-Men (1963) #129\n|-\n|[[Mr. Fantastic]]\n|interchangeable arms and [[Fantasticar]] stand\n|\n|Fantastic Four (1961) #489\n|-\n|[[Nick Fury]]\n|gun and flaming jetpack stand\n|\n|Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

[[Hasbro]]:\n| 2006\u2013Present\n|}\n'''Marvel Legends''' is an [[action figure]] line based on the characters of [[Marvel Comics]], initially produced by [[Toy Biz]], then by [[Hasbro]]. This line is in the {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} scale, with spin-off lines in the {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}}, {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}}, and {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} scale.\n\nThe line initially began as a spin-off of the [[Spider-Man Classics]] line, which were also produced by Toy Biz. At its inception in 2002, the Marvel Legends line copied the clam-shell packaging and the included comic book that had shipped with the Spider-Man Classics line. Beginning January 1, 2007, Hasbro became the new license holder to the rights to produce toys and games based upon the Marvel Universe. The new Hasbro packaging did not include a comic book and the new molds eliminated finger joints, which were a mainstay during the Toy Biz era, but the company did continue with the theme of Build-A-Figure pieces. During the late 2000s, production on the Marvel Legends line slowed down to the point where it was rumored that it may be cancelled, but Hasbro revealed (at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]) that due to fan requests and the upcoming movies based on Marvel characters, the line would be making a comeback in 2012, and in January 2012, Marvel Legends returned to store shelves.\n\nAt the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Hasbro announced that Marvel Legends would be given a new start as the ''Marvel Legends Infinite Series'' starting with the [[Mandroid]] series. Initially, the Marvel Legends line has used the \"chase\" concept to introduce figures based on less popular or recognisable characters. These got their nickname by being shipped in fewer quantities than the rest of the figures, thus causing collectors to ''chase'' after them. Eventually, rather than entirely new figures, the chase concept evolved into variants (such as an alternate head or a different colour scheme) of a figure released in that same series.

Breen]].  After service in World War II during the next two years, Lemm served as an assistant coach at the [[University of Notre Dame]] under [[Hugh Devore]] in 1945. Lemm returned to Carroll as an assistant coach with the school's football team the following year, then became a head coach for the first time, accepting the top job for Waukesha High School in 1948.\n\nFollowing Lemm's one year at Waukesha, Carroll's former coach, Breen, took the head coaching position at [[Lake Forest College]]. Lemm served under his leadership for the next three years, while also working as the school's head basketball coach, then replaced Breen in 1952.  During his two seasons, he compiled an 11\u20134\u20131 record before leaving to accept the head coach position at Montana State University.  An 8-1 season in 1954 was followed the next year by a 4\u20134\u20131 campaign.  On May 14, 1956, he reached the [[National Football League]] (NFL) when he accepted a defensive assistant position with the [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]].\n\nLemm spent just one season before resigning to again accept the head coaching position at Lake Forest.  During the next two years, he nearly matched his previous stint at the school with an 11\u20135 record, winning District Coach of the Year accolades in 1957 from the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA).  On February 21, 1959, he returned to an assistant's role with the Cardinals, and would remain at the professional level for the remainder of his career.\n\nAfter again spending a single season with the Cardinals, Lemm resigned on January 12, 1960 to accept an assistant coaching position with the [[Houston Oilers]] of the seminal [[American Football League]].  During the first season of play, the Oilers captured the league's [[American Football League#AFL Championship Games|first-ever title]], but Lemm resigned after the season, returning to [[Libertyville, Illinois]] to work in the sporting goods industry.\n\nHowever, after a slow start to the [[1961 AFL season|1961]] season that saw the team with a 1\u20133\u20131 record, Oilers' head coach [[Lou Rymkus]] was fired. Lemm was offered the position by his former coach John Breen, the Oilers' Director of Player Personnel, and proceeded to lead the team to nine straight victories.  The team then won its second straight title with a 10\u20133 win over the [[San Diego Chargers]] on December 24, 1961, and Lemm was named AFL Coach of the Year for his efforts.\n\nAfter orally agreeing to a contract for the next season, Lemm instead resigned on February 22, 1962 to take the top spot with the Cardinals, citing the proximity of St. Louis to his home in [[Lake Bluff, Illinois]].  He replaced [[Pop Ivy]] at St. Louis, and Ivy replaced Lemm at Houston.  After a 4\u20139\u20131 record in his first year, Lemm came close to capturing the NFL's Eastern Conference title with a 9\u20135 season in 1963 and a 9\u20133\u20132 mark the following year.  After signing a contract with a huge pay increase, the Cardinals crashed in 1965 with a 5\u20139 mark, with Lemm seemingly having job security.  However, after Lemm was asked to stay in St. Louis as a full-time coach, he resigned on January 10, 1966, again citing family considerations.  Oddly, he then accepted the head coaching job with his former team in Houston 19 days later.\n\nThe Oilers struggled in 1966 with a 3\u201311 record, but bounced back in 1967 with a 9\u20134\u20131 record and a spot in the AFL Championship game.  After a 40\u20137 thrashing at the hands of the [[Oakland Raiders]], the Oilers again reached the postseason in 1969 compiling a mediocre 6\u20136\u20132 record and were again dismantled by the Raiders, 56\u20137, in the AFL's oddly constructed one year playoff system. For that season the first place team of the West played the second place team of the East and vice versa. The team's first year in the post-merger NFL, 1970, finished with a disastrous 3\u201310\u20131 mark.  Following a 44\u20130 loss to his former team in St. Louis on November 1, 1970, Lemm announced he would be retiring at the conclusion of the year, this time citing health issues. Lemm's final game came on December 20 of that year, a 52\u201310 loss to the Oilers' Lone Star State rivals, the [[Dallas Cowboys]].\n\nLemm died on October 8, 1988 in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] after a college reunion.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Former Houston coach dies |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6703426/the_galveston_daily_news/

October 8, 1988) was an [[American football]] coach at the high school, collegiate and professional levels and achieved his greatest prominence as head coach of the [[American Football League]]'s [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]] and the [[National Football League]]'s [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\nLemm graduated from [[Carroll University|Carroll College]], in [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]], in 1942 after playing football for head coach [[John W. Breen]].  After service in World War II during the next two years, Lemm served as an assistant coach at the [[University of Notre Dame]] under [[Hugh Devore]] in 1945. Lemm returned to Carroll as an assistant coach with the school's football team the following year, then became a head coach for the first time, accepting the top job for Waukesha High School in 1948.\n\nFollowing Lemm's one year at Waukesha, Carroll's former coach, Breen, took the head coaching position at [[Lake Forest College]]. Lemm served under his leadership for the next three years, while also working as the school's head basketball coach, then replaced Breen in 1952.  During his two seasons, he compiled an 11\u20134\u20131 record before leaving to accept the head coach position at Montana State University.  An 8-1 season in 1954 was followed the next year by a 4\u20134\u20131 campaign.  On May 14, 1956, he reached the [[National Football League]] (NFL) when he accepted a defensive assistant position with the [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]].\n\nLemm spent just one season before resigning to again accept the head coaching position at Lake Forest.  During the next two years, he nearly matched his previous stint at the school with an 11\u20135 record, winning District Coach of the Year accolades in 1957 from the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA).  On February 21, 1959, he returned to an assistant's role with the Cardinals, and would remain at the professional level for the remainder of his career.\n\nAfter again spending a single season with the Cardinals, Lemm resigned on January 12, 1960 to accept an assistant coaching position with the [[Houston Oilers]] of the seminal [[American Football League]].  During the first season of play, the Oilers captured the league's [[American Football League#AFL Championship Games|first-ever title]], but Lemm resigned after the season, returning to [[Libertyville, Illinois]] to work in the sporting goods industry.\n\nHowever, after a slow start to the [[1961 AFL season|1961]] season that saw the team with a 1\u20133\u20131 record, Oilers' head coach [[Lou Rymkus]] was fired. Lemm was offered the position by his former coach John Breen, the Oilers' Director of Player Personnel, and proceeded to lead the team to nine straight victories.  The team then won its second straight title with a 10\u20133 win over the [[San Diego Chargers]] on December 24, 1961, and Lemm was named AFL Coach of the Year for his efforts.\n\nAfter orally agreeing to a contract for the next season, Lemm instead resigned on February 22, 1962 to take the top spot with the Cardinals, citing the proximity of St. Louis to his home in [[Lake Bluff, Illinois]].  He replaced [[Pop Ivy]] at St. Louis, and Ivy replaced Lemm at Houston.  After a 4\u20139\u20131 record in his first year, Lemm came close to capturing the NFL's Eastern Conference title with a 9\u20135 season in 1963 and a 9\u20133\u20132 mark the following year.  After signing a contract with a huge pay increase, the Cardinals crashed in 1965 with a 5\u20139 mark, with Lemm seemingly having job security.  However, after Lemm was asked to stay in St. Louis as a full-time coach, he resigned on January 10, 1966, again citing family considerations.  Oddly, he then accepted the head coaching job with his former team in Houston 19 days later.\n\nThe Oilers struggled in 1966 with a 3\u201311 record, but bounced back in 1967 with a 9\u20134\u20131 record and a spot in the AFL Championship game.  After a 40\u20137 thrashing at the hands of the [[Oakland Raiders]], the Oilers again reached the postseason in 1969 compiling a mediocre 6\u20136\u20132 record and were again dismantled by the Raiders, 56\u20137, in the AFL's oddly constructed one year playoff system. For that season the first place team of the West played the second place team of the East and vice versa. The team's first year in the post-merger NFL, 1970, finished with a disastrous 3\u201310\u20131 mark.  Following a 44\u20130 loss to his former team in St. Louis on November 1, 1970, Lemm announced he would be retiring at the conclusion of the year, this time citing health issues. Lemm's final game came on December 20 of that year, a 52\u201310 loss to the Oilers' Lone Star State rivals, the [[Dallas Cowboys]].\n\nLemm died on October 8, 1988 in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] after a college reunion.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Former Houston coach dies |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6703426/the_galveston_daily_news/ |newspaper=[[The Galveston Daily News]] |location=[[Galveston, Texas]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=October 10, 1988 |page=3 |access-date=September 19, 2016 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{Open access}} }}</ref>\n\n==Head coaching record==\n===College football===\n{{CFB Yearly Record Start | type = coach | team = | conf = | bowl = | poll = no }}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subhead\n | name      = [[Lake Forest Foresters football|Lake Forest Foresters]]\n | conf      = [[College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin]]\n | startyear = 1952\n | endyear   = 1953\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = conference\n | year         = [[1952 college football season|1952]]\n | name         = Lake Forest\n | overall      = 6\u20131\u20131\n | conference   = 3\u20130\u20131\n | confstanding = T\u20131st\n | bowlname     = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[1953 college football season|1953]]\n | name         = Lake Forest\n | overall      = 5\u20133\n | conference   = 4\u20131\n | confstanding = 2nd\n | bowlname     = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subhead\n | name      = [[Montana State Bobcats football|Montana State Bobcats]]\n | conf      = [[Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference|Rocky Mountain Conference]]\n | startyear = 1955\n | endyear   = single\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = \n | year         = [[1955 college football season|1955]]\n | name         = Montana State\n | overall      = 4\u20134\u20131\n | conference   = 3\u20132\u20131\n | confstanding = 3rd\n | bowlname     = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subtotal\n | name       = Montana State\n | overall    = 4\u20134\u20131\n | confrecord = 3\u20132\u20131\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subhead\n | name      = [[Lake Forest Foresters football|Lake Forest Foresters]]\n | conf      = [[College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin]]\n | startyear = 1957\n | endyear   = single\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Entry\n | championship = conference\n | year         = [[1957 college football season|1957]]\n | name         = Lake Forest\n | overall      = 6\u20132\n | conference   = 6\u20131\n | confstanding = T\u20131st\n | bowlname     = \n | bowloutcome  = \n | bcsbowl      = \n | ranking      = no\n | ranking2     = no\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record Subtotal\n | name       = Lake Forest\n | overall    = 17\u20136\u20131\n | confrecord = 13\u20132\u20131\n}}\n{{CFB Yearly Record End\n | overall  = 21\u201310\u20132\n | bowls    = no\n | poll     = no\n | polltype = \n}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of American Football League players]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{navboxes|list=\n{{Lake Forest Foresters men's basketball coach navbox}}\n{{Lake Forest Foresters football coach navbox}}\n{{Montana State Bobcats football coach navbox}}\n{{Montana State Bobcats men's basketball coach navbox}}\n{{Tennessee Titans coach navbox}}\n{{Arizona Cardinals coach navbox}}\n{{1960 Houston Oilers}}\n{{1961 Houston Oilers}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lemm, Wally}}\n[[Category:1919 births]]\n[[Category:1988 deaths]]\n[[Category:American Football League champions]]\n[[Category:Basketball coaches from Illinois]]\n[[Category:Chicago Cardinals coaches]]\n[[Category:Carroll Pioneers football coaches]]\n[[Category:Carroll Pioneers football players]]\n[[Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States]]\n[[Category:High school football coaches in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Houston Oilers coaches]]\n[[Category:Lake Forest Foresters football coaches]]\n[[Category:Lake Forest Foresters men's basketball coaches]]\n[[Category:Montana State Bobcats football coaches]]\n[[Category:Montana State Bobcats men's basketball coaches]]\n[[Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football coaches]]\n[[Category:People from Lake Bluff, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Chicago]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Cardinals (football) coaches]]\n", "name_user": "Jweiss11", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHead coaching record:NCAA College Division football season", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Lemm"}

He played in regional theatres and then co-founded the [[Dundee Repertory Theatre]] in Scotland in 1939. He also appeared as an extra in British films including ''[[Good Morning, Boys]]'' (1937), ''[[A Yank at Oxford]]'' (1938) and ''[[Old Bones of the River]]'' (1939).\n\n[[File:Pegasus Bridge, June 1944 B5288.jpg|thumb|175px|Captain Richard Todd landed near [[Pegasus Bridge]] on 6 June 1944.]]\nTodd enlisted soon after the outbreak of [[World War 2]], entering the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]] in late 1940. On 29 January 1941 he was one of 26 cadets injured when 'D' Block of New College was hit by a German bomb in an attack by the [[Luftwaffe]]. In his memoires he describes seeing the bomb pass through the ceiling in front of him before he was blown out of the building by its blast, landing on a grass bank and suffering multiple lacerations, five cadets were killed in the incident. Todd was commissioned in the Spring of 1941. On the day he received his commission he tried to join several friends at the [[Caf\u00e9 de Paris (London)|Caf\u00e9 de Paris]] in London, but could not get a table booked for the evening. That evening venue was destroyed in an air raid, and fifteen newly-commissioned subalterns were killed. \n\nHe served in the [[King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry]] (KOYLI), before joining the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and the [[7th (Light Infantry) Parachute Battalion]] as part of the [[6th Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 6th Airborne Division]].

Short of transport as they advanced into Germany, Todd, as the Motor Transport Officer, was responsible for gathering a rag tag selection of commandeered vehicles to ferry the troops forward. After VE day, the Division returned to the UK for a few weeks before being sent on counter-insurgency operations in Palestine.

His former agent, Robert Lennard, had become a casting agent for [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] and advised him to try out for the Dundee Repertory Company. Todd did so, performing in plays such as ''Claudia'', where he appeared with Catherine Grant-Bogle. Lennard arranged for a screen test and Associated British offered him a long-term contract in 1948. He was cast in the lead in ''[[For Them That Trespass]]'' (1949), directed by [[Alberto Cavalcanti]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47223206 |title=Richard Todd is newest find for British films. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=9 July 1949 |accessdate=25 July 2012 |page=38 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The film was a minor hit and Todd's career was launched.<ref>Nepean, E.

He was lent out to a new company, Constellation Films, to appear in a thriller, ''[[The Interrupted Journey]]'' (1949). [[Alfred Hitchcock]] then used him in ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' (1950), opposite [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Jane Wyman]] \u2013 Hitchcock's first British film located in Britain since 1939.\n\nAssociated British put him in a drama, ''[[Portrait of Clare]]'' (1950), which did not perform particularly well at the box office. Neither did ''[[Flesh and Blood (1951 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1951), for London Films, in which Todd had a dual role. Director [[King Vidor]] offered Todd a lead in a Hollywood movie,  ''[[Lightning Strikes Twice (1951 film)|Lightning Strikes Twice]]'' (1951). Far more popular was ''[[The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men]]'' (1952), in which Todd played the title role for the Disney Corporation.\n\nAssociated British put him in another thriller, ''[[24 Hours of a Woman's Life]]'' (1952), with [[Merle Oberon]]. The Rank Organisation borrowed him for a thriller, ''[[Venetian Bird]]'' (1952), directed by [[Ralph Thomas]].\n\nDisney reunited the ''Robin Hood'' team in ''[[The Sword and the Rose]]'' (1953), with Todd as [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]]. It was not as popular as ''Robin Hood'' in the US but performed well in Europe. The same went for Disney's, ''[[Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue]]'' (1953), in which Todd played the title role. Disney pulled back on making costume films as a result.<ref>Disney Reports Income Gain Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 4 June 1954: A7.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, he appeared in a [[BBC Television]] adaptation of the novel ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', as Heathcliff. [[Nigel Kneale]], responsible for the adaptation, said the production came about purely because Todd had turned up at the BBC and told them that he would like to play Heathcliff for them. Kneale had to write the script in only a week as the broadcast was rushed into production.<ref name=\"kneale\">{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Andy |title=Into the Unknown: The Fantastic Life of Nigel Kneale|type=paperback|year=2006|location=London|publisher=[[Headpress]]|isbn=978-1-900486-50-7|page=34}}</ref>\n\nTodd's career received a boost when [[20th Century-Fox]] signed him to a non-exclusive contract and cast him as the United States Senate Chaplain [[Peter Marshall (preacher)|Peter Marshall]] in the [[A Man Called Peter|film version]] of [[Catherine Marshall]]'s best selling biography, ''[[Peter Marshall (preacher)|A Man Called Peter]]'' (1955), which was a popular success.\n\nEven more popular was ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1955) in which Todd played [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Guy Gibson]]. This was the most successful film at the British box office in 1955<ref>\"'The Dam Busters'.\" ''Times'' [London, England], 29 December 1955, p. 12, via ''The Times Digital Archive''. Retrieved: 11 July 2012.</ref>  and which would become the defining role of Todd's movie career.\n\n20th Century Fox offered Todd another historical picture, ''[[The Virgin Queen (1955 film)|The Virgin Queen]]'' (1955), playing [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] opposite [[Bette Davis]]' [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. It did not do as well as ''Peter''.\n\nIn France he played [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel Fersen]] opposite [[Mich\u00e8le Morgan]] in ''[[Marie Antoinette Queen of France]]'' (1956), which was popular in France but not widely seen elsewhere. Fox cast him in a war film, ''[[D-Day the Sixth of June]]'' (1956), opposite Robert Taylor, which was a mild success.\n\n''[[Yangtse Incident: The Story of H.M.S. Amethyst]]'' (1957) was an attempt to repeat the success of ''The Dam Busters'', with the same director (Michael Anderson) and Todd playing another real life hero. It was popular in Britain but not on the scale of ''The Dam Busters''. He was [[Jean de Dunois|Dunois, Bastard of Orl\u00e9ans]] in ''[[Saint Joan (1957 film)|Saint Joan]]'' (1957), directed by [[Otto Preminger]].\n\n''[[Chase a Crooked Shadow]]'' (1958) was a thriller with director Anderson for Associated British. ''[[Intent to Kill]]'' (1958) was another thriller, this time for Fox, with [[Betsy Drake]]. He returned to war films with ''[[Danger Within]]'' (1958), a POW story. Then there were more thrillers, with ''[[Never Let Go]]'' (1960), directed by [[John Guillermin]] and co-starring [[Peter Sellers]] in a rare dramatic role.\n\nFew of these films had been overly popular but Todd was still the top billed star of ''[[The Long and the Short and the Tall (film)|The Long and the Short and the Tall]]'' (1961), with Laurence Harvey and Richard Harris. He tried comedy with ''[[Don't Bother to Knock (1961 film)|Don't Bother to Knock]]'' (1961), then made an adventure film in South Africa, ''[[The Hellions (film)|The Hellions]]'' (1961).\n\nTodd's cinema career rapidly declined in the 1960s as the [[counter-culture]] movement in the Arts became fashionable in England, with [[British New Wave|social-realist]] dramas commercially replacing the more middle-class orientated dramatic productions that Todd's performance character-type had previously excelled in.\n\n''[[The Boys (1962 British film)|The Boys]]'' (1962) was a courtroom drama film in which Todd played the lead prosecuting barrister. He had a good part among the many stars in ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), playing Major John Howard during the paratroop action before D-Day in which he himself had taken part in 1944 (another actor portrayed Todd); this was his biggest hit for some time. He appeared in ''[[The Very Edge]]'' (1963), a thriller, then he played Harry Sanders in two films for [[Harry Alan Towers]]: ''[[Death Drums Along the River]]'' (1965) and ''[[Coast of Skeletons]]'' (1965). He also had a small role in Anderson's ''[[Operation Crossbow (film)|Operation Crossbow]]'' (1965).\n\nIn 1964 he was a member of the jury at the [[14th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale 1964\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1964/04_jury_1964/04_Jury_1964.html |title=Berlinale 1964: Juries |accessdate=16 February 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nHe had a supporting part in ''[[The Battle of the Villa Fiorita]]'' (1965) and the lead in ''[[The Love-Ins]]'' (1968).\n\nIn the 1970s, he gained new fans when he appeared as the reader for Radio Four's ''Morning Story''. In the 1980s his distinctive voice was heard as narrator of ''Wings Over the World'', a thirteen-part documentary series about the history of aviation shown on Arts & Entertainment television. He appeared before the camera in the episode about the [[Lancaster bomber]]. Todd continued to act on television, including roles in ''[[Virtual Murder (TV series)|Virtual Murder]]''; ''[[Silent Witness]]'' and in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[Kinda (Doctor Who)|\"Kinda\"]]'' in 1982. In 1989 he appeared in the first episode of the sixth season of the television [[whodunit]] ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' in which he played Colonel Alex Schofield in the episode entitled [[List of Murder, She Wrote episodes#Season 6 (1989\u201390)|\"Appointment in Athens\"]].\n\nHe formed Triumph Theatre Productions with [[Duncan Weldon (producer)|Duncan C. Weldon]] and Paul Elliott in the late 1960s. This company produced more than 100 plays, musicals and pantomimes all over the country; some of them starred Todd.\n\nHis acting career extended into his eighties, and he made several appearances in British shows such as [[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]] and ''[[The Royal]]''. He appeared in The Royal as Hugh Hurst, a retired solicitor, in the episode \"Kiss and Tell\" (2003); his last appearance in Heartbeat was as Major Harold Beecham in the 2007 episode [[Heartbeat (series 11\u201318)#Series 16 (2006\u20132007)|\"Seeds of Destruction\"]].\n\nRichard Todd was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1993.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?participantId=192516 TCM]</ref>\n\nHe was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions: in March 1960 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]]; and in November 1988 when [[Michael Aspel]] surprised him on stage at the [[Theatre Royal Windsor]].\n\n===Unmade projects===\nTodd was the first choice of author [[Ian Fleming]] to play [[James Bond]] in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', but a scheduling conflict gave the role to [[Sean Connery]].

His first wife was actress Catherine Grant-Bogle, whom he met in Dundee Repertory and was married to from 1949 until 1970; they had a son Peter (1952\u20132005) and a daughter Fiona. In 1960 he had a son Jeremy with model Patricia Nelson.

He was lent out to a new company, Constellation Films, to appear in a thriller, ''[[The Interrupted Journey]]'' (1949). [[Alfred Hitchcock]] then used him in ''[[Stage Fright (1950 film)|Stage Fright]]'' (1950), opposite [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Jane Wyman]] \u2013 Hitchcock's first British film located in Britain since 1939.\n\nAssociated British put him in a drama, ''[[Portrait of Clare]]'' (1950), which did not perform particularly well at the box office. Neither did ''[[Flesh and Blood (1951 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1951), for London Films, in which Todd had a dual role. Director [[King Vidor]] offered Todd a lead in a Hollywood movie,  ''[[Lightning Strikes Twice (1951 film)|Lightning Strikes Twice]]'' (1951). Far more popular was ''[[The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men]]'' (1952), in which Todd played the title role for the Disney Corporation.\n\nAssociated British put him in another thriller, ''[[24 Hours of a Woman's Life]]'' (1952), with [[Merle Oberon]]. The Rank Organisation borrowed him for a thriller, ''[[Venetian Bird]]'' (1952), directed by [[Ralph Thomas]].\n\nDisney reunited the ''Robin Hood'' team in ''[[The Sword and the Rose]]'' (1953), with Todd as [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk]]. It was not as popular as ''Robin Hood'' in the US but performed well in Europe. The same went for Disney's, ''[[Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue]]'' (1953), in which Todd played the title role. Disney pulled back on making costume films as a result.<ref>Disney Reports Income Gain Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 4 June 1954: A7.</ref>\n\nIn 1953, he appeared in a [[BBC Television]] adaptation of the novel ''[[Wuthering Heights]]'', as Heathcliff. [[Nigel Kneale]], responsible for the adaptation, said the production came about purely because Todd had turned up at the BBC and told them that he would like to play Heathcliff for them. Kneale had to write the script in only a week as the broadcast was rushed into production.<ref name=\"kneale\">{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Andy |title=Into the Unknown: The Fantastic Life of Nigel Kneale|type=paperback|year=2006|location=London|publisher=[[Headpress]]|isbn=978-1-900486-50-7|page=34}}</ref>\n\nTodd's career received a boost when [[20th Century-Fox]] signed him to a non-exclusive contract and cast him as the United States Senate Chaplain [[Peter Marshall (preacher)|Peter Marshall]] in the [[A Man Called Peter|film version]] of [[Catherine Marshall]]'s best selling biography, ''[[Peter Marshall (preacher)|A Man Called Peter]]'' (1955), which was a popular success.\n\nEven more popular was ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1955) in which Todd played [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Guy Gibson]]. This was the most successful film at the British box office in 1955<ref>\"'The Dam Busters'.\" ''Times'' [London, England], 29 December 1955, p. 12, via ''The Times Digital Archive''. Retrieved: 11 July 2012.</ref>  and which would become the defining role of Todd's movie career.\n\n20th Century Fox offered Todd another historical picture, ''[[The Virgin Queen (1955 film)|The Virgin Queen]]'' (1955), playing [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] opposite [[Bette Davis]]' [[Queen Elizabeth I]]. It did not do as well as ''Peter''.\n\nIn France he played [[Axel von Fersen the Younger|Axel Fersen]] opposite [[Mich\u00e8le Morgan]] in ''[[Marie Antoinette Queen of France]]'' (1956), which was popular in France but not widely seen elsewhere. Fox cast him in a war film, ''[[D-Day the Sixth of June]]'' (1956), opposite Robert Taylor, which was a mild success.\n\n''[[Yangtse Incident: The Story of H.M.S. Amethyst]]'' (1957) was an attempt to repeat the success of ''The Dam Busters'', with the same director (Michael Anderson) and Todd playing another real life hero. It was popular in Britain but not on the scale of ''The Dam Busters''. He was [[Jean de Dunois|Dunois, Bastard of Orl\u00e9ans]] in ''[[Saint Joan (1957 film)|Saint Joan]]'' (1957), directed by [[Otto Preminger]].\n\n''[[Chase a Crooked Shadow]]'' (1958) was a thriller with director Anderson for Associated British. ''[[Intent to Kill]]'' (1958) was another thriller, this time for Fox, with [[Betsy Drake]]. He returned to war films with ''[[Danger Within]]'' (1958), a POW story. Then there were more thrillers, with ''[[Never Let Go]]'' (1960), directed by [[John Guillermin]] and co-starring [[Peter Sellers]] in a rare dramatic role.\n\nFew of these films had been overly popular but Todd was still the top billed star of ''[[The Long and the Short and the Tall (film)|The Long and the Short and the Tall]]'' (1961), with Laurence Harvey and Richard Harris. He tried comedy with ''[[Don't Bother to Knock (1961 film)|Don't Bother to Knock]]'' (1961), then made an adventure film in South Africa, ''[[The Hellions (film)|The Hellions]]'' (1961).\n\nTodd's cinema career rapidly declined in the 1960s as the [[counter-culture]] movement in the Arts became fashionable in England, with [[British New Wave|social-realist]] dramas commercially replacing the more middle-class orientated dramatic productions that Todd's performance character-type had previously excelled in.\n\n''[[The Boys (1962 British film)|The Boys]]'' (1962) was a courtroom drama film in which Todd played the lead prosecuting barrister. He had a good part among the many stars in ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' (1962), playing Major John Howard during the paratroop action before D-Day in which he himself had taken part in 1944 (another actor portrayed Todd); this was his biggest hit for some time. He appeared in ''[[The Very Edge]]'' (1963), a thriller, then he played Harry Sanders in two films for [[Harry Alan Towers]]: ''[[Death Drums Along the River]]'' (1965) and ''[[Coast of Skeletons]]'' (1965). He also had a small role in Anderson's ''[[Operation Crossbow (film)|Operation Crossbow]]'' (1965).\n\nIn 1964 he was a member of the jury at the [[14th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale 1964\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1964/04_jury_1964/04_Jury_1964.html |title=Berlinale 1964: Juries |accessdate=16 February 2010 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nHe had a supporting part in ''[[The Battle of the Villa Fiorita]]'' (1965) and the lead in ''[[The Love-Ins]]'' (1968).\n\nIn the 1970s, he gained new fans when he appeared as the reader for Radio Four's ''Morning Story''. In the 1980s his distinctive voice was heard as narrator of ''Wings Over the World'', a thirteen-part documentary series about the history of aviation shown on Arts & Entertainment television. He appeared before the camera in the episode about the [[Lancaster bomber]]. Todd continued to act on television, including roles in ''[[Virtual Murder (TV series)|Virtual Murder]]''; ''[[Silent Witness]]'' and in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[Kinda (Doctor Who)|\"Kinda\"]]'' in 1982. In 1989 he appeared in the first episode of the sixth season of the television [[whodunit]] ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' in which he played Colonel Alex Schofield in the episode entitled [[List of Murder, She Wrote episodes#Season 6 (1989\u201390)|\"Appointment in Athens\"]].\n\nHe formed Triumph Theatre Productions with [[Duncan Weldon (producer)|Duncan C. Weldon]] and Paul Elliott in the late 1960s. This company produced more than 100 plays, musicals and pantomimes all over the country; some of them starred Todd.\n\nHis acting career extended into his eighties, and he made several appearances in British shows such as [[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]] and ''[[The Royal]]''. He appeared in The Royal as Hugh Hurst, a retired solicitor, in the episode \"Kiss and Tell\" (2003); his last appearance in Heartbeat was as Major Harold Beecham in the 2007 episode [[Heartbeat (series 11\u201318)#Series 16 (2006\u20132007)|\"Seeds of Destruction\"]].\n\nRichard Todd was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in 1993.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?participantId=192516 TCM]</ref>\n\nHe was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions: in March 1960 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]] at the BBC's [[Lime Grove Studios]]; and in November 1988 when [[Michael Aspel]] surprised him on stage at the [[Theatre Royal Windsor]].\n\n===Unmade projects===\nTodd was the first choice of author [[Ian Fleming]] to play [[James Bond]] in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', but a scheduling conflict gave the role to [[Sean Connery]]. In the 1960s, Todd unsuccessfully attempted to produce a film of Ian Fleming's ''[[The Diamond Smugglers]]''<ref name=caught/> and a television series based on true accounts of the [[Queen's Messenger]]s.<ref name=caught/> He was also announced for a proposed film about [[William Shakespeare]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55851326 |title=Hope tops list for popularity. |newspaper=[[The Mail (Adelaide)|The Mail]] |location=Adelaide |date=30 December 1950 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |page=5 Supplement: Sunday Magazine |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''British Film Character Actors'' (1982), Terence Pettigrew described Todd as \"an actor who made the most of what he had, which could be summed up as an inability to sit still while there was a horse to leap astride, a swollen river to swim or a tree to vanish into.\"\n\n==Personal life==\nBoth Todd's marriages ended in divorce. His first wife was actress Catherine Grant-Bogle, whom he met in Dundee Repertory and was married to from 1949 until 1970; they had a son Peter (1952\u20132005) and a daughter Fiona. In 1960 he had a son Jeremy with model Patricia Nelson. He was married to model Virginia Mailer from 1970 until 1992; they had two sons, Andrew and Seumas (1977\u20131997).<ref>[http://www.findmypast.com/BirthsMarriagesDeaths.jsp Deaths England and Wales 1984\u20132006]</ref> \n\nIn retirement, Todd lived in the village of [[Little Ponton]] and later in [[Little Humby]], 8 miles from [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]].\n\nTwo of Todd's five children died by suicide. In 1997, Seumas Palethorpe-Todd shot himself in the head at the family home in Lincolnshire; an inquest determined that the suicide might have been a depressive reaction to the drug he was taking for severe acne. On 21 September 2005 Peter killed himself with a shotgun in [[East Malling]], [[Kent]], following marital difficulties.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/4770682.stm|title=Suicide of actor's depressed son|publisher=BBC | date=3 March 2006 | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> His sons' suicides affected Todd profoundly and he admitted to visiting their adjoining graves regularly.

He continued to be identified in the public consciousness with [[Guy Gibson]] from his portrayal of him in the 1950's film, and attended 617 Squadron anniversaries up to 2008. He narrated a television documentary about the Squadron, and contributed forewords to several books on the subject, including: \"The Dam Buster Story\" (2003); \"Filming the Dam Busters\" (2005); and \"Bouncing-Bomb Man: The Science of Sir Barnes Wallis\" (2009).{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Death==\nTodd died at his home near [[Grantham]] in [[Lincolnshire]] on 3 December 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8394812.stm|work=BBC News|title=Dambusters star Richard Todd dies aged 90|accessdate=4 December 2009 | date=4 December 2009}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/05/movies/05todd.html Richard Todd, Dashing Actor, Dies at 90]</ref> His body was buried between his two sons Seumas and Peter at St. Guthlac's Church in [[Little Ponton]], in the county of [[Lincolnshire]].

This move was criticized, as commentators believed that it was meant primarily to [[Protectionism|suppress]] the sale of products deemed as competition to [[Amazon Fire TV]] products, given that Amazon itself had deliberately refused to offer software for its own streaming services on these devices, and the action contradicted the implication that Amazon.com was a general online retailer.<ref name=\"nyt-amazonstopselling\">{{cite news|title=Amazon to Stop Selling Apple TV and Chromecast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/business/amazon-to-stop-selling-apple-tv-and-chromecast.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 October 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=\"bloomberg-ccban\">{{cite news|title=Amazon to Ban Sale of Apple, Google Video-Streaming Devices\n|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/amazon-will-ban-sale-of-apple-google-video-streaming-devices|accessdate=1 October 2015|work=Bloomberg News|date=October 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"wired-appletvban\">{{cite news|title=Amazon Is Banning Apple TV and Chromecast.
