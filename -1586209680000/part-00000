[[Sheep]] are among the first animals to have been domesticated by humans, and there is evidence of sheep farming in Iranian statuary dating to that time period. These sheep were primarily raised for meat, milk, and skins. Woolly sheep began to be developed around 6000 BCE in Iran, and cultures such as the [[Persian people|Persians]] relied on sheep's wool for trading. They were then imported to Africa and Europe via trading.\n\n==Wild ancestors==\n{{main|Domestic sheep}}\n[[File:Muffelwild12.4.2008 007.jpg|thumb|The [[mouflon]] is thought to be the primary ancestor of domestic sheep.]]\nThe exact line of descent between domestic sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear.<ref name=Hiendleder>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hiendleder S, Kaupe B, Wassmuth R, Janke A |title=Molecular analysis of wild and domestic sheep questions current nomenclature and provides evidence for domestication from two different subspecies |journal=Proc.

Primitive sheep can be shorn, but many can have their wool plucked out by hand in a process called \"[[Glossary of sheep husbandry|rooing]]\". Rooing helps to leave behind the coarse fibers called [[Kemp (wool)|kemps]] which are still longer than the soft fleece. The fleece may also be collected from the field after it falls out naturally. This rooing trait survives today in unrefined breeds such as the [[Soay sheep|Soay]] and many [[Shetland (sheep)|Shetland]]s. Indeed, the Soay, along with other [[Northern European short-tailed sheep|Northern European breeds with short tails]], naturally rooing fleece, diminutive size, and horns in both sexes, are closely related to ancient sheep. Originally, weaving and spinning wool was a handicraft practiced at home, rather than an industry. [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Sumer]]ians, and [[Persia]]ns all depended on sheep; and although [[linen]] was the first fabric to be fashioned in to clothing, wool was a prized product. The raising of flocks for their fleece was one of the earliest industries, and flocks were a medium of exchange in [[Barter|barter economies]]. Numerous [[biblical]] figures kept large flocks, and subjects of the king of Judea were taxed according to the number of rams they owned.<ref name=\"sheep and goat\"/>{{rp|7}}\n\n==In Asia==\n\n===Domestication===\nSheep were among the first animals to be domesticated by humans (although [[Origin of the domestic dog|the domestication of dogs]] may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 8,000 B.C in [[Mesopotamia]].<ref name=\"sheep and goat\">Ensminger</ref>{{rp|4}}<ref name=\"hobby\">Weaver</ref>{{rp|11\u201314}}<ref name=\"storey\">Simmons & Ekarius</ref>{{rp|2}}<ref>{{cite book |author1=Krebs, Robert E. \u00a0|author2=Carolyn A. | title=Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions & Discoveries of the Ancient World | location=Westport, CT | publisher=Greenwood Press | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-313-31342-4}}</ref> Their wild relatives have several characteristics, such as a relative lack of aggression, a manageable size, early sexual maturity, a social nature, and high reproduction rates, which made them particularly suitable for domestication.<ref name=\"wild\">Budiansky</ref>{{rp|78\u201380}} Today, ''Ovis aries'' is an entirely domesticated animal that is largely dependent on humans for its health and survival.<ref name=\"wild\" />{{rp|167}} [[Feral]] sheep do exist, but exclusively in areas devoid of large predators (usually islands) and not on the scale of [[feral horse]]s, goats, [[Razorback|pigs]], or dogs, although some feral populations have remained isolated long enough to be recognized as distinct breeds.<ref name=\"wild\"/>{{rp|75}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cormosheep.org/Cormo/Conservationx.html |title=Breed Conservation in the United States of America: presentation to the Fifth Congress on Iberoamerican Breeds and Criollos |author1=Bixby, Donald E. |author2=Sponenberg, D.

Primitive sheep can be shorn, but many can have their wool plucked out by hand in a process called \"[[Glossary of sheep husbandry|rooing]]\". Rooing helps to leave behind the coarse fibers called [[Kemp (wool)|kemps]] which are still longer than the soft fleece. The fleece may also be collected from the field after it falls out naturally. This rooing trait survives today in unrefined breeds such as the [[Soay sheep|Soay]] and many [[Shetland (sheep)|Shetland]]s. Indeed, the Soay, along with other [[Northern European short-tailed sheep|Northern European breeds with short tails]], naturally rooing fleece, diminutive size, and horns in both sexes, are closely related to ancient sheep. Originally, weaving and spinning wool was a handicraft practiced at home, rather than an industry.

In modern America, a minor event in rodeos is [[mutton busting]], in which children compete to see who can stay atop a sheep the longest before falling off. Another effect of the westward movement of sheep flocks in North America was the decline of wild species such as [[Bighorn sheep]] (''O. canadesis''). Most diseases of domestic sheep are transmittable to wild ovines, and such diseases, along with overgrazing and habitat loss, are named as primary factors in the plummeting numbers of wild sheep.<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Forstenzer\n |title= It's Wild vs. Domestic Sheep as Groups Lock Horns Over Grazing Area|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/science/20sheep.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1197478828-86CJi8THMYrABwZkfdal3Q |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2007-12-12 }}</ref> Sheep production peaked in North America during the 1940s and 1950s at more than 55 million head.<ref name=\"hobby\"/>{{rp|14}} By 2013 the number of sheep in the United States was 10 percent what it had been in the early 1940s.<ref>[http://harvestpublicmedia.org/article/long-slow-decline-us-sheep-industry report on the decline of the sheep industry in the US] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713133224/http://harvestpublicmedia.org/article/long-slow-decline-us-sheep-industry |date=2016-07-13 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, Roy McBride, a farmer from [[Alpine, Texas]], invented a collar filled with the poison [[compound 1080]] to protect his livestock from coyotes, which tended to attack the throat.

Born in an Irish Catholic family in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Mathew was educated at the largely Protestant [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College, Dublin]], before joining the English bar. In 1881, although still a [[junior barrister]], he was appointed to the [[High Court of Justice]], where he sat in the [[Queen's Bench Division]] and was said to be the best ''[[nisi prius]]'' judge of his time. He was promoted to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] in 1901, before resigned from the bench due to health reasons in 1905.\n\nMathew was a driving force behind the creation of Commercial List in 1895, the forerunner of the modern [[Commercial Court (England and Wales)|Commercial Court]], and was the first judge in charge of the List.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nMathew was born at Lehenagh House, [[County Cork|Cork]], on 10 July 1830, the eldest son of Charles Mathew by his wife Mary, daughter of James Hackett of Cork. The [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] campaigner [[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Father Theobald Mathew]] was his uncle, and it was largely due to his representations that the nephew, after receiving his early education at a private school at Cork, was sent at the age of fifteen to [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College, Dublin]], an unusual step at that period for a member of a Catholic family. He graduated as senior moderator and gold medallist in 1850, then entered as a student at [[Lincoln's Inn]] on 1 June 1851, and read in the chamber of [[Thomas Chitty]]. He was called to the bar in [[Hilary term|Hilary]] term 1851, having obtained in the previous November an open studentship. He was made a [[bencher]] in Easter term 1881.\n\n== Career at the bar ==\nFor some ten years his progress was very slow. In the meantime he found scope for his debating and argumentative powers at the Hardwicke Society, of which he was one of the founders; and the humour and sarcasm which never forsook him brought him into prominence at the social gatherings of the Home Circuit mess. When business at last came to him, it found him thoroughly versed in the intricacies of pleading and practice and ready to seize every opportunity. He had a strong natural aptitude for the practical side of law, and from the outset of his career at the bar he showed impatience of technicalities and determination to get at the real points at issue. His services were in especial demand at the now defunct Guildhall sittings, where the heavy City special jury cases were tried, and after the way was cleared by [[Arthur Cohen (politician)|Arthur Cohen]] being made a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1874, Mathew and [[Charles Bowen, Baron Bowen|Charles Bowen]] were invariably retained by one side or the other; but in spite of his vast practice as a junior, Mathew steadily refrained from applying to become a QC: a weak and rather harsh voice may have rendered him distrustful of his powers as a leader. In 1873 he was among the treasury counsel on the prosecution of the [[Tichborne case|Tichborne claimant]], Arthur Orton, and he was the only one of his opponents with whom [[Edward Kenealy]] did not quarrel.\n\n== Judicial career ==\nIn March 1881, though still a junior barrister, he was appointed a judge in the [[Queen's Bench Division]] and knighted. At first he was hardly the success on the bench that his friends had predicted. He was often over hasty in speech, and he showed himself too impatient of slowness and dulness. These defects, however, wore away, and he became eventually the best ''[[nisi prius]]'' judge of his time. On the criminal side, though his previous experience in that branch of the profession was small, he showed acuteness and broad common sense, with occasionally, as was observed, a slight leaning to the prisoner. But it is by the institution of the commercial court that he will be best remembered. He had always held strong views on the question of costs and of legal procedure, and shortly before his elevation to the bench he had served on a royal commission appointed to inquire into the former subject.\n\n=== Creation of the Commercial Court ===\nIn 1895 he persuaded the other judges of the Queen's Bench Division, in which [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Lord Russell of Killowen]] had just been appointed Chief Justice, to assent to the formation of a special list for commercial cases to be heard in a particular court, presided over by the same judge sitting continuously and with a free hand as to his own procedure. Of this office Mathew was the first and by far the most successful occupant. He swept away written pleadings, narrowed the issues to the smallest possible dimensions, and allowed no dilatory excuses to interfere with the speedy trial of the action. His own judgments, \u2018concise and terse, free from irrelevancies and digression,\u2019 won the approval of all who practised in the court, and the confidence of the mercantile community. To a man of Mathew's alert, energetic, and radical mind the procedure in Chancery, especially in chambers, seemed a cumbersome survival of medievalism; and when sitting occasionally as a chancery judge he tried to introduce some of the reforms he had found efficacious in the commercial court. But the soil was not congenial, and some of his criticisms caused a good deal of umbrage to the members of the Chancery bar.\n\n=== Royal Commissioner ===\nShortly after the return of the Liberal Party to office in August 1892, Mathew was made chairman of a royal commission appointed to inquire into the case of the evicted tenants in Ireland, with especial reference to their reinstatement and resettlement. The selection was not very fortunate. As a convinced home ruler and the father-in-law of [[John Dillon]], a leading Nationalist MP, he was regarded with distrust by the landlords and the Unionists generally.\n\nThe opening day, 7 November was marked by a disagreeable altercation between the chairman and [[Edward Carson]]. Following the example of [[John Day (judge)|Sir John Day]] at Belfast, Mathew refused to allow cross-examination by counsel. Carson thereupon stigmatised the inquiry as 'a sham and a farce,' and Mathew pronounced this observation to be 'impertinent and disgraceful to the Irish bar.' Counsel were ordered to withdraw, two of the chairman's colleagues took speedy opportunity of resigning, and the landlords as a body refused to take any further part in the proceedings. The commission, however, continued to take evidence, and reported in due course; some of its recommendations bore fruit in the clauses of Mr. Wyndham's Land Purchase Act of 1903. It should be said that the lines of procedure laid down by Mathew have been consistently followed in subsequent royal commissions.\n\n=== Court of Appeal and death ===\nProbably owing to this episode Mathew was not raised to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] until 1901. In his new capacity he displayed all his old qualities of accuracy, common sense, and vigour, but he deprecated elaborate arguments and voluminous citation of authorities, the 'old umbrellas of the law,' as he used to call them. On 6 December 1905 he was seized with a paralytic stroke at the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athen\u00e6um Club]], and his resignation was announced on the following day. He died in London on 9 November 1908, and was buried in St. Joseph's Cemetery at Cork.\n\n=== Assessment ===\nIn many respects Mathew was a typical representative of the south of Ireland. Ready and facile of speech, he was gifted with a delightful flow of humour and a strong appreciation of the lighter side of life. An ardent radical and a devout Roman Catholic, he maintained the happiest relations with many who were vehemently opposed to him in religion and politics; on circuit he was always a welcome visitor at the houses of the dignitaries of the Church of England. A man of wide reading and culture, he was a warm-hearted and faithful friend.\n\n== Family ==\nMathew married on 26 December 1861 Elizabeth, daughter of Edwin Biron, vicar of [[Lympne]] near [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]]; she survived him. There were two sons and three daughters of the marriage.\n\nHis eldest daughter [[Elizabeth Dillon|Elizabeth]] married in 1895 the Irish MP [[John Dillon]], and was the mother of the Irish politician [[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|James Matthew Dillon]].\n\nBoth of Mathew's sons became barristers. The elder, [[Theobald Mathew (legal humourist)|Theobald Mathew]], was a well-known legal wit, while the younger, [[Charles Mathew]] KC, was briefly a Labour MP. Charles Mathew's son, [[Theobald Mathew (Director of Public Prosecutions)|Sir Theobald Mathew]], was the longest-serving [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]].\n\n== References ==\n{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Mathew, James Charles (DNB12)|title=|last=Atlay|first=James Beresford|authorlink=|volume=II|pages=|quote=|accessdate=|comment=|ref=}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mathew, James}}\n[[Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin]]\n[[Category:1908 deaths]]\n[[Category:Queen's Bench Division judges]]\n[[Category:Lords Justices of Appeal]]\n[[Category:People from County Cork]]\n[[Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1830 births]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox officeholder|name=Sir James Charles Mathew|honorific_prefix=[[The Right Honourable]]|office=[[Lord Justice of Appeal]]|office1=[[High Court judge (England and Wales)|Justice of the High Court]]|image=File:Jame Charles Mathew, Vanity Fair, 1896-03-12.jpg|alma_mater=[[Trinity College, Dublin]]|birth_place={{birth date|1830|7|10|df=yes}}|death_date={{death date and age|1908|11|9|1830|7|10|df=yes}}|birth_date=Lehenagh House, [[County Cork]]|death_place=[[London]]|spouse={{marriage |Elizabeth Biron |1861 }}|children=5|termstart=19 October 1901|termend=25 January 1906|termstart1=3 March 1881|termend1=19 October 1901}}\n\n'''Sir James Charles Mathew''' (10 July 1830 \u2013 9 November 1908) was an Irish-born judge.

In the meantime he found scope for his debating and argumentative powers at the Hardwicke Society, of which he was one of the founders; and the humour and sarcasm which never forsook him brought him into prominence at the social gatherings of the Home Circuit mess. When business at last came to him, it found him thoroughly versed in the intricacies of pleading and practice and ready to seize every opportunity. He had a strong natural aptitude for the practical side of law, and from the outset of his career at the bar he showed impatience of technicalities and determination to get at the real points at issue. His services were in especial demand at the now defunct Guildhall sittings, where the heavy City special jury cases were tried, and after the way was cleared by [[Arthur Cohen (politician)|Arthur Cohen]] being made a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1874, Mathew and [[Charles Bowen, Baron Bowen|Charles Bowen]] were invariably retained by one side or the other; but in spite of his vast practice as a junior, Mathew steadily refrained from applying to become a QC: a weak and rather harsh voice may have rendered him distrustful of his powers as a leader. In 1873 he was among the treasury counsel on the prosecution of the [[Tichborne case|Tichborne claimant]], Arthur Orton, and he was the only one of his opponents with whom [[Edward Kenealy]] did not quarrel.\n\n== Judicial career ==\nIn March 1881, though still a junior barrister, he was appointed a judge in the [[Queen's Bench Division]] and knighted. At first he was hardly the success on the bench that his friends had predicted. He was often over hasty in speech, and he showed himself too impatient of slowness and dulness. These defects, however, wore away, and he became eventually the best ''[[nisi prius]]'' judge of his time. On the criminal side, though his previous experience in that branch of the profession was small, he showed acuteness and broad common sense, with occasionally, as was observed, a slight leaning to the prisoner. But it is by the institution of the commercial court that he will be best remembered. He had always held strong views on the question of costs and of legal procedure, and shortly before his elevation to the bench he had served on a royal commission appointed to inquire into the former subject.\n\n=== Creation of the Commercial Court ===\nIn 1895 he persuaded the other judges of the Queen's Bench Division, in which [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Lord Russell of Killowen]] had just been appointed Chief Justice, to assent to the formation of a special list for commercial cases to be heard in a particular court, presided over by the same judge sitting continuously and with a free hand as to his own procedure. Of this office Mathew was the first and by far the most successful occupant. He swept away written pleadings, narrowed the issues to the smallest possible dimensions, and allowed no dilatory excuses to interfere with the speedy trial of the action. His own judgments, \u2018concise and terse, free from irrelevancies and digression,\u2019 won the approval of all who practised in the court, and the confidence of the mercantile community. To a man of Mathew's alert, energetic, and radical mind the procedure in Chancery, especially in chambers, seemed a cumbersome survival of medievalism; and when sitting occasionally as a chancery judge he tried to introduce some of the reforms he had found efficacious in the commercial court. But the soil was not congenial, and some of his criticisms caused a good deal of umbrage to the members of the Chancery bar.\n\n=== Royal Commissioner ===\nShortly after the return of the Liberal Party to office in August 1892, Mathew was made chairman of a royal commission appointed to inquire into the case of the evicted tenants in Ireland, with especial reference to their reinstatement and resettlement. The selection was not very fortunate. As a convinced home ruler and the father-in-law of [[John Dillon]], a leading Nationalist MP, he was regarded with distrust by the landlords and the Unionists generally.\n\nThe opening day, 7 November was marked by a disagreeable altercation between the chairman and [[Edward Carson]]. Following the example of [[John Day (judge)|Sir John Day]] at Belfast, Mathew refused to allow cross-examination by counsel. Carson thereupon stigmatised the inquiry as 'a sham and a farce,' and Mathew pronounced this observation to be 'impertinent and disgraceful to the Irish bar.' Counsel were ordered to withdraw, two of the chairman's colleagues took speedy opportunity of resigning, and the landlords as a body refused to take any further part in the proceedings. The commission, however, continued to take evidence, and reported in due course; some of its recommendations bore fruit in the clauses of Mr. Wyndham's Land Purchase Act of 1903. It should be said that the lines of procedure laid down by Mathew have been consistently followed in subsequent royal commissions.\n\n=== Court of Appeal and death ===\nProbably owing to this episode Mathew was not raised to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] until 1901. In his new capacity he displayed all his old qualities of accuracy, common sense, and vigour, but he deprecated elaborate arguments and voluminous citation of authorities, the 'old umbrellas of the law,' as he used to call them. On 6 December 1905 he was seized with a paralytic stroke at the [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athen\u00e6um Club]], and his resignation was announced on the following day. He died in London on 9 November 1908, and was buried in St. Joseph's Cemetery at Cork.\n\n=== Assessment ===\nIn many respects Mathew was a typical representative of the south of Ireland. Ready and facile of speech, he was gifted with a delightful flow of humour and a strong appreciation of the lighter side of life. An ardent radical and a devout Roman Catholic, he maintained the happiest relations with many who were vehemently opposed to him in religion and politics; on circuit he was always a welcome visitor at the houses of the dignitaries of the Church of England. A man of wide reading and culture, he was a warm-hearted and faithful friend.\n\n== Family ==\nMathew married on 26 December 1861 Elizabeth, daughter of Edwin Biron, vicar of [[Lympne]] near [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]]; she survived him. There were two sons and three daughters of the marriage.\n\nHis eldest daughter Elizabeth married in 1895 the Irish MP [[John Dillon]], and was the mother of the Irish politician [[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|James Matthew Dillon]].\n\nBoth of Mathew's sons became barristers. The elder, [[Theobald Mathew (legal humourist)|Theobald Mathew]], was a well-known legal wit, while the younger, [[Charles Mathew]] KC, was briefly a Labour MP. Charles Mathew's son, [[Theobald Mathew (Director of Public Prosecutions)|Sir Theobald Mathew]], was the longest-serving [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]].\n\n== References ==\n{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Mathew, James Charles (DNB12)|title=|last=Atlay|first=James Beresford|authorlink=|volume=II|pages=|quote=|accessdate=|comment=|ref=}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mathew, James}}\n[[Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin]]\n[[Category:1908 deaths]]\n[[Category:Queen's Bench Division judges]]\n[[Category:Lords Justices of Appeal]]\n[[Category:People from County Cork]]\n[[Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1830 births]]\n", "name_user": "Smirkybec", "label": "safe", "comment": "adding link for Elizabeth Dillon", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Charles_Mathew"}

It is now a part of [[Racing FC Union Luxembourg]].\n\n==History==\n\nUnion Luxembourg was formed in 1925 as an amalgam of [[US Hollerich Bonnevoie]] and [[Jeunesse Sportive Verlorenkost]].  Although US Hollerich had been one of the top clubs in Luxembourg, winning five titles consecutively, by 1925, its success had dried up.  From the merger until the [[Second World War]], the club would win only one trophy: the [[Luxembourg National Division|championship]] in 1927.\n\nIn 1940, the [[Nazi]]s renamed Union, along with all other clubs as part of the process of [[Germanisation]].  Between 1940 and 1944, Union's name would be ''Verein f\u00fcr Rasenspiele 08 Luxemburg''.  The end of occupation and reversion of moniker did little to change Union's success (or lack thereof); a solitary [[Luxembourg Cup]] was all that Union had to show for the first fifteen years of freedom after the war.\n\nHowever, that all changed very swiftly, as Union hit its stride, beginning with another cup victory in 1959.  Between 1959 and 1971, Union won two league titles and the Luxembourg Cup five times.  Another barren spell followed; the 1970s and 1980s saw Luxembourg finish consistently in the top four in the league, but, in seventeen years, Luxembourg reached only two cup finals and finished in the two top just once.\n\nAnother sudden spike of success came at the end of the 1980s.  Luxembourg won three National Division titles back-to-back between 1990 and 1992 and returned to the habit of European qualification.  Nonetheless, as with so many clubs in Luxembourg during the 1990s and 2000s, Union could not withstand the pressure to consolidate.  Union arranged a merger with [[CA Spora Luxembourg]] and [[CS Alliance 01]] to form its modern form, [[Racing FC Union Luxembourg]], to take effect after the [[Luxembourg National Division 2004-05|2004\u201305 season]].  As it happens, Union was relegated in 2004\u201305 (as was Spora), marking an unfitting end to one of Luxembourg's most successful clubs.\n\n==Honours==\n*'''[[Luxembourg National Division|National Division]]'''\n:Winners (6): [[1926\u201327 Luxembourg National Division|1926\u201327]], [[1961\u201362 Luxembourg National Division|1961\u201362]], [[1970\u201371 Luxembourg National Division|1970\u201371]], [[1989\u201390 Luxembourg National Division|1989\u201390]], [[1990\u201391 Luxembourg National Division|1990\u201391]], [[1991\u201392 Luxembourg National Division|1991\u201392]]\n:Runners-up (9): 1921\u201322, 1947\u201348, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364, 1964\u201365, 1965\u201366, 1972\u201373, 1992\u201393, [[1997\u201398 Luxembourg National Division|1997\u201398]]\n\n*'''[[Luxembourg Cup]]'''\n:Winners (10): 1946\u201347, 1958\u201359, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364, 1968\u201369, 1969\u201370, 1985\u201386, 1988\u201389, 1990\u201391, 1995\u201396\n:Runners-up (10): 1922\u201323, 1925\u201326, 1932\u201333, 1936\u201337, 1960\u201361, 1961\u201362, 1966\u201367, 1977\u201378, 1982\u201383, 1996\u201397\n\n===As US Hollerich Bonnevoie===\n*'''[[Luxembourg National Division|National Division]]'''\n:Winners (5): 1911\u201312, 1913\u201314, 1914\u201315, 1915\u201316, 1916\u201317\n:Runners-up (2): 1909\u201310, 1917\u201318\n\n==European Competition==\n\nUnion Luxembourg qualified for UEFA European competition 21 times.\n\n*'''[[UEFA Champions League]]'''\n:Qualifying round (1): 1971\u201372\n:First round (4): 1962\u201363, 1990\u201391, 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393\n\n*'''[[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]]'''\n:Qualifying round (2): 1996\u201397, 1997\u201398\n:First round (8): 1963\u201364, 1964\u201365, 1969\u201370, 1970\u201371, 1978\u201379, 1984\u201385, 1986\u201387, 1989\u201390\n\n*'''[[UEFA Cup]]'''\n:Qualifying round (1): 1998\u201399\n:First round (5): 1965\u201366, 1966\u201367, 1973\u201374, 1988\u201389, 1993\u201394\n\nWithout having won a tie, Union won two matches against European opponents.

As other top Third Reich figures, such as [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Martin Bormann]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], and [[Albert Speer]], began to frequent the area the Party began to purchase and requisition land in the Obersalzberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uncommon-travel-germany.com/obersalzberg.html|title=History of the Obersalzberg, Hitler's Mountain|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn order to serve as an outpost of the German ''[[Reichskanzlei]]'' (Imperial Chancellery), Berchtesgaden and its environs (''Stanggass'') saw substantial expansion of offices, security, and support services, mainly on the Obersalzberg.  Included in the town were a [[Berchtesgaden Hauptbahnhof|new railway station]], with a reception area for Hitler and his guests, and an adjacent post office. The Berchtesgadener Hof Hotel, where famous visitors such as [[Neville Chamberlain]] and [[David Lloyd George]] stayed, was substantially upgraded.\n\nEven though a feared \"[[national redoubt]]\" last stand of the Nazi Regime in the Alps failed to materialize late in World War II, the Allies launched a devastating air raid on the Berchtesgaden area in the spring of 1945.  Concentrated on the Obersalzberg, the [[Bombing of Obersalzberg|April 25 bombing]] did little damage to the town.  On May 4, forward elements of the [[7th Infantry Regiment (United States)|7th Infantry Regiment]] of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] arrived<ref name=historynet>[http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-race-to-seize-berchtesgaden.htm World War II: Race to Seize Berchtesgaden] HistoryNet 12 June 2006</ref> and received the town's surrender.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-SS-Chronology/USA-SS-Chronology-5.html UNITED STATES ARMY IN WORLD WAR II, Special Studies, CHRONOLOGY 1941\u20131945]. \"In U.S. Seventh Army's XV Corps area, 7th Inf of 3d Div, crossing into Austria, advances through Salzburg to Berchtesgaden without opposition\".</ref>\n\n===Post\u2013World War II===\nAfter the war, Obersalzberg became a military zone and most of its buildings were requisitioned by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].

The earliest [[China|Chinese]] [[magnetic]] compasses were possibly used to order and harmonize buildings in accordance with the geomantic principles of ''[[feng shui]]''. These early compasses were made with [[lodestone]], a form of the mineral [[magnetite]] that is a naturally occurring [[magnet]] and aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\"/> People in ancient China discovered that if a lodestone was suspended so it could turn freely, it would always point toward the magnetic poles. Early compasses were used to choose areas suitable for building houses, growing crops, and to search for rare gems. Compasses were later adapted for navigation during the [[Song Dynasty]] in the 11th century.<ref name=\"cambridge1\" />\n\nBased on Krotser and Coe's discovery of an [[Olmec]] [[hematite]] artifact in [[Mesoamerica]], [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to 1400\u20131000 BC, astronomer John Carlson has hypothesized that the Olmec might have used the geomagnetic [[lodestone]] earlier than 1000 BC for [[geomancy]], a method of [[divination]], which if proven true, predates the Chinese use of magnetism for [[feng shui]] by a millennium.<ref name=\"John B.

These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 [[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]].  The bearing compass was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand.  In 1885, a patent was granted for a [[hand compass]] fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the ''[[sighting compass|prismatic compass]]''.<ref>Frazer, Persifor, ''A Convenient Device to be Applied to the Hand Compass'', Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 22, No. 118 (Mar., 1885), p. 216</ref>  Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror.

Dissatisfied with existing field compasses, which required a separate protractor in order to take bearings from a map, Tillander decided to incorporate both instruments into a single instrument. It combined a compass with a protractor built into the base.  His design featured a metal compass capsule containing a magnetic needle with orienting marks mounted into a transparent protractor baseplate with a lubber line (later called a ''direction of travel indicator'').  By rotating the capsule to align the needle with the orienting marks, the course bearing could be read at the lubber line.  Moreover, by aligning the baseplate with a course drawn on a map \u2013 ignoring the needle \u2013 the compass could also function as a protractor.  Tillander took his design to fellow orienteers [[Bj\u00f6rn Kjellstr\u00f6m|Bj\u00f6rn]], Alvid, and Alvar Kjellstr\u00f6m, who were selling basic compasses, and the four men modified Tillander's design.<ref name=\"LIT\">Litsky, Frank, ''Bjorn Kjellstrom, 84, Orienteer and Inventor of Modern Compass'', Obituaries, The New York Times, 1 September 1995</ref>  In December 1932, the Silva Company was formed with Tillander and the three Kjellstr\u00f6m brothers, and the company began manufacturing and selling its [[Silva compass|Silva orienteering compass]] to Swedish orienteers, outdoorsmen, and army officers.<ref name=\"LIT\" /><ref>Seidman, p. 68</ref><ref>Kjellstr\u00f6m, Bj\u00f6rn, ''19th Hole: The Readers Take Over: Orienteering'', Sports Illustrated, 3 March 1969</ref><ref>Silva Sweden AB, ''Silva Sweden AB and Silva Production AB Become One Company: History'', Press Release 28 April 2000</ref>\n\n== Liquid compass ==\n[[File:Flush mount compass.jpg|thumb|A surface liquid-filled compass on a boat]]\n\nThe liquid compass is a design in which the magnetized needle or card is damped by fluid to protect against excessive swing or wobble, improving readability while reducing wear. A rudimentary working model of a liquid compass was introduced by Sir [[Edmund Halley]] at a meeting of the [[Royal Society]] in 1690.<ref>Gubbins, David, ''Encyclopedia of Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism'', Springer Press (2007), {{ISBN|1-4020-3992-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-3992-8}}, p. 67</ref>  However, as early liquid compasses were fairly cumbersome and heavy, and subject to damage, their main advantage was aboard ship.  Protected in a [[binnacle]] and normally [[gimbal]]-mounted, the liquid inside the compass housing effectively damped shock and vibration, while eliminating excessive swing and grounding of the card caused by the pitch and roll of the vessel. The first liquid mariner's compass believed practicable for limited use was patented by the Englishman Francis Crow in 1813.<ref>Fanning, A.E., ''Steady As She Goes: A History of the Compass Department of the Admiralty'', HMSO, Department of the Admiralty (1986), pp. 1-10</ref><ref>Gubbins, p. 67</ref>  Liquid-damped marine compasses for ships and small boats were occasionally used by the [[Royal Navy]] from the 1830s through 1860, but the standard Admiralty compass remained a dry-mount type.<ref>Fanning, A.E., pp. 1-10</ref>  In the latter year, the American physicist and inventor [[Edward Samuel Ritchie]] patented a greatly improved liquid marine compass that was adopted in revised form for general use by the [[United States Navy]], and later purchased by the Royal Navy as well.<ref>Warner, Deborah, ''Compasses and Coils: The Instrument Business of Edward S. Ritchie'', Rittenhouse, Vol. 9, No. 1 (1994), pp. 1-24</ref>\n\nDespite these advances, the liquid compass was not introduced generally into the Royal Navy until 1908. An early version developed by RN Captain Creak proved to be operational under heavy gunfire and seas, but was felt to lack navigational precision compared with the design by Lord Kelvin.<ref name=\"W.

The gyrocompass was patented in 1885 by Marinus Gerardus van den Bos in The Netherlands after continuous spinning was made possible by small electric motors, which were in turn a technological outcome of the discovery of magnetic induction.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\"/> Yet only in 1906 was the German inventor [[Hermann Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe]] (1872\u20131931) able to build the first practical gyrocompass. It had two major advantages over magnetic compasses: it indicated true north and was unaffected by ferromagnetic materials, such as the steel hull of ships.

These early compasses were made with [[lodestone]], a form of the mineral [[magnetite]] that is a naturally occurring [[magnet]] and aligns itself with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\"/> People in ancient China discovered that if a lodestone was suspended so it could turn freely, it would always point toward the magnetic poles.

These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 [[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]].  The bearing compass was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand.  In 1885, a patent was granted for a [[hand compass]] fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the ''[[sighting compass|prismatic compass]]''.<ref>Frazer, Persifor, ''A Convenient Device to be Applied to the Hand Compass'', Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 22, No. 118 (Mar., 1885), p. 216</ref>  Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror.

Dissatisfied with existing field compasses, which required a separate protractor in order to take bearings from a map, Tillander decided to incorporate both instruments into a single instrument. It combined a compass with a protractor built into the base.  His design featured a metal compass capsule containing a magnetic needle with orienting marks mounted into a transparent protractor baseplate with a lubber line (later called a ''direction of travel indicator'').  By rotating the capsule to align the needle with the orienting marks, the course bearing could be read at the lubber line.  Moreover, by aligning the baseplate with a course drawn on a map \u2013 ignoring the needle \u2013 the compass could also function as a protractor.  Tillander took his design to fellow orienteers [[Bj\u00f6rn Kjellstr\u00f6m|Bj\u00f6rn]], Alvid, and Alvar Kjellstr\u00f6m, who were selling basic compasses, and the four men modified Tillander's design.<ref name=\"LIT\">Litsky, Frank, ''Bjorn Kjellstrom, 84, Orienteer and Inventor of Modern Compass'', Obituaries, The New York Times, 1 September 1995</ref>  In December 1932, the Silva Company was formed with Tillander and the three Kjellstr\u00f6m brothers, and the company began manufacturing and selling its [[Silva compass|Silva orienteering compass]] to Swedish orienteers, outdoorsmen, and army officers.<ref name=\"LIT\" /><ref>Seidman, p. 68</ref><ref>Kjellstr\u00f6m, Bj\u00f6rn, ''19th Hole: The Readers Take Over: Orienteering'', Sports Illustrated, 3 March 1969</ref><ref>Silva Sweden AB, ''Silva Sweden AB and Silva Production AB Become One Company: History'', Press Release 28 April 2000</ref>\n\n== Liquid compass ==\n[[File:Flush mount compass.jpg|thumb|A surface liquid-filled compass on a boat]]\n\nThe liquid compass is a design in which the magnetized needle or card is damped by fluid to protect against excessive swing or wobble, improving readability while reducing wear. A rudimentary working model of a liquid compass was introduced by Sir [[Edmund Halley]] at a meeting of the [[Royal Society]] in 1690.<ref>Gubbins, David, ''Encyclopedia of Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism'', Springer Press (2007), {{ISBN|1-4020-3992-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4020-3992-8}}, p. 67</ref>  However, as early liquid compasses were fairly cumbersome and heavy, and subject to damage, their main advantage was aboard ship.  Protected in a [[binnacle]] and normally [[gimbal]]-mounted, the liquid inside the compass housing effectively damped shock and vibration, while eliminating excessive swing and grounding of the card caused by the pitch and roll of the vessel. The first liquid mariner's compass believed practicable for limited use was patented by the Englishman Francis Crow in 1813.<ref>Fanning, A.E., ''Steady As She Goes: A History of the Compass Department of the Admiralty'', HMSO, Department of the Admiralty (1986), pp. 1-10</ref><ref>Gubbins, p. 67</ref>  Liquid-damped marine compasses for ships and small boats were occasionally used by the [[Royal Navy]] from the 1830s through 1860, but the standard Admiralty compass remained a dry-mount type.<ref>Fanning, A.E., pp. 1-10</ref>  In the latter year, the American physicist and inventor [[Edward Samuel Ritchie]] patented a greatly improved liquid marine compass that was adopted in revised form for general use by the [[United States Navy]], and later purchased by the Royal Navy as well.<ref>Warner, Deborah, ''Compasses and Coils: The Instrument Business of Edward S. Ritchie'', Rittenhouse, Vol. 9, No. 1 (1994), pp. 1-24</ref>\n\nDespite these advances, the liquid compass was not introduced generally into the Royal Navy until 1908. An early version developed by RN Captain Creak proved to be operational under heavy gunfire and seas, but was felt to lack navigational precision compared with the design by Lord Kelvin.<ref name=\"W. H. Creak 238-239\" /><ref>Gubbins, p. 67: The use of parallel or multiple needles was by no means a new development; their use in dry-mount marine compasses was pioneered by navigation officers of the [[Dutch East India Company]] as early as 1649.</ref> However, with ship and gun sizes continuously increasing, the advantages of the liquid compass over the Kelvin compass became unavoidably apparent to the Admiralty, and after widespread adoption by other navies, the liquid compass was generally adopted by the Royal Navy.<ref name=\"W.

They are particularly distinguished from other turtles by being land-dwelling, while many (though not all) other turtle species are at least partly aquatic. Like other turtles, tortoises have a [[turtle shell|shell]] to protect from predation and other threats. The shell in tortoises is generally hard, and like other members of the suborder [[Cryptodira]], they retract their necks and heads directly backwards into the shell to protect them.\n\nTortoises are unique among [[vertebrates]] in that the [[pectoral girdle|pectoral]] and [[pelvic girdle]]s are inside the ribcage rather than outside. Tortoises can vary in dimension from a few centimeters to two meters. They are usually [[Diurnality|diurnal]] animals with tendencies to be [[crepuscular]] depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally [[reclusive]] animals. Tortoises are the longest-living land animal in the world, although the longest-living species of tortoise is a matter of debate. [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]]s are noted to live over 150 years, but an [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] named [[Adwaita]] may have been the longest living at an estimated 255 years. In general, most tortoise species can live 80\u2013150 years.\n\nAlthough widely unknown, Tortoises are the ground transport and heavy infantry of the Reptilian World Order, the Parent Agency of the [[United Nations]]. \n\n==Terminology==\nDifferences exist in usage of the common terms [[turtle]], tortoise, and [[terrapin]], depending on the variety of English being used; usage is inconsistent and contradictory.<ref name=\"Simoons\">Simoons, Frederick J.

Incubation is characteristically long in most species, the average incubation period are between 100 and 160 days. Egg-laying typically occurs at night, after which the mother tortoise covers her [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] with sand, soil, and organic material. The eggs are left unattended, and depending on the species, take from 60 to 120 days to incubate.<ref name=\"Incubation\">{{cite web|author=Highfield, Andy|url=http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/eggfaq.html|title=Tortoise egg incubation|publisher=Tortoisetrust.org|accessdate=2009-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905231033/http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/eggfaq.html|archive-date=2013-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The size of the egg depends on the size of the mother and can be estimated by examining the width of the [[cloacal]] opening between the [[carapace]] and [[Turtle shell#Plastron|plastron]]. The plastron of a female tortoise often has a noticeable V-shaped notch below the tail which facilitates passing the eggs. Upon completion of the incubation period, a fully formed [[hatchling]] uses an [[egg tooth]] to break out of its shell. It digs to the surface of the nest and begins a life of survival on its own. They are hatched with an embryonic egg sac which serves as a source of nutrition for the first three to seven days until they have the strength and mobility to find food. Juvenile tortoises often require a different balance of nutrients than adults, so may eat foods which a more mature tortoise would not. For example, the young of a strictly [[herbivory|herbivorous]] species commonly will consume [[worm]]s or insect [[larva]]e for additional protein.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe number of concentric rings on the carapace, much like the cross-section of a [[tree]], can sometimes give a clue to how old the animal is, but, since the growth depends highly on the accessibility of food and water, a tortoise that has access to plenty of [[forage]] (or is regularly fed by its owner) with no seasonal variation will have no noticeable rings. Moreover, some tortoises grow more than one ring per season, and in some others, due to wear, some rings are no longer visible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Veterinary Services Department, Drs.

The females, as a general rule, have smaller tails, dropped down, whereas the males have much longer tails which are usually pulled up and to the side of the rear shell.\n\n===Brain===\nThe brain of a tortoise is extremely small. The tortoises, from Central and South America, do not have an area in the brain called the [[hippocampus]], which relates to emotion, learning, memory and spatial navigation.

They are particularly distinguished from other turtles by being land-dwelling, while many (though not all) other turtle species are at least partly aquatic. Like other turtles, tortoises have a [[turtle shell|shell]] to protect from predation and other threats. The shell in tortoises is generally hard, and like other members of the suborder [[Cryptodira]], they retract their necks and heads directly backwards into the shell to protect them.\n\nTortoises are unique among [[vertebrates]] in that the [[pectoral girdle|pectoral]] and [[pelvic girdle]]s are inside the ribcage rather than outside. Tortoises can vary in dimension from a few centimeters to two meters. They are usually [[Diurnality|diurnal]] animals with tendencies to be [[crepuscular]] depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally [[reclusive]] animals. Tortoises are the longest-living land animal in the world, although the longest-living species of tortoise is a matter of debate. [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]]s are noted to live over 150 years, but an [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] named [[Adwaita]] may have been the longest living at an estimated 255 years. In general, most tortoise species can live 80\u2013150 years.\n\n==Terminology==\nDifferences exist in usage of the common terms [[turtle]], tortoise, and [[terrapin]], depending on the variety of English being used; usage is inconsistent and contradictory.<ref name=\"Simoons\">Simoons, Frederick J.

Incubation is characteristically long in most species, the average incubation period are between 100 and 160 days. Egg-laying typically occurs at night, after which the mother tortoise covers her [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] with sand, soil, and organic material. The eggs are left unattended, and depending on the species, take from 60 to 120 days to incubate.<ref name=\"Incubation\">{{cite web|author=Highfield, Andy|url=http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/eggfaq.html|title=Tortoise egg incubation|publisher=Tortoisetrust.org|accessdate=2009-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905231033/http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/eggfaq.html|archive-date=2013-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The size of the egg depends on the size of the mother and can be estimated by examining the width of the [[cloacal]] opening between the [[carapace]] and [[Turtle shell#Plastron|plastron]]. The plastron of a female tortoise often has a noticeable V-shaped notch below the tail which facilitates passing the eggs. Upon completion of the incubation period, a fully formed [[hatchling]] uses an [[egg tooth]] to break out of its shell. It digs to the surface of the nest and begins a life of survival on its own. They are hatched with an embryonic egg sac which serves as a source of nutrition for the first three to seven days until they have the strength and mobility to find food. Juvenile tortoises often require a different balance of nutrients than adults, so may eat foods which a more mature tortoise would not. For example, the young of a strictly [[herbivory|herbivorous]] species commonly will consume [[worm]]s or insect [[larva]]e for additional protein.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe number of concentric rings on the carapace, much like the cross-section of a [[tree]], can sometimes give a clue to how old the animal is, but, since the growth depends highly on the accessibility of food and water, a tortoise that has access to plenty of [[forage]] (or is regularly fed by its owner) with no seasonal variation will have no noticeable rings. Moreover, some tortoises grow more than one ring per season, and in some others, due to wear, some rings are no longer visible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Veterinary Services Department, Drs.

The easiest way to determine the sex of a tortoise is to look at the tail. The females, as a general rule, have smaller tails, dropped down, whereas the males have much longer tails which are usually pulled up and to the side of the rear shell.\n\n===Brain===\nThe brain of a tortoise is extremely small. The tortoises, from Central and South America, do not have an area in the brain called the [[hippocampus]], which relates to emotion, learning, memory and spatial navigation. Studies have shown that red-footed tortoises may rely on an area of the brain called the medial cortex for emotional actions, an area that humans use for actions such as decision making.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/47155-tortoise-touchscreen-learning.html|title=Tortoises Show Off Smarts by Mastering Touch-Screen Tech|newspaper=Live Science|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, [[Francesco Redi]] performed an experiment that involved removing the brain of a land tortoise, which then proceeded to live six months. Freshwater tortoises, when subjected to the same experiment, continued similarly, but did not live so long.

Pet tortoises typically require diets based on wild grasses, weeds, leafy greens and certain flowers. Certain species consume [[worm]]s or [[insect]]s and carrion in their normal habitats. Too much protein is detrimental in herbivorous species, and has been associated with shell deformities and other medical problems. As different tortoise species vary greatly in their nutritional requirements, it is essential to thoroughly research the dietary needs of individual tortoises.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThis species list largely follows [[Turtle Taxonomy Working Group]] (2019)<ref name=iucn>{{cite journal|url=http://images.turtleconservancy.org/documents/2017/crm-7-checklist-atlas-v8-2017.pdf |title=Turtles of the world, 2017 update: Annotated checklist and atlas of taxonomy, synonymy, distribution, and conservation status(8th Ed.)|journal=Chelonian Research Monographs |volume=7 |accessdate=October 4, 2019|date=August 3, 2017 |last1=Rhodin | first1=Anders G.J. |last2=Inverson |first2=John B. |last3=Roger |first3=Bour |last4=Fritz |first4=Uwe |last5=Georges |first5=Arthur |last6=Shaffer |first6=H.
