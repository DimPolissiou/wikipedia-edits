{"title_page": "Fender Deluxe", "text_new": "{{about||Deluxe-series amplifiers with built-in reverb|Fender Deluxe Reverb|humbucker-equiped variant of the Telecaster guitar|Fender Telecaster Deluxe}}\nThe '''Fender Deluxe''' [[guitar amplifier]] is a range of non-reverb guitar amplifiers produced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]].  The amplifiers were originally produced from early 1948 to 1966 and reissues are in current production.  Its predecessor was the Fender Model 26 [[Fender Amplifiers#Early amplifiers: K.26F and Woodie|\"Woodie\"]] produced from 1946 to 1948.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-woodie-deluxe-model-26/|title=Fender Woody Deluxe (Model 26) \u2013 Ampwares}}</ref>\n\n== Tweed Deluxe ==\nThe Fender Deluxe amp of the 1950s was a medium-powered unit designed to let guitarists \"hold their own\" in a small group. As [[blues]], [[western swing]], [[Western music (North America)|Western]], and [[rockabilly]] bands began getting louder, the overdriven tone of a cranked-up Deluxe found its way onto many live and recorded performances.\n\nThe earliest version of the Deluxe was the 5A3,<ref>http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender-Deluxe-5A3-Schematic.pdf</ref> and is often referred to as having a TV Front appearance because the wide panels around the grill were like the television sets of the 1950s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ggjaguar.com/50dlx.htm|title=GGJaguar's Guitarium and Ampeteria 1950 Fender Deluxe|website=www.ggjaguar.com}}</ref> This was true also of the smaller [[Fender Princeton]] student and studio amp introduced in 1946 and upgraded in 1948.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ggjaguar.com/prince.htm|title=GGJaguar's Guitarium and Ampeteria 1953 Fender Princeton|website=www.ggjaguar.com}}</ref> Subsequent versions of the Deluxe were the \"wide panel\" cabinet design 5B3,<ref>http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender-Deluxe-5B3-Schematic.pdf</ref> 5C3,<ref>http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender-Deluxe-5C3-Schematic.pdf</ref> and 5D3,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-wide-panel-tweed-deluxe/|title=Fender Wide Panel Tweed Deluxe \u2013 Ampwares}}</ref> followed by the \"narrow panel\" cabinet 5E3.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-narrow-panel-tweed-deluxe/|title=Fender Narrow Panel Tweed Deluxe \u2013 Ampwares}}</ref> The Deluxe was the most popular of the [[Fender tweed|Tweed amplifiers]] made by Fender.<ref>Cf. Weber, p.38</ref>\n\nIt is relatively small in size, having one twelve inch speaker. Depending on the model it has either three or four inputs (5E3<ref name=\"auto\">http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender-Deluxe-5E3-Schematic.pdf</ref>) and two channels. Each channel has a volume control. Both channels share a tone control. The inputs and controls are mounted at the top of the amplifier. It is often referred to as the \"Tweed Deluxe\" because of its covering\u2014a light brown material which is actually a cotton twill that is often lacquered.\n\nAt the time, [[Leo Fender]] produced amplifiers with the intention of having the amplifier stay clean even at high volumes. The Tweed Deluxe is not known for producing a clean tone at high volumes, and as such, was regarded as being an intermediate amplifier. The saturated tone this amplifier produces at higher volumes is the reason why it is one of the more famous amplifiers Fender ever produced. It is part of the signature tone for many musicians, a few notable examples being [[Larry Carlton]], [[Don Felder]], [[Billy Gibbons]] and [[Neil Young]].\n\nUnusual for a Fender amplifier, the Deluxe (models 5D3<ref>http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender-Deluxe-5D3-Schematic.pdf</ref> and 5E3<ref name=\"auto\"/>) has a cathode biased output stage, with no negative feedback (a distinctive combination it shares with the [[Vox AC30]] and the 18 watt Marshall model 1974). The output valves are driven by a cathodyne phase splitter. These aspects of the circuit make a key contribution to the complex, wild and ragged sound of an overdriven 5E3 Deluxe, especially in comparison to other Fender amplifiers. Most Fender push-pull amplifier designs use negative feedback, tapped from the output transformer speaker winding to enable more headroom before power stage distortion starts. They also use the more efficient negative-voltage fixed biasing on the output valves, allowing higher output power while running the output valves at a cooler temperature. (The earlier 5C3 Deluxe model ''did'' use negative feedback although it too was cathode biased.)\n\nThe amplifier has a [[5Y3]]-GT rectifier, 2 [[6V6]]-GT power tubes operating in push-pull mode, and a [[12AX7#Similar twin-triode designs|12AY7]] and a [[12AX7]] in the preamp.<ref>The Tube Store (2010, June 21).

Due to limited power handling, owners sometimes replaced it with the more powerful Jensen P12Q.\n\nThe Tweed Deluxe is such a seminal amplifier, is so desirable and (in its original form) so expensive, that there are at least 30 or 40 companies making clones or variants of it, either as kits or as completed amplifiers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/pm/nov07/articles/torrestweed.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201102001/http://www.soundonsound.com/pm/nov07/articles/torrestweed.htm |archive-date=2014-02-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Brown Deluxe ==\n\nBetween 1959 and 1963, Fender began redressing several of their existing amp models in a light brown material known as [[tolex]], and moving the control faces from the top-rear of the cabinet to the front. These amps are referred to as the [[Fender Amplifiers#Brownface|Brown or Brownface]] Fender amps. The Deluxe was one such model that made this transition in 1961. The circuit was also changed to include a [[tremolo]] effect, separate tone controls for the input channels, and a long-tail pair-type phase inverter. The preamp tube complement was changed to a trio of 12AX7 tubes, and the rectifier was changed to the more efficient GZ34 tube. The pair of 6V6GT power tubes remained the same, although the bias structure was changed from cathode to fixed biasing, bringing the output power up to around 20 watts. The circuit number was changed to 6G3,<ref>http://www.thetubestore.com/lib/thetubestore/schematics/Fender/Fender-Deluxe-6G3-Schematic.pdf</ref> and Fender continued to build and dress the Deluxe in these circuits and cosmetics until 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-brownface-deluxe/|title=Fender Brownface Deluxe \u2013 Ampwares}}</ref>\n\n== Blackface Deluxe ==\n\nFender again made a change in their amplifier cosmetics between 1963 and 1964. The color of the tolex covering was changed to black, and the control knobs were changed from ones with pointers that indicated the level number labeled on the control face to ones that had the level numbers incorporated upon the knobs themselves. These are referred to as the [[Fender Amplifiers#Blackface|Blackface]] amps. The Deluxe was given its new look in 1963, and again, the circuitry was altered to the number AA763, devoting a full 12AX7 to the preamp of each of the relabeled \"Normal\" and \"Vibrato\" channels, as well as to the oscillator for the tremolo effect, a [[12AX7#Similar twin-triode designs|12AT7]] tube as a phase inverter, and individual Treble and Bass control knobs rather than single tone controls for each channel. The output bias remained fixed, but incorporated a [[potentiometer]] to make bias adjustment simpler. The output was also bumped to 22 watts.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://ampwares.com/amplifiers/fender-blackface-deluxe/|title=Fender Blackface Deluxe \u2013 Ampwares}}</ref>\n\nWhen Fender redressed the Deluxe in 1963, they began producing a spin-off model that included an integrated [[Reverberation#Spring reverberators|spring reverb]] tank, thus giving birth to the [[Fender Deluxe Reverb]]. Fender discontinued the base Deluxe model in 1966<ref name=\"auto1\"/> but as of 2018, the Deluxe Reverb version was still in production.\n\n== Reproduction ==\nIn 2007\u20132011, Fender's Custom Shop division made an authentic recreation of the 5E3 Deluxe. Handwired point-to-point and with custom made transformers based on the 1957 specification it was dubbed the '''Fender '57 Deluxe Amp'''. This is the first time Fender made a reproduction of the Tweed Deluxe.\n\nIn 2012 Fender issued an Artist Signature amplifier based on the 5E3 circuit with the addition of a tremolo effect; the '''Fender Eric Clapton (or EC) Tremolux'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fender.com/series/artist-signature/ec-tremolux-120v/|title=Shop Fender &#124; Electric Guitars, Acoustics, Bass, Amps & More}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 Fender introduced a piggyback head version of the 5E3 Deluxe to the Custom Shop lineup, dubbed the '''Fender '57 Deluxe Head'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.premierguitar.com/blogs/5-daily-news/post/20150-fender-introduces-65-deluxe-reverb-head-and-57-deluxe-head|title=Fender Introduces '65 Deluxe Reverb Head and '57 Deluxe Head|website=www.premierguitar.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fender.com/series/custom/57-deluxe-head-120v/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110173418/http://www.fender.com/series/custom/57-deluxe-head-120v/ |archive-date=2014-01-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2016 Fender issued a hand-wired Artist Signature model, \"'''Fender Edge Deluxe'''\", based on a customized 1957 5E3 Tweed Deluxe, part of the rig of U2-guitarist \"The Edge\".

After one year at [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], he signed for [[Juventus]] for \u20ac25&nbsp;million in 2009. Melo spent four seasons at [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], playing 154 total games and winning eight honours including three [[S\u00fcper Lig]] titles. After a spell back in [[Serie A]] with [[Inter Milan]], he returned to Brazil in 2017 by signing for [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], where he soon won the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A]] in 2018.\n                                                                                  \nMelo was a [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian international]] from 2009 to 2010, earning 22 caps and scoring two goals.

Following impressive performances with Flamengo, Melo transferred to [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] in the summer of 2003, but would remain for just one season. In his single season with Cruzeiro, Melo managed to make 31 league appearances, scoring two goals. Following yet another impressive season in Brazil, he was sold to [[Gr\u00eamio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Gr\u00eamio]].\n\nFollowing his transfer to Gr\u00eamio, Melo managed to make an additional 19 appearances and adding three goals to his tally in his native Brazil.

After one year at [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], he signed for [[Juventus]] for \u20ac25&nbsp;million in 2009. Melo spent four seasons at [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], playing 154 total games and winning eight honours including three [[S\u00fcper Lig]] titles. After a spell back in [[Serie A]] with [[Inter Milan]], he returned to Brazil in 2017 by signing for [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], where he soon won the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A]] in 2018.\n                                                                                  \nMelo was a [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian international]] from 2009 to 2010, earning 22 caps and scoring two goals. He was part of their squads that won the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]] and reached the quarter-finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Brazil===\nMelo began his career for [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], where he made 69 appearances and scored no goals in his two-season spell with the club. Following impressive performances with Flamengo, Melo transferred to [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] in the summer of 2003, but would remain for just one season. In his single season with Cruzeiro, Melo managed to make 31 league appearances, scoring two goals. Following yet another impressive season in Brazil, he was sold to [[Gr\u00eamio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Gr\u00eamio]].\n\nFollowing his transfer to Gr\u00eamio, Melo managed to make an additional 19 appearances and adding three goals to his tally in his native Brazil.

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.
