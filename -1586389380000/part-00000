He was recognised as the leading humourist in the House of Commons.\n\nLawson was Member for [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]], 1859\u201365, 1868\u201385; [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]], 1886\u20131900; [[Camborne (UK Parliament constituency)|Camborne]], 1903\u20131906; and Cockermouth 1906. He was the son of [[Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 1st Baronet, of Brayton]], who changed his name from Wybergh, and Caroline Graham, daughter of [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]]. He was privately educated at home. He was a founder member of both the [[National Liberal Club]] and the [[Reform League]], a prominent member of the [[Peace Society]], and the [[Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade]]. He was a director of the  [[Maryport and Carlisle Railway]] and a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Cumberland.<ref name=Debrett>[https://archive.org/stream/debrettshouseo1881londuoft#page/134/mode/2up Debretts House of Commons and the Judicial Bench 1881]</ref> He was always an enthusiast in the cause of temperance and in 1879 he became president of the [[United Kingdom Alliance]]. He was, like his younger brother [[William Lawson (co-operator)|William]], a forward thinking co-operator and agriculturalist.<ref>The Concise Dictionary Of National Biography, Vol 2 page 1743</ref>\n\n==Early days==\nWilfrid Lawson the son of [[Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 1st Baronet, of Brayton]], was born at [[Brayton Hall, Cumberland|Brayton Hall]], [[Aspatria]], [[Cumberland]] on 4 September 1829. Since the family preferred a simple sporting life, they encouraged their children to enjoy a string of outdoor pursuits, including [[fishing]], [[shooting]], [[ice skating]], [[cricket]] and the family obsession, [[foxhunting]]. He bought [[John Peel (huntsman)|John Peel's]] pack of hounds after Peel's death and became Master of the Cumberland Foxhounds. From early childhood he developed an exceptional talent for mimicry and a talent for writing rapid, fluent, and vigorous verse that played so conspicuous a part in the serious correspondence of his mature life.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 9</ref>\n\nHe received his education at home under the tutorship of John Oswald Jackson, a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister of some repute.<ref>Some Notable Cumbrians, Chance page 60</ref>   In later life, both Lawson and his celebrated brother [[William Lawson (co-operator)|William]]<ref>Ten Years Of Gentleman Farming, Lawson and Hunter, page 14</ref>   openly declared their lack of formal education.  Jackson predominantly taught his pupils [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] [[prose]], complemented with [[mathematics]], [[natural science]]s, [[political economy]], [[English language|English]] and foreign [[history]], with the elements of [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] to enhance the curriculum.  Lawson also gained a fondness for [[poetry]], in particular the works of [[Lord Byron]], whose lines often adorned his political speeches.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 56-57</ref>\n\n===Family===\n[[File:Mary Lawson circa 1900.jpg|thumb|Mary Lawson circa 1900]]\nOn 13 November 1860, Lawson married Mary, daughter of Joseph Pocklington Senhouse of Netherhall, [[Maryport]], [[Cumberland]].<ref>Carlisle Journal 16 November 1860</ref> Their union produced eight children; four boys, Wilfrid, Mordaunt, Arthur and Godfrey; and four girls. Ellen, Mabel, Lucy and Josephine. Ellen married [[Viscount Knutsford|Arthur Henry Holland-Hibbert, 3rd Viscount Knutsford]] (1855\u20131935),<ref>Maryport Advertiser, 7 November 1884</ref> they produced one daughter named Elsie and one son named Thurstan. In 1895, Mabel married Alan de Lancey Curwen of [[Workington Hall]], they had three children. In 1896, Lucy married Edward Heathcote Thruston of [[Pennal]] Tower, Mochgullith, [[North Wales]]<ref>West Cumberland Times, 9 May 1896</ref> In 1909 Josephine married [[Frederick William Chance]], the member of Parliament for the city of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].\nMary's sister Blanche married Alfred Curzon, 4th [[Baron Scarsdale]] (1831\u20131916). Blanche was the mother of [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], [[Viceroy of India]].\nLawson succeeded to the baronetcy and estates upon the death of his father in 1867.\n\n===Early political influences===\n\nWith limited access to his intellectual peers, Lawson received his political convictions from his father and a constant stream of influential household guests. In 1840, the family explored the consequences of adopting [[free trade]] and the repeal of the iniquitous [[Corn Laws]]. They eagerly digested the speeches of [[John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland|Granby]], [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]], and the [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]] on one side and of [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], [[John Bright|Bright]] and [[Charles Pelham Villiers|Villiers]] on the other, with the caricatured comments of [[Punch (magazine)|Mr. Punch]], to enrich the subject. \n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Lawson 2nd Baronet circa 1860.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wilfrid Lawson circa 1860]]\nThe Lawsons shared the opinions of [[Radicals (UK)|radicals]], who argued that [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] were parasites of the state raising the price of the people's bread as a means of helping the landed interests and to add revenue to the state coffers which could be used for the anti-Christian purposes of corruption and foreign war.<ref>The Rise and Fall of Liberal Government in Victorian Britain, Jonathon Parry, (Yale 1993), page 163</ref> In 1843, after attending a series of travelling lectures given by [[Thomas Chalmers|Chalmers]] and [[Robert Smith Candlish|Candlish]], they re-enacted the prominent debates relating to the question of [[Separation of church and state|Church and State]] and discussed the [[Church of Scotland|Scottish church]] and its recent schism, when 451 ministers seceded, leaving the [[Kirk]] to form the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]].  In 1843, they debated the [[Rebecca Riots]]; and after [[Daniel O'Connell]] electrified [[Ireland]] with his desire to repeal the union they consumed endless hours debating the everlasting [[Irish Question]]. In 1848, they contemplated the events surrounding revolution, when the morning newspapers reported some fresh upheaval, spreading relentlessly across [[Europe]], shaking [[Monarchy|kingdoms]] and thrones, causing terrific slaughter in [[France]], provoking [[Chartism|Chartist]] riots in [[England]], and bringing home lessons of deep political importance. Throughout the 1840s, they debated the morality of war, with particular reference to the [[First Anglo-Afghan War|Afghan]] and the [[First Opium War|Chinese Opium Wars]]. As the wars concluded the question of peace came to the fore. The leaflets of [[Elihu Burritt]]' a leading peace campaigners were awaited and absorbed on publication, while another apostle of peace, [[Henry Richard]] made a lecturing visit to Brayton. Lawson completed his education by reading [[The Nonconformist]], edited by [[Edward Miall]]. Many of these early [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] refrains forged his character and formed his opinions and convictions pushing him along a path that led from [[romanticism]] and [[Evangelicalism]] to [[Cobdenism]].<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 296-300</ref>\n\n===Political style===\nIn his lifetime Lawson was one of Britain's most celebrated and popular political figures and yet he was not a [[pamphleteer]] or an essayist, nor was he the owner of a newspaper or a [[Periodical literature|periodical]] like his radical colleagues, [[Joseph Cowen]] and [[Henry Labouchere]]. His strength of argument came from his unique way of transmitting the spoken word, which seldom lacked qualities of humour or entertainment such that his precise, logical, well-balanced arguments ranked high, when compared to contemporary political orators. Lawson became the chief [[jester]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], where he contributed a rich, racy style to debates, earning him the epithet the \"witty [[baronet]]\".<ref>A Diary of Two Parliaments: Disraeli's Parliament 1874\u20131880, Henry. W Lucy, published in 2 Vol.s, (London 1885), page 100-1</ref> \n[[File:One of the many caricature depictions.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the many caricature depictions]]\nLawson was a member of innumerable societies and [[Advocacy group|pressure groups]], and made many political speeches throughout his life on a wide variety of subjects and related incidents. Today he is widely remembered for his pursuit of the lost cause of [[Temperance movement|temperance]] reform, when temperance was only one strand of a very complex set of ideas he espoused. Lawson was in fact, the most [[Cobdenite]] of the Cobdenites and his contribution to the debate on radical reform, and foreign and colonial policy was significant. In the context of his radical philosophy as a whole, Lawson was a full-blooded radical, whose views covered a wide range and were almost always, very extreme. If the voting habits of an individual [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] can be used to place that person along the radical spectrum then Lawson belongs on the outer fringes, for it is doubtful if any member of any British political party or of any time in the history of the modern British parliamentary system, has ever voted in as many minority [[Division of the assembly|divisions]] as Lawson.<ref>Wilfrid Lawson: Attitudes and Opinions on Britain's Imperial and Foreign Policy (1868\u20131892) by Terry Carrick (Unpublished Thesis for a Ph.D.) pages 33\u201336</ref>\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Entry into politics===\nAfter [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] dissolved Parliament in 1857, Lawson came forward as a radical to contest the [[West Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|West Cumberland]] stronghold [[Rotten and pocket boroughs|owned]] by the [[Henry Lowther, 3rd Earl of Lonsdale|Lowther family]]. The Lawsons were obsessed with the concept of political freedom and since the [[Electoral district|constituency]] had for over twenty years been denied the opportunity to select their representative Lawson senior was determined, at personal expense to offer the electorate a choice.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Carlisle Patriot, 10 April 1857</ref> Lawson stood as a [[Little Englander]], with a radical programme endorsing the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] watchwords, Peace, [[Retrenchment]] and Reform. Lawson identified with the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] of politics and consistently advocated their principles, particularly in response to conflict undertaken to promote selfish British interests. Although Lawson, a disappointing third in the poll,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> lost the election,  the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] in the form of [[John Bright|Bright]], [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], [[Edward Miall|Miall]], [[Thomas Milner Gibson|Milner Gibson]] and [[Austen Henry Layard|Layard]] all lost their seats.\n\n===1859 Carlisle election===\n[[File:One of the reception rooms at Brayton Hall circa1890.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the reception rooms at Brayton Hall circa1890]]\nAfter [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] dissolved Parliament in 1859, Lawson was invited to stand with his uncle, [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]] for the [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle constituency]].<ref>The Carlisle Patriot, 10 April 1859</ref> Although Graham's address was moderate, he informed his agent, \"Lawson and his father sincerely entertain extreme opinions, and may be considered partisans of [[John Bright|Mr Bright]]. Lawson would go the whole length, would pledge himself to the [[Secret ballot|ballot]], and would go ahead of me.\"<ref>Life and Letters of Sir James Graham, 1792\u20131861, Vol. 2, Charles Stuart Parker, page 379-380, (London 1907)</ref> Lawson concurred; \"I may honestly confess I am rather more of a radical than he (Graham).\"<ref>The Carlisle Patriot,16 April 1859</ref> When questioned on the lengths he would go in lowering the [[Suffrage|franchise]], he replied, \"As far as any proposition is likely to be brought into Parliament, which has the least chance of success.\"<ref>Carlisle Patriot, 16 April 1859</ref> When the poll closed Graham stood at its head with 538 votes, Lawson trailed by 22 votes, 40 votes ahead of his [[Tory]] rival.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, W.B. Luke, Simpkin (London 1900) page 17</ref> As a result, he became a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]]. Lawson made his maiden speech on 20 March 1860, in a debate relating to the introduction of the [[Secret Ballot]].<ref>Hansard Vol 157, 20 March 1860, Col. 940</ref>\n\n===1865 Carlisle election===\n[[File:Punch A Most Effective Water Spouter.jpg|thumb|300px|Punch: A Most Effective Water Spouter]]\nUnder normal circumstances Lawson should have returned to the House of Commons in 1865; however, during the previous year he had introduced the [[Permissive Bill]]. A Bill so unpopular, he struggled to find a member to [[Second (parliamentary procedure)|second]] the proposal. Needless to say Lawson lost the [[Division of the assembly|division]] by 294 votes to 37.<ref>Hansard Vol. 175 Col. 1423</ref> For suggesting that people had the right to restrict the access of others to the [[Liquor store|liquor shops]], the full weight of public opinion favouring the liberty of the subject, backed by the Tories and brewing industry, rained down upon him. Although Lawson was popular for other reasons, and lost the election by a mere seventeen votes, it prompted ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper to run an article suggesting that no future sensible constituency would ever return him to the house.<ref>The Times, 13 July 1865</ref> However, an opportunity arose for an early return to parliament in July 1866, after [[Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo|Lord Naas]], the [[Tory|Conservative]] member for the small [[ancient borough]] of [[Cockermouth]] became [[Chief Secretary of Ireland]]. When the redistribution of parliamentary seats became an electoral issue Lawson informed his would-be supporters that if elected he would not hesitate to do everything in his power, to support some form of [[borough]] [[disenfranchisement]]. However, when his defeat became a forlorn conclusion he retired from the contest.<ref>Carlisle Journal, 13 July 1866</ref>\n\n===1868 Carlisle election===\nBy openly supporting [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] desire to [[Irish Church Act 1869|disestablish the Irish Church]] Lawson endured the wrath of the [[Church of England]] in the form of the [[Francis Close|Dean of Carlisle]], who proclaimed Lawson the greatest radical in all of [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Carlisle Journal, 1 September 1868\">Carlisle Journal, 1 September 1868</ref> To those who accused Lawson of \"robbing a poor man of his beer\". He retorted, \"Far from the truth I am trying to rob the rich man of his prey, out of the plunder he makes, from the homes and happiness of the working men of this country.\" He also supported the need for a national [[education policy]] based upon a [[Secular education|secular system]] with the capacity to accommodate the various religious interests.<ref name=\"Carlisle Journal, 1 September 1868\"/> Nationally the [[general election]] produced a landslide [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] victory with a majority of over one hundred. Lawson returned to parliament at the head of the Carlisle poll.<ref>The Carlisle Journal, 20 November 1868</ref>\n\n===1874 Carlisle election===\n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Lawson Vanity Fair 11 May 1872.jpg|thumb|left|Caricature by [[Adriano Cecioni]] published in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine 1868-1914)|Vanity Fair]] in 1872.]]\nAs the 1874 [[general election]] approached, Lawson had good cause to feel satisfied with the progressive reforms introduced by the outgoing [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] government.<ref name=\"Carlisle Journal, 16 January 1874\">Carlisle Journal, 16 January 1874</ref> They had gone some way to pacify [[Ireland]] by [[Irish Church Act 1869|disestablishing the Irish church]] and introducing an [[Irish Land Acts|Irish Land Bill]]. They had introduced an [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Education Bill]], which Lawson welcomed with a few reservations. They had introduced the [[Local Government Board|Local Government Board Act 1871]], which put the supervision of the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]] under the [[Local Government Board]]. They had repealed the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851|Ecclesiastical Titles Act]] and abolished the [[Religious test]]s in the universities. They had introduced much needed [[Cardwell Reforms|army reforms]], instituted the abolition of the [[sale of commissions]] in the army and made peacetime [[Flagellation|flogging]] illegal. In foreign affairs they had settled the [[Alabama Claims]] by [[international arbitration]] to the benefit of the [[United States]]; and kept Britain out of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. They had introduced the Secret Ballot notwithstanding the serious opposition from the Tory party. Although parliament had passed the 1872 licensing act, Lawson had failed miserably to enact his Permissive Prohibitory Bill.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell pages 81\u2013102</ref> In 1870, he had without success, introduced a resolution condemning the [[Opium]] traffic,<ref>Hansard, 10 May 1870, Vol. 201, mCols 480\u2013490</ref> which he compared to the problems associated with alcohol: \"We go on to this day merrily poisoning the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] with opium as we do our own people with alcohol.\"<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell page 86</ref> Lawson also voted in a minority division of two in support of [[Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Dilke]] when heavily censured by parliament after seeking returns relating to the expenditure on the [[British Royal family]].<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, W.B. Luke pages 72\u201373</ref> On 2 August 1870, at the time of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Lawson had opposed Gladstone, who sought parliament's permission to increase the army estimates by \u00a32,000,000 and 20,000 men. Lawson saw the vote as a danger to Britain and represented the first step in a direction away from a policy of [[Non-interventionism|non-intervention]], war when not a necessity, was he emphasised, a crime and no war was justified unless strictly defensive. Although he threatened to walk through the [[Members' Lobby|lobbies]] unattended he received support from six radicals.<ref>Hansard Vol. 203, Col. 1441, 2 August 1870</ref> \nDuring the election, Lawson expressed his opposition to the ongoing [[Anglo-Ashanti wars|Ashanti war]] which he saw as a continuation of the drive to open out Africa \"We are opening out Africa to progress, civilisation and religion. I don't believe in the souls of a few being saved by destroying the bodies of many more out there. I don't believe in civilising and [[Christianization|Christianising]] by the sword.\"<ref name=\"Carlisle Journal, 16 January 1874\"/> Unlike many of his Liberal colleagues, Lawson was re-elected<ref>Carlisle Journal, 6 February 1874</ref> and would spend the vast majority of his time in the forthcoming parliament opposing [[Benjamin Disraeli|Beaconsfieldism]] and what he saw as unnecessary conflict.\n\n===Beaconsfieldism===\nLawson began his campaign against [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli's]] [[imperialist]] policies by opposing the annexation of the [[Fiji]] Islands.<ref>Hansard 3rd ser., Vol. 221 cols. 1264\u20131301</ref> He supported Gladstone in his sustained attack on the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government's]] policy relating to the [[April Uprising|Eastern question]] by proposing, although unsuccessfully, Resolutions against the Vote of Credit for \u00a36,000,000 and 20,000 men, and the calling out of the [[Military reserve force|Reserve]].<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell (London 1909) page 133-8</ref> He opposed Britain's invasion of [[Second Anglo-Afghan War|Afghanistan]], as he explained, on grounds of principle, honour, morality and justice.<ref>Hansard 3rd ser., Vol. 243 col. 999, 17 December 1878</ref> Between the years 1877 and 1881, Lawson was extremely busy protesting against the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government's]] imperial policies in [[South Africa]]. It began with a sustained attack against the annexation of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], which swiftly lead to the [[Anglo-Zulu War|Zulu war]]<ref>Hansard 3rd ser., Vol. 249 col. 153, 4 August 1879</ref> and the role played by [[Sir Bartle Frere]], the [[High Commissioner]] to the [[Cape Colony]], whom Lawson continuously asked parliament to recall.<ref>Hansard 3rd ser., Vol. 252 col. 1620, 10 June 1880</ref> He led a successful opposition, following the death of [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Louis Napoleon]], thus preventing his burial in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>The Times 16 July 1880</ref> He also led a successful opposition to the annexation of [[Basutoland]] by the Cape colony, thus maintaining the countries eventual independence from South Africa.<ref>Hansard 3rd ser., Vol. 257, col. 1071, 20 January 1881</ref> Lawson summarised Disraeli's policies with the following statement:  \n::\"at the undertakings into which the Government had gone, the things they had done, or tried to do, or promised to do, or failed to do. They had set themselves up to frighten [[Russia]], protect [[Turkey]], to annex the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], to reform [[Asia Minor]], to occupy [[Cyprus]], to manipulate [[Egypt]], to invade [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]], to catch [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetywayo]], to smoke out Secocoeine, and to secure a scientific frontier for [[India]]. How he asked, had they tried to do these things? They had shifted our Indian troops up and down, moved our [[Naval fleet|fleet]] backwards and forwards, made secret treaties, sent ultimatums to everybody with whom they had the slightest quarrel, engaged in two cruel and unjust wars and paved the way for any number more.\"<ref>The West Cumberland Times, 31 January 1880</ref>\n\n===Egyptian crisis===\nIn 1880, the Carlisle constituency returned Lawson to parliament with an increased majority, while the country as a whole returned a Liberal government led by Gladstone. Lawson supported the claim of the [[Atheism|atheist]] [[Charles Bradlaugh]], who sought religious freedom.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell (London 1909) pages 149\u201350</ref> In relation to [[Irish people|Irish]] affairs, he supported Gladstone's introduction of the [[Irish Land Act]] (1881),<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell (London 1909) pages 157\u201358</ref> only to oppose the government after Gladstone introduced the [[Protection of Person and Property Act 1881]], which Lawson described as \"starting once more on the hopeless, miserable, never-ending attempt to settle the Irish difficulty by force.\"<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell (London 1909) pages 165</ref> In January 1881, Lawson became a leading spokesman for the [[Transvaal Independence Committee]],<ref>The Arbitrator, January 1881</ref> from where he denounced the belligerence before applauding the negotiated settlement to end the [[First Boer War]]. The [[History of Egypt under the British|Egyptian crisis]] followed.\nThe British occupation of Egypt was the most important single act of British foreign policy during Gladstone's second administration and according to many historians has since become one of the classic case studies of the partition of Africa and of late nineteenth century informal imperialism in general.<ref>Robinson and Gallagher, pages 122\u2013210</ref> Lawson's agitation against intervention in [[Egypt]] was completely in harmony with his support for the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] [[Boers]] in their struggle against British rule; his support for [[Afghan]] tribesmen seeking to retain their independence; and his wish to see justice spread to encompass the needs of the [[Irish people]]. Underlying all of these policies was an inherent distrust of the concept of empire and a cardinal belief in the traditional assertions of [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], that Britain should promote peace, and avoid interference in the political institutions of other nations. In many respects, Egypt was Lawson's defining moment as an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] [[Political radicalism|radical]]. He not only led the agitation but he disagreed with the opinions of many of his radical contemporaries, colleagues he had and would later stand shoulder to shoulder with in agitating against similar imperialist concerns.<ref>Trouble Makers, A.J.P. Taylor, p. 81</ref> For three long years he criticised British diplomats and argued against a government of his own making; against the European bondholders control of the country;<ref>Hansard 26 Vol 269 Cols 1711\u201332 May 1882</ref> against the [[bombardment of Alexandria]];<ref>Hansard, Vol. 272 Col. 708 17 July 1882</ref>  and against the British armies destruction of the Egyptian force under [[Ahmed Orabi]] at the [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]].<ref>Hansard, Vol. 272 Col. 1335 & 1338 25 July 1882</ref> He argued against parliament awarding a Vote of Thanks for Britain's military leaders;<ref>Hansard, Vol. 274 Col. 32 24 October 1882</ref> and in conjunction with [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]] campaigned for the release of [[Ahmed Orabi]].<ref>Hansard Vol. 274 Col. 275 26 October 1882</ref> On one occasion, in a blistering attack on the Government's forward policy, Lawson reminded his colleagues of their probable response had the bombardment occurred under a Conservative and not a Liberal administration.\n::They would have had his right hon. friend the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] for the [[Home Office|Home Department]] ([[Sir William Harcourt]]), (laughter and cheers) stumping the country and denouncing Government by ultimatum. They would have had the noble [[Marquesses in the United Kingdom|Marquesss]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] for [[India]] ([[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Lord Hartington]]) moving a Resolution condemning the proceeding's taken behind the back of Parliament. (Cheers from the Irish Members.) They would have had the [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills|President of the Board of Trade]] ([[Joseph Chamberlain]]) summoning the caucus. (Cheers and laughter.) They would have had the other right hon. Gentleman, the Member for [[Birmingham]], the [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]] ([[John Bright]]) declaiming in the [[Seat of local government|Town Hall]] of [[Birmingham]] against the wicked [[Tory]] Government; and as for the [[Midlothian campaign|Prime Minister]], they all knew there would not have been a railway train, (cheers and laughter) passing a roadside station, that he would not have pulled up to proclaim the doctrine of [[non-intervention]] as the duty of the Government. (Laughter and cheers from the Irish Members). It was perfectly abominable to see men whom they respected, whom they believed in, whom they had placed in power, overturning every principle they had professed, carrying out a policy that was abhorrent to every lover of justice and of right.<ref>Hansard, vol. 272, col. 172, 12 July 1882</ref>\nAs quickly as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] began to solve one problem another arrived in the [[Sudan]]. In 1881, an obscure tribesman and religious zealot named [[Muhammad Ahmad]], proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]], who initiated a [[Jihad]] against the Egyptian military occupation. After 50,000 Mahdist tribesmen annihilated a 10,000 strong Egyptian army under the command of a reluctant British mercenary, general [[William Hicks (British soldier)|William Hicks]] Pasha, the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] fully understood the serious nature of their involvement in Egypt. This resulted in the dispatch of General [[Charles George Gordon]] to oversee the evacuation of [[Khartoum]]. After supporting a policy of \"rescue and retire\" Lawson quickly withdrew his support he could find no relationship between what Gladstone described as \"a small service to humanity,\" and the killing of thousands of Arabs.<ref>Hansard Vol 284 col. 896\u2013911 14 February 1884</ref> After the death of Gordon, Lawson applauded Gladstone's decision to evacuate the Sudan.\n\n===West Cumberland===\nIn 1885, after  the reduction  of  the [[carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] seat to  one  member Lawson  decided to contest the [[Henry Lowther, 3rd Earl of Lonsdale|Lowther]] dominated Cockermouth constituency.<ref>West Cumberland Times, 1 November 1881</ref> However, his attitude towards [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] imperialist policies in Egypt had made enemies in his [[Cockermouth]] constituency and  on 5 December, the newly enfranchised electorate rejected his appeal by a small but decisive margin of ten votes.<ref>West Cumberland Times, 6 December 1885</ref> As a result, Lawson missed the parliamentary debates surrounding [[Third Gladstone ministry|Irish home Rule]] and the subsequent schism of the Liberal party. Lawson was extremely critical of the newly formed [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] particularly in the roles played by [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[John Bright]]. In Lawson's opinion the turncoats had become the reactionary radical opposition and had placed Britain under the yoke of a Tory administration. He cared little for their names: [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]], Dissenting Liberals, [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Hartingtonians]], [[Joseph Chamberlain|Chamberlainites]], Old [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], [[Lord Randolph Churchill|Randolphians]], Tory democrats, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], [[Constitutionalists]], Ruling Councillors, Knight Harbinghers, [[Union Jack]]s and Union Jackasses; they were all out and out Tories.<ref>The West Cumberland Times, 7 January 1888</ref> Lawson returned to the House of Commons in the election of 1886, one of only three \"Home Rulers\" to capture a Conservative seat;<ref>The West Cumberland Times, 10 June 1887</ref>  converting a minority of ten into a majority of over one thousand.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 187</ref> In parliament he vehemently opposed [[Arthur Balfour]]'s coercion measures.\nHe served as [[List of Presidents of Co-operative Congress|President]] of the second day of the 1887 [[Co-operative Congress]].<ref name=PDF>{{Citation| title =Congress Presidents 1869\u20132002| url =http://archive.co-op.ac.uk/downloadFiles/congressPresidentstable.pdf| date =February 2002| access-date =2008-05-10| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080528100558/http://archive.co-op.ac.uk/downloadFiles/congressPresidentstable.pdf| archive-date =28 May 2008| df =dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== The Newcastle programme and the second home rule bill===\n[[File:Wilfrid_Lawson.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Wilfrid Lawson c1895]]\nIn October 1891, the Liberal Party held their annual conference in the city of [[Newcastle Upon Tyne|Newcastle]], where delegates thrashed out a radical agenda to take them through the next General Election, and beyond to the new century. Immediately but reluctantly endorsed by Gladstone, [[the Newcastle Programme]] as it became popularly known was a grandiose scheme that enshrined the majority of Lawson's outstanding reforms.<ref>National Liberal Federation, Fourteenth Annual Conference 1891</ref>  Lawson had waited a lifetime for the realisation of these enactments, and boasted: \"If the chartists could rise from their graves they would not believe that the Liberal party had absolutely homologated those great reforms.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">The West Cumberland Times, 20 June 1892</ref> The election issue was no longer simply Home Rule; it was the full Newcastle programme, and Lawson was anxious to settle the Irish question to secure further domestic reforms.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Back in parliament Lawson continued to support Gladstone, who introduced his [[Government of Ireland Bill 1893|Second Home Rule bill]], which, except for a reduced number of Irish members at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] mirrored its predecessor. As expected the bills progress through Parliament was obstructed by the Opposition who emphasised all the inadequacies in the measure, which in turn justified the [[House of Lords]] rejecting the bill. In the Commons the bill passed its third reading on 1 September. However, after four nights of obligatory debate, the Lords rejected the measure by a huge majority of 419 to 41. Lawson was furious, mend them, was not his way, \"you only mend a thing you want to keep, and he never wanted to keep the House of Lords, he wanted to end them.\"<ref>The West Cumberland Times, 8 January 1890</ref> After Gladstone's resignation in 1894 Lawson's expectations crumbled.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Boer war===\nThe [[Cockermouth]] [[Electoral district|electorate]] returned Lawson to parliament in the general election of 1895, where, with a slightly reduced majority he continued to prosecute his anti-war opinions. In 1898, he criticised the government, the [[Clergy]], the newspaper editors and above all, public opinion after a command under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|General Kitchener]] slaughtered thousands of [[Dervish]] natives at the [[battle of Omdurman]].<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 247</ref> In 1896 he denounced the [[Jameson raid]] and sought answers to questions relating to the role played by the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], [[Joseph Chamberlain]].<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 230, 236, 253</ref> When war came in the form of the [[Second Boer War]], Lawson was unapologetic in his criticism of the British governments policy. He became a prominent [[opposition to the Second Boer War|Pro-Boer]] and a member of numerous anti war organisations including the [[Stop the War Committee]], the League of Liberals Against Aggression and Militarism, and the [[South Africa Conciliation Committee]]. On numerous occasions, he voted against, and spoke out against providing finance, sending men, ammunition and supplies, in the vain hope that with sufficient support he could bring down the government and so end the war.<ref>Hansard, Vol. 86 Cols. 1246-8 3 March 1899</ref> However, all his efforts came to nothing and in return he became one of the few pro-Boer politicians to lose his parliamentary seat at the subsequent so called [[Khaki election]] of 1900.\n\n===Camborne===\n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Lawson, political postcard.jpg|thumb|120px|Election Postcard]]\nFollowing the death of [[William Sproston Caine]] M.P. on 17 March 1903, the Liberal Association of the [[Camborne]] Division of [[Cornwall]] invited Lawson to stand on their behalf at the forthcoming by-election. They made the offer under peculiarly acceptable conditions, for should he secure the seat, he would be at liberty, when the next election occurred, to return, should he wish, to his old constituency at [[Cockermouth]]. Almost immediately after the Cornish electorate returned Lawson with a huge majority, the Cockermouth Liberal Associated selected him to stand as their candidate at the next election.<ref>West Cumberland Times, 20 May 1903</ref> In parliament he continued to prosecute his anti-imperialist, [[Free Trade]] and temperance views while at home he began to campaign for the oncoming election. In January 1906 he returned with a majority of almost 600.\n\n==Temperance==\nAlthough Lawson did not enter the House of Commons on behalf of the Temperance movement he became their chief parliamentary spokesman. In 1863 he spoke in favour of a Bill to introduce the Sunday closing of public houses.<ref>Hansard 3 June 1863 vol 171 cc277-319</ref> Later that year he proposed that \"the Laws under which Licences are granted for the sale of Intoxicating Liquors are eminently unsatisfactory and deficient in power to protect the public, and therefore require immediate alteration.\"<ref>Hansard, 16 July 1863 vol 172 cols 928-33</ref> After the resolution was heavily defeated he was encouraged to introduce his [[Permissive Bill]]. On 8 June, Lawson rose in front of a packed House of Commons to deliver a speech of great ability that filled four pages of [[Hansard]], to move the second reading of the first of several Permissive Bills. A policy that later became known as Local Option and eventually Local Veto, The Bill was fashioned to embody the convictions but not the policy of the [[United Kingdom Alliance]]. he did not propose to prohibit the sale of liquor by enactment. The Bill provided that on application of any district, be that [[parish]], [[town]] or [[borough]], the votes of the ratepayers should be cast on the question of whether the trade in alcoholic beverages should exist in that district or not; where a majority of two thirds of the [[Rates (tax)|ratepayers]] would be required to decide the outcome.<ref>Hansard, 8 June 1864 vol 175 cols 1390-423</ref> The Bill was heavily defeated by a majority of 257. He reintroduced the bill again in 1869,<ref>Hansard, 12 May 1869 vol 196 cols 637-83</ref> 1870,<ref>Hansard, 13 July 1870 vol 203 cols 169-91</ref> 1871,<ref>Hansard, 17 May 1871 vol 206 cols 917-53</ref> 1873,<ref>Hansard, 7 May 1873 vol 215 cols 1609\u201364</ref> 1874,<ref>Hansard, 17 June 1874 vol 220 cols 2\u201361</ref> 1876,<ref>Hansard, 14 June 1876 vol 229 col 1821\u201383</ref> 1878,<ref>Hansard 26 June 1878 vol 241 cols 251-97</ref> In 1879, he varied his attack on the drink trade by proposing a Resolution in place of the Permissive Bill. Taking the words from a recommendation of the [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation of the Province of Canterbury]], he asked that inhabitants of districts, being the persons most interested in the licensing of Public Houses, should themselves have the power of stopping such licensing, if they objected to having the trade forced upon them.<ref>Hansard, 11 March 1879 vol 244 cols 632\u2013753</ref> In the following year he moved his resolution on two occasions, In the first he was defeated by a majority of 114 votes,<ref>Hansard, 5 March 1880 vol 251 cols 441\u2013528</ref> whereas on the second occasion he carried his motion by 26 votes.<ref>Hansard, 18 June 1880 vol 253 cols 340-89</ref> Although he carried the motion again in 1881 and 1883 with majorities of 42 and 87, [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] government failed to enact the policy.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:The Start of the Funeral Cortege 01.jpg|thumb|300px|The Start of the Funeral Cortege]]\nOn 30 June, though feeling tired and weary, Lawson went down to the House to record his vote. From where he returned to No 18, [[Ovington Square]], [[Knightsbridge]], London, went to bed and never rose again. The first part of the funeral arrangements took place at [[St Margaret's, Westminster|St Margaret's Church, Westminster]] amidst a large gathering of members of Parliament, family members, personal friends, and representatives of public bodies. [[File:The Start of the Funeral Cortege 02.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The End of the Funeral Cortege]]\nThe interment of the remains took place at [[Aspatria]] churchyard on the following day. The large concourse of people who followed the coffin from Brayton Hall to the churchyard was representative of the political and public life of the county, whilst the [[Temperance movement|temperance]] organisations represented were of a national character. The inscription on the coffin read:- Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, Born 4 September 1829, Died 1 July 1906.<ref>Carlisle Journal 6 July 1906</ref>\n\nAt the time of his death, Lawson was chiefly known as a pro-Boer, and anti-everything else; a [[little Englander]], a Peace-at-any-price Man, a would-be destroyer of the [[State religion|established church]], the [[House of Lords]], the liquor traffic, and several other institutions less robust. He supported payment for Members of parliament, [[women's suffrage]], the construction of a [[Channel tunnel]], the [[Irish Home Rule movement]], opposed coercion in all its manifestations and stoically defended [[Free Trade]] whenever a threat appeared. After a long career his successes were few, although in 1892, after an eighteen-year struggle, he did eventually get a majority against the motion for adjourning on the [[Epsom Derby|Derby day]].<ref>Hansard, 31 May 1892 vol 5 cc382-91</ref> Today he his primarily remembered as a Temperance Reformer.\nAlthough offered a [[Privy Council]]lorship by [[Henry Campbell Bannerman]] he declined.\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:The Sir Wilfrid Lawson Memorial, Aspatria.jpg|150px|thumb|The Sir Wilfrid Lawson Memorial, Aspatria]]\nOn 21 April 1908, the [[George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle|Earl of Carlisle]], unveiled a memorial, designed by [[Louis Frederick Roslyn]], in the form of a drinking fountain surmounted by a bronze group of [[St. George and the dragon]]. The monument, financed by public subscription, stands in the town of [[Aspatria]].  On the front of the fountain is a portrait of Lawson, inscribed with dates of birth and death. On the right hand side is a bronze panel representing [[Temperance Movement|Temperance]], in which is portrayed a young girl offering a traveller a drink of water, drawn from an adjoining well. On the left hand side a third panel depicts Peace, on which appears a tribesman dressed in savage garb, clasping the hand of friendship held out by a warrior kneeling at the feet of a winged Angel, which crowned by a halo is rising in the background. The fourth panel bears the following inscription:   \n::Remember\n::Wilfrid Lawson\n::2nd Baronet of Brayton & Isel\t\n::In whose honour this fountain is erected by his many friends and admirers. Beloved for the integrity of his life and the height of his ideals. An example for all time for one who gave himself for others, believing in the brotherhood of man. A lover of truth and mercy, a brave and strenuous advocate of temperance, which sacred cause he championed in the House of Commons for forty years with gay wisdom and perseverance.\n[[File:Unveiling of Sir Welfrid Lawson Memorial at Aspatria 21 April 1908.jpg|350px|thumb|left|Unveiling of Sir Welfrid Lawson Memorial at Aspatria 21 April 1908]]\nOn 6 June 1908, the Lawson family installed a stained glass window dedicated to the memory of their late patriarch, in the east end of Aspatria Church. The window is large and beautifully ornate, and symbolises the characters and scene of the last chapter of Revelations.<ref>The West Cumberland Times, 9 June 1908</ref>\n\nOn 20 July 1909, the members of the [[United Kingdom Alliance]] and other Temperance organisations erected a second memorial in the [[Victoria Embankment Gardens]] in London, close to [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]]. It was unveiled, amidst continuous interruptions by [[suffragettes]], by the then prime minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], who said:\n::\"Sir Wilfrid Lawson was one of the most remarkable and certainly one of the most attractive political characters of the times. He was an apostle not of lost but of gaining causes, content for most of his life to be in the minority, but watching year by year the minority slowly developing into the majority of the future. I doubt very much whether we shall ever see again in our time a combination in one and the same man of such fearlessness and courage, such a passionate love for freedom, such a single minded independence and self devotion, such an enduring and strenuous assiduity in pursuit of the cause once taken up, and never by him to be laid down; such a combination.\".<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell pages 375\u201388</ref>\nThe bronze statue, designed by David McGill, is striking, life like and shows Lawson, in an attitude of debate. On the front of the pedestal on which it stands is the inscription: \u2013 \"Sir Wilfrid Lawson, Bart., of Brayton, [[Cumberland]]; born September 4th, 1829: Member of Parliament for [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]], [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]], [[Camborne (UK Parliament constituency)|Camborne]], 1859 1906; president of the United Kingdom Temperance Alliance, 1879 1909.\" On one side of the pedestal are the words. \"A true patriot, a wise and witty orator, a valiant and farseeing reformer, he spent a long life as the courageous champion of righteousness, peace, freedom and temperance.\" On the other side the inscription runs. \"Erected by his friends and followers in grateful remembrance of his splendid leadership, and of his pure and unworldly life, July 20th, 1909.\"\n[[File:Copy of Mammoth 011.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sir Wilfrid Lawson in the Victoria Embankment Gardens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Sir Wilfrid Lawson by W B Luke (Political Biography published by Simpkin Marshall of London in 1900).\n* Sir Wilfrid Lawson A Memoir Edited by G W Russell (Political Biography published by Smith Elder & Co. of London in 1909).\n* Wisdom Grave & Gay Being Selected Speeches of Sir Wilfrid Lawson On Social Reform &C Edited by R A Jamieson (Published by S W Partridge & Co of London in 1889).\n* Cartoons In Rhyme And Line By Sir Wilfrid Lawson and F Carruthers Gould (Published by T Fisher Unwin of London in 1905).\n* Wilfrid Lawson: Attitudes and Opinions on Britain's Imperial and Foreign Policy (1868\u20131892) by Terry Carrick (Unpublished Thesis for a Ph.D.)\n* Some Notable Cumbrians by Sir F.

He was the son of [[Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 1st Baronet, of Brayton]], who changed his name from Wybergh, and Caroline Graham, daughter of [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]]. He was privately educated at home. He was a founder member of both the [[National Liberal Club]] and the [[Reform League]], a prominent member of the [[Peace Society]], and the [[Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade]].

He was, like his younger brother [[William Lawson (co-operator)|William]], a forward thinking co-operator and agriculturalist.<ref>The Concise Dictionary Of National Biography, Vol 2 page 1743</ref>\n\n==Early days==\nWilfrid Lawson the son of [[Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 1st Baronet, of Brayton]], was born at [[Brayton Hall, Cumberland|Brayton Hall]], [[Aspatria]], [[Cumberland]] on 4 September 1829. Since the family preferred a simple sporting life, they encouraged their children to enjoy a string of outdoor pursuits, including [[fishing]], [[shooting]], [[ice skating]], [[cricket]] and the family obsession, [[foxhunting]]. He bought [[John Peel (huntsman)|John Peel's]] pack of hounds after Peel's death and became Master of the Cumberland Foxhounds. From early childhood he developed an exceptional talent for mimicry and a talent for writing rapid, fluent, and vigorous verse that played so conspicuous a part in the serious correspondence of his mature life.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 9</ref>\n\nHe received his education at home under the tutorship of John Oswald Jackson, a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister of some repute.<ref>Some Notable Cumbrians, Chance page 60</ref>   In later life, both Lawson and his celebrated brother [[William Lawson (co-operator)|William]]<ref>Ten Years Of Gentleman Farming, Lawson and Hunter, page 14</ref>   openly declared their lack of formal education.  Jackson predominantly taught his pupils [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] [[prose]], complemented with [[mathematics]], [[natural science]]s, [[political economy]], [[English language|English]] and foreign [[history]], with the elements of [[rhetoric]] and [[logic]] to enhance the curriculum.  Lawson also gained a fondness for [[poetry]], in particular the works of [[Lord Byron]], whose lines often adorned his political speeches.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 56-57</ref>\n\n===Family===\n[[File:Mary Lawson circa 1900.jpg|thumb|Mary Lawson circa 1900]]\nOn 13 November 1860, Lawson married Mary, daughter of Joseph Pocklington Senhouse of Netherhall, [[Maryport]], [[Cumberland]].<ref>Carlisle Journal 16 November 1860</ref> Their union produced eight children; four boys, Wilfrid, Mordaunt, Arthur and Godfrey; and four girls.

Ellen married [[Viscount Knutsford|Arthur Henry Holland-Hibbert, 3rd Viscount Knutsford]] (1855\u20131935),<ref>Maryport Advertiser, 7 November 1884</ref> they produced one daughter named Elsie and one son named Thurstan. In 1895, Mabel married Alan de Lancey Curwen of [[Workington Hall]], they had three children. In 1896, Lucy married Edward Heathcote Thruston of [[Pennal]] Tower, Mochgullith, [[North Wales]]<ref>West Cumberland Times, 9 May 1896</ref> In 1909 Josephine married [[Frederick William Chance]], the member of Parliament for the city of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].\nMary's sister Blanche married Alfred Curzon, 4th [[Baron Scarsdale]] (1831\u20131916). Blanche was the mother of [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], [[Viceroy of India]].\nLawson succeeded to the baronetcy and estates upon the death of his father in 1867.\n\n===Early political influences===\n\nWith limited access to his intellectual peers, Lawson received his political convictions from his father and a constant stream of influential household guests. In 1840, the family explored the consequences of adopting [[free trade]] and the repeal of the iniquitous [[Corn Laws]]. They eagerly digested the speeches of [[John Manners, 7th Duke of Rutland|Granby]], [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]], and the [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]] on one side and of [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], [[John Bright|Bright]] and [[Charles Pelham Villiers|Villiers]] on the other, with the caricatured comments of [[Punch (magazine)|Mr. Punch]], to enrich the subject. \n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Lawson 2nd Baronet circa 1860.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Wilfrid Lawson circa 1860]]\nThe Lawsons shared the opinions of [[Radicals (UK)|radicals]], who argued that [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] were parasites of the state raising the price of the people's bread as a means of helping the landed interests and to add revenue to the state coffers which could be used for the anti-Christian purposes of corruption and foreign war.<ref>The Rise and Fall of Liberal Government in Victorian Britain, Jonathon Parry, (Yale 1993), page 163</ref> In 1843, after attending a series of travelling lectures given by [[Thomas Chalmers|Chalmers]] and [[Robert Smith Candlish|Candlish]], they re-enacted the prominent debates relating to the question of [[Separation of church and state|Church and State]] and discussed the [[Church of Scotland|Scottish church]] and its recent schism, when 451 ministers seceded, leaving the [[Kirk]] to form the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church of Scotland]].  In 1843, they debated the [[Rebecca Riots]]; and after [[Daniel O'Connell]] electrified [[Ireland]] with his desire to repeal the union they consumed endless hours debating the everlasting [[Irish Question]]. In 1848, they contemplated the events surrounding revolution, when the morning newspapers reported some fresh upheaval, spreading relentlessly across [[Europe]], shaking [[Monarchy|kingdoms]] and thrones, causing terrific slaughter in [[France]], provoking [[Chartism|Chartist]] riots in [[England]], and bringing home lessons of deep political importance. Throughout the 1840s, they debated the morality of war, with particular reference to the [[First Anglo-Afghan War|Afghan]] and the [[First Opium War|Chinese Opium Wars]]. As the wars concluded the question of peace came to the fore. The leaflets of [[Elihu Burritt]]' a leading peace campaigners were awaited and absorbed on publication, while another apostle of peace, [[Henry Richard]] made a lecturing visit to Brayton. Lawson completed his education by reading [[The Nonconformist]], edited by [[Edward Miall]]. Many of these early [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] refrains forged his character and formed his opinions and convictions pushing him along a path that led from [[romanticism]] and [[Evangelicalism]] to [[Cobdenism]].<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 296-300</ref>\n\n===Political style===\nIn his lifetime Lawson was one of Britain's most celebrated and popular political figures and yet he was not a [[pamphleteer]] or an essayist, nor was he the owner of a newspaper or a [[Periodical literature|periodical]] like his radical colleagues, [[Joseph Cowen]] and [[Henry Labouchere]]. His strength of argument came from his unique way of transmitting the spoken word, which seldom lacked qualities of humour or entertainment such that his precise, logical, well-balanced arguments ranked high, when compared to contemporary political orators. Lawson became the chief [[jester]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], where he contributed a rich, racy style to debates, earning him the epithet, the \u2018witty [[baronet]]\u2019.<ref>A Diary of Two Parliaments: Disraeli\u2019s Parliament 1874\u20131880, Henry. W Lucy, published in 2 Vol.s, (London 1885), page 100-1</ref> \n[[File:One of the many caricature depictions.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the many caricature depictions]]\nLawson was a member of innumerable societies and [[Advocacy group|pressure groups]], and made many political speeches throughout his life on a wide variety of subjects and related incidents. Today he is widely remembered for his pursuit of the lost cause of [[Temperance movement|temperance]] reform, when temperance was only one strand of a very complex set of ideas he espoused. Lawson was in fact, the most [[Cobdenite]] of the Cobdenites and his contribution to the debate on radical reform, and foreign and colonial policy was significant. In the context of his radical philosophy as a whole, Lawson was a full-blooded radical, whose views covered a wide range and were almost always, very extreme. If the voting habits of an individual [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] can be used to place that person along the radical spectrum then Lawson belongs on the outer fringes, for it is doubtful if any member of any British political party or of any time in the history of the modern British parliamentary system, has ever voted in as many minority [[Division of the assembly|divisions]] as Lawson.<ref>Wilfrid Lawson: Attitudes and Opinions on Britain's Imperial and Foreign Policy (1868\u20131892) by Terry Carrick (Unpublished Thesis for a Ph.D.) pages 33\u201336</ref>\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Entry into politics===\nAfter [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] dissolved Parliament in 1857, Lawson came forward as a radical to contest the [[West Cumberland (UK Parliament constituency)|West Cumberland]] stronghold [[Rotten and pocket boroughs|owned]] by the [[Henry Lowther, 3rd Earl of Lonsdale|Lowther family]]. The Lawsons were obsessed with the concept of political freedom and since the [[Electoral district|constituency]] had for over twenty years been denied the opportunity to select their representative Lawson senior was determined, at personal expense to offer the electorate a choice.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Carlisle Patriot, 10 April 1857</ref> Lawson stood as a [[Little Englander]], with a radical programme endorsing the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] watchwords, Peace, [[Retrenchment]] and Reform. Lawson identified with the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] of politics and consistently advocated their principles, particularly in response to conflict undertaken to promote selfish British interests. Although Lawson, a disappointing third in the poll,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> lost the election,  the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] in the form of [[John Bright|Bright]], [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], [[Edward Miall|Miall]], [[Thomas Milner Gibson|Milner Gibson]] and [[Austen Henry Layard|Layard]] all lost their seats.\n\n===1859 Carlisle election===\n[[File:One of the reception rooms at Brayton Hall circa1890.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the reception rooms at Brayton Hall circa1890]]\nAfter [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] dissolved Parliament in 1859, Lawson was invited to stand with his uncle, [[Sir James Graham, 2nd Baronet|Sir James Graham]] for the [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle constituency]].<ref>The Carlisle Patriot, 10 April 1859</ref> Although Graham's address was moderate, he informed his agent, \"Lawson and his father sincerely entertain extreme opinions, and may be considered partisans of [[John Bright|Mr Bright]]. Lawson would go the whole length, would pledge himself to the [[Secret ballot|ballot]], and would go ahead of me.\"<ref>Life and Letters of Sir James Graham, 1792\u20131861, Vol. 2, Charles Stuart Parker, page 379-380, (London 1907)</ref> Lawson concurred; \"I may honestly confess I am rather more of a radical than he (Graham).\"<ref>The Carlisle Patriot,16 April 1859</ref> When questioned on the lengths he would go in lowering the [[Suffrage|franchise]], he replied, \"As far as any proposition is likely to be brought into Parliament, which has the least chance of success.\"<ref>Carlisle Patriot, 16 April 1859</ref> When the poll closed Graham stood at its head with 538 votes, Lawson trailed by 22 votes, 40 votes ahead of his [[Tory]] rival.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, W.B. Luke, Simpkin (London 1900) page 17</ref> As a result, he became a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]]. Lawson made his maiden speech on 20 March 1860, in a debate relating to the introduction of the [[Secret Ballot]].<ref>Hansard Vol 157, 20 March 1860, Col. 940</ref>\n\n===1865 Carlisle election===\n[[File:Punch A Most Effective Water Spouter.jpg|thumb|300px|Punch: A Most Effective Water Spouter]]\nUnder normal circumstances Lawson should have returned to the House of Commons in 1865; however, during the previous year he had introduced the [[Permissive Bill]]. A Bill so unpopular, he struggled to find a member to [[Second (parliamentary procedure)|second]] the proposal. Needless to say Lawson lost the [[Division of the assembly|division]] by 294 votes to 37.<ref>Hansard Vol. 175 Col. 1423</ref> For suggesting that people had the right to restrict the access of others to the [[Liquor store|liquor shops]], the full weight of public opinion favouring the liberty of the subject, backed by the Tories and brewing industry, rained down upon him. Although Lawson was popular for other reasons, and lost the election by a mere seventeen votes, it prompted ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper to run an article suggesting that no future sensible constituency would ever return him to the house.<ref>The Times, 13 July 1865</ref> However, an opportunity arose for an early return to parliament in July 1866, after [[Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo|Lord Naas]], the [[Tory|Conservative]] member for the small [[ancient borough]] of [[Cockermouth]] became [[Chief Secretary of Ireland]]. When the redistribution of parliamentary seats became an electoral issue Lawson informed his would-be supporters that if elected he would not hesitate to do everything in his power, to support some form of [[borough]] [[disenfranchisement]]. However, when his defeat became a forlorn conclusion he retired from the contest.<ref>Carlisle Journal, 13 July 1866</ref>\n\n===1868 Carlisle election===\nBy openly supporting [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] desire to [[Irish Church Act 1869|disestablish the Irish Church]] Lawson endured the wrath of the [[Church of England]] in the form of the [[Francis Close|Dean of Carlisle]], who proclaimed Lawson the greatest radical in all of [[Europe]].<ref name=\"Carlisle Journal, 1 September 1868\">Carlisle Journal, 1 September 1868</ref> To those who accused Lawson of \u2018robbing a poor man of his beer\u2019. He retorted, \"Far from the truth I am trying to rob the rich man of his prey, out of the plunder he makes, from the homes and happiness of the working men of this country.\" He also supported the need for a national [[education policy]] based upon a [[Secular education|secular system]] with the capacity to accommodate the various religious interests.<ref name=\"Carlisle Journal, 1 September 1868\"/> Nationally the [[general election]] produced a landslide [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] victory with a majority of over one hundred.

They had introduced an [[Elementary Education Act 1870|Education Bill]], which Lawson welcomed with a few reservations. They had introduced the [[Local Government Board|Local Government Board Act 1871]], which put the supervision of the [[English Poor Laws|Poor Law]] under the [[Local Government Board]]. They had repealed the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851|Ecclesiastical Titles Act]] and abolished the [[Religious test]]s in the universities. They had introduced much needed [[Cardwell Reforms|army reforms]], instituted the abolition of the [[sale of commissions]] in the army and made peacetime [[Flagellation|flogging]] illegal. In foreign affairs they had settled the [[Alabama Claims]] by [[international arbitration]] to the benefit of the [[United States]]; and kept Britain out of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. They had introduced the Secret Ballot notwithstanding the serious opposition from the Tory party. Although parliament had passed the 1872 licensing act, Lawson had failed miserably to enact his Permissive Prohibitory Bill.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell pages 81\u2013102</ref> In 1870, he had without success, introduced a resolution condemning the [[Opium]] traffic,<ref>Hansard, 10 May 1870, Vol. 201, mCols 480\u2013490</ref> which he compared to the problems associated with alcohol: \"We go on to this day merrily poisoning the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] with opium as we do our own people with alcohol.\"<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell page 86</ref> Lawson also voted in a minority division of two in support of [[Sir Charles Dilke, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Dilke]] when heavily censured by parliament after seeking returns relating to the expenditure on the [[British Royal family]].<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, W.B. Luke pages 72\u201373</ref> On 2 August 1870, at the time of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Lawson had opposed Gladstone, who sought parliament's permission to increase the army estimates by \u00a32,000,000 and 20,000 men. Lawson saw the vote as a danger to Britain and represented the first step in a direction away from a policy of [[Non-interventionism|non-intervention]], war when not a necessity, was he emphasised, a crime and no war was justified unless strictly defensive. Although he threatened to walk through the [[Members' Lobby|lobbies]] unattended he received support from six radicals.<ref>Hansard Vol. 203, Col. 1441, 2 August 1870</ref> \nDuring the election, Lawson expressed his opposition to the ongoing [[Anglo-Ashanti wars|Ashanti war]] which he saw as a continuation of the drive to open out Africa \"We are opening out Africa to progress, civilisation and religion. I don\u2019t believe in the souls of a few being saved by destroying the bodies of many more out there. I don\u2019t believe in civilising and [[Christianization|Christianising]] by the sword.\"<ref name=\"Carlisle Journal, 16 January 1874\"/> Unlike many of his Liberal colleagues, Lawson was re-elected<ref>Carlisle Journal, 6 February 1874</ref> and would spend the vast majority of his time in the forthcoming parliament opposing [[Benjamin Disraeli|Beaconsfieldism]] and what he saw as unnecessary conflict.\n\n===Beaconsfieldism===\nLawson began his campaign against [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli's]] [[imperialist]] policies by opposing the annexation of the [[Fiji]] Islands.<ref>Hansard 3rd ser., Vol. 221 cols. 1264\u20131301</ref> He supported Gladstone in his sustained attack on the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government's]] policy relating to the [[April Uprising|Eastern question]] by proposing, although unsuccessfully, Resolutions against the Vote of Credit for \u00a36,000,000 and 20,000 men, and the calling out of the [[Military reserve force|Reserve]].<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell (London 1909) page 133-8</ref> He opposed Britain's invasion of [[Second Anglo-Afghan War|Afghanistan]], as he explained, on grounds of principle, honour, morality and justice.<ref>Hansard 3rd ser., Vol. 243 col. 999, 17 December 1878</ref> Between the years 1877 and 1881, Lawson was extremely busy protesting against the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government's]] imperial policies in [[South Africa]]. It began with a sustained attack against the annexation of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], which swiftly lead to the [[Anglo-Zulu War|Zulu war]]<ref>Hansard 3rd ser., Vol. 249 col. 153, 4 August 1879</ref> and the role played by [[Sir Bartle Frere]], the [[High Commissioner]] to the [[Cape Colony]], whom Lawson continuously asked parliament to recall.<ref>Hansard 3rd ser., Vol. 252 col. 1620, 10 June 1880</ref> He led a successful opposition, following the death of [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Louis Napoleon]], thus preventing his burial in [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>The Times 16 July 1880</ref> He also led a successful opposition to the annexation of [[Basutoland]] by the Cape colony, thus maintaining the countries eventual independence from South Africa.<ref>Hansard 3rd ser., Vol. 257, col. 1071, 20 January 1881</ref> Lawson summarised Disraeli's policies with the following statement:  \n::\"at the undertakings into which the Government had gone, the things they had done, or tried to do, or promised to do, or failed to do. They had set themselves up to frighten [[Russia]], protect [[Turkey]], to annex the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], to reform [[Asia Minor]], to occupy [[Cyprus]], to manipulate [[Egypt]], to invade [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]], to catch [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetywayo]], to smoke out Secocoeine, and to secure a scientific frontier for [[India]]. How he asked, had they tried to do these things? They had shifted our Indian troops up and down, moved our [[Naval fleet|fleet]] backwards and forwards, made secret treaties, sent ultimatums to everybody with whom they had the slightest quarrel, engaged in two cruel and unjust wars and paved the way for any number more.\"<ref>The West Cumberland Times, 31 January 1880</ref>\n\n===Egyptian crisis===\nIn 1880, the Carlisle constituency returned Lawson to parliament with an increased majority, while the country as a whole returned a Liberal government led by Gladstone. Lawson supported the claim of the [[Atheism|atheist]] [[Charles Bradlaugh]], who sought religious freedom.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell (London 1909) pages 149\u201350</ref> In relation to [[Irish people|Irish]] affairs, he supported Gladstone's introduction of the [[Irish Land Act]] (1881),<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell (London 1909) pages 157\u201358</ref> only to oppose the government after Gladstone introduced the [[Protection of Person and Property Act 1881]], which Lawson described as \"starting once more on the hopeless, miserable, never-ending attempt to settle the Irish difficulty by force.\"<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson, A Memoir, G.W.E. Russell (London 1909) pages 165</ref> In January 1881, Lawson became a leading spokesman for the [[Transvaal Independence Committee]],<ref>The Arbitrator, January 1881</ref> from where he denounced the belligerence before applauding the negotiated settlement to end the [[First Boer War]]. The [[History of Egypt under the British|Egyptian crisis]] followed.\nThe British occupation of Egypt was the most important single act of British foreign policy during Gladstone's second administration and according to many historians has since become one of the classic case studies of the partition of Africa and of late nineteenth century informal imperialism in general.<ref>Robinson and Gallagher, pages 122\u2013210</ref> Lawson's agitation against intervention in [[Egypt]] was completely in harmony with his support for the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] [[Boers]] in their struggle against British rule; his support for [[Afghan]] tribesmen seeking to retain their independence; and his wish to see justice spread to encompass the needs of the [[Irish people]]. Underlying all of these policies was an inherent distrust of the concept of empire and a cardinal belief in the traditional assertions of [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], that Britain should promote peace, and avoid interference in the political institutions of other nations. In many respects, Egypt was Lawson's defining moment as an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] [[Political radicalism|radical]]. He not only led the agitation but he disagreed with the opinions of many of his radical contemporaries, colleagues he had and would later stand shoulder to shoulder with in agitating against similar imperialist concerns.<ref>Trouble Makers, A.J.P. Taylor, p. 81</ref> For three long years he criticised British diplomats and argued against a government of his own making; against the European bondholders control of the country;<ref>Hansard 26 Vol 269 Cols 1711\u201332 May 1882</ref> against the [[bombardment of Alexandria]];<ref>Hansard, Vol. 272 Col. 708 17 July 1882</ref>  and against the British armies destruction of the Egyptian force under [[Ahmed Orabi]] at the [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]].<ref>Hansard, Vol. 272 Col. 1335 & 1338 25 July 1882</ref> He argued against parliament awarding a Vote of Thanks for Britain's military leaders;<ref>Hansard, Vol. 274 Col. 32 24 October 1882</ref> and in conjunction with [[Wilfrid Scawen Blunt]] campaigned for the release of [[Ahmed Orabi]].<ref>Hansard Vol. 274 Col. 275 26 October 1882</ref> On one occasion, in a blistering attack on the Government's forward policy, Lawson reminded his colleagues of their probable response had the bombardment occurred under a Conservative and not a Liberal administration.\n::They would have had his right hon. friend the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] for the [[Home Office|Home Department]] ([[Sir William Harcourt]]), (laughter and cheers) stumping the country and denouncing Government by ultimatum.

(Laughter and cheers from the Irish Members). It was perfectly abominable to see men whom they respected, whom they believed in, whom they had placed in power, overturning every principle they had professed, carrying out a policy that was abhorrent to every lover of justice and of right.<ref>Hansard, vol. 272, col. 172, 12 July 1882</ref>\nAs quickly as [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] began to solve one problem another arrived in the [[Sudan]]. In 1881, an obscure tribesman and religious zealot named [[Muhammad Ahmad]], proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]], who initiated a [[Jihad]] against the Egyptian military occupation. After 50,000 Mahdist tribesmen annihilated a 10,000 strong Egyptian army under the command of a reluctant British mercenary, general [[William Hicks (British soldier)|William Hicks]] Pasha, the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] fully understood the serious nature of their involvement in Egypt. This resulted in the dispatch of General [[Charles George Gordon]] to oversee the evacuation of [[Khartoum]]. After supporting a policy of \u2018rescue and retire\u2019 Lawson quickly withdrew his support he could find no relationship between what Gladstone described as \"a small service to humanity,\" and the killing of thousands of Arabs.<ref>Hansard Vol 284 col. 896\u2013911 14 February 1884</ref> After the death of Gordon, Lawson applauded Gladstone's decision to evacuate the Sudan.\n\n===West Cumberland===\nIn 1885, after  the reduction  of  the [[carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] seat to  one  member Lawson  decided to contest the [[Henry Lowther, 3rd Earl of Lonsdale|Lowther]] dominated Cockermouth constituency.<ref>West Cumberland Times, 1 November 1881</ref> However, his attitude towards [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] imperialist policies in Egypt had made enemies in his [[Cockermouth]] constituency and  on 5 December, the newly enfranchised electorate rejected his appeal by a small but decisive margin of ten votes.<ref>West Cumberland Times, 6 December 1885</ref> As a result, Lawson missed the parliamentary debates surrounding [[Third Gladstone ministry|Irish home Rule]] and the subsequent schism of the Liberal party. Lawson was extremely critical of the newly formed [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] particularly in the roles played by [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and [[John Bright]]. In Lawson's opinion the turncoats had become the reactionary radical opposition and had placed Britain under the yoke of a Tory administration. He cared little for their names: [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]], Dissenting Liberals, [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|Hartingtonians]], [[Joseph Chamberlain|Chamberlainites]], Old [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], [[Lord Randolph Churchill|Randolphians]], Tory democrats, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], [[Constitutionalists]], Ruling Councillors, Knight Harbinghers, [[Union Jack]]s and Union Jackasses; they were all out and out Tories.<ref>The West Cumberland Times, 7 January 1888</ref> Lawson returned to the House of Commons in the election of 1886, one of only three \u2018Home Rulers\u2019 to capture a Conservative seat;<ref>The West Cumberland Times, 10 June 1887</ref>  converting a minority of ten into a majority of over one thousand.<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 187</ref> In parliament he vehemently opposed [[Arthur Balfour]]'s coercion measures.\nHe served as [[List of Presidents of Co-operative Congress|President]] of the second day of the 1887 [[Co-operative Congress]].<ref name=PDF>{{Citation| title =Congress Presidents 1869\u20132002| url =http://archive.co-op.ac.uk/downloadFiles/congressPresidentstable.pdf| date =February 2002| access-date =2008-05-10| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080528100558/http://archive.co-op.ac.uk/downloadFiles/congressPresidentstable.pdf| archive-date =28 May 2008| df =dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== The Newcastle programme and the second home rule bill===\n[[File:Wilfrid_Lawson.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Wilfrid Lawson c1895]]\nIn October 1891, the Liberal Party held their annual conference in the city of [[Newcastle Upon Tyne|Newcastle]], where delegates thrashed out a radical agenda to take them through the next General Election, and beyond to the new century. Immediately but reluctantly endorsed by Gladstone, [[the Newcastle Programme]] as it became popularly known was a grandiose scheme that enshrined the majority of Lawson's outstanding reforms.<ref>National Liberal Federation, Fourteenth Annual Conference 1891</ref>  Lawson had waited a lifetime for the realisation of these enactments, and boasted: \"If the chartists could rise from their graves they would not believe that the Liberal party had absolutely homologated those great reforms.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">The West Cumberland Times, 20 June 1892</ref> The election issue was no longer simply Home Rule; it was the full Newcastle programme, and Lawson was anxious to settle the Irish question to secure further domestic reforms.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Back in parliament Lawson continued to support Gladstone, who introduced his [[Government of Ireland Bill 1893|Second Home Rule bill]], which, except for a reduced number of Irish members at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] mirrored its predecessor. As expected the bills progress through Parliament was obstructed by the Opposition who emphasised all the inadequacies in the measure, which in turn justified the [[House of Lords]] rejecting the bill. In the Commons the bill passed its third reading on 1 September. However, after four nights of obligatory debate, the Lords rejected the measure by a huge majority of 419 to 41. Lawson was furious, mend them, was not his way, \"you only mend a thing you want to keep, and he never wanted to keep the House of Lords, he wanted to end them.\"<ref>The West Cumberland Times, 8 January 1890</ref> After Gladstone's resignation in 1894 Lawson's expectations crumbled.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Boer war===\nThe [[Cockermouth]] [[Electoral district|electorate]] returned Lawson to parliament in the general election of 1895, where, with a slightly reduced majority he continued to prosecute his anti-war opinions. In 1898, he criticised the government, the [[Clergy]], the newspaper editors and above all, public opinion after a command under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|General Kitchener]] slaughtered thousands of [[Dervish]] natives at the [[battle of Omdurman]].<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 247</ref> In 1896 he denounced the [[Jameson raid]] and sought answers to questions relating to the role played by the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], [[Joseph Chamberlain]].<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell page 230, 236, 253</ref> When war came in the form of the [[Second Boer War]], Lawson was unapologetic in his criticism of the British governments policy. He became a prominent [[opposition to the Second Boer War|Pro-Boer]] and a member of numerous anti war organisations including the [[Stop the War Committee]], the League of Liberals Against Aggression and Militarism, and the [[South Africa Conciliation Committee]]. On numerous occasions, he voted against, and spoke out against providing finance, sending men, ammunition and supplies, in the vain hope that with sufficient support he could bring down the government and so end the war.<ref>Hansard, Vol. 86 Cols. 1246-8 3 March 1899</ref> However, all his efforts came to nothing and in return he became one of the few pro-Boer politicians to lose his parliamentary seat at the subsequent so called [[Khaki election]] of 1900.\n\n===Camborne===\n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Lawson, political postcard.jpg|thumb|120px|Election Postcard]]\nFollowing the death of [[William Sproston Caine]] M.P. on 17 March 1903, the Liberal Association of the [[Camborne]] Division of [[Cornwall]] invited Lawson to stand on their behalf at the forthcoming by-election. They made the offer under peculiarly acceptable conditions, for should he secure the seat, he would be at liberty, when the next election occurred, to return, should he wish, to his old constituency at [[Cockermouth]]. Almost immediately after the Cornish electorate returned Lawson with a huge majority, the Cockermouth Liberal Associated selected him to stand as their candidate at the next election.<ref>West Cumberland Times, 20 May 1903</ref> In parliament he continued to prosecute his anti-imperialist, [[Free Trade]] and temperance views while at home he began to campaign for the oncoming election. In January 1906 he returned with a majority of almost 600.\n\n==Temperance==\nAlthough Lawson did not enter the House of Commons on behalf of the Temperance movement he became their chief parliamentary spokesman. In 1863 he spoke in favour of a Bill to introduce the Sunday closing of public houses.<ref>Hansard 3 June 1863 vol 171 cc277-319</ref> Later that year he proposed that \"the Laws under which Licences are granted for the sale of Intoxicating Liquors are eminently unsatisfactory and deficient in power to protect the public, and therefore require immediate alteration.\"<ref>Hansard, 16 July 1863 vol 172 cols 928-33</ref> After the resolution was heavily defeated he was encouraged to introduce his [[Permissive Bill]]. On 8 June, Lawson rose in front of a packed House of Commons to deliver a speech of great ability that filled four pages of [[Hansard]], to move the second reading of the first of several Permissive Bills. A policy that later became known as Local Option and eventually Local Veto, The Bill was fashioned to embody the convictions but not the policy of the [[United Kingdom Alliance]]. he did not propose to prohibit the sale of liquor by enactment. The Bill provided that on application of any district, be that [[parish]], [[town]] or [[borough]], the votes of the ratepayers should be cast on the question of whether the trade in alcoholic beverages should exist in that district or not; where a majority of two thirds of the [[Rates (tax)|ratepayers]] would be required to decide the outcome.<ref>Hansard, 8 June 1864 vol 175 cols 1390-423</ref> The Bill was heavily defeated by a majority of 257. He reintroduced the bill again in 1869,<ref>Hansard, 12 May 1869 vol 196 cols 637-83</ref> 1870,<ref>Hansard, 13 July 1870 vol 203 cols 169-91</ref> 1871,<ref>Hansard, 17 May 1871 vol 206 cols 917-53</ref> 1873,<ref>Hansard, 7 May 1873 vol 215 cols 1609\u201364</ref> 1874,<ref>Hansard, 17 June 1874 vol 220 cols 2\u201361</ref> 1876,<ref>Hansard, 14 June 1876 vol 229 col 1821\u201383</ref> 1878,<ref>Hansard 26 June 1878 vol 241 cols 251-97</ref> In 1879, he varied his attack on the drink trade by proposing a Resolution in place of the Permissive Bill. Taking the words from a recommendation of the [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation of the Province of Canterbury]], he asked that inhabitants of districts, being the persons most interested in the licensing of Public Houses, should themselves have the power of stopping such licensing, if they objected to having the trade forced upon them.<ref>Hansard, 11 March 1879 vol 244 cols 632\u2013753</ref> In the following year he moved his resolution on two occasions, In the first he was defeated by a majority of 114 votes,<ref>Hansard, 5 March 1880 vol 251 cols 441\u2013528</ref> whereas on the second occasion he carried his motion by 26 votes.<ref>Hansard, 18 June 1880 vol 253 cols 340-89</ref> Although he carried the motion again in 1881 and 1883 with majorities of 42 and 87, [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone's]] government failed to enact the policy.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:The Start of the Funeral Cortege 01.jpg|thumb|300px|The Start of the Funeral Cortege]]\nOn 30 June, though feeling tired and weary, Lawson went down to the House to record his vote. From where he returned to No 18, [[Ovington Square]], [[Knightsbridge]], London, went to bed and never rose again. The first part of the funeral arrangements took place at [[St Margaret's, Westminster|St Margaret's Church, Westminster]] amidst a large gathering of members of Parliament, family members, personal friends, and representatives of public bodies. [[File:The Start of the Funeral Cortege 02.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The End of the Funeral Cortege]]\nThe interment of the remains took place at [[Aspatria]] churchyard on the following day. The large concourse of people who followed the coffin from Brayton Hall to the churchyard was representative of the political and public life of the county, whilst the [[Temperance movement|temperance]] organisations represented were of a national character. The inscription on the coffin read:- Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, Born 4 September 1829, Died 1 July 1906.<ref>Carlisle Journal 6 July 1906</ref>\n\nAt the time of his death, Lawson was chiefly known as a pro-Boer, and anti-everything else; a [[little Englander]], a Peace-at-any-price Man, a would-be destroyer of the [[State religion|established church]], the [[House of Lords]], the liquor traffic, and several other institutions less robust. He supported payment for Members of parliament, [[women's suffrage]], the construction of a [[Channel tunnel]], the [[Irish Home Rule movement]], opposed coercion in all its manifestations and stoically defended [[Free Trade]] whenever a threat appeared. After a long career his successes were few, although in 1892, after an eighteen-year struggle, he did eventually get a majority against the motion for adjourning on the [[Epsom Derby|Derby day]].<ref>Hansard, 31 May 1892 vol 5 cc382-91</ref> Today he his primarily remembered as a Temperance Reformer.\nAlthough offered a [[Privy Council]]lorship by [[Henry Campbell Bannerman]] he declined.\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:The Sir Wilfrid Lawson Memorial, Aspatria.jpg|150px|thumb|The Sir Wilfrid Lawson Memorial, Aspatria]]\nOn 21 April 1908, the [[George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle|Earl of Carlisle]], unveiled a memorial, designed by [[Louis Frederick Roslyn]], in the form of a drinking fountain surmounted by a bronze group of [[St. George and the dragon]]. The monument, financed by public subscription, stands in the town of [[Aspatria]].  On the front of the fountain is a portrait of Lawson, inscribed with dates of birth and death. On the right hand side is a bronze panel representing [[Temperance Movement|Temperance]], in which is portrayed a young girl offering a traveller a drink of water, drawn from an adjoining well. On the left hand side a third panel depicts Peace, on which appears a tribesman dressed in savage garb, clasping the hand of friendship held out by a warrior kneeling at the feet of a winged Angel, which crowned by a halo is rising in the background. The fourth panel bears the following inscription:   \n::Remember\n::Wilfrid Lawson\n::2nd Baronet of Brayton & Isel\t\n::In whose honour this fountain is erected by his many friends and admirers. Beloved for the integrity of his life and the height of his ideals. An example for all time for one who gave himself for others, believing in the brotherhood of man. A lover of truth and mercy, a brave and strenuous advocate of temperance, which sacred cause he championed in the House of Commons for forty years with gay wisdom and perseverance.\n[[File:Unveiling of Sir Welfrid Lawson Memorial at Aspatria 21 April 1908.jpg|350px|thumb|left|Unveiling of Sir Welfrid Lawson Memorial at Aspatria 21 April 1908]]\nOn 6 June 1908, the Lawson family installed a stained glass window dedicated to the memory of their late patriarch, in the east end of Aspatria Church. The window is large and beautifully ornate, and symbolises the characters and scene of the last chapter of Revelations.<ref>The West Cumberland Times, 9 June 1908</ref>\n\nOn 20 July 1909, the members of the [[United Kingdom Alliance]] and other Temperance organisations erected a second memorial in the [[Victoria Embankment Gardens]] in London, close to [[Cleopatra's Needle (London)|Cleopatra's Needle]]. It was unveiled, amidst continuous interruptions by [[suffragettes]], by the then prime minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], who said:\n::\"Sir Wilfrid Lawson was one of the most remarkable and certainly one of the most attractive political characters of the times. He was an apostle not of lost but of gaining causes, content for most of his life to be in the minority, but watching year by year the minority slowly developing into the majority of the future. I doubt very much whether we shall ever see again in our time a combination in one and the same man of such fearlessness and courage, such a passionate love for freedom, such a single minded independence and self devotion, such an enduring and strenuous assiduity in pursuit of the cause once taken up, and never by him to be laid down; such a combination.\".<ref>Sir Wilfrid Lawson: A Memoir, Russell pages 375\u201388</ref>\nThe bronze statue, designed by David McGill, is striking, life like and shows Lawson, in an attitude of debate. On the front of the pedestal on which it stands is the inscription: \u2013 \"Sir Wilfrid Lawson, Bart., of Brayton, [[Cumberland]]; born September 4th, 1829: Member of Parliament for [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]], [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth]], [[Camborne (UK Parliament constituency)|Camborne]], 1859 1906; president of the United Kingdom Temperance Alliance, 1879 1909.\" On one side of the pedestal are the words. \"A true patriot, a wise and witty orator, a valiant and farseeing reformer, he spent a long life as the courageous champion of righteousness, peace, freedom and temperance.\" On the other side the inscription runs. \"Erected by his friends and followers in grateful remembrance of his splendid leadership, and of his pure and unworldly life, July 20th, 1909.\"\n[[File:Copy of Mammoth 011.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Sir Wilfrid Lawson in the Victoria Embankment Gardens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Sir Wilfrid Lawson by W B Luke (Political Biography published by Simpkin Marshall of London in 1900).\n* Sir Wilfrid Lawson A Memoir Edited by G W Russell (Political Biography published by Smith Elder & Co. of London in 1909).\n* Wisdom Grave & Gay Being Selected Speeches of Sir Wilfrid Lawson On Social Reform &C Edited by R A Jamieson (Published by S W Partridge & Co of London in 1889).\n* Cartoons In Rhyme And Line By Sir Wilfrid Lawson and F Carruthers Gould (Published by T Fisher Unwin of London in 1905).\n* Wilfrid Lawson: Attitudes and Opinions on Britain's Imperial and Foreign Policy (1868\u20131892) by Terry Carrick (Unpublished Thesis for a Ph.D.)\n* Some Notable Cumbrians by Sir F.

Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.<ref>http://www.arthistory.net</ref>\n\nAs a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, \"the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians\".<ref>Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press</ref>\n\nAs a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or \"[[philosophy of art]]\", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.<ref>Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).</ref>\n\nArt history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?\n\nThe historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a \"[[Western canon|canon]]\" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.\n\n{{History of art sidebar}}\n{{European art history}}\n\n==Definition==\nart is the best\n\n==Methodologies==\nArt historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.\n\nArt historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.\n\nArt historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational\u2014also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an \"impression\" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].\n\nAn [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.\n\nMany art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.\n\nMore recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.<ref>Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010</ref> From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.<ref>[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010</ref> Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&source=bl&ots=NOIDTggsRX&sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&hl=en&ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H.

His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.\n\nVasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Winckelmann and art criticism===\nScholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717\u20131768), criticised Vasari's \"cult\" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken \u00fcber die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase \u2018history of art\u2019 in the title of a book)\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}</ref> Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818\u20131897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.\n\nWinckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laoco\u00f6n group]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederl\u00e4ndische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden K\u00fcnste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].\n\n===W\u00f6lfflin and stylistic analysis===\n:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.\n[[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]] (1864\u20131945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the \"father\" of modern art history. W\u00f6lfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|fa\u00e7ades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], W\u00f6lfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an \"art history without names.\" Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently \"Italian\" and an inherently \"[[Culture of Germany|German]]\" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]].\n\n===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===\n{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}\nContemporaneous with W\u00f6lfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.\n\nThe next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Julius von Schlosser]], Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term \"Second Vienna School\" (or \"New Vienna School\") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto P\u00e4cht, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; P\u00e4cht, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.\n\n===Panofsky and iconography===\n[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]\nOur 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. \"Iconography\"\u2014with roots meaning \"symbols from writing\" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources\u2014especially scripture and mythology. \"Iconology\" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.\n\nPanofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.\n\nWarburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.\n\n===Freud and psychoanalysis===\nHeinrich W\u00f6lfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].\n[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]]]]\nThough the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.\n\nAn unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo's Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.<ref name=Freud>Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.</ref> Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari's ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.\n\n===Jung and archetypes===\n[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.<ref>In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.</ref> He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.<ref>Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.</ref> His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.\n\nJung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.<ref>[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}</ref>\n\nThe legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.\n\n===Marx and ideology===\nDuring the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nMarcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.<ref>Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). \"Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932\". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.</ref>\n\nArtist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.\nPerhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay \"[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]\".<ref>[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961</ref> In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called \"[[vulgar Marxism]]\".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nMarxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Feminist art history===\n[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay \"[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]\" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled \"Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art\". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}</ref> The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.\n\nWhile feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical \"re-reading\" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].\n\n===Barthes and semiotics===\nAs opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]\u2019s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]\u2014the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]\u2014the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.<ref>All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31.\"</ref>\n\nSemiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].<ref>\"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128.\"</ref> Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]\u2019s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.<ref>\"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213.\"</ref> According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce\u2019s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or \u201cunlimited semiosis\u201d is endless; the art historian's job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.<ref name=\"A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24\">\"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24.\"</ref>\n\nSemiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer's perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.<ref name=\"A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24\" /> [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay \u201cIn the Name of Picasso.\u201d She denounced the artist's monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.<ref>\"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208.\"</ref>\n\n===Museum studies and collecting===\nAspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.\n\n===New materialism===\nScientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.\n\nConcurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor\u2013network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.\n\n===Nationalist art history===\nThe making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one's country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country's identity.\n\nMost art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.\n\nMany of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government\u2014regardless of what cultures created the art\u2014and an often implicit mission to bolster that country's own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.\n\n==Divisions by period==\nThe field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in \"19th-century German [[architecture]]\" or in \"16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture.\" Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).\n\n[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.\n\n\"Contemporary art history\" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.\n\n==Professional organizations==\nIn the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].<ref>[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]</ref> It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.<ref>[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Aesthetics]]\n*[[Art criticism]]\n*''[[Bildwissenschaft]]''\n*[[Fine Art]]s\n*[[History of art]]\n*[[Visual arts and Theosophy]]\n*[[Women in the art history field]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Listed by date\n*W\u00f6lfflin, H.

Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.<ref>http://www.arthistory.net</ref>\n\nAs a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, \"the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians\".<ref>Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press</ref>\n\nAs a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or \"[[philosophy of art]]\", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.<ref>Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).</ref>\n\nArt history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?\n\nThe historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a \"[[Western canon|canon]]\" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.\n\n{{History of art sidebar}}\n{{European art history}}\n\n==Definition==\nArt history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.\n\n==Methodologies==\nArt historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.\n\nArt historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.\n\nArt historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational\u2014also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an \"impression\" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].\n\nAn [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.\n\nMany art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.\n\nMore recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.<ref>Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010</ref> From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.<ref>[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010</ref> Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&source=bl&ots=NOIDTggsRX&sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&hl=en&ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H.

His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.\n\nVasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Winckelmann and art criticism===\nScholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717\u20131768), criticised Vasari's \"cult\" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken \u00fcber die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase \u2018history of art\u2019 in the title of a book)\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}</ref> Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818\u20131897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.\n\nWinckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laoco\u00f6n group]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederl\u00e4ndische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden K\u00fcnste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].\n\n===W\u00f6lfflin and stylistic analysis===\n:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.\n[[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]] (1864\u20131945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the \"father\" of modern art history. W\u00f6lfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|fa\u00e7ades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], W\u00f6lfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an \"art history without names.\" Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently \"Italian\" and an inherently \"[[Culture of Germany|German]]\" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]].\n\n===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===\n{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}\nContemporaneous with W\u00f6lfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.\n\nThe next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]], [[Julius von Schlosser]], Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term \"Second Vienna School\" (or \"New Vienna School\") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto P\u00e4cht, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; P\u00e4cht, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.\n\n===Panofsky and iconography===\n[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]\nOur 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. \"Iconography\"\u2014with roots meaning \"symbols from writing\" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources\u2014especially scripture and mythology. \"Iconology\" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.\n\nPanofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.\n\nWarburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.\n\n===Freud and psychoanalysis===\nHeinrich W\u00f6lfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].\n[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]]]]\nThough the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.\n\nAn unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo's Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.<ref name=Freud>Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''.

Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.</ref> Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari's ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.\n\n===Jung and archetypes===\n[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.<ref>In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.</ref> He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.<ref>Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.</ref> His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.\n\nJung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.<ref>[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}</ref>\n\nThe legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.\n\n===Marx and ideology===\nDuring the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nMarcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.<ref>Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). \"Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932\". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.</ref>\n\nArtist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.\nPerhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay \"[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]\".<ref>[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961</ref> In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called \"[[vulgar Marxism]]\".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nMarxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n===Feminist art history===\n[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay \"[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]\" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled \"Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art\". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}</ref> The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.\n\nWhile feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical \"re-reading\" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].\n\n===Barthes and semiotics===\nAs opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]\u2019s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]\u2014the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]\u2014the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.<ref>All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31.\"</ref>\n\nSemiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].<ref>\"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128.\"</ref> Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]\u2019s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.<ref>\"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213.\"</ref> According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce\u2019s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or \u201cunlimited semiosis\u201d is endless; the art historian's job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.<ref name=\"A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24\">\"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24.\"</ref>\n\nSemiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer's perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.<ref name=\"A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24\" /> [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay \u201cIn the Name of Picasso.\u201d She denounced the artist's monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.<ref>\"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208.\"</ref>\n\n===Museum studies and collecting===\nAspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.\n\n===New materialism===\nScientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.\n\nConcurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor\u2013network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.\n\n===Nationalist art history===\nThe making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one's country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country's identity.\n\nMost art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.\n\nMany of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government\u2014regardless of what cultures created the art\u2014and an often implicit mission to bolster that country's own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.\n\n==Divisions by period==\nThe field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in \"19th-century German [[architecture]]\" or in \"16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture.\" Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).\n\n[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.\n\n\"Contemporary art history\" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.\n\n==Professional organizations==\nIn the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].<ref>[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]</ref> It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.<ref>[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Aesthetics]]\n*[[Art criticism]]\n*''[[Bildwissenschaft]]''\n*[[Fine Art]]s\n*[[History of art]]\n*[[Visual arts and Theosophy]]\n*[[Women in the art history field]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Listed by date\n*W\u00f6lfflin, H.

The ten basic elements are plant, fire, earth, cold, lightning, water, air, metal, light, and dark.\n\nEpic dragons are rarer than basic elemental dragons and hybrids. Types of Epic dragon include Sun, Moon, Rainbow, Treasure, Olympus, Gemstone, Dream, Seasonal, Apocalypse, Chrysalis, Ornamental, Crystalline, Snowflake, Monolith, Aura, Hidden, Galactic, and Surface.\n\nThere are a number of limited or rare dragons, known as \"Special Dragons\", that are only available during a specific period of time. These dragons are themed toward specific [[holidays]], seasons, anomalies, months, and events. For example, the Ghost dragon is available for [[Halloween]] and the [[Reindeer]] dragon is available for [[Christmas|the winter holidays]]. Many Epic dragons are also limited; for example, the [[Leap year|Leap Year]] Dragon that is theoretically only available every 4 years. Limited dragons are often released alongside a limited park decoration. Limited dragons include the gemstone dragons, which correspond to the monthly birthstones. Gemstone dragons earn gems rather than dragoncash.

The higher level a dragon is, the more dragoncash it will earn per minute. Different dragons earn dragoncash at different rates. For example, a Gift dragon at level 10 can only earn 77 dragoncash per minute while a level 10 Moon Dragon can earn 256 coins per minute. Rainbow Dragons can earn 400 dragoncash per minute at level 10.\n\nThere have also been several events held in relation to time of year or holidays that require the player to do a number of activities like collecting Dragoncash/Gems, hatching or selling dragons after incubation, and other special provisions.

Willamson was released two and a half years later on 30 October 1944, when he once again turned to developing his horseracing career.\n\nHe married Zelma Ava Dickman, a hairdresser on 17 January 1949 at St Paul's Church of England, in Caulfield, Melbourne. Willamson won his first Victorian jockey premiership in the 1951-52 season and rode the horse ''[[Dalray]]'' to a victory in the 1952 [[Melbourne Cup]]. He went on to win five more, and won the [[Cox Plate|W. S. Cox Plate]] and [[Brisbane Cup]] in 1953, a season where he set a Victorian record with 67 and a half winners.<ref>Sydney ''Daily Mirror'', dated 21 October 1953</ref> He later won the Duke of Edinburgh [[Australian Cup]] (1954) but faced a setback in October of that year when a fall nearly cost him his life and put him out of racing for nine months. Recovering from his injuries, he went on to win the [[Caulfield Cup]] in 1955 on the famous horse ''[[Rising Fast]]'' and Ilumquh in 1960 amongst others.\n\nHe moved to [[Ireland]] in 1960 and later to [[England]] which he won a number of important mainstream races throughout the 1960s such as the [[1,000 Guineas Stakes|1,000 Guineas]] in 1962 on ''Abermaid'' and ''Night Off'' in 1965. Williamson won the [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]] at Longchamp, Paris, in 1968 and 1969 which brought him significant praise, notably from [[Lester Piggott]].<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160661b.htm Australian Dictionary of Biography]</ref> In total he won 8 Classic Races in Ireland, 2 Classic Races in England and 3 Classic Races in mainland Europe, including France in 1971.<ref>[http://www.horsedirectory.com.au/racinghistory/jockey/profiles/bill_williamson.html Horsedirectory.com]</ref>\n\nHe retired from professional racing in 1973 when he took up a new job as a racing manager for the Indian shipping magnate Ravi Tikkoo.\n\nHe returned to his native Melbourne in 1977 but developed cancer, and died on 28 January 1979 in South Caulfield Melbourne. He is buried at the Cheltenham Memorial Park (Wangara Road).\n\n== The Australian years ==\nApprentice Bill Williamson rode his first winner in 1937, but it was only after he was discharged from the army, where he served as a driver with the 119th General Transport Company, after which his career gathered pace. Much of Williamson\u2019s early success came from his association with trainers Lou Robertson and Fred Hoysted, both members of the Racing\u2019s Hall of Fame. His greatest success came in the 1952 Melbourne Cup when he rode Dalray to victory (with a broken left arm, being an injury sustained during a fall some three weeks before). He twice won the Caulfield Cup on Rising Fast in 1955 and Ilumquh 1960. He won the Victorian Jockey\u2019s Premiership in six of the eight years, before he headed abroad in 1960, where he rode until his retirement in 1973.\n\nWilliamson rode with great distinction in England, Ireland and Europe winning thirteen classic races, eight in Ireland, two in England and three in Europe. \"He and Scobie Breasley were the best two jockeys I\u2019ve ever seen,\" International jockey Ron Hutchison said, \"he was extremely patient, sitting and waiting until the final three hundreds to take off. He was just a wonderful stylist, so nice to watch, a straight back, low in the saddle and perfect balance.\"\n\nThe sleepy eyed Williamson (dubbed \"Weary Willy\" by the English press due to his sleepy eyes) was an exceptionally modest man with an intense dislike for self-promotion. He never bothered to add up the number of winners he rode, and was vague about his achievements and the names of champions he had ridden. Once asked why he did not smile after he had won, \"because half an hour later I might get beat on a favourite and I was sorry I smiled.\" He also said \"who smiles, really, when they are working?\"\n\nHe became interested in horses as a child because of the achievements of his mothers uncle Bobby Lewis, the famous jockey (four times winner of Melbourne Cup). The family came from Epsom in Victoria and bought Bill a pony when he was only seven. As his skills improved, trainer Alex McCracken allowed him to work his horse at the track at Mentone. As soon as he could leave school, he became an apprentice to Fred Lewis, Bob's brother at Epsom.\n\nHis first winner came at Epsom in 1937 on a horse called Lilirene, the last winner Bobby Lewis rode to victory ironically. Lewis was a hard master and pointed out so many faults in Williamson's riding, that the boy wondered how the boy managed to stay on.\n\nWilliamson spent 18 months in the army as a driver with the 119th General Transport Company in World War 2, but in 1944, on a leave of absence, he rode Lawrence into second place in the Caulfield Cup won by Counsel. He believed Lawrence would have won the race had it been at Flemington as he had been for the previous four years during the war. He won the VRC St Leger that year on Lawrence and the VRC Sires Produce Stakes on Delina, both trained by Lou Robertson.\n\nWhen he became the number one rider for the powerful Father Hoysted, Williamson's career really took off. His association with Hoysted assured him rides on outstanding horses and, over the next 25 years, he rode hundreds of winners for the Hoysteds. He wins includes the 1955 Caulfield Cup on Rising Fast, on whom he ridden on 30 occasions, 1953 Maribyrnong Plate on the flying fillie fascinating, 1951 VRC St Leger on Midway, the 1950 VRC Oaks on the brilliant True Course and the three consecutive VRC Sire Produce Stakes on True Course in 1950, Usage in 1951 and Pure Fire in 1952.\n\nWilliamson is also remembered for his bad luck in the 1955 Melbourne Cup, in which Rising Fast was allegedly interfered with by Toporoa while the former was attempting to win the cups double, i.e. consecutive Melbourne Cups. The winner of the 1954-55 Caulfield Cups was allotted a massive 63.5&nbsp;kg \u2013 yes folks, more than Phar Lap was asked to carry in the 1930 Melbourne Cup,- when attempting to win his second straight Melbourne Cup in 1955. Rising Fast conceded 15.5&nbsp;kg to Toporoa, who won by a length having moved out in the straight, some experts saying taking out Rising Fast's ground in doing so.\n\nOn lookers expected Williamson to fire in a protest against Sellwood on his return to scale. While none was forthcoming, Sellwood was suspended for two months for his interference in the race at an adjourned inquiry the next day. Williamson never elaborated on the incident but did confide with the co-writer of this biography, that the interference in question made no impact on the result as the horse was tiring under his huge weight of the time, but to others this explanation was not forthcoming and died with him.\n\nHe was also remembered for his part in the famous triple dead heat in the 1956 Hotham Handicap at Flemington, when his mount Pandie Sun, trained by the late Collin Hayes, shared the honours with Fighting Force (Jockey Jack Purtell) and Arc Royal (Jockey Reggie Heather).\n\n== The European years ==\nWilliamson went to Europe in 1960 with wife Zelma and his two sons, spending two years in Ireland with Seamus McGrath, for whom he won several [[Irish Classic Races|Irish classics]]. Having moved to England in 1962, Williamson won the Ascot Gold Cup, French Gold Cup and the Arc de Triomphe on Levmoss in 1969, a considerable feat in the same year considering the fact the horse was stylishly winning long distance races over 2.5\u20133 miles, having to revert to a mile and half against the cream of the crop of Europe to win Arc de Triomphe. Not only did he win this mile and half super classic, at odds of 50-1, he did it in record time (a magnificent feat). Williamson said to the co-writer, \"who did you back? I bet you backed Lester (Piggett) on Parktop\" who ran second - the disgruntled co-writer admitted he had.\n\nHe also won the Champions Stakes on the Irish trained Arctic Storm, and the Doncaster Cup on the [[Paddy Prendergast (racehorse trainer)|Paddy Prendergast]] trained Canterbury.\n\nDubbed \"Weary Willy\" by the English press because of his sleepy eyes and lack of socialising, Williamson also won the classic One Thousand Guineas at Newmarket twice on Abermaid, trained by Harry Wragg, and Night Off, trained by Major Lionel Holiday, amongst many other major races.\n\nHe retired from professional racing in 1973 where he took up a new job as Racing Manager for the Indian shipping magnate, Ravi Tikkoo. After a most distinguished career in the saddle of some 37 years, he returned to Melbourne in 1976 at the age of 54 and became assistant start for the VRC and VATC until his death on 28 January 1979.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160661b.htm?hilite=williamson Australian Dictionary of Biography: Williamson, William]\n*[http://www.focrc.org Friends of Cheltenham and Regional Cemeteries Inc.]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Williamson, Bill}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:1979 deaths]]\n[[Category:Jockeys from Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Australian Thoroughbred Racing Hall of Fame inductees]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the English footballer|Bill Williamson (footballer)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=June 2014}}\n{{Infobox horseracing personality\n|name  = Bill Williamson\n|image= [[File:BillWilliamson.jpg|240px]]\n|caption  = \n|occupation  = [[Jockey]]\n|birth_place = [[Australia]]\n|birth_date  =  19 December 1922\n|death_date  = 28 January 1979\n|career wins  = \n|race  = [[Melbourne Cup]] (1952)<br>[[W S Cox Plate]] (1953)<br>[[Brisbane Cup]] (1953)<br>[[Australian Cup]] (1954)<br>[[Caulfield Cup]] (1955,1960)<br>\n'''[[British Classic Races|British Classic Race]] wins:'''\n|awards = 1951/2 Victorian jockeys premiership\n|honours  = \n|horses  = \n|updated = 10 April 2011\n}}\n\n'''Bill Williamson''' born '''William James Williamson''' (19 December 1922 \u2013 28 January 1979) was an [[Australia]]n [[jockey]] who enjoyed considerable success in Australia during the 1950s and in Europe during the 1960s.

This issue was discussed in Rajyasabha with lot of hot debates and speaker suspended the Rajyasabha for 15 minutes.\n\n===Appointment of Gujarat Lokayukta===\nThe [[Lokayukta]] is a state-level body for monitoring the government, particularly for corruption. In August 2011, Beniwal appointed Justice [[R A Mehta]] as the Lokayukta. She did this under Section 3 of the Gujarat Lokayukta Act,\n1986, which gives the governor the right to appoint Lokayukta without consulting the\ngovernment,<ref name=toi>\n{{cite news | title =        Anna man is Gujarat Lokayukta| work =    [[Times of India]]| url =   http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-27/ahmedabad/29935689_1_gujarat-hc-gujarat-high-court-chief-justice | date =  27 August 2011}}</ref> when there has been a long delay in making the appointment. In so doing, Beniwal bypassed the [[Narendra Modi]] government of Gujarat, which had been sitting on the matter since 2004.\n\nJustice Mehta had been recommended by the Chief Justice of the [[Gujarat High Court]] in June 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_is-justice-ra-mehta-likely-to-be-appointed-gujarat-lok-ayukta_1555291 |title=Is Justice RA Mehta likely to be appointed Gujarat lok ayukta? - India - DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=15 June 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}</ref> but the government did not act on the suggestion.  In August, the father of murdered [[Right to Information Act|RTI]] activist [[Amit Jethwa]] filed a [[Public Interest Litigation]] in the High Court, which then served a show cause notice on the government for the delay in the appointment of Lokayukta.  In response, the Gujarat state cabinet set up another committee of five ministers to look into the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/r-mehta-gujarat-lokayukta-111044463.html |title=R.A.

Officially named '''Minnehaha Regional Park''', it is part of the [[Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board]] system and lies within the [[Mississippi National River and Recreation Area]], a unit of the [[National Park Service]].  The park was designed by landscape architect [[Horace W.S. Cleveland]] in 1883 as part of the [[Grand Rounds Scenic Byway]] system, and was part of the popular steamboat [[Upper Mississippi River]] \"Fashionable Tour\" in the 1800s.\n\nThe park preserves historic sites that illustrate transportation, pioneering, and architectural themes. Preserved structures include the Minnehaha Princess Station, a Victorian train depot built in the 1870s; the [[John H. Stevens House]], built in 1849 and moved to the park from its original location in 1896, utilizing horses and 10,000 school children; and the [[Longfellow House]], a house built to resemble the [[Longfellow House\u2013Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site|Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's house]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  The park was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1969 as the '''Minnehaha Historic District'''<ref name=nris/> in recognition of its state-level significance in architecture, commerce, conservation, literature, transportation, and urban planning.<ref name=\"Grossman\">{{cite journal |last=Grossman |first=John |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory \u2013 Nomination Form: Minnehaha Park Historic District |url={{NRHP url|id=69000369}} |publisher=National Park Service |date=1969-10-22 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThe central feature of the park, Minnehaha Falls, was a favorite subject of pioneer photographers, beginning with [[Alexander Hesler]]'s [[daguerreotype]] in 1852. Although he never visited the park, [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] helped to spread the waterfall's fame when he wrote his celebrated poem, ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]''.  The falls are located on Minnehaha Creek near the creek's [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] with the [[Mississippi River]], near [[Fort Snelling]]. The main [[Minnesota Veterans Home]] is located on a bluff where the Mississippi and Minnehaha Creek converge. More than 850,000 people visit Minnehaha Falls each year, and it continues to be the most photographed site in Minnesota.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Image:Casper wild.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Snelling in 1844, by John Caspar Wild]]\n\nSettlement in the area began in 1805 when the US Army bought a nine-square-mile tract of land at the confluence of the Mississippi and [[Minnesota River]] from the native [[Sioux]].  Sited on the bluff overlooking the rivers, [[Fort Snelling]] was built under the command of Colonel [[Josiah Snelling]] between 1820 and 1824. In 1821 Snelling's son, [[William Joseph Snelling]] came to the fort after leaving [[West Point]] and spending a year with friendly [[Sioux]].  According to a Minnesota history account written in 1858, \"The year after he came to the fort young Snelling set out in company with [[Joseph R. Brown]], a frontiersman and local celebrity, to explore the rivulet that supplies the cascade of Minne Ha-Ha, as far as [[Lake Minnetonka|Lake Minne Tonka]].\"  Both \"men\" were 17-year-old boys at the time.<ref name=\"William Joseph Snelling  and the Early Northwest\">{{cite web |url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/10/v10i04p367-385.pdf |title=William Joseph Snelling and the Early Northwest |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |accessdate=29 April 2015 |author=Woodall, Allen E.}}</ref>\n\nSome very early records refer to the falls as \"Brown's Falls\" which lead some historians to assume they were named after prominent pioneer Joseph R. Brown.  Park Ranger Kathy Swenson, writing for the National Park Service in 2009 states: \"The overwhelming evidence points to Brown's Falls (and creek) being named for Jacob Brown, major general and commander in chief of the army from 1814 \u2013 1828 rather than for Joseph R. Brown, teenage musician at Fort Snelling and later army sergeant (1820\u20131828), fur trader, politician, editor, and inventor. However, I have not yet found a document that officially or specifically mentions Jacob Brown as the namesake.\"  Swenson explains \"'Browns Fall/Creek' seems to be most associated with military maps and personnel while\n'Little Falls/Creek' seems to be favored by those without a strong military connection although there are exceptions.\"<ref name=\"Naming Minnehaha Falls\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minnehahacreek.org/sites/minnehahacreek.org/files/attachments/NamingMinnehahaFalls-KathySwenson_0.pdf |title=Naming Minnehaha Falls |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=29 April 2015 |author=Park Ranger Kathy Swenson, National Park Service, 2009}}</ref>  The current name is [[Dakota language|Dakota]] for waterfall (Mn\u00ed\u021fa\u021fa, \"curling water\").<ref>{{cite news |url=https://eminnetonka.com/documents/naturalresourcesdocs/Minnehaha_Design_2011_web.pdf |format=PDF |title=Minnehaha Creek Watershed Map |work=City of Minnetonka |date=2011 |accessdate=2018-12-04 }}</ref>\n\n===''The Song of Hiawatha'' brings fame ===\n\nThe name \"Minnehaha Falls\" was in common use by 1855, when the publication of ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'' by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] brought the falls worldwide fame.  Longfellow's [[epic poem]] features Hiawatha, a Native American hero who falls in love with Minnehaha, a Native American woman who later dies during a severe winter.  Longfellow never visited the falls himself.  He was inspired by the writings of Mary H. Eastman and [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]], and by a daguerreotype created by [[Alexander Hesler]] when he chose the name for Hiawatha's lover.  The image was taken in 1852, according to a letter written by Hesler, as discussed in \"Minnesota History\" magazine.<ref name=\"Minnesota History magazine\">{{cite web |url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/8/v08i03p281-282.pdf |title=Minnesota History Magazine }}</ref>\n\n===The \"Fashionable Tour\"===\n[[File:Minne-ha-ha, by Upton, B.

The steamboat journey began to attract the attention of tourists, and in 1835 well known artist of American Indian life [[George Catlin]] made a trip by steamboat up the Mississippi from St. Louis to the Falls of St. Anthony and Fort Snelling. Impressed with the scenery, Catlin proposed a \"Fashionable Tour\" of the upper Mississippi, saying:\n\n<blockquote>This Tour would comprehend but a small part of the great \"Far West\"; but it will furnish to the traveller a fair sample, and being apart of it which is now made so easily accessible to the world, and the only part of it to which ladies can have access, I would recommend to all who have time and inclination to devote to the enjoyment of so splendid a Tour, to wait not, but make it while the subject is new, and capable of producing the greatest degree of pleasure.<ref name=\"tour\" /></blockquote>\n\nFollowing Catlin's visit, each ensuing year saw an increasing number of sightseers, artists, and photographers.  Hundreds of [[Stereoscopic View]] cards of the falls exist.  The visitors were mainly men but a few women took the journey, most notably 80-year-old [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton]], the widow of [[Alexander Hamilton]].

In these two cities alone more than four hundred thousand people saw the exhibition. \"The river comes to me instead of my going to the river,\" wrote Longfellow. [[John Greenleaf Whittier|Whittier]], after seeing a panorama, sang of the \"new Canaan of our Israel,\" and [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], who not only viewed a panorama but also made the tour itself, envisaged a coming heroic age in which simple and obscure men, the real heroes of history, would build the foundations of new castles [i]n the West and throw bridges across a \"Rhine stream of a different kind.\"<ref name=\"tour\" /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Minnehaha_Falls_from_1878_guide_to_summer_resorts.jpg |thumb|left|upright| Minnehaha Falls ~ from 1878 Minnesota guide to summer resorts]]\n\nAccording to an account written in 1852, passengers disembarked St. Paul and \"[from there traveled by] stagecoach for what was called the 'grand tour.'

The board began by acquiring park land near today's downtown Minneapolis. Their choice to hire noted landscape architect [[Horace Cleveland]] was fortunate.  Cleveland was hired by the Board to design a system of parks and interconnected parkways to connect and preserve the existing natural landscape.  Cleveland was a preservationist by nature, respecting the natural landscape features and using the existing topography and vegetation to keep his designs as natural as possible.  When the park board considered building a photographic stand in the lower glen near the falls in 1889, he responded saying:\n\n<blockquote>I learn that the park commission are seriously thinking of a building at Minnehaha for the express purpose of taking photographs\u2014on the site heretofore profaned by a shanty for that purpose. I cannot remain silent in view of this proposed vandalism which I am sure you cannot sanction\u2014and which I am equally sure will forever be a stigma upon Minneapolis and elicit the anathema of every man of sense and taste who visits the place. If erected it will simply be pandering to the tastes of the army of boobies who think to boost themselves into notoriety by connecting their own stupid features with the representation of one of the most beautiful of God's works.<ref name=\"MPRB history\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe result of Cleveland's vision is the famous \"Grand Rounds\", an interconnected series of parkways and parks centered on the Mississippi River. This vision was expanded by subsequent park commissioners and superintendents to encircle a series of lakes, now known as the \"Chain of Lakes\", and to follow Minnehaha Creek to Minnehaha Falls. The area was designated as a [[National Scenic Byway]] in 1998, and the [[Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway|Minneapolis Grand Rounds]] is known today as one of the best urban park systems in the world.\n\n===Acquisition and development===\n\n[[File:Minnehaha Falls, Minnesota c1908.jpg|thumb|Minnehaha falls with rustic bridge ~ circa 1895]]\n[[File:Minnehaha Falls on June 22, 2013 - Picture 2 of 6.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque with photograph of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, and Governor Karl Rolvaag visiting the Falls in 1964]]\nWhen Minneapolis' Park Board purchased Minnehaha Falls and surrounding land in 1889, it became one of the first state parks in the United States; only New York had created a state park by that time. The next summer the Park Board began to furnish the park with tables, seating, and lavatories.  By 1893 a pavilion had been built and the park approved funding for two bridges \"of a rustic nature\", one above the falls and the other below.  A refectory was built in 1905 to serve \"refreshments of a clean and wholesome nature at a reasonable cost.\"  In 1926 the park board designated the park to be a center for winter sports activities; plans were made to build a ski jump and the board purchased toboggans for rental.  Major improvements including retaining walls, bridges, and stairs were made by federal [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) crews from 1936 to 1942.<ref name=\"MPRB history\">{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/minnehaha_regional_park/#group_3_16969 |title=Minnehaha Regional Park - History |publisher=Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board |accessdate=December 27, 2017 |first=David C. |last=Smith}}</ref>\n\nWhile on the campaign trail in 1964, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and Minnesota Senator [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] visited the park.  Johnson would go on to win the presidential election that year with Humphrey as his running mate.  Their visit is commemorated with a plaque which reads:\n\n<blockquote>President Lyndon B. Johnson, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey and Governor Karl Rolvaag enjoy the spray from Minnehaha Falls.  On that day, however, Minneapolis was experiencing a drought.  In order to create the beautiful spray of the falls pictured here the city had to open many fire hydrants upstream and out of sight, to feed water to the creek.</blockquote>\n\nThe park saw conflict in the 1960s when the highway department planned an elevated freeway between Minnehaha Park and Longfellow Gardens over Minnehaha Creek. The park board challenged the plan and brought the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Fortunately for the park a similar case was decided in favor of the preservation of park land, thus setting a precedent, and the elevated freeway was never built.  Eventually a highway was built in the late 1990s that routed the road through a tunnel over the creek and covered by a \"land bridge\". A new garden, the Longfellow Garden, was established on top of the land bridge.<ref name=\"MPRB history\" />\n\nMajor improvements were also made in the 1990s.  The Pergola Garden was created to feature native wildflowers and grasses.  The parking lot that once overlooked the falls was removed, replaced by a garden and a low circular wall inscribed with Longfellow's words. The old refectory was given a veranda and a bandshell was added.  In 2007 a new river overlook was built in the Wabun picnic area and included a children's playground.<ref name=\"MPRB history\" />\n\nIn 2011 major restoration work on the park was completed.  The crumbling historic retaining walls built by the WPA in the 1930s were reinforced, eroded stream banks were restored, natural seating areas made of limestone were added, and trails and paths were improved. Landscape improvements were also done: invasive plants were removed and replaced with native plantings with deeper roots to stabilize the stream banks and prevent erosion.<ref name=\"Minnehaha Creek Watershed District\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minnehahacreek.org/project/minnehaha-falls-and-glen-restoration |title=Restoring a Historic Landmark |publisher=Minnehaha Falls and Glen Restoration |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nMore than 850,000 people visit Minnehaha Falls each year, and it continues to be the most photographed site in Minnesota.<ref name=\"Minnehaha Creek Watershed District\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minnehahacreek.org/project/minnehaha-falls-and-glen-restoration |title=Restoring a Historic Landmark |publisher=Minnehaha Falls and Glen Restoration |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:minnehahamap.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the north end of the park]]\n[[File:FrozenMinnehaha.jpg|thumb|right|Frozen Minnehaha Falls]]\n\nMinnehaha Park is situated on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]] within the [[Minnehaha Historic District]].  Located between Hiawatha Avenue and the Minnehaha Parkway, the park includes [[Minnehaha Creek]] with its falls and glen.  The 167-acre park is divided into two main portions: an upper section above the falls, with grassy open areas like many other city parks, and the lower 54-acre section which is for the most part allowed to maintain its natural state. The creek runs through the upper section and after it drops at the falls, it flows through the lower glen for another three-fourths of a mile.\n\nMinnehaha Park is a popular site for weddings and cultural festivities. Minnesota is well known for its large population of Swedish immigrants. Since 1934 Swedes have celebrated ''Svenskarnas Dag'' (Swedish Heritage Day) at the park in June of each year. The park has a bandstand with free music concerts in the summer.  Bicyclists use miles of off-street trails, including the former Milwaukee Road right-of-way, which  leads to [[Fort Snelling State Park]].  Bikes are available for rent, and there is an off-leash dog park area. Also located within the park are reservable outdoor picnic sites, and picnic shelters for groups, as well as playgrounds and a summer wading pool for children.  The falls freeze in the winter, making the park a popular year-round attraction.<ref name=\"MPRB Minnehaha\">{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/minnehaha_regional_park/ |title=Minnehaha Regional Park |publisher=Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board |accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt one time the park also featured a zoo and pony rides. In 1893 the Park Board gave permission for a [[Shetland pony]] concession and also began to accept gifts of animals for a zoo in the park.  The zoo grew in size, and by 1899 a bear pit and an alligator tank had been added.  Although very popular, when [[Theodore Wirth]] became the new park superintendent in 1906, the zoo was removed at his urging.  The animals were donated to [[Longfellow Gardens]], but a fenced area containing deer and elk remained until 1923. To this day the area is sometimes referred to as \"the deer pen\".\n\nBetween the 1930s and the 1950s there was also an \"Auto Tourist Camp\" where large numbers of tourists tented or stayed in small cabins.  A park historian states that in those years \"the camp was intended to appeal to the many tourists who were traveling the country in their new\nautomobiles\".<ref name=\"MPRB history\" /> At one time there were several [[grist mill]]s located on Minnehaha Creek.  The remains of a stone and earth mill dam, built in the lower glen in 1853 or 1854, is still visible beside the creek.<ref name=\"Grossman\"/>\n\n[[File:SKUNKCABBAGE-MOSS-400X575.jpg|thumb|left|Skunk cabbage]]\n\nGardens in the upper park area include Longfellow Gardens, Minnehaha Falls Pergola Garden, and the Song of Hiawatha Garden.<ref name=\"MPRB Minnehaha\" /> The lower glen area offers examples of a surprisingly large number of trees that are native to Minnesota including basswood, black ash, maples, oaks, willows, and cottonwoods.  Unusual plants include the first spring-blooming plant, [[skunk cabbage]], often blooming so early that temperatures are still freezing and snow may still be on the ground.  As the name implies, they have a disagreeable odor except to the various insects that prefer to feed on rotting flesh or dung. By consuming carbohydrates stored in its fleshy roots, skunk cabbages can maintain a temperature inside the [[spathe]] that is 15\u201335 degrees warmer than the surrounding air temperature. The warmth helps attract cold-blooded, early-emerging pollinating insects during early spring when temperatures are still chilly.  As the spathe dies back the large, showy leaves emerge which die back by mid-August, making the plant difficult to find in late summer.<ref name=\"skunk cabbage\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/miss/learn/nature/skunkcabbage.htm |title=Skunk Cabbage |work=Mississippi National River and Recreation Area |accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Minnesota County Biological Survey\">{{cite web |url=https://www.co.dakota.mn.us/parks/Planning/Greenways/Documents/MinnesotaRiverGreenwayFortSnellingEcologicalStudy.pdf |title=Inventory of Biological Features of Fort Snelling State Park and Inventory of Natural Communities and Rare Plants of Minnehaha Regional Park |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |year=1995 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref> Other wild flowers include [[wild ginger]], [[trout lily|trout lilie]]s, [[anemone]]s, [[marsh marigold]] and various ferns and sedges.

It was originally created in plaster for the Columbian Exposition in 1893, and cast in bronze and erected at the park in 1912. Other statues commemorate several notable figures including [[John H. Stevens]], the first authorized resident on the west bank of the Mississippi River in what would become Minneapolis. He was granted permission to occupy the site, then part of the Fort Snelling military reservation, in exchange for providing ferry service to St. Anthony across the river. A statue of Swedish musician and poet [[Gunnar Wennerberg]] was placed in the park in 1915. A mask of Dakota leader [[Taoyateduta]] (Little Crow) was placed overlooking the falls in 1992.\n\nWhile the name Minnehaha is often translated as \"Laughing Water\", the correct translation is \"curling water\" or \"waterfall\". The name comes from the [[Lakota language|Dakota language]] elements ''mni,'' meaning water, and ''\u021fa\u021fa'', meaning waterfall. Thus the expression \"Minnehaha Falls\" translates as \"Waterfall Falls\". The \"Laughing Water\" translation comes from [[Mary H. Eastman]]'s book ''Dahcotah \u2013 Life and Legends of the Sioux Around Fort Snelling'', published in 1849. The Dakota called Minnehaha Creek \"Wakpa Cistinna\", meaning \"Little River\". According to information provided by the National Park Service, an early missionary who had learned the Dakota language wrote: \"The Indian name, 'Little Waterfall,' is given ... in speaking of the falls now called by white people 'Minnehaha'. The Indians never knew it by the latter name, bestowed upon it by the whites.\" \n<ref name=\"Naming Minnehaha Falls\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minnehahacreek.org/sites/minnehahacreek.org/files/attachments/NamingMinnehahaFalls-KathySwenson_0.pdf |title=Naming Minnehaha Falls |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=29 April 2015 |author=Park Ranger Kathy Swenson, National Park Service, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Humanities Web.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitiesweb.org/spa/lcp/ID/17435/c/261 |title=The Song of Hiawatha Notes |publisher=Humanities Web.org |accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Minnehaha Creek|Minnehaha Falls}} Minnehaha Creek and Falls===\n[[File:Minnehaha Falls nor6a.jpg|thumb|left|Minnehaha Falls, c. 1860]]\n[[File:Minnehaha Falls on June 22, 2013 - Video 1 of 4.webm|thumb|right|Minnehaha Falls video, June 2013]]\n\n[[Minnehaha Creek]] extends from [[Lake Minnetonka]] in the west and flows east for 22 miles (35&nbsp;km) through several suburbs west of Minneapolis, and continuing through south Minneapolis. The [[drainage basin|watershed]] for the [[stream|creek]] covers {{convert|181|sqmi|km2}}.  Along the creek is a 53-foot (16-meter) [[waterfall]], Minnehaha Falls, which is situated 3/4 of a mile from where the stream empties into the Mississippi River.\n\nMinnehaha Falls is geologically linked to [[Saint Anthony Falls]], which is the only waterfall on the [[Mississippi River]].  Roughly 10,000 years ago, St. Anthony Falls several miles downstream on the Mississippi River at the confluence of the [[glacial River Warren]] (at present-day [[Ft. Snelling]]). Geologically, the area has a sandstone layer beneath a layer of limestone.  Over the centuries, water in the river beds broke through the limestone layer, and the churning at the bottom of the falls ate away at the soft underlying sandstone.  Eventually, the hard limestone cap was unsupported and broke off.  Thus St. Anthony Falls receded, moving upstream at a rate of about 4 feet (1.2 m) per year. As St. Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River moved past Minnehaha Creek, a second falls was created, Minnehaha Falls, which also continued to move upstream to its present site in the park.\n\nAn island in the Mississippi River near Minnehaha Creek once existed; the receding St. Anthony Falls divided into two as it passed around the island. The falls in the channel farthest from Minnehaha Creek reached the upstream end of the island first, cutting off water to the west channel and resulting in an \"abandoned waterfall\" at the north end of the channel. The abandoned west channel is now a grassy cul-de-sac known as the \"Deer Pen\". Locating the abandoned waterfall was made difficult in recent years since the Deer Pen was partially filled with tons of fill dirt from nearby construction projects.<ref>{{cite news |author=Steller, Chris |title=Paradise backfilled: Making a mountain out of a river bed at Minnehaha Park |url=http://mplsparkwatch.org/node/821 |publisher=Minnesota Monitor |date=May 9, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821104406/http://mplsparkwatch.org/node/821 |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}</ref> Today, the mouth of Minnehaha Creek where it joins the Mississippi River is the lowest surface point in the city of Minneapolis at 686&nbsp;ft (209 m) above [[sea level]].\n\n[[File:Minnehaha Frozen Falls with Visitors.jpg|thumb|300 px|Walking behind frozen Falls]]\n\nErosion within the last century has resulted in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain.

If there is a rain shortage in the autumn, the falls may virtually dry up. In the summer, especially in the rainy months of June and July, the flow can be surprisingly forceful.\n\nOn June 19, 2014, professional kayaker Hunt Jennings descended the waterfall in a kayak when it was at record height due to several days of heavy rain.  The only injury sustained by Jennings was a small cut above his upper lip.  A spokesperson for the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board commented, \"We are deeply concerned that this act and subsequent publicity will inspire others to attempt the same feat.

The depot handled as many as 39 round trips per day. The interior is complete and well-preserved, containing an iron heating stove, waiting room benches and a ticket window.  In 1964, the title was transferred to the [[Minnesota Historical Society]]. The [[Minnesota Transportation Museum]] assisted in the restoration of the building, and today provides historic interpretation.  The depot is open in the summer on Sundays from 1:30 to 4:30.

Jones, a Minneapolis philanthropist and entrepreneur.  Built in 1907, the house's facade was designed to resemble Longfellow's home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Originally the home was part of Jones' private 4.6-acre botanical garden and zoological park near Minnehaha Falls.  After Jones died, the home fell into disrepair. His will gave the property to the city which used the house as part of the Minneapolis public library from 1936 to 1967. The house was moved in 1994 and renovated. It opened as an information center in 2001.  Today the home serves as the home of a botanical art school and provides offices for the Minneapolis Parks Foundation.  The Longfellow House and John H. Stevens House also co-sponsor 90-minute historic nature walks around the park.<ref name=nps>{{cite web |title=Mississippi National River and Recreation Area \u2013 Longfellow House Hospitality Center (U.S. National Park Service) |url=http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/longhous.htm |publisher=National Park Service |date=2006-07-27 |accessdate=2008-04-17}}</ref>\n\n===John Harrington Stevens House ===\n[[Image:John H. Stevens House.JPG|thumb|John H. Stevens' House]]\nThe [[John Harrington Stevens House]], built in 1849 or 1850 near [[St. Anthony Falls]] (on the site where the Minneapolis Post Office now sits), was moved to Minnehaha Park in 1896.  According to the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, the home has the distinction of being the first [[Light-frame construction|wood-frame]] dwelling built west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].  John H. Stevens was granted permission to build his house on land controlled by Fort Snelling in exchange for providing ferry service across the Mississippi River.  In subsequent years it became a hub of civic and social activity.  Dubbed the \"Birthplace of Minneapolis\", both Hennepin County and Minneapolis were organized in Stevens' home; it was in this home that the name ''Minneapolis'' was suggested.\n\nIn 1896 over 10,000 school children helped pull the house to its present location in Minnehaha Park.  The children were divided into seven relay teams, each consisting of around 1,000 pupils.  As teams finished their designated distance, they dropped the ropes and boarded trolley cars for the park.  All went well until \"the lads from the South Side High School\" refused to give up the ropes to the next relay team.  The ''Minneapolis Tribune'' reported the event:\n\n<blockquote>At this point there was something of unexpected interest. Waving their school flag in triumph from the gable window of the old building the lads from the South Side High School shouted their school yell and BAD DEFIANCE TO ALL COMERS.  At this point the Central High School scholars were billed to relieve the South Siders, and consequently surrounded the building.  The spirit of school rivalry broke out, strong and bitter. The South Siders refused to surrender the fortress and flaunted their banner from the window in spite of all entreaties and orders. Contractor Pratt could not oust them. Supt. Jordan could not oust them, and finally Sergeant Martinson called for a detail of police and made a rush for the house. But the South Side lads were still game, and did not give up until several had been made to feel the force of police authority. Then they made a break. As they dashed from one door the Centrals entered by the other, and their banner was soon flying from the gable amid vociferous cheers. The South Siders were chased up the street by a detachment of Centrals, and for a moment it looked as if the rush would result in some bruised heads. However, good nature was restored and again the house started on its way.<ref name=\"Minneapolis Star Tribune\">{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/blogs/286391561.html |title=May 29, 1896: Schoolchildren move a house |work=Yesterday's News |date=19 December 2014 |accessdate=22 April 2015 |author=Wellter, Ben}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe house arrived in the park at 3&nbsp;pm along with the last relay team of children, having covered a distance of four miles.  In the evening, 1,000 Japanese lanterns were placed about the park and the festivities included fireworks and an illumination of the falls.  The Tribune newspaper reported that some people complained about the children having a day out of school and  \"...the park commissioners and the park policemen objected to the way in which the children took possession of the park and everything in it.

Officially named '''Minnehaha Regional Park''', it is part of the [[Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board]] system and lies within the [[Mississippi National River and Recreation Area]], a unit of the [[National Park Service]].  The park was designed by landscape architect [[Horace W.S. Cleveland]] in 1883 as part of the [[Grand Rounds Scenic Byway]] system, and was part of the popular steamboat [[Upper Mississippi River]] \"Fashionable Tour\" in the 1800s.\n\nThe park preserves historic sites that illustrate transportation, pioneering, and architectural themes. Preserved structures include the Minnehaha Princess Station, a Victorian train depot built in the 1870s; the [[John H. Stevens House]], built in 1849 and moved to the park from its original location in 1896, utilizing horses and 10,000 school children; and the [[Longfellow House]], a house built to resemble the [[Longfellow House\u2013Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site|Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's house]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  The park was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1969 as the '''Minnehaha Historic District'''<ref name=nris/> in recognition of its state-level significance in architecture, commerce, conservation, literature, transportation, and urban planning.<ref name=\"Grossman\">{{cite journal |last=Grossman |first=John |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory \u2013 Nomination Form: Minnehaha Park Historic District |url={{NRHP url|id=69000369}} |publisher=National Park Service |date=1969-10-22 |accessdate=2015-05-05}}</ref>\n\nThe central feature of the park, Minnehaha Falls, was a favorite subject of pioneer photographers, beginning with [[Alexander Hesler]]'s [[daguerreotype]] in 1852. Although he never visited the park, [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] helped to spread the waterfall's fame when he wrote his celebrated poem, ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]''.  The falls are located on Minnehaha Creek near the creek's [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] with the [[Mississippi River]], near [[Fort Snelling]]. The main [[Minnesota Veterans Home]] is located on a bluff where the Mississippi and Minnehaha Creek converge. More than 850,000 people visit Minnehaha Falls each year, and it continues to be the most photographed site in Minnesota.\n\n==History==\n\n[[Image:Casper wild.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Snelling in 1844, by John Caspar Wild]]\n\nSettlement in the area began in 1805 when the US Army bought a nine-square-mile tract of land at the confluence of the Mississippi and [[Minnesota River]] from the native [[Sioux]].  Sited on the bluff overlooking the rivers, [[Fort Snelling]] was built under the command of Colonel [[Josiah Snelling]] between 1820 and 1824. In 1821 Snelling's son, [[William Joseph Snelling]] came to the fort after leaving [[West Point]] and spending a year with friendly [[Sioux]].  According to a Minnesota history account written in 1858, \"The year after he came to the fort young Snelling set out in company with [[Joseph R. Brown]], a frontiersman and local celebrity, to explore the rivulet that supplies the cascade of Minne Ha-Ha, as far as [[Lake Minnetonka|Lake Minne Tonka]].\"  Both \"men\" were 17-year-old boys at the time.<ref name=\"William Joseph Snelling  and the Early Northwest\">{{cite web |url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/10/v10i04p367-385.pdf |title=William Joseph Snelling and the Early Northwest |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |accessdate=29 April 2015 |author=Woodall, Allen E.}}</ref>\n\nSome very early records refer to the falls as \"Brown's Falls\" which lead some historians to assume they were named after prominent pioneer Joseph R. Brown.  Park Ranger Kathy Swenson, writing for the National Park Service in 2009 states: \"The overwhelming evidence points to Brown's Falls (and creek) being named for Jacob Brown, major general and commander in chief of the army from 1814 \u2013 1828 rather than for Joseph R. Brown, teenage musician at Fort Snelling and later army sergeant (1820\u20131828), fur trader, politician, editor, and inventor. However, I have not yet found a document that officially or specifically mentions Jacob Brown as the namesake.\"  Swenson explains \"'Browns Fall/Creek' seems to be most associated with military maps and personnel while\n'Little Falls/Creek' seems to be favored by those without a strong military connection although there are exceptions.\"<ref name=\"Naming Minnehaha Falls\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minnehahacreek.org/sites/minnehahacreek.org/files/attachments/NamingMinnehahaFalls-KathySwenson_0.pdf |title=Naming Minnehaha Falls |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=29 April 2015 |author=Park Ranger Kathy Swenson, National Park Service, 2009}}</ref>  The current name is [[Dakota language|Dakota]] for waterfall (Mn\u00ed\u021fa\u021fa, \"curling water\").<ref>{{cite news |url=https://eminnetonka.com/documents/naturalresourcesdocs/Minnehaha_Design_2011_web.pdf |format=PDF |title=Minnehaha Creek Watershed Map |work=City of Minnetonka |date=2011 |accessdate=2018-12-04 }}</ref>\n\n===''The Song of Hiawatha'' brings fame ===\n\nThe name \"Minnehaha Falls\" was in common use by 1855, when the publication of ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'' by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] brought the falls worldwide fame.  Longfellow's [[epic poem]] features Hiawatha, a Native American hero who falls in love with Minnehaha, a Native American woman who later dies during a severe winter.  Longfellow never visited the falls himself.  He was inspired by the writings of Mary H. Eastman and [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]], and by a daguerreotype created by [[Alexander Hesler]] when he chose the name for Hiawatha's lover.  The image was taken in 1852, according to a letter written by Hesler, as discussed in \"Minnesota History\" magazine.<ref name=\"Minnesota History magazine\">{{cite web |url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/8/v08i03p281-282.pdf |title=Minnesota History Magazine }}</ref>\n\n===The \"Fashionable Tour\"===\n[[File:Minne-ha-ha, by Upton, B.

The steamboat journey began to attract the attention of tourists, and in 1835 well known artist of American Indian life [[George Catlin]] made a trip by steamboat up the Mississippi from St. Louis to the Falls of St. Anthony and Fort Snelling. Impressed with the scenery, Catlin proposed a \"Fashionable Tour\" of the upper Mississippi, saying:\n\n<blockquote>This Tour would comprehend but a small part of the great \"Far West\"; but it will furnish to the traveller a fair sample, and being apart of it which is now made so easily accessible to the world, and the only part of it to which ladies can have access, I would recommend to all who have time and inclination to devote to the enjoyment of so splendid a Tour, to wait not, but make it while the subject is new, and capable of producing the greatest degree of pleasure.<ref name=\"tour\" /></blockquote>\n\nFollowing Catlin's visit, each ensuing year saw an increasing number of sightseerers, artists, and photographers.  Hundreds of [[Stereoscopic View]] cards of the falls exist.  The visitors were mainly men but a few women took the journey, most notably 80-year-old [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton]], the widow of [[Alexander Hamilton]].  The beauty of the area was also spread through [[moving panorama]]s, artistic panoramic creations that were shown much like today's travel documentaries.<ref name=\"The Minnesota Historical Society\">{{cite web |url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/30/v30i01p014-023.pdf |title=Documentary Panorama |publisher=The Minnesota Historical Society |accessdate=1 May 2015 |author=Heilbron, Bertha L.}}</ref> Quoting from a 1939 paper written by the [[Minnesota Historical Society]]:\n\n<blockquote>Crowds of people went to see these travel movies of the 1840's and 1850's and thus toured the great river vicariously.  The throngs that wished to view Banvard's panorama were so great when it was displayed in Boston and New York that railroads ran special excursions to accommodate them. In these two cities alone more than four hundred thousand people saw the exhibition. \"The river comes to me instead of my going to the river,\" wrote Longfellow. [[John Greenleaf Whittier|Whittier]], after seeing a panorama, sang of the \"new Canaan of our Israel,\" and [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], who not only viewed a panorama but also made the tour itself, envisaged a coming heroic age in which simple and obscure men, the real heroes of history, would build the foundations of new castles [i]n the West and throw bridges across a \"Rhine stream of a different kind.\"<ref name=\"tour\" /></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Minnehaha_Falls_from_1878_guide_to_summer_resorts.jpg |thumb|left|upright| Minnehaha Falls ~ from 1878 Minnesota guide to summer resorts]]\n\nAccording to an account written in 1852, passengers disembarked St. Paul and \"[from there traveled by] stagecoach for what was called the 'grand tour.'

The 1878 [[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy]] railway promotional booklet, ''A Guide to the Summer Resorts of Minnesota'', told of the delights and health benefits of travel to Minnesota: \"The scenery is unequaled and the invigorating air is so rich in oxygen and ozone that it is unsurpassed anywhere in the world and is sure to offer to the tourist and the invalid a hearty welcome, confident that the one will surely find rest and enjoyment, and the other that much coveted of earthly blessings \u2014 health.\"  The booklet describes the coach ride from Minneapolis to Minnehaha Falls: \"One of the famous trips that few tourists miss taking is that from Minneapolis to St. Paul by carriage.  Starting from the former place on the west side of the river, a pleasant drive of four miles over a level prairie, brings the traveler to [[The Song of Hiawatha|''Where the Falls of Minnehaha Flash and gleam among the oak trees.

The board began by acquiring park land near today's downtown Minneapolis. Their choice to hire noted landscape architect [[Horace Cleveland]] was fortunate.  Cleveland was hired by the Board to design a system of parks and interconnected parkways to connect and preserve the existing natural landscape.  Cleveland was a preservationist by nature, respecting the natural landscape features and using the existing topography and vegetation to keep his designs as natural as possible.  When the park board considered building a photographic stand in the lower glen near the falls in 1889, he responded saying:\n\n<blockquote>I learn that the park commission are seriously thinking of a building at Minnehaha for the express purpose of taking photographs\u2014on the site heretofore profaned by a shanty for that purpose. I cannot remain silent in view of this proposed vandalism which I am sure you cannot sanction\u2014and which I am equally sure will forever be a stigma upon Minneapolis and elicit the anathema of every man of sense and taste who visits the place. If erected it will simply be pandering to the tastes of the army of boobies who think to boost themselves into notoriety by connecting their own stupid features with the representation of one of the most beautiful of God's works.<ref name=\"MPRB history\" /></blockquote>\n\nThe result of Cleveland's vision is the famous \"Grand Rounds\", an interconnected series of parkways and parks centered on the Mississippi River. This vision was expanded by subsequent park commissioners and superintendents to encircle a series of lakes, now known as the \"Chain of Lakes\", and to follow Minnehaha Creek to Minnehaha Falls. The area was designated as a [[National Scenic Byway]] in 1998, and the [[Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway|Minneapolis Grand Rounds]] is known today as one of the best urban park systems in the world.\n\n===Acquisition and development===\n\n[[File:Minnehaha Falls, Minnesota c1908.jpg|thumb|Minnehaha falls with rustic bridge ~ circa 1895]]\n[[File:Minnehaha Falls on June 22, 2013 - Picture 2 of 6.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque with photograph of President Lyndon B.

Humphrey, and Governor Karl Rolvaag visiting the Falls in 1964]]\nWhen Minneapolis' Park Board purchased Minnehaha Falls and surrounding land in 1889, it became one of the first state parks in the United States; only New York had created a state park by that time. The next summer the Park Board began to furnish the park with tables, seating, and lavatories.  By 1893 a pavilion had been built and the park approved funding for two bridges \"of a rustic nature\", one above the falls and the other below.  A refectory was built in 1905 to serve \"refreshments of a clean and wholesome nature at a reasonable cost.\"  In 1926 the park board designated the park to be a center for winter sports activities; plans were made to build a ski jump and the board purchased toboggans for rental.  Major improvements including retaining walls, bridges, and stairs were made by federal [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) crews from 1936 to 1942.<ref name=\"MPRB history\">{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/minnehaha_regional_park/#group_3_16969 |title=Minnehaha Regional Park - History |publisher=Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board |accessdate=December 27, 2017 |first=David C. |last=Smith}}</ref>\n\nWhile on the campaign trail in 1964, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and Minnesota Senator [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] visited the park.  Johnson would go on to win the presidential election that year with Humphrey as his running mate.  Their visit is commemorated with a plaque which reads:\n\n<blockquote>President Lyndon B. Johnson, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey and Governor Karl Rolvaag enjoy the spray from Minnehaha Falls.  On that day, however, Minneapolis was experiencing a drought.  In order to create the beautiful spray of the falls pictured here the city had to open many fire hydrants upstream and out of sight, to feed water to the creek.</blockquote>\n\nThe park saw conflict in the 1960s when the highway department planned an elevated freeway between Minnehaha Park and Longfellow Gardens over Minnehaha Creek. The park board challenged the plan and brought the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Fortunately for the park a similar case was decided in favor of the preservation of park land, thus setting a precedent, and the elevated freeway was never built.  Eventually a highway was built in the late 1990s that routed the road through a tunnel over the creek and covered by a \"land bridge\". A new garden, the Longfellow Garden, was established on top of the land bridge.<ref name=\"MPRB history\" />\n\nMajor improvements were also made in the 1990s.  The Pergola Garden was created to feature native wildflowers and grasses.  The parking lot that once overlooked the falls was removed, replaced by a garden and a low circular wall inscribed with Longfellow's words. The old refectory was given a veranda and a bandshell was added.  In 2007 a new river overlook was built in the Wabun picnic area and included a children's playground.<ref name=\"MPRB history\" />\n\nIn 2011 major restoration work on the park was completed.  The crumbling historic retaining walls built by the WPA in the 1930s were reinforced, eroded stream banks were restored, natural seating areas made of limestone were added, and trails and paths were improved. Landscape improvements were also done: invasive plants were removed and replaced with native plantings with deeper roots to stabilize the stream banks and prevent erosion.<ref name=\"Minnehaha Creek Watershed District\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minnehahacreek.org/project/minnehaha-falls-and-glen-restoration |title=Restoring a Historic Landmark |publisher=Minnehaha Falls and Glen Restoration |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nMore than 850,000 people visit Minnehaha Falls each year, and it continues to be the most photographed site in Minnesota.<ref name=\"Minnehaha Creek Watershed District\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minnehahacreek.org/project/minnehaha-falls-and-glen-restoration |title=Restoring a Historic Landmark |publisher=Minnehaha Falls and Glen Restoration |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:minnehahamap.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the north end of the park]]\n[[File:FrozenMinnehaha.jpg|thumb|right|Frozen Minnehaha Falls]]\n\nMinnehaha Park is situated on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]] within the [[Minnehaha Historic District]].  Located between Hiawatha Avenue and the Minnehaha Parkway, the park includes [[Minnehaha Creek]] with its falls and glen.  The 167-acre park is divided into two main portions: an upper section above the falls, with grassy open areas like many other city parks, and the lower 54-acre section which is for the most part allowed to maintain its natural state. The creek runs through the upper section and after it drops at the falls, it flows through the lower glen for another three-fourths of a mile.\n\nMinnehaha Park is a popular site for weddings and cultural festivities. Minnesota is well known for its large population of Swedish immigrants. Since 1934 Swedes have celebrated ''Svenskarnas Dag'' (Swedish Heritage Day) at the park in June of each year. The park has a bandstand with free music concerts in the summer.  Bicyclists use miles of off-street trails, including the former Milwaukee Road right-of-way, which  leads to [[Fort Snelling State Park]].  Bikes are available for rent, and there is an off-leash dog park area. Also located within the park are reservable outdoor picnic sites, and picnic shelters for groups, as well as playgrounds and a summer wading pool for children.  The falls freeze in the winter, making the park a popular year-round attraction.<ref name=\"MPRB Minnehaha\">{{cite web |url=https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/parks__lakes/minnehaha_regional_park/ |title=Minnehaha Regional Park |publisher=Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board |accessdate=December 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt one time the park also featured a zoo and pony rides. In 1893 the Park Board gave permission for a [[Shetland pony]] concession and also began to accept gifts of animals for a zoo in the park.  The zoo grew in size, and by 1899 a bear pit and an alligator tank had been added.  Although very popular, when [[Theodore Wirth]] became the new park superintendent in 1906, the zoo was removed at his urging.  The animals were donated to [[Longfellow Gardens]], but a fenced area containing deer and elk remained until 1923. To this day the area is sometimes referred to as \"the deer pen\".\n\nBetween the 1930s and the 1950s there was also an \"Auto Tourist Camp\" where large numbers of tourists tented or stayed in small cabins.  A park historian states that in those years \"the camp was intended to appeal to the many tourists who were traveling the country in their new\nautomobiles\".<ref name=\"MPRB history\" /> At one time there were several [[grist mill]]s located on Minnehaha Creek.  The remains of a stone and earth mill dam, built in the lower glen in 1853 or 1854, is still visible beside the creek.<ref name=\"Grossman\"/>\n\n[[File:SKUNKCABBAGE-MOSS-400X575.jpg|thumb|left|Skunk cabbage]]\n\nGardens in the upper park area include Longfellow Gardens, Minnehaha Falls Pergola Garden, and the Song of Hiawatha Garden.<ref name=\"MPRB Minnehaha\" /> The lower glen area offers examples of a surprisingly large number of trees that are native to Minnesota including basswood, black ash, maples, oaks, willows, and cottonwoods.  Unusual plants include the first spring-blooming plant, [[skunk cabbage]], often blooming so early that temperatures are still freezing and snow may still be on the ground.  As the name implies, they have a disagreeable odor except to the various insects that prefer to feed on rotting flesh or dung. By consuming carbohydrates stored in its fleshy roots, skunk cabbages can maintain a temperature inside the [[spathe]] that is 15\u201335 degrees warmer than the surrounding air temperature. The warmth helps attract cold-blooded, early-emerging pollinating insects during early spring when temperatures are still chilly.  As the spathe dies back the large, showy leaves emerge which die back by mid-August, making the plant difficult to find in late summer.<ref name=\"skunk cabbage\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/miss/learn/nature/skunkcabbage.htm |title=Skunk Cabbage |work=Mississippi National River and Recreation Area |accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Minnesota County Biological Survey\">{{cite web |url=https://www.co.dakota.mn.us/parks/Planning/Greenways/Documents/MinnesotaRiverGreenwayFortSnellingEcologicalStudy.pdf |title=Inventory of Biological Features of Fort Snelling State Park and Inventory of Natural Communities and Rare Plants of Minnehaha Regional Park |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |year=1995 |accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref> Other wild flowers include [[wild ginger]], [[trout lily|trout lilie]]s, [[anemone]]s, [[marsh marigold]] and various ferns and sedges.

Erosion below the falls has exposed Minnesota's geologic past from the present day back to over 450 million years ago, when Minnesota was covered with shallow seas.\n\n[[File:Hiawatha and Minnehaha sculpture2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Hiawatha and Minnehaha]]'', 1912 bronze sculpture by [[Jacob Fjelde]]]]\n\nStatues in the park include a bronze sculpture of ''[[Hiawatha and Minnehaha]]'', by [[Jacob Fjelde]] depicting [[Hiawatha]] carrying Minnehaha.  It was originally created in plaster for the Columbian Exposition in 1893, and cast in bronze and erected at the park in 1912. Other statues commemorate several notable figures including [[John H. Stevens]], the first authorized resident on the west bank of the Mississippi River in what would become Minneapolis. He was granted permission to occupy the site, then part of the Fort Snelling military reservation, in exchange for providing ferry service to St. Anthony across the river. A statue of Swedish musician and poet [[Gunnar Wennerberg]] was placed in the park in 1915. A mask of Dakota leader [[Taoyateduta]] (Little Crow) was placed overlooking the falls in 1992.\n\nWhile the name Minnehaha is often translated as \"Laughing Water\", the correct translation is \"curling water\" or \"waterfall\". The name comes from the [[Lakota language|Dakota language]] elements ''mni,'' meaning water, and ''\u021fa\u021fa'', meaning waterfall. Thus the expression \"Minnehaha Falls\" translates as \"Waterfall Falls\". The \"Laughing Water\" translation comes from [[Mary H. Eastman]]'s book ''Dahcotah \u2013 Life and Legends of the Sioux Around Fort Snelling'', published in 1849. The Dakota called Minnehaha Creek \"Wakpa Cistinna\", meaning \"Little River\". According to information provided by the National Park Service, an early missionary who had learned the Dakota language wrote: \"The Indian name, 'Little Waterfall,' is given ... in speaking of the falls now called by white people 'Minnehaha'. The Indians never knew it by the latter name, bestowed upon it by the whites.\" \n<ref name=\"Naming Minnehaha Falls\">{{cite web |url=http://www.minnehahacreek.org/sites/minnehahacreek.org/files/attachments/NamingMinnehahaFalls-KathySwenson_0.pdf |title=Naming Minnehaha Falls |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=29 April 2015 |author=Park Ranger Kathy Swenson, National Park Service, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Humanities Web.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.humanitiesweb.org/spa/lcp/ID/17435/c/261 |title=The Song of Hiawatha Notes |publisher=Humanities Web.org |accessdate=3 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|Minnehaha Creek|Minnehaha Falls}} Minnehaha Creek and Falls===\n[[File:Minnehaha Falls nor6a.jpg|thumb|left|Minnehaha Falls, c. 1860]]\n[[File:Minnehaha Falls on June 22, 2013 - Video 1 of 4.webm|thumb|right|Minnehaha Falls video, June 2013]]\n\n[[Minnehaha Creek]] extends from [[Lake Minnetonka]] in the west and flows east for 22 miles (35&nbsp;km) through several suburbs west of Minneapolis, and continuing through south Minneapolis. The [[drainage basin|watershed]] for the [[stream|creek]] covers {{convert|181|sqmi|km2}}.  Along the creek is a 53-foot (16-meter) [[waterfall]], Minnehaha Falls, which is situated 3/4 of a mile from where the stream empties into the Mississippi River.\n\nMinnehaha Falls is geologically linked to [[Saint Anthony Falls]], which is the only waterfall on the [[Mississippi River]].  Roughly 10,000 years ago, St. Anthony Falls several miles downstream on the Mississippi River at the confluence of the [[glacial River Warren]] (at present-day [[Ft. Snelling]]). Geologically, the area has a sandstone layer beneath a layer of limestone.  Over the centuries, water in the river beds broke through the limestone layer, and the churning at the bottom of the falls ate away at the soft underlying sandstone.  Eventually, the hard limestone cap was unsupported and broke off.  Thus St. Anthony Falls receded, moving upstream at a rate of about 4 feet (1.2 m) per year. As St. Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River moved past Minnehaha Creek, a second falls was created, Minnehaha Falls, which also continued to move upstream to its present site in the park.\n\nAn island in the Mississippi River near Minnehaha Creek once existed; the receding St. Anthony Falls divided into two as it passed around the island. The falls in the channel farthest from Minnehaha Creek reached the upstream end of the island first, cutting off water to the west channel and resulting in an \"abandoned waterfall\" at the north end of the channel. The abandoned west channel is now a grassy cul-de-sac known as the \"Deer Pen\". Locating the abandoned waterfall was made difficult in recent years since the Deer Pen was partially filled with tons of fill dirt from nearby construction projects.<ref>{{cite news |author=Steller, Chris |title=Paradise backfilled: Making a mountain out of a river bed at Minnehaha Park |url=http://mplsparkwatch.org/node/821 |publisher=Minnesota Monitor |date=May 9, 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821104406/http://mplsparkwatch.org/node/821 |archivedate=August 21, 2008 }}</ref> Today, the mouth of Minnehaha Creek where it joins the Mississippi River is the lowest surface point in the city of Minneapolis at 686&nbsp;ft (209 m) above [[sea level]].\n\n[[File:Minnehaha Frozen Falls with Visitors.jpg|thumb|300 px|Walking behind frozen Falls]]\n\nErosion within the last century has resulted in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some remedial work could theoretically restore the 19th-century appearance of the falls.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minnpost.com/ronway/2008/06/02/2066/corps_doesnt_actually_know_whether_falls_walls_are_historic |title=Corps doesn't actually know whether falls' walls are historic |work=MinnPost |accessdate=22 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nDue to extremely cold winter temperatures, the falls freeze, creating a dramatic cascade of ice that can last well into the spring. If there is a rain shortage in the autumn, the falls may virtually dry up. In the summer, especially in the rainy months of June and July, the flow can be surprisingly forceful.\n\nOn June 19, 2014, professional kayaker Hunt Jennings descended the waterfall in a kayak when it was at record height due to several days of heavy rain.  The only injury sustained by Jennings was a small cut above his upper lip.  A spokesperson for the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board commented, \"We are deeply concerned that this act and subsequent publicity will inspire others to attempt the same feat.  The impact of the drop, the large boulders at the base of the Falls, the deep water and fast current could easily injure or kill a kayaker.\"<ref name=\"Star Tribune\">{{cite news | url=http://www.startribune.com/officials-warn-plunging-over-minnehaha-falls-can-be-fatal-activity/263911581/ | title=Officials warn plunging over Minnehaha Falls can be fatal activity | newspaper=Star Tribune | date=11 July 2014 | accessdate=11 June 2015 | author=Wheeler, Jeff}}</ref>\n\n== Park geology==\n[[File:Limestone-sandstone.jpg|thumb|upright|The Platteville Limestone Formation along the banks of Minnehaha Creek.

The uppermost layer of soils and gravels of Minnesota were deposited by the most recent [[Ice Age]], about 10,000 years ago.   Four great ice ages have swept away all traces of the more recent [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] eras in the Twin Cities area, however standing at the upper falls, one is standing directly on the [[Platteville Limestone]] Formation laid down during the [[Ordovician Period]] of the [[Paleozoic Era]].

The depot handled as many as 39 round trips per day. The interior is complete and well-preserved, containing an iron heating stove, waiting room benches and a ticket window.  In 1964, the title was transferred to the [[Minnesota Historical Society]]. The [[Minnesota Transportation Museum]] assisted in the restoration of the building, and today provides historic interpretation.  The depot is open in the summer on Sundays from 1:30 to 4:30.

Originally the home was part of Jones' private 4.6-acre botanical garden and zoological park near Minnehaha Falls.  After Jones died, the home fell into disrepair. His will gave the property to the city which used the house as part of the Minneapolis public library from 1936 to 1967. The house was moved in 1994 and renovated. It opened as an information center in 2001.  Today the home serves as the home of a botanical art school and provides offices for the Minneapolis Parks Foundation.  The Longfellow House and John H.

Stevens House.JPG|thumb|John H. Stevens' House]]\nThe [[John Harrington Stevens House]], built in 1849 or 1850 near [[St. Anthony Falls]] (on the site where the Minneapolis Post Office now sits), was moved to Minnehaha Park in 1896.  According to the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, the home has the distinction of being the first [[Light-frame construction|wood-frame]] dwelling built west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].  John H. Stevens was granted permission to build his house on land controlled by Fort Snelling in exchange for providing ferry service across the Mississippi River.  In subsequent years it became a hub of civic and social activity.  Dubbed the \"Birthplace of Minneapolis\", both Hennepin County and Minneapolis were organized in Stevens' home; it was in this home that the name ''Minneapolis'' was suggested.\n\nIn 1896 over 10,000 school children helped pull the house to its present location in Minnehaha Park.  The children were divided into seven relay teams, each consisting of around 1,000 pupils.  As teams finished their designated distance, they dropped the ropes and boarded trolley cars for the park.  All went well until \"the lads from the South Side High School\" refused to give up the ropes to the next relay team.  The ''Minneapolis Tribune'' reported the event:\n\n<blockquote>At this point there was something of unexpected interest. Waving their school flag in triumph from the gable window of the old building the lads from the South Side High School shouted their school yell and BAD DEFIANCE TO ALL COMERS.  At this point the Central High School scholars were billed to relieve the South Siders, and consequently surrounded the building.  The spirit of school rivalry broke out, strong and bitter. The South Siders refused to surrender the fortress and flaunted their banner from the window in spite of all entreaties and orders. Contractor Pratt could not oust them. Supt. Jordan could not oust them, and finally Sergeant Martinson called for a detail of police and made a rush for the house. But the South Side lads were still game, and did not give up until several had been made to feel the force of police authority. Then they made a break. As they dashed from one door the Centrals entered by the other, and their banner was soon flying from the gable amid vociferous cheers. The South Siders were chased up the street by a detachment of Centrals, and for a moment it looked as if the rush would result in some bruised heads. However, good nature was restored and again the house started on its way.<ref name=\"Minneapolis Star Tribune\">{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/blogs/286391561.html |title=May 29, 1896: Schoolchildren move a house |work=Yesterday's News |date=19 December 2014 |accessdate=22 April 2015 |author=Wellter, Ben}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe house arrived in the park at 3&nbsp;pm along with the last relay team of children, having covered a distance of four miles.
