The story of a young boy Ruslaan Bhat is divided into three parts. The first one brings into focus the human rights violation in the valley. The second part points out that the difficulties are not restricted to the place within the mountains only but the discrimination follows outside as well. The third part is Ruslaan's fight against the odds and he proves that Kashmir is not the place that produces terrorism rather a place where best minds are sheltered who are waiting for the dark clouds to move away.

It is not about a particular community but all those who have been disowned or alienated on the basis of race, caste or skin colour. This is the story of Ruslaan, a boy who dwells in one of the most disturbed areas of world, Kashmir. It doesn't have a rigid plot, it brings into focus the atrocious life of a middle class Kashmiri family and the discrimination they are subject to when they step out of the valley. Ruslaan belongs to a lower-middle-class family living in Srinagar. His dad owns a watch repairing shop at Lal chowk and due to financial crisis elder brother Ghulam Nabi drops out from school to be a local news reporter and support the family. The story is an amalgamation of militancy period and Army occupation period. The loss of his best friend Reyaz, and violence around coerces Ruslaan to hate his own land. His eyes goaded with big dreams do not allow him to sacrifice his life for freedom. To prove this world actual worth of Kashmir he decides to study further and become an astronaut. He faces resistance from his father who is a separatists and hates India. Ruslaan rejects the idea of War and strives to lead a successful life. He believes his pen can change the way world views his land.\n\nRuslaan escapes from his house to pursue higher degree and be an astronaut but when he steps beyond the mountains surrounding the valley he realizes that at every step he was singled out. When during his first night in Delhi, he is termed as a terrorist because of being a Kashmiri and is stranded on the lonely road with night at its peak, he begins to justify his father's hatred towards India and Indians. With the advancing time he realizes that Kashmirs are not much admired in the rest of the country, some called them terrorists, some called them selfish. After the initial days of torment and struggle between the country and his identity he at last gets admission in IIT and begins to live his dream. Mohammad Aamir, a boy from Lucknow becomes his biggest support and offers him to share his apartment because no one was willing to rent a flat to a Kashmiri. Everyday Ruslaan faces a new sort of discrimination, first because of his Muslim name and second because of his Kashmiri upbringing. Amidst all the hatred love blossoms in Ruslaan's heart. He falls in love with Aamir's younger sister Haya. Love affair with Haya and friendship with Yasar Lone (another Kashmiri boy studying architecture) makes his life pleasant and relieves him of the pain.\n\nHis stay in United States brings forth another trauma, India rejected him because he was a Kashmiri and America rejected him because he was a Muslim.\nFighting all the odds Ruslaan succeeds in achieving his goals and fulfills his dreams when entire nation chants his name and everyone addresses him as a Kashmiri boy.\nNo Exit is a struggle between the world and an individuals identity.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]]. The species is closely related to the [[North Island robin]] (formerly ''P. australis longipes'', now considered a distinct species),<ref name=Miller>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Hilary C.|last2=Lambert|first2=David M.|year=2006|title=A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand's Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=40|issue=3|pages=844\u2013855|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.04.012|pmid=16750641}}</ref> and also to the extremely rare [[black robin]] (''P. traversi'') of the [[Chatham Islands]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe South Island robin is a small passerine, 10\u201318&nbsp;cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch.<ref name=PowleslandA>{{cite book|last=Powlesland|first=R. G.|year=1997|title=Protocols for monitoring New Zealand robins: Petroica australis|series=Department of Conservation Technical Series|volume=13|publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation}}</ref> However, male North Island robins are almost black with a white spot just above the beak, as well as the greyish-white lower breast. Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=Miller/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref name=Gill>Gill, F. and D.

Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

The birds are sparsely distributed through the [[South Island, New Zealand|South Island]] and [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]], although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (''P. australis rakiura'') are the two [[subspecies]].

North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three.

Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).<ref name=IUCN/>\n\nNew Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:New Zealand Robin.jpg|thumb|left|South Island robin]]\nThe South Island robin has two subspecies: ''P. australis australis'', the nominate form, and ''P. australis rakiura'', the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The [[North Island robin]] (''P. longipes''), the [[tomtit]] (''Petroica macrocephala''), and the [[black robin]] (''Petroica traversi'') in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. ''P. traversi'' seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of ''P. australis'', although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined.<ref name=Miller/> The family [[Petroicidae]] of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, [[New Zealand]], and [[New Guinea]].<ref name=Gill>Gill, F. and D.

Doi 10.14344/IOC.ML.10.1.  http://www.worldbirdnames.org/</ref>.\n\n==Fossil record==\nThere is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' can be traced to the first and ''P. macrocephala'' to the second wave. The evidence suggests that ''P. longipes'' and ''P. australis'' began to diverge prior to the [[Pleistocene]] era, and that the two South Island subspecies of ''P. australis'' began to diverge after the [[Pleistocene]] era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter.

A side effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male's ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.<ref name=Barnett>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Craig A.|last2=Briskie|first2=James V.|year=2011|title=Strategic Regulation of Body Mass and Singing Behavior in New Zealand Robins|journal=Ethology|volume=117|issue=1|pages=28\u201336|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.2010.01844.x}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nThe South Island robin is listed as being of [[least concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].<ref name=IUCN/> However, the Stewart Island robin (''Petroica australis rakiura'') has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats.<ref name=Hale></ref> Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see [[South Island robin#Distribution|above]]. However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed.<ref name=Hale/> Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences therefore remain a concern with this subspecies.\n\nIn contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations,<ref name=TaylorJamiesonWallis></ref> although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.\n\n==South Island robins and 1080 poison==\n\nA number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental [[sodium fluoroacetate|1080]] poisoning following pest control operations.<ref name=Spurr>{{cite book|last=Spurr|first=E.|year=2000|chapter=Impacts of possum control on non-target species|editor=T.L.

It controlled the [[Mongolian Plateau]] from 647 to 682.\n\nIt was first established as [[Khangai Mountains|Yanran]] at [[Shanyu Tai]], southwest of present-day [[Urad Middle Banner|Urat Middle Banner]], the northern slope of [[Lang Shan]]. This was later shifted to Hanhai and controlled by Uighurs instead of Han Chinese, around the banks of the [[Orkhon River]], and named from its namesakes for a short period before it was changed to Anbei. The seat of governance remained there until the year 687.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 646 the Tang dynasty conquered the Xuyantuo and on 9 January 647, thirteen Tiele and Uyghur tribes surrendered to the Tang. Tang Taizong organized them into six commanderies and seven tributary prefectures under the [[Jimi system]]. The six commanderies were Hanhai (\u7ff0\u6d77\u5e9c), Jinwei (\u91d1\u5fae\u5e9c), Yanran (\u71d5\u7136\u5e9c), Youling (\u5e7d\u9675\u5e9c), Guilin (\u9f9c\u6797\u5e9c), and Lushan (\u76e7\u5c71\u5e9c). The seven prefectures were Gaolan (\u7690\u862d\u5dde), Gaoque (\u9ad8\u95d5\u5dde), Jilu (\u96de\u9e7f\u5dde), Jitian (\u96de\u7530\u5dde), Yuxi (\u6986\u6eaa\u5dde), Dailin (\u8e5b\u6797\u5dde), and Douyan (\u7ac7\u984f\u5dde). Collectively these were known as the \"Cantian Khan Circuit.\" On 10 April the Yanran Protectorate was created at the foothills of the Shanyu Plateau, southwest of present-day [[Urad Middle Banner]], and governorship of the 13 tribes was handed over to the protector general, Li Suli (\u674e\u7d20\u7acb), who served from 647\u2013649.\n\nOn 5 February 663 the Yanran Protectorate was renamed Hanhai Protectorate.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=203}}\n\nIn August 669 the Hanhai Protectorate was renamed the Protectorate General to Pacify the North, otherwise known as the Anbei Duhufu.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} Its seat was relocated to the city of Datong in present-day [[Ejin Banner]].\n\nIn 687 the seat of Anbei was moved to the city of [[Xi'an]] near modern [[Minle County]] due to incursions by the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 698 the seat was moved to Yunzhong near modern [[Horinger]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 708 the seat of Anbei was moved to the western Shouxiang city near modern [[Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} \n\nIn 714 the Anbei and Chanyu protectorates were separated. Chanyu was re-located to Yunzhong while Anbei was re-located to the middle [[Shouxian|Shouxiang]] city, near modern [[Baotou]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} \n\nIn 749 the seat was moved to the military settlement of [[Hengshi, Hunan|Hengsai]], near modern-day Urad Middle Banner.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nDue to unfavorable farming conditions near the Hengsai settlement, [[Guo Ziyi]] resettled the army near modern [[Urad Front Banner]] in 755.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nFollowing the [[An Lushan Rebellion]], the Chanyu and Anbei protectorates lost any real authority and survived in name only. Due to the [[taboo]] of An Lushan's name, the Anbei Protectorate was renamed the [[Zhenbei Protectorate]] in 757, which has the meaning of \"Protectorate General to Suppress the North.\"{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 758 the Hengsai Army changed its name to [[Tiande Army]] and came under control of the [[Zhenwu Jiedushi]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=679}} \n\nIn 840 a group of [[Uyghurs]] attacked the Tiande Army.{{sfn|Drompp|2005|p=39}}\n\nIn 843 the Chanyu Protectorate was renamed back to Anbei Protectorate{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=82}}\n[[File:Tang Protectorates.png|thumb|260px|Map of the six major protectorates during Tang dynasty.

It controlled the [[Mongolian Plateau]] from 647 to 682.\n\nIt was first established as [[Khangai Mountains|Yanran]] at [[Shanyu Tai]], southwest of present-day [[Urad Middle Banner|Urat Middle Banner]], the northern slope of [[Lang Shan]]. This was later shifted to Hanhai and controlled by Uighurs instead of Han Chinese, around the banks of the [[Orkhon River]], and named from its namesakes for a short period before it was changed to Anbei. The seat of governance remained there until the year 687.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 646 the Tang dynasty conquered the Xuyantuo and on 9 January 647, thirteen Tiele and Uyghur tribes surrendered to the Tang. Tang Taizong organized them into six commanderies and seven tributary prefectures under the [[Jimi system]]. The six commanderies were Hanhai (\u7ff0\u6d77\u5e9c), Jinwei (\u91d1\u5fae\u5e9c), Yanran (\u71d5\u7136\u5e9c), Youling (\u5e7d\u9675\u5e9c), Guilin (\u9f9c\u6797\u5e9c), and Lushan (\u76e7\u5c71\u5e9c). The seven prefectures were Gaolan (\u7690\u862d\u5dde), Gaoque (\u9ad8\u95d5\u5dde), Jilu (\u96de\u9e7f\u5dde), Jitian (\u96de\u7530\u5dde), Yuxi (\u6986\u6eaa\u5dde), Dailin (\u8e5b\u6797\u5dde), and Douyan (\u7ac7\u984f\u5dde). Collectively these were known as the \"Cantian Khan Circuit.\" On 10 April the Yanran Protectorate was created at the foothills of the Shanyu Plateau, southwest of present-day [[Urad Middle Banner]], and governorship of the 13 tribes was handed over to the protector general, Li Suli (\u674e\u7d20\u7acb), who served from 647\u2013649.\n\nOn 5 February 663 the Yanran Protectorate was renamed Hanhai Protectorate.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=203}}\n\nIn August 669 the Hanhai Protectorate was renamed the Protectorate General to Pacify the North, otherwise known as the Anbei Duhufu.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} Its seat was relocated to the city of Datong in present-day [[Ejin Banner]].\n\nIn 687 the seat of Anbei was moved to the city of [[Xi'an]] near modern [[Minle County]] due to incursions by the [[Second Turkic Khaganate]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 698 the seat was moved to Yunzhong near modern [[Horinger]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 708 the seat of Anbei was moved to the western Shouxiang city near modern [[Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} \n\nIn 714 the Anbei and Chanyu protectorates were separated. Chanyu was re-located to Yunzhong while Anbei was re-located to the middle [[Shouxian|Shouxiang]] city, near modern [[Baotou]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}} \n\nIn 749 the seat was moved to the military settlement of [[Hengshi, Hunan|Hengsai]], near modern-day Urad Middle Banner.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nDue to unfavorable farming conditions near the Hengsai settlement, [[Guo Ziyi]] resettled the army near modern [[Urad Front Banner]] in 755.{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nFollowing the [[An Lushan Rebellion]], the Chanyu and Anbei protectorates lost any real authority and survived in name only. Due to the [[taboo]] of An Lushan's name, the Anbei Protectorate was renamed the [[Zhenbei Protectorate]] in 757, which has the meaning of \"Protectorate General to Suppress the North.\"{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}\n\nIn 758 the Hengsai Army changed its name to [[Tiande Army]] and came under control of the [[Zhenwu Jiedushi]].{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=41}}{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=679}} \n\nIn 840 a group of [[Uyghurs]] attacked the Tiande Army.{{sfn|Drompp|2005|p=39}}\n\nIn 843 the Chanyu Protectorate was renamed back to Anbei Protectorate{{sfn|Xiong|2008|p=82}}\n[[File:Tang Protectorates.png|thumb|260px|Map of the six major protectorates during Tang dynasty.

This can include purchasing items on-line with a computer or using a smartphone to purchase something at a store. Money can be deposited in the digital wallet prior to any transactions or, in other cases, an individual's bank account can be linked to the digital wallet. Users might also have their [[driver's license]], [[Health Care Card|health card]], loyalty card(s) and other ID documents stored within the wallet. The credentials can be passed to a merchant's terminal wirelessly via [[near field communication]] (NFC). Increasingly, digital wallets are being made not just for basic financial transactions but to also authenticate the holder's credentials. For example, a digital wallet could verify the age of the buyer to the store while purchasing alcohol.

Once the software is installed, the user begins by entering all the pertinent information. The digital wallet is now set up. At the purchase or check-out page of an e-commerce site, the digital wallet software has the ability to automatically enter the user information in the online form. By default, most digital wallets prompt when the software recognizes a form in which it can fill out; if one chooses to fill out the form automatically, the user will be prompted for a [[password]]. This keeps unauthorized users away from viewing personal information stored on a particular computer.\n\n===ECML===\nDigital wallets are designed to be accurate when transferring data to retail checkout forms; however, if a particular e-commerce site has a peculiar checkout system, the digital wallet may fail to properly recognize the form's fields. This problem has been eliminated by sites and wallet software that use [[Electronic Commerce Modeling Language]] (ECML) technology. Electronic Commerce Modeling Language is a protocol that dictates how online retailers structure and set up their checkout forms.\n\n==Security==\n\nConsumers are not required to fill out order forms on each site when they purchase an item because the information has already been stored and is automatically updated and entered into the order fields across merchant sites when using a digital wallet. Consumers also benefit when using digital wallets because their information is encrypted or protected by a private software code; merchants benefit by receiving protection against fraud .\n\nDigital wallets are available to consumers free of charge, and they're fairly easy to obtain. For example, when a consumer makes a purchase at a merchant site that's set up to handle server-side digital wallets, they type their name, payment and shipping information into the merchant's own form. At the end of the purchase, the consumer is asked to sign up for a wallet of their choice by entering a user name and password for future purchases. Users can also acquire wallets at a wallet vendor's site.\n\nAlthough a wallet is free for consumers, vendors charge merchants for wallets. Some wallet vendors make arrangements for merchants to pay them a percentage of every successful purchase directed through their wallets. In other cases, digital wallet vendors process the transactions between cardholders and participating merchants and charge merchants a flat fee.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Advantages for e-commerce sites==\nUpwards of 25% of online shoppers abandon their order due to frustration in filling in forms.<ref>Graphic Arts Monthly, 1999{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}</ref> The digital wallet combats this problem by giving users the option to transfer their information securely and accurately. This simplified approach to completing transactions results in better usability and ultimately more utility for the customer.\n\nDigital Wallets can also increase the security of the transaction since the wallet typically does not pass payment card details to the website (a unique transaction identifier or token is shared instead).
