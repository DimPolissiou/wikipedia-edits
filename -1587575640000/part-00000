The rest of the McQueens are sceptical, which proves correct when she does not arrive. Several days later, Kathleen arrives in Hollyoaks in Alec's sports car, claiming the pair have split up. She asks Myra for money, which Theresa's father left for her. Myra refuses and tells her to leave before Theresa finds her. Later, Theresa meets Kathleen just as she is leaving the village. Kathleen, not wanting to disappoint her daughter, claims she has come to stay. Kathleen begins to buy Theresa expensive gifts. Theresa is desperate to believe her mother has changed. However, Kathleen encourages Theresa to shoplift, which causes more tension between Kathleen and the rest of the McQueens. Kathleen tells Theresa they should run away together to London, to which Theresa agrees. Myra and [[Jacqui McQueen]] ([[Claire Cooper]]) confront Kathleen before she leaves and reveal that she has been stealing money from deceased [[Tina Reilly]]'s ([[Leah Hackett]]) bank account. Theresa refuses to believe Myra or Jacqui and prepares to leave. After a fight breaks out, Theresa is forced to choose to go with her mother to London or stay in the village. Theresa decides to stay in Hollyoaks as Kathleen leaves.\n\nKathleen returns in December 2010 after being caught using fake money. Kathleen is taken to the McQueens by police detective constable [[Ethan Scott]] ([[Craig Vye]]). Theresa refuses to have anything to do with her mother. Later, Kathleen discovers that Theresa had a daughter, and her cousin [[Carmel Valentine]] ([[Gemma Merna]]) is trying to kidnap her. Kathleen is suspicious, demanding to know why. She then realises that the baby is Carmel's husband Calvin's daughter. After she questions Theresa, Kathleen learns that Theresa killed Calvin. Kathleen confronts Carmel and informs the family that she won't report Carmel to the police of Calvin's murder if Carmel terminates her parental rights to Theresa's baby and the McQueens give her money. The McQueens eventually pay Kathleen \u00a32,000 and catch her paying off a policeman. Despite blackmailing her family, Kathleen moves in with Myra. She becomes annoyed when Carmel attempts to snatch Theresa's baby again, so decides to have her granddaughter baptised. After locking Myra and [[Mercedes McQueen]] ([[Jennifer Metcalfe]]) in rooms upstairs, Kathleen, Theresa and [[Bart McQueen]] ([[Jonny Clarke]]) have the baby's christening, naming her Kathleen \"Katy\" Khloe Angel McQueen, as Theresa had planned to call her. Kathleen left in 2011 after her latest scam to use her daughter's kidney for money came to light.\n\nKathleen returns to Hollyoaks in August 2014 and is run over by [[Sonny Valentine]] (Aaron Fontaine), who insists that Kathleen jumped onto the car. She claims to have badly injured her ankle, and Nana forces Carmel to allow her to stay. Kathleen later visits her daughter, Theresa, in prison and promises to find dirt on Sonny, who is stopping Theresa from seeing Kathleen-Angel. Kathleen later drags Mercedes and Jacqui's adoptive daughter, [[Phoebe Jackson|Phoebe McQueen]] (Mandip Gill) into her plan to try and drive Sonny away, but when Sonny offers Kathleen a load of cash, she disappears. It later transpires that Sonny has beaten Kathleen up severely, and threatens to kill her if she breathes a word to anyone. Kathleen then calls Theresa and tells her that she can't help her escape anymore, which upsets both Theresa and Kathleen. A few weeks later, Sonny walks in on Kathleen attempting to call Carmel, but he stops her and threatens her again. He throws a large amount of money at Kathleen, and as she is picking it all up, Carmel enters and asks Kathleen what Sonny has done to her. The next day, Carmel, Myra, Phoebe and Mercedes visit Kathleen in hospital, where she explains that Sonny beat her up and threatened to kill her if she told anybody. As the McQueens try and take Kathleen to the police station to tell them about Sonny, Kathleen flees and asks a taxi to take her to the airport, intending to use the tickets to Spain that Sonny bought her. Before leaving, she tells Carmel, Myra, Phoebe and Mercedes that Sonny is very dangerous, and that she doesn't want to get hurt again.\n\nIn December 2014, Myra told John-Paul that she couldn't attend his wedding with Ste.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hollyoaks}}\n{{Hollyoaks characters|present}}\n\n[[List of soap opera villains#Hollyoaks|List of soap opera villains]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McQueen, Kathleen}}\n[[Category:Hollyoaks characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2009]]\n[[Category:McQueen family]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Kathleen-Angel McQueen}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=Hollyoaks\n|image=Kathleen McQueen.jpg\n|imagesize=210px\n|introducer=[[Lucy Allan (producer)|Lucy Allan]] (2009)<br>[[Paul Marquess]] (2010)<br>[[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] (2014)\n|name= Kathleen McQueen\n|portrayer= Alison Burrows\n|years= 2009\u20132011, 2014\n|first= 28 December 2009\n|last= 25 September 2014\n|spinoffs=''[[Hollyoaks Later]]'' (2009) <br> ''Hollyoaks: King of Hearts (2010)''<br> ''[[Hollyoaks Later|Hollyoaks: The McQueens]] (2016)''\n|classification=[[List of past Hollyoaks characters#Last appeared in 2014|Former; regular]]\n|born=1965\n|family= [[McQueen family|McQueen]]\n|mother= [[Nana McQueen|Marlena McQueen]]\n|aunts=Marguerite McQueen\n|halfsisters= [[Myra McQueen]]<br>[[Reenie McQueen]]\n|halfbrothers=Louis McQueen\n|grandmothers= Queenie McQueen\n|daughters= [[Theresa McQueen]]\n|granddaughters= [[Kathleen-Angel McQueen]]<br>[[Myra-Pocahontas Savage-McQueen]]\n|nephews= [[Niall Rafferty]]<br>[[John Paul McQueen]]<br>Louis McQueen\n|nieces= [[Jacqui McQueen]]<br> [[Mercedes McQueen]]<br> [[Tina Reilly]]<br>[[Carmel McQueen]]<br> [[Michaela McQueen]]<br>[[Carmina McQueen]]<br>[[Porsche McQueen]]<br>[[Celine McQueen]]<br>[[Cleo McQueen]]\n|cousins=[[Breda McQueen]]<br>Victor McQueen\n|relatives=[[Bart McQueen]]<br>[[Hollyoaks Later (series 4)|Jennifique McQueen]]<br>[[Matthew McQueen]]\n|home=[[Spain]]\n}}\n\n'''Kathleen McQueen''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel 4]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Hollyoaks]]'', played by Alison Burrows.

The two met when Justin was troubled and began buying [[marijuana]] off Macki. Soon Justin was forced to go to boot camp and sorted out his life. When Justin returned to town, Macki frequently distracted Justin and wanted him to come back to his old ways. However, Justin wanted to avoid Macki and hang around with his stepbrother [[Ali Taylor]] and friend [[Nicole Owen]]. An embittered Macki made Ali's life a misery by calling him \"monkey boy\" and other racist taunts, and he framed Justin for a fire started in the science lab at the school. However, after finding evidence against Macki, Justin managed to get him expelled.\n\nBoth Ali and Justin thought their troubles were over, until next term as Macki returned to school and wanted revenge. The bullying got worse and both Ali and Justin were beaten up by Macki and his friends. Ali eventually had enough of the bullying and went after him with a knife that his father, Richard, had confiscated from Justin (who got the knife to defend himself against Macki). When Ali found Macki, Macki challenged him to a one-on-one fight and led him to a quiet spot; whilst Ali's back was turned, Macki picked up a brick.\n\nJustin, who had realised the knife was missing, found Ali just in time to see Macki with the brick. He called out to Ali, who then turned around and stabbed Macki. Ali dropped the knife and Justin told him he'd sort it all out and told Ali to go home. Ali then ran out into the road and was hit by a car. Justin hid the knife in the hospital toilets. Meanwhile, both Macki and Ali died of their injuries. A few days later, Justin went back for the knife but the police had already found it and were waiting for Justin to show up.

His mother [[Frankie Osborne]], her son [[Craig Dean]], and her daughter [[Steph Cunningham|Steph Dean]] dropped in for an unplanned visit, and a drunken Frankie told the Haytons all about Jake's affair and his giving an [[Sexually transmitted infection|STI]] to Becca. The families also clashed over wedding preparations and cost. In spite of this turmoil, Charles and Margaret attended Becca's wedding and wished her well.\n\nCharles suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in early 2006 and Becca went to visit him during his recuperation.

Margaret was extremely apprehensive about the relationship, along with Nancy's relationship with a tattoo artist, but went along with what Becca and Nancy wanted. Over the course of the next year, Becca gave birth to her and Justin's son [[Charlie Dean]], who was thought to be Jake's child, and was sent to prison and stabbed to death. When Margaret returned the next summer, she was surprised to see Nancy, who was raising Charlie, had taken up with Jake. She wanted to take Charlie to raise for herself, but Jake and Nancy refused. Margaret told Nancy she would never be as good as Becca, no matter how much she tried.\n\nIn February 2012, Margaret turns up out of the blue, and she is not pleased about Nancy's relationship with [[Darren Osborne]] ([[Ashley Taylor Dawson]]), and when Nancy thinks Darren is having an affair with [[Cindy Cunningham]] ([[Stephanie Waring]]), Margaret convinces Nancy to go and live in Canada with her once they have laid flowers on Becca's grave on Valentine's Day, the anniversary of her death, which is also the day Darren has arranged a surprise wedding for Nancy.

When Justin returned to town, Macki frequently distracted Justin and wanted him to come back to his old ways. However, Justin wanted to avoid Macki and hang around with his stepbrother [[Ali Taylor]] and friend [[Nicole Owen]]. An embittered Macki made Ali's life a misery by calling him \"monkey boy\" and other racist taunts, and he framed Justin for a fire started in the science lab at the school. However, after finding evidence against Macki, Justin managed to get him expelled.\n\nBoth Ali and Justin thought their troubles were over, until next term as Macki returned to school and wanted revenge. The bullying got worse and both Ali and Justin were beaten up by Macki and his friends. Ali eventually had enough of the bullying and went after him with a knife that his father, Richard, had confiscated from Justin (who got the knife to defend himself against Macki). When Ali found Macki, Macki challenged him to a one-on-one fight and led him to a quiet spot; whilst Ali's back was turned, Macki picked up a brick.\n\nJustin, who had realised the knife was missing, found Ali just in time to see Macki with the brick. He called out to Ali, who then turned around and stabbed Macki. Ali dropped the knife and Justin told him he'd sort it all out and told Ali to go home. Ali then ran out into the road and was hit by a car. Justin hid the knife in the hospital toilets. Meanwhile, both Macki and Ali died of their injuries. A few days later, Justin went back for the knife but the police had already found it and were waiting for Justin to show up.

It is most commonly used either during union organizing efforts, or during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace, violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the picket line.\n\nViolence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part of a campaign that includes spying, [[intimidation]], impersonation, [[disinformation]], and [[sabotage]].<ref>Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases \u2014 A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 87</ref> Violence in [[labor unrest|labor disputes]] may be the result of unreasonable polarization, or miscalculation. It may be willful and provoked, or senseless and tragic. On some occasions, violence in labor disputes may be purposeful and calculated,<ref>Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 318</ref> for example the hiring and deployment of [[goon squad]]s to assault strikers.\n\nIncidents of violence during periods of labor unrest are sometimes perceived differently by different parties. It is sometimes a challenge to ascertain the truth about labor-related violence, and [[Union violence|incidents of violence committed by, or in the name of, unions or union workers have occurred]] as well.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe practice of workers organizing, and meeting resistance for organizing, dates to antiquity.<ref>John Romer, ''Ancient Lives; the story of the Pharaoh's Tombmakers. London'': Phoenix Press, 1984, pp. 116-123 See also E.F. Wente, \"A letter of complaint to the Vizier To\", in ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', 20, 1961 and W.F. Edgerton, \"The strikes in Ramses III's Twenty-ninth year\", ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', 10, 1951.</ref>  The first known individual killed by authorities for labor activities is likely Cinto Brandini, executed with nine others in 1345 Florence for attempting to organize woolcombers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=James C.

Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.</ref>  Mass labor violence in the U.S. peaked in the early 20th century and has largely subsided since the 1940s.  But the deadly suppression of labor unions on a large scale persists into the new century, in the 2012 [[Marikana killings]] in South Africa, in the ongoing assassinations of [[Trade unions in Colombia|trade union members in Colombia]], and the South Korean government's response to [[Korean Confederation of Trade Unions]] protests.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Hyun|title=South Korea Labor Strikes Back|url=http://fpif.org/south-korean-labor-strikes-back/|accessdate=18 April 2016|publisher=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=12 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\n\nSince unions are organized to achieve [[collective bargaining]] power to begin with, most union conflicts have been motivated primarily by economic issues (wages, working hours, safety conditions, work rules, etc.),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lalor|first1=John Joseph|title=Cyclopaedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and of the Political History of the United States, Volume 3|date=1890|publisher=C.

In some instances, however, other causes emerge.\n\n===Race===\n\n[[File:Randrebellion.png|right|thumb|French cartoon of the [[Rand Rebellion]] in South Africa, 1922]]\n\nThe 1887 [[Thibodaux massacre]] in [[Louisiana]], the 1899 [[Pana riot]] in southern [[Illinois]], and the 1911 [[Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway#1911 strike|Queen & Crescent killings]] in [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] are three examples of deliberate campaigns of murder against organized black workers in the American south, the first committed by landowners, the other two by white competitors.\n\nIn South Africa the 1922 [[Rand Rebellion]] also had underlying racial causes, taking on the slogan \"''Workers of the world, unite and fight for a white South Africa!''\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workmall.com/wfb2001/south_africa/south_africa_history_conflict_in_the_1920s.html|title=South Africa  Conflict in the 1920s - Flags, Maps, Economy, Geography, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System|work=workmall.com}}</ref> before their strike grew to a small-scale rebellion at the cost of 200 lives.  The behavior of South African police in the [[1946 African Mine Workers' Union strike]] is said to have led to the formation of the [[Northern Rhodesian African Mineworkers' Union]] in 1949 as a cornerstone of the anti-apartheid movement.<ref>{{cite web|title=The African Miners' Strike of 1946 |first=M.

Polish labor unions were centrally involved in workers\u2019 uprisings and/or general strikes that challenged the sitting governments in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a insurrection (1905)|1905]], [[1923 Krak\u00f3w riot|1923]], and [[1937 peasant strike in Poland|1937]].  In a similar way the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|strike of Asturian miners in 1934]], put down by right-wing Spanish government forces with great loss of life, amounted to an insurrection through work stoppage, not an economic labor action.   Unions continued to play a political and military role in the subsequent [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nAlong with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in Spain, other totalitarian regimes in Europe brought their labor unions under government control, violently when necessary.  After coming to power as chancellor in January 1933, Adolf Hitler declared May Day a national holiday, then on May 2, 1933 unexpectedly moved to outlaw labor unions as part of the Nazi \"[[Gleichschaltung|synchronization]]\" process.   Major unions such as the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund]] were raided that day, their accounts seized, and their leaders (Gustav Schiefer, [[Wilhelm Leuschner]], Erich Luebbe) arrested and sent to concentration camps.  (The bodies of four murdered trade union officials in Duisburg were only found a year later, in April 1934.)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gregor|first1=Neil|title=Nazism|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9FFAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA296|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref>  Every worker in the nation was then compelled to join the single party-controlled union, the [[German Labour Front]].  Similar coercive violence was exercised against labor unions in conquered nations, as in the Netherlands in 1941.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Warmbrunn|first1=Werner|title=The Dutch Under German Occupation, 1940-1945|date=1963|publisher=Stanford University Press|page=136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ykWfAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA136|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Types of violence ==\n\nSome anti-union violence appears to be random, such as an incident during the [[1912 Lawrence Textile Strike|1912 textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], in which a police officer fired into a crowd of strikers, killing [[Anna LoPizzo]].<ref>William Dudley Haywood, Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, page 249</ref>\n\nAnti-union violence may be used as a means to intimidate others, as in the [[Frank Little (unionist)|hanging of union organizer Frank Little]] from a railroad trestle in [[Butte, Montana]]. A note was pinned to his body which said, \"Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!\" The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists in the Butte area were on the note, with the \"L\" for Frank Little circled.<ref>Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224</ref><ref>Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249</ref>\n\nAnti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the [[Anaconda Road Massacre]]. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died.<ref>Mary Murphy, Mining cultures: men, women, and leisure in Butte, 1914-41, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 33</ref>\n\nOther anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914 when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].<ref>Zinn, H. \"The Ludlow Massacre\", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346\u2013349</ref> During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the \"Death Special\". At the Forbes tent colony,\n\n<blockquote>\n\"[The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent some six hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of the shots struck miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing him instantly. Another striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ... suffered nine bullet wounds to his legs... One tent was later found to have about 150 bullet holes...\"<ref>Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 98</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nSometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an auto workers strike organised by [[Victor G. Reuther|Victor Reuther]] and others in 1937, \"[u]nionists assembled rocks, steel hinges, and other objects to throw at the cops, and police organized [[tear gas]] attacks and mounted charges.\"<ref>Nelson Lichtenstein, Walter Reuther: the most dangerous man in Detroit, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 101</ref>\n\nThere have been cases where violence has been perpetrated or encouraged by agents of management, intending it to be blamed on the union.<ref>Robert Hunter, Violence and the labor movement, Macmillan, 1914 (1919 version), page 317</ref>\n\n== Violence by country ==\n\n{{Expand list|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n[[File:Strike in Brussels.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of the 1902 Belgium general strike, by Henri Meurnier]]\n\n;Belgium\n* the [[Belgian general strike of 1902]] was led by the coal miners of [[Li\u00e8ge (province)|Li\u00e8ge]], lasting 10 to 20 days and killing about 12\n\n;Russia\n* in the [[Lena massacre]] hundreds of striking goldfield workers were killed by tsarist government forces in northeast [[Siberia]] near the [[Lena River]] on {{OldStyleDate|17 April|1912|4 April}}\n\n;United Kingdom\n* on 17 May 1869, a labor action of Welsh colliers (forcibly delivering the mine's new operator to the police station) developed into [[Mold, Flintshire#The Mold Riot|The Mold Riot]], a confrontation between a mob of 1500 workers and citizens, versus [[King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster)|King's Own Royal Regiment]].

It is most commonly used either during union organizing efforts, or during strikes. The aim most often is to prevent a union from forming, to destroy an existing union, or to reduce the effectiveness of a union or a particular strike action. If strikers prevent people or goods to enter or leave a workplace, violence may be used to allow people and goods to pass the picket line.\n\nViolence against unions may be isolated, or may occur as part of a campaign that includes spying, [[intimidation]], impersonation, [[disinformation]], and [[sabotage]].<ref>Robert Michael Smith, From Blackjacks To Briefcases \u2014 A History of Commercialized Strikebreaking and Unionbusting in the United States, 2003, p. 87</ref> Violence in [[labor unrest|labor disputes]] may be the result of unreasonable polarization, or miscalculation.

Polish labor unions were centrally involved in workers\u2019 uprisings and/or general strikes that challenged the sitting governments in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a insurrection (1905)|1905]], [[1923 Krak\u00f3w riot|1923]], and [[1937 peasant strike in Poland|1937]].  In a similar way the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|strike of Asturian miners in 1934]], put down by right-wing Spanish government forces with great loss of life, amounted to an insurrection through work stoppage, not an economic labor action.   Unions continued to play a political and military role in the subsequent [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nAlong with [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in Spain, other totalitarian regimes in Europe brought their labor unions under government control, violently when necessary.  After coming to power as chancellor in January 1933, Adolf Hitler declared May Day a national holiday, then on May 2, 1933 unexpectedly moved to outlaw labor unions as part of the Nazi \"[[Gleichschaltung|synchronization]]\" process.   Major unions such as the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund]] were raided that day, their accounts seized, and their leaders (Gustav Schiefer, [[Wilhelm Leuschner]], Erich Luebbe) arrested and sent to concentration camps.  (The bodies of four murdered trade union officials in Duisburg were only found a year later, in April 1934.)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gregor|first1=Neil|title=Nazism|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9FFAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA296|accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref>  Every worker in the nation was then compelled to join the single party-controlled union, the [[German Labour Front]].

A note was pinned to his body which said, \"Others Take Notice! First And Last Warning!\" The initial of the last names of seven well-known union activists in the Butte area were on the note, with the \"L\" for Frank Little circled.<ref>Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, pages 223-224</ref><ref>Peter Carlson, Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, 1983, pages 17, 248-249</ref>\n\nAnti-union violence may be abrupt and unanticipated. Three years after Frank Little was lynched, a strike by Butte miners was suppressed with gunfire when deputized mine guards suddenly fired upon unarmed picketers in the [[Anaconda Road Massacre]]. Seventeen were shot in the back as they tried to flee, and one man died.<ref>Mary Murphy, Mining cultures: men, women, and leisure in Butte, 1914-41, University of Illinois Press, 1997, page 33</ref>\n\nOther anti-union violence may seem orchestrated, as in 1914 when mine guards and the state militia fired into a tent colony of striking miners in Colorado, an incident that came to be known as the [[Ludlow Massacre]].<ref>Zinn, H. \"The Ludlow Massacre\", A People's History of the United States. pgs 346\u2013349</ref> During that strike, the company hired the Baldwin Felts agency, which built an armored car so their agents could approach the strikers' tent colonies with impunity. The strikers called it the \"Death Special\". At the Forbes tent colony,\n\n<blockquote>\n\"[The Death Special] opened fire, a protracted spurt that sent some six hundred bullets tearing through the thin tents. One of the shots struck miner Luka Vahernik, fifty, in the head, killing him instantly. Another striker, Marco Zamboni, eighteen ... suffered nine bullet wounds to his legs... One tent was later found to have about 150 bullet holes...\"<ref>Scott Martelle, Blood Passion, Rutgers University Press, 2008, page 98</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nSometimes, there is simultaneous violence on both sides. In an auto workers strike organised by [[Victor G.

In 2010 when [[Paul Marquess]] took over the role, he recognised she was an under used character split her apart from the McQueen family, subsequently increasing her role within the show. Jacqui has been portrayed as a \"tough ex-con\" and is extremely feisty, she often takes on the matriarch role within the McQueens.\n\nMany of Jacqui's early storylines revolved around her life of crime, marrying [[Aleksander Malota]] ([[Jon Lolis]]) to pay off debts and her wayward relationship with [[Tony Hutchinson]] ([[Nick Pickard]]), which became popular with viewers. One of her most prominent early plots involved her desire to have her own child after a miscarriage left her unable to, this resulted in failed adoption, various surrogate mother stories involving her family and eventually led to the breakdown of her relationship with Tony. Jacqui's later storylines involved her relationship with [[Des Townsend]] ([[Kris Deedigan]]), covering up [[Calvin Valentine]]'s ([[Ricky Whittle]]) murder, being blackmailed and held at knife point for sex and a \"surprise relationship\" with [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]) which also become very popular with audiences. In 2011 Jacqui made a [[rape]] accusation against [[Gilly Roach]] ([[Anthony Quinlan]]), whether Gilly is guilty or innocent was decided by a jury composed of viewers. The storyline subsequently resulted in Gilly being found not guilty. Various critics have praised the character because of her \"feisty and tough persona\". Others have criticised her \"chav\" dress sense and accused her of being a \"trollop\". Cooper has received various award nominations for her portrayal.

[[Myra McQueen]] ([[Nicole Barber-Lane]]) is furious and orders Jacqui, Aleksander and Carmel to leave the house. Jacqui announces her pregnancy; Tony initially does not want the child, fearing that it may die like his previous child and their dreams are shattered when Jacqui miscarries and is left unable to have children of her own.

Jacqui's later storylines involved her relationship with [[Des Townsend]] ([[Kris Deedigan]]), covering up [[Calvin Valentine]]'s ([[Ricky Whittle]]) murder, being blackmailed and held at knife point for sex and a \"surprise relationship\" with [[Rhys Ashworth]] ([[Andrew Moss]]) which also become very popular with audiences. In 2011 Jacqui made a [[rape]] accusation against [[Gilly Roach]] ([[Anthony Quinlan]]), whether Gilly is guilty or innocent was decided by a jury composed of viewers. The storyline subsequently resulted in Gilly being found not guilty. Various critics have praised the character because of her \"feisty and tough persona\". Others have criticised her \"chav\" dress sense and accused her of being a \"trollop\". Cooper has received various award nominations for her portrayal.
