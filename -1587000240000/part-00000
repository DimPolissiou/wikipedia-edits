The film is animated in the style of television holiday specials and, unlike most mainstream holiday films, centers on Jewish characters during the [[Hanukkah]] season, as opposed to the Christian celebration of [[Christmas]]. \n\nThis is also [[Happy Madison Productions]]' first animated film. The film's title is taken from a line in Sandler's series of songs called ''[[The Chanukah Song]]'' that compares the gift-giving traditions of [[Christmas]] and [[Hanukkah|Chanukah]]: ''\"Instead of one day of presents, we get eight crazy nights!\"'' A new version of ''The Chanukah Song'' also plays over the film's closing credits. It has been called the best known [[Hanukkah film]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Jews deserve a better Hanukkah movie than Adam Sandler's \"Eight Crazy Nights\" |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/12/01/jews-deserve-a-better-hanukkah-movie-than-adam-sandlers-eight-crazy-nights/amp |accessdate=7 December 2019 |agency=Salon}}</ref>\n\nThe film has received a cult following, especially among those in the [[Jewish community]], as it is one of the highest-profile and most-known Hanukkah films.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jews deserve a better Hanukkah movie than Adam Sandler's \"Eight Crazy Nights\" |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/12/01/jews-deserve-a-better-hanukkah-movie-than-adam-sandlers-eight-crazy-nights/amp |accessdate=7 December 2019 |agency=Salon}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn December 2001 in the small fictional town of Dukesberry, [[New Hampshire]], Davey Stone is a 33-year-old [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] troublemaker with a long [[criminal record]], whose antics have long earned him the community's animosity. Davey is arrested for [[dine and dash|refusing to pay his bill]] at Mr. Chang's Chinese restaurant, attempting to evade arrest (\"Davey's Song\"), stealing a [[snowmobile]], and destroying festive [[Ice sculpture|ice sculptures]] in the process. At Davey's trial, Whitey Duvall, a 70-year-old volunteer referee from Davey's former basketball league, intervenes. At Whitey's suggestion, the judge sentences Davey to [[community service]] as a referee-in-training for Whitey's Youth Basketball League. Under the terms of the community service, if Davey commits a crime before his sentence is completed, he will serve 10 years in prison.\n\nThe next day, Davey's first game ends in disaster. After Davey causes disruptions and torments an obese player for his [[gynecomastia]], Whitey suffers a [[grand mal seizure]], and the game is abruptly halted.  Attempting to calm Davey down, Whitey takes him to the mall, where they meet Davey's childhood friend Jennifer Friedman and her son Benjamin. Whitey reminds Davey that he lost his chance with Jennifer 20 years earlier, but Davey secretly still has feelings for her.\n\nAs time progresses, Davey and Whitey's relationship becomes more strained. Whitey's various attempts to encourage Davey are met with humiliation and assault--including but not limited to Davey knocking Whitey into a [[chemical toilet|porta-potty]] then spraying him with a hose when he climbs out, causing him to be frozen in defecation for several hours before a group of grazing reindeer licks him out. When Davey gets home (\"Long Ago\") his trailer is being burned down by a man who lost a basketball match to him earlier and was forced to chew on a [[jock strap]]. Davey runs into the burning trailer to rescue a [[Hanukkah]] card from his late parents, then watches the trailer burn down. Whitey opens his home to Davey, who reluctantly accepts; also living there is Whitey's [[Diabetes|diabetic]] [[fraternal twin]] sister Eleanore. The Duvall household has many complex rules, to which Whitey refers as [[technical foul]]s (\"Technical Foul\"). Davey seemingly overcomes them and starts to turn his life around.\n\nBut Davey's progress in reforming stops short when Whitey recalls what happened two decades ago: En route to one of Davey's basketball games, his parents were killed in a car accident when a truck skidded on [[black ice]] and swerved into them, and Davey learned of their deaths when the police showed up at the end of his game to inform him. Devastated by the loss of his loving parents and leaping from foster home to foster home, Davey spent the next 20 years numbing his pain with alcohol and petty crime. Uncomfortable with this reminder of his tragic, painful childhood, Davey loses his temper and insults both Whitey and Eleanore and Whitey kicks Davey out, much to Davey's relief.\n\nDavey spends the rest of the day drinking, and that night he breaks into the closed mall. In his drunken stupor, he imagines the logos of various stores coming to life and confronting him about his inability to grieve for his parents, which they identify as the source of his alcoholism (\"Intervention Song\"). He finally opens his parents' Hanukkah card, which contains a heartfelt message praising him for being a good son, and two photos: one of a young Davey and Jennifer at one of their basketball games, and one with his late parents. Davey finally cries and comes to terms with his loss. Just then the police arrive to arrest him, but he escapes and boards a bus to [[New York City]]. En route, the bus is forced to stop when a single thumbtack in the road punctures all eight rear tires. Reminded of the Miracle of Hanukkah, Davey walks off the bus, intending to find Whitey and make amends with him.\n\nDavey finds Whitey at the All-Star Banquet, an annual town celebration in which one member of the community is recognized for positive contributions to Dukesberry with the \"Dukesberry All-Star Patch\" which Whitey has wanted for 35 years. When Whitey is passed over for seemingly the final time, he decides to move to [[Florida]] and live the rest of his life in [[anonymity]]. Risking arrest, Davey enters the hall and informs everyone of Whitey's many selfless contributions to Dukesberry throughout his life. The ashamed townspeople acknowledge the error of their decision (\"Bum Biddy\"). Davey leads them to Whitey, who has gone to the mall with Eleanore to \"speak to it\" one more time. The townspeople thank Whitey for his service over the years and the Mayor officially grants him the Patch Award. All 34 previous recipients of the awards give theirs to Whitey. Davey and Jennifer reconcile and Whitey goes into a seizure, which he calls \"the happiest seizure of my life!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Davey Stone/Whitey Duvall/Eleanore Duvall\n* [[Jackie Sandler|Jackie Titone]]<!--This was prior to her marriage to Sandler.--> as Jennifer Friedman.\n** [[Alison Krauss]] as her singing voice\n* Austin Stout as Benjamin Friedman, Jennifer's excitable 11-year-old son.\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as The Narrator/Mr. York, a Chinese restaurant waiter.\n* [[Kevin Nealon]] as Mayor Dewey, the Mayor of Dukesberry.\n* [[Norm Crosby]] as the Judge.\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Tom Baltezor, a competitor in the All-Star Banquet for the patch and the initial winner of it.

Animation]]. It was the only animated film that [[Adam Sandler]] worked on until ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'' in 2012, and remains the only traditionally-animated film to have his involvement.\n\nSeth Kearsley revealed in an email to Doug Walker ([[The Nostalgia Critic]]) that certain elements of the movie that were notorious, specifically the feces-eating deer scene and even Whitey's voice (which was originally more higher-pitched and annoying), were intended to be cut, but were kept due to \"focus groups\" who had seen the film (who lowered Whitey's voice down), as well as the fact that the product placements were used without permission.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=497iTevXQ8M|title=Nostalgia Critic Real Thoughts on 8 Crazy Nights|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Channel Awesome|date=April 10, 2015|accessdate=August 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823215530/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=497iTevXQ8M&gl=US&hl=en&has_verified=1&bpctr=9999999999|archive-date=August 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Eight Crazy Nights'' came in at fifth place on its opening weekend among U.S. box office, making only $14 million since its Wednesday launch.

The film is animated in the style of television holiday specials and, unlike most mainstream holiday films, centers on Jewish characters during the [[Hanukkah]] season, as opposed to the Christian celebration of [[Christmas]]. \n\nThis is also [[Happy Madison Productions]]' first animated film. The film's title is taken from a line in Sandler's series of songs called ''[[The Chanukah Song]]'' that compares the gift-giving traditions of [[Christmas]] and [[Hanukkah|Chanukah]]: ''\"Instead of one day of presents, we get eight crazy nights!\"'' A new version of ''The Chanukah Song'' also plays over the film's closing credits. It has been called the best known [[Hanukkah film]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Jews deserve a better Hanukkah movie than Adam Sandler's \"Eight Crazy Nights\" |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/12/01/jews-deserve-a-better-hanukkah-movie-than-adam-sandlers-eight-crazy-nights/amp |accessdate=7 December 2019 |agency=Salon}}</ref>\n\nThe film has received a cult following, especially among those in the [[Jewish community]], as it is one of the highest-profile and most-known Hanukkah films.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jews deserve a better Hanukkah movie than Adam Sandler's \"Eight Crazy Nights\" |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/12/01/jews-deserve-a-better-hanukkah-movie-than-adam-sandlers-eight-crazy-nights/amp |accessdate=7 December 2019 |agency=Salon}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn December 2001 in the small fictional town of Dukesberry, [[New Hampshire]], Davey Stone is a 33-year-old [[Jews|Jewish]] [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] troublemaker with a long [[criminal record]], whose antics have long earned him the community's animosity. Davey is arrested for [[dine and dash|refusing to pay his bill]] at Mr. Chang's Chinese restaurant, attempting to evade arrest (\"Davey's Song\"), stealing a [[snowmobile]], and destroying festive [[Ice sculpture|ice sculptures]] in the process. At Davey's trial, Whitey Duvall, a 70-year-old volunteer referee from Davey's former basketball league, intervenes. At Whitey's suggestion, the judge sentences Davey to [[community service]] as a referee-in-training for Whitey's Youth Basketball League. Under the terms of the community service, if Davey commits a crime before his sentence is completed, he will serve 10 years in prison.\n\nThe next day, Davey's first game ends in disaster. After Davey causes disruptions and torments an obese player for his [[gynecomastia]], Whitey suffers a [[grand mal seizure]], and the game is abruptly halted.  Attempting to calm Davey down, Whitey takes him to the mall, where they meet Davey's childhood friend Jennifer Friedman and her son Benjamin. Whitey reminds Davey that he lost his chance with Jennifer 20 years earlier, but Davey secretly still has feelings for her.\n\nAs time progresses, Davey and Whitey's relationship becomes more strained. Whitey's various attempts to encourage Davey are met with humiliation and assault--including but not limited to Davey knocking Whitey into a [[chemical toilet|porta-potty]] then spraying him with a hose when he climbs out, causing him to be frozen in defecation for several hours before a group of grazing reindeer licks him out. When Davey gets home (\"Long Ago\") his trailer is being burned down by a man who lost a basketball match to him earlier and was forced to chew on a [[jock strap]]. Davey runs into the burning trailer to rescue a [[Hanukkah]] card from his late parents, then watches the trailer burn down. Whitey opens his home to Davey, who reluctantly accepts; also living there is Whitey's [[Diabetes|diabetic]] [[fraternal twin]] sister Eleanore. The Duvall household has many complex rules, to which Whitey refers as [[technical foul]]s (\"Technical Foul\"). Davey seemingly overcomes them and starts to turn his life around.\n\nBut Davey's progress in reforming stops short when Whitey recalls what happened two decades ago: En route to one of Davey's basketball games, his parents were killed in a car accident when a truck skidded on [[black ice]] and swerved into them, and Davey learned of their deaths when the police showed up at the end of his game to inform him. Devastated by the loss of his loving parents and leaping from foster home to foster home, Davey spent the next 20 years numbing his pain with alcohol and petty crime. Uncomfortable with this reminder of his tragic, painful childhood, Davey loses his temper and insults both Whitey and Eleanore and Whitey kicks Davey out, much to Davey's relief.\n\nDavey spends the rest of the day drinking, and that night he breaks into the closed mall. In his drunken stupor, he imagines the logos of various stores coming to life and confronting him about his inability to grieve for his parents, which they identify as the source of his alcoholism (\"Intervention Song\"). He finally opens his parents' Hanukkah card, which contains a heartfelt message praising him for being a good son, and two photos: one of a young Davey and Jennifer at one of their basketball games, and one with his late parents. Davey finally cries and comes to terms with his loss. Just then the police arrive to arrest him, but he escapes and boards a bus to [[New York City]]. En route, the bus is forced to stop when a single thumbtack in the road punctures all eight rear tires. Reminded of the Miracle of Hanukkah, Davey walks off the bus, intending to find Whitey and make amends with him.\n\nDavey finds Whitey at the All-Star Banquet, an annual town celebration in which one member of the community is recognized for positive contributions to Dukesberry with the \"Dukesberry All-Star Patch\" which Whitey has wanted for 35 years. When Whitey is passed over for seemingly the final time, he decides to move to [[Florida]] and live the rest of his life in [[anonymity]]. Risking arrest, Davey enters the hall and informs everyone of Whitey's many selfless contributions to Dukesberry throughout his life. The ashamed townspeople acknowledge the error of their decision (\"Bum Biddy\"). Davey leads them to Whitey, who has gone to the mall with Eleanore to \"speak to it\" one more time. The townspeople thank Whitey for his service over the years and the Mayor officially grants him the Patch Award. All 34 previous recipients of the awards give theirs to Whitey. Davey and Jennifer reconcile and Whitey goes into a seizure, which he calls \"the happiest seizure of my life!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Adam Sandler]] as Davey Stone/Whitey Duvall/Eleanore Duvall\n* [[Jackie Sandler|Jackie Titone]]<!--This was prior to her marriage to Sandler.--> as Jennifer Friedman.\n** [[Alison Krauss]] as her singing voice\n* Austin Stout as Benjamin Friedman, Jennifer's excitable 11-year-old son.\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as The Narrator/Mr. York, a Chinese restaurant waiter.\n* [[Kevin Nealon]] as Mayor Dewey, the Mayor of Dukesberry.\n* [[Norm Crosby]] as the Judge.\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Tom Baltezor, a competitor in the All-Star Banquet for the patch and the initial winner of it.

Film A/S]], [[Bardel Entertainment]], Goldenbell Animation, Marina Motion Animation, Spaff Animation, Tama Production, Time Lapse Pictures, [[Warner Bros. Animation]], [[Y. R. Studio]], and [[Yowza! Animation]]. It was the only animated film that [[Adam Sandler]] worked on until ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'' in 2012, and remains the only traditionally-animated film to have his involvement.\n\nSeth Kearsley revealed in an email to Doug Walker ([[The Nostalgia Critic]]) that certain elements of the movie that were notorious, specifically the feces-eating deer scene and even Whitey's voice (which was originally more higher-pitched and annoying), were intended to be cut, but were kept due to \"focus groups\" who had seen the film (who lowered Whitey's voice down), as well as the fact that the product placements were used without permission.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=497iTevXQ8M|title=Nostalgia Critic Real Thoughts on 8 Crazy Nights|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Channel Awesome|date=April 10, 2015|accessdate=August 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190823215530/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=497iTevXQ8M&gl=US&hl=en&has_verified=1&bpctr=9999999999|archive-date=August 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Eight Crazy Nights'' came in at fifth place on its opening weekend among U.S. box office, making only $14 million since its Wednesday launch.

It was Jackson's sixth studio album released through Epic, and his last released before [[Death of Michael Jackson|his death in 2009]]. An extensive and laborious album to make, Jackson started the multi genre production in 1997, and did not finish until eight weeks before the album's October 2001 release. It was reported that it cost thirty million dollars to make the album,<ref name=\"promotioninfo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1455976/20020708/jackson_michael.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson Shocks Al Sharpton By Calling Tommy Mottola A Racist |author=Jennifer Vineyard |work=MTV |publisher=Viacom |date=2002-07-02 |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref> making it the most expensive album ever made.<ref name=\"Branigan 20m\">{{cite news|last=Branigan|first=Tania|title=Jackson spends \u00a320m to be Invincible|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/08/taniabranigan|accessdate=2013-02-16|newspaper=The Guardian|date=September 8, 2001}}</ref> The album features appearances from [[Carlos Santana]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]. ''Invincible'' incorporates [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Soul music|soul]]. Similarly to Jackson's previous material, the album explores themes such as [[love]], [[Romance (love)|romance]], [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]], [[media criticism]], and [[Social issue|social issues]]. \n\nUnlike with Jackson's post-''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' studio albums, there was no world tour to promote ''Invincible''; a tour was planned, but canceled due to conflicts between Jackson and [[Sony Music Entertainment]]. Following Sony's decision to abruptly end all promotion for the album, Jackson made allegations in July 2002 that [[Tommy Mottola]] was a \"devil\" and a \"racist\" who did not support his [[African Americans|African-American]] artists but used them for his own personal gain. \n\n''Invincible'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and in ten other countries worldwide. As well as \"You Rock My World\", the album spawned three more singles: \"[[Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry]]\", \"[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]\" and the [[promotional single]] \"[[Speechless (Michael Jackson song)|Speechless]]\". \"You Rock My World\" was the album's most successful single, peaking at number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was Jackson's last top 10 hit before his death. Although ''Invincible'' was one of the best-selling albums of 2001, it received mixed reviews. However, in retrospective reviews the album has gained more positive reviews and has been credited as an early development of [[dubstep]].<ref name=\"Nanke\">{{Cite web|url=https://kennedytorch.org/14178/artsculture/review-jacksons-invincible-is-underappreciated/|title=Review: Jackson\u2019s Invincible is under-appreciated|last=Nanke|first=Ashton|website=Kennedy Torch|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref><ref name=\"OToole\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UNCGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT451&lpg=PT451&dq=michael+jackson+invincible+dubstep&source=bl&ots=DThiYmyFJt&sig=ACfU3U3DTLclEQB4caVnnUtWUILxTm2jQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiC6e-btrfmAhWWi1wKHTEoBw84ChDoATADegQICRAB|title=Michael Jackson FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the King of Pop|last=O'Toole|first=Kit|date=2015-10-01|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4950-4599-8|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHaving sold approximately 6 million copies worldwide, and being certified [[RIAA certification|2\u00d7 Platinum]] in January 2002 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), sales for ''Invincible'' were notably low compared to Jackson's previous releases, due to the lack of promotion, no supporting world tour and his label dispute. ''Invincible'' received one [[Grammy Award]] nomination, with \"You Rock My World\" being nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. In 2009, ''Invincible'' was voted by readers of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the Best Album of the Decade.\n\n==Background==\nJackson had been recording solo studio albums since ''[[Got to Be There]]'' for [[Motown]] in 1971. During his time as a member of [[the Jacksons]], he frequently wrote material for the group after they left Motown in 1975 and began working on more projects as a solo artist, which eventually led to recording his own solo albums for [[Epic Records]], notably ''[[Off the Wall]]'' (1979), ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' (1982), ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' (1987), and [[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|''Dangerous'']] (1991). The success of ''Thriller'', which, as of 2020, still holds its place as the best selling album of all time with a reported 66 million units sold, often over-shadowed Jackson's other projects. Prior to the release of ''Invincible'', Jackson had not released any new material since ''[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]'' in 1997, or a studio album since ''[[HIStory]]'' in 1995. ''Invincible'' was thus looked at as Jackson's 'career come back'.<ref name=\"ALG Invincible\">{{allmusic|album|invincible-mw0000011263|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]|accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>\n\n''Invincible'' was dedicated to the fifteen-year-old Afro-Norwegian boy [[Benjamin Hermansen|Benjamin \"Benny\" Hermansen]] who was stabbed to death by a group of [[neo-Nazi]]s in [[Oslo]], Norway, in January 2001.<ref name=\"dedication\"/> The reason for this tribute was partly due to the fact that another Oslo youth, Omer Bhatti, Jackson's friend, was also a good friend of Hermansen.<ref name=\"dedication\"/> The dedication in the album reads, \"Michael Jackson gives 'special thanks': ''This album is dedicated to Benjamin 'Benny' Hermansen.

It was Jackson's sixth studio album released through Epic, and his last released before [[Death of Michael Jackson|his death in 2009]]. An extensive and laborious album to make, Jackson started the multi genre production in 1997, and did not finish until eight weeks before the album's October 2001 release. It was reported that it cost thirty million dollars to make the album,<ref name=\"promotioninfo\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1455976/20020708/jackson_michael.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson Shocks Al Sharpton By Calling Tommy Mottola A Racist |author=Jennifer Vineyard |work=MTV |publisher=Viacom |date=2002-07-02 |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref> making it the most expensive album ever made.<ref name=\"Branigan 20m\">{{cite news|last=Branigan|first=Tania|title=Jackson spends \u00a320m to be Invincible|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/08/taniabranigan|accessdate=2013-02-16|newspaper=The Guardian|date=September 8, 2001}}</ref> The album features appearances from [[Carlos Santana]] and [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]. ''Invincible'' incorporates [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Soul music|soul]]. Similarly to Jackson's previous material, the album explores themes such as [[love]], [[Romance (love)|romance]], [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]], [[media criticism]], and [[Social issue|social issues]]. \n\nUnlike with Jackson's post-''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' studio albums, there was no world tour to promote ''Invincible''; a tour was planned, but canceled due to conflicts between Jackson and [[Sony Music Entertainment]]. Following Sony's decision to abruptly end all promotion for the album, Jackson made allegations in July 2002 that [[Tommy Mottola]] was a \"devil\" and a \"racist\" who did not support his [[African Americans|African-American]] artists but used them for his own personal gain. \n\n''Invincible'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and in ten other countries worldwide. As well as \"You Rock My World\", the album spawned three more singles: \"[[Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry]]\", \"[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]\" and the [[promotional single]] \"[[Speechless (Michael Jackson song)|Speechless]]\". \"You Rock My World\" was the album's most successful single, peaking at number ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was Jackson's last top 10 hit before his death. Although ''Invincible'' was one of the best-selling albums of 2001, it received mixed reviews. However, in retrospective reviews the album has gained more positive reviews and has been credited as an early development of [[dubstep]].<ref name=\"Nanke\">{{Cite web|url=https://kennedytorch.org/14178/artsculture/review-jacksons-invincible-is-underappreciated/|title=Review: Jackson\u2019s Invincible is under-appreciated|last=Nanke|first=Ashton|website=Kennedy Torch|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref><ref name=\"OToole\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UNCGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT451&lpg=PT451&dq=michael+jackson+invincible+dubstep&source=bl&ots=DThiYmyFJt&sig=ACfU3U3DTLclEQB4caVnnUtWUILxTm2jQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiC6e-btrfmAhWWi1wKHTEoBw84ChDoATADegQICRAB|title=Michael Jackson FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the King of Pop|last=O'Toole|first=Kit|date=2015-10-01|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4950-4599-8|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHaving sold approximately 6 million copies worldwide, and being certified [[RIAA certification|2\u00d7 Platinum]] in January 2002 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), sales for ''Invincible'' were notably low compared to Jackson's previous releases, due to the lack of promotion, no supporting world tour and his label dispute. ''Invincible'' received one [[Grammy Award]] nomination, with \"You Rock My World\" being nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. In 2009, ''Invincible'' was voted by readers of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the Best Album of the Decade.\n\n==Background==\nJackson had been recording solo studio albums since ''[[Got to Be There]]'' for [[Motown]] in 1971. During his time as a member of [[the Jacksons]], he frequently wrote material for the group after they left Motown in 1975 and began working on more projects as a solo artist, which eventually led to recording his own solo albums for [[Epic Records]], notably ''[[Off the Wall]]'' (1979), ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' (1982), ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' (1987), and [[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|''Dangerous'']] (1991). The success of ''Thriller'', which, as of 2020, still holds its place as the best selling album of all time with a reported 66 million units sold, often over-shadowed Jackson's other projects. Prior to the release of ''Invincible'', Jackson had not released any new material since ''[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]'' in 1997, or a studio album since ''[[HIStory]]'' in 1995. ''Invincible'' was thus looked at as Jackson's 'career come back'.<ref name=\"ALG Invincible\">{{allmusic|album|invincible-mw0000011263|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]|accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>\n\n''Invincible'' was dedicated to the fifteen-year-old Afro-Norwegian boy [[Benjamin Hermansen|Benjamin \"Benny\" Hermansen]] who was stabbed to death by a group of [[neo-Nazi]]s in [[Oslo]], Norway, in January 2001.<ref name=\"dedication\"/> The reason for this tribute was partly due to the fact that another Oslo youth, Omer Bhatti, Jackson's friend, was also a good friend of Hermansen.<ref name=\"dedication\"/> The dedication in the album reads, \"Michael Jackson gives 'special thanks': ''This album is dedicated to Benjamin 'Benny' Hermansen.

Jackson wisely did not conform to pop music standards at the time of production, leaving ''Invincible'' sounding just as fresh and distinctive as it did on the day it was released.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@JonathanTSDM/michael-jacksons-invincible-is-all-grown-up-18-years-later-a-track-by-track-review-cdbbf7ae92de|title=Michael Jackson\u2019s \u2018Invincible\u2019 is All Grown Up: 18 Years Later, a Track by Track Review|last=Harris|first=Jonathan|date=2019-09-14|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-12-15}}</ref>\n\n[[AllMusic]] editor [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] commented that it has a \"spark\" and \"sound better than anything Jackson has done since ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]''.\"<ref name=\"ALG Invincible\" /> Erlewine noted that while the album had good material it was \"not enough to make ''Invincible'' the comeback Jackson needed - he really would have had to have an album that sounded free instead of constrained for that to work - but it does offer a reminder that he can really craft good pop.\"<ref name=\"ALG Invincible\" /> Writing for [http://popdose.com/ ''PopDose''], Mike Heyliger wrote \"''Invincible'' isn't the piece of shit most claim it to be.

As a young artist, Gill had assisted Johnston in its early development stages. In 1926, [[Douglas Cleverdon]], a young printer-publisher, opened a bookshop in [[Bristol]], and Gill painted a fascia for the shop for him in sans-serif capitals. In addition, Gill sketched an alphabet for Cleverdon as a guide for him to use for future notices and announcements. By this time Gill had become a prominent stonemason, artist and creator of lettering in his own right and had begun to work on creating typeface designs.\n\nGill was commissioned to develop his alphabet into a full metal type family by his friend [[Stanley Morison]], an influential Monotype executive and historian of printing. Morison hoped that it could be Monotype's competitor to a wave of German sans-serif families in a new \"[[Sans-serif#Geometric|geometric]]\" style, which included [[Erbar (typeface)|Erbar]], [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] and [[Kabel (typeface)|Kabel]], all being launched to considerable attention in Germany during the late 1920s. Gill Sans was released in 1928 by Monotype, initially as a set of titling capitals that was quickly followed by a lower-case. Gill's aim was to blend the influences of Johnston, classic serif typefaces and [[Roman square capitals|Roman inscriptions]] to create a design that looked both cleanly modern and classical at the same time.\n\nMarketed by Monotype as a design of \"classic simplicity and real beauty\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Promotional Poster, 1928|url=http://theredlist.com/wiki-2-343-917-998-view-type-profile-gill-eric.html|website=Red List|publisher=Monotype}}</ref> it was intended as a [[display typeface]] that could be used for posters and advertisements, as well as for the text of documents that need to be clearly legible at small sizes or from a distance, such as book blurbs, timetables and price lists. Designed before setting documents entirely in sans-serif text was common, its standard weight is noticeably bolder than most modern body text fonts.\n\nAn immediate success, the year after its release the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) chose it for all its posters, timetables and publicity material. [[British Rail#Nationalisation in 1948|British Railways]] chose Gill Sans as the basis for its standard lettering when the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|railway companies]] were nationalised in 1948. Gill Sans also soon became used on the modernist, deliberately simple covers of [[Penguin Books]], and was sold up to very large sizes which were often used in British posters and notices of the period. Gill Sans was one of the dominant typefaces in British printing in the years following its release, and remains extremely popular: it has been described as \"the British [[Helvetica]]\" because of its lasting popularity in British design. Gill Sans has influenced many other typefaces, and helped to define a genre of sans-serif, known as the [[Sans-serif#Humanist|humanist]] style.\n\nMonotype rapidly expanded the original regular or medium weight into a large family of styles, which it continues to sell. A basic set is included with some [[Microsoft]] software and [[List of fonts in Mac OS X#System fonts|Mac OS]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Gill Sans compared to other sans-serifs.png|thumb|Gill Sans compared to other sans-serifs of the period. Gill Sans does not use the single-storey \"g\" or \"a\" used by many sans-serifs and is less monoline than Johnston. Its structure is influenced by traditional serif fonts such as Caslon rather than being strongly based on straight lines and circles as Futura is.]]\nThe proportions of Gill Sans stem from [[Roman square capitals|monumental Roman capitals]] in the upper case, and traditional [[Serif#Old-style|\"old-style\"]] serif letters in the lower. This gives Gill Sans a very different style of design to [[Sans-serif#Geometric|geometric]] sans-serifs like [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]], based on simple squares and circles, or [[Sans-serif#Grotesque|realist or grotesque]] designs like [[Akzidenz-Grotesk]], Helvetica and [[Univers]] influenced by nineteenth-century lettering styles.<ref name=\"Tracy2003 general\">{{cite book|first=Walter|last=Tracy|author-link=Walter Tracy|title=Letters of Credit: A View of Type Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y8NssjbqNcsC&pg=PA87|date=January 2003|publisher=D.R.

Some sources of the period distinguish sans-serifs into the \"grotesques\" of the nineteenth century and the modern \"sans-serifs\" of the twentieth, or similar classification structures.}} The J descends below the baseline. The \"O\" is an almost perfect circle and the capital \"M\" is based on the proportions of a square with the middle strokes meeting at the centre; this was not inspired by Roman carving but is very similar to Johnston.<ref name=\"Calligraphic tendencies in the development of sanserif types in the twentieth century\" />{{efn|[[James Mosley|Mosley]] writes that it is \"tempting to speculate\" that this may have been Gill's idea even in the Johnston type, since it does not resemble Johnston's calligraphy, although there are naturally many past precedents for the design in signpainting and type.<ref name=\"Mosley lecture 2015\">{{cite speech\n |title=Lecture on Gill's work\n |first1 =James\n |last1=Mosley\n |event= 'Me & Mr Gill' talk\n |location=Old Truman Brewery, London\n |date=November 10, 2015\n |url= http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/noted-71\n |access-date=\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Italian connection\" />}} The 'E' and 'F' are also relatively narrow.\n\n[[File:Gill Sans exemplar 2.png|thumb|right|Distinctive characters of Gill Sans.]]\nThe influence of traditional serif letters is also clear in the \"two-storey\" lower-case \"a\" and \"g\", unlike that of Futura, and the \"t\" with its curve to bottom right and slanting cut at top left, unlike Futura's which is simply formed from two straight lines.<ref name=\"Rabinowitz2015\">{{cite book|first=Tova|last=Rabinowitz|title=Exploring Typography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xjRBBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA127|date=1 January 2015|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-305-46481-0|pages=127\u20139}}</ref> The lower-case \"a\" also narrows strikingly towards the top of its loop, a common feature of serif designs but rarer in sans-serifs.\n\nFollowing the traditional serif model the [[Italic type|italic]] has different letterforms from the roman, where many sans-serifs simply slant the letters in what is called an [[Oblique type|oblique]] style.

As a young artist, Gill had assisted Johnston in its early development stages. In 1926, [[Douglas Cleverdon]], a young printer-publisher, opened a bookshop in [[Bristol]], and Gill painted a fascia for the shop for him in sans-serif capitals. In addition, Gill sketched an alphabet for Cleverdon as a guide for him to use for future notices and announcements. By this time Gill had become a prominent stonemason, artist and creator of lettering in his own right and had begun to work on creating typeface designs.\n\nGill was commissioned to develop his alphabet into a full metal type family by his friend [[Stanley Morison]], an influential Monotype executive and historian of printing. Morison hoped that it could be Monotype's competitor to a wave of German sans-serif families in a new \"[[Sans-serif#Geometric|geometric]]\" style, which included [[Erbar (typeface)|Erbar]], [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] and [[Kabel (typeface)|Kabel]], all being launched to considerable attention in Germany during the late 1920s. Gill Sans was released in 1928 by Monotype, initially as a set of titling capitals that was quickly followed by a lower-case. Gill's aim was to blend the influences of Johnston, classic serif typefaces and [[Roman square capitals|Roman inscriptions]] to create a design that looked both cleanly modern and classical at the same time.\n\nMarketed by Monotype as a design of \"classic simplicity and real beauty\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Promotional Poster, 1928|url=http://theredlist.com/wiki-2-343-917-998-view-type-profile-gill-eric.html|website=Red List|publisher=Monotype}}</ref> it was intended as a [[display typeface]] that could be used for posters and advertisements, as well as for the text of documents that need to be clearly legible at small sizes or from a distance, such as book blurbs, timetables and price lists. Designed before setting documents entirely in sans-serif text was common, its standard weight is noticeably bolder than most modern body text fonts.\n\nAn immediate success, the year after its release the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (LNER) chose it for all its posters, timetables and publicity material. [[British Rail#Nationalisation in 1948|British Railways]] chose Gill Sans as the basis for its standard lettering when the [[Big Four (British railway companies)|railway companies]] were nationalised in 1948. Gill Sans also soon became used on the modernist, deliberately simple covers of [[Penguin Books]], and was sold up to very large sizes which were often used in British posters and notices of the period. Gill Sans was one of the dominant typefaces in British printing in the years following its release, and remains extremely popular: it has been described as \"the British [[Helvetica]]\" because of its lasting popularity in British design. Gill Sans has influenced many other typefaces, and helped to define a genre of sans-serif, known as the [[Sans-serif#Humanist|humanist]] style.\n\nMonotype rapidly expanded the original regular or medium weight into a large family of styles, which it continues to sell. A basic set is included with some [[Microsoft]] software and [[List of fonts in Mac OS X#System fonts|Mac OS]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Gill Sans compared to other sans-serifs.png|thumb|Gill Sans compared to other sans-serifs of the period.
