On this date in 2005, he was shot and killed during an exchange of gunfire with FBI agents after they surrounded the house in [[Hormigueros, Puerto Rico]] where he was living. The FBI operation was questioned by local Puerto Rican authorities as well as international organizations.\n\nThe killing of Ojeda R\u00edos resonated throughout the Puerto Rican community around the world. Members of the [[Puerto Rican Independence]] movement and Puerto Ricans in general, expressed their indignation through repeated [[protest]]s. The hip hop musical group [[Calle 13]] wrote \"Querido FBI\" (Dear FBI), a song protesting the manner of Ojeda R\u00edos's death. His funeral became an island-wide event, dwarfing the funerals of [[Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn]] and other Puerto Rican statesmen, and was attended by tens of thousands of followers. Members of the [[Partido Nuevo Progresista|statehood movement]] and [[Partido Popular Democratico de Puerto Rico|supporters of the Commonwealth]] also joined in the criticism of the federal handling of the FBI's shooting incident.\n\nIn late March 2006, the [[Puerto Rico Department of Justice]] sued federal authorities, including [[FBI Director]] [[Robert Mueller]] and [[US Attorney General]] [[Alberto Gonzales]], seeking an injunction to force the federal government authorities to provide the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Commonwealth government]] with information related to the operation in which Ojeda R\u00edos died, as well as another FBI operation in which the FBI searched the homes of independence supporters affiliated with Los Macheteros.

It is especially known for publishing an alternative federal budget on an annual basis. The CCPA claims that its estimates of budgetary surpluses have consistently been more accurate than those of the government. The CCPA is a registered charity with the [[Canada Revenue Agency]], and it reported $5.6 million in revenues in 2013.{{Sfn|Beeby|2014a}}{{Sfn|Canada Revenue Agency|2010}} Think tanks such as the CCPA, [[C.&nbsp;D. Howe Institute]], [[Macdonald\u2013Laurier Institute]], [[Fraser Institute]] and [[Montreal Economic Institute]] have charity status in Canada through their work in the advancement of education.{{Sfn|Beeby|2014a}} The CCPA is based in [[Ottawa]] but has branch offices in [[Vancouver]], [[Winnipeg, Manitoba|Winnipeg]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Toronto]] and [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]. It is funded primarily through individual donations, but also receives research grants, and has institutional support from trade unions.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe CCPA was founded in Ottawa in 1980 by a group of largely [[Carleton University]] professors who wished to re-create something akin to the [[League for Social Reconstruction]] (1931-1942) which in the inter-war period had promoted social, economic, and political change for Canada. [[Michael Kelway Oliver]], a former professor of Political Science at [[McGill University|McGill]] and President of [[Carleton University|Carleton]] was the first CCPA president. He was succeeded by Peter Findlay, a professor of Social Work at [[Carleton University|Carleton]]. In 1987 Duncan Cameron, then at the [[University of Ottawa]], became president; he was succeeded by Larry Brown, [[NUPGE]] National President, in 2000.\n\nThe CCPA began with funding from trade unions and individual members. The first Executive Director was Robert Clarke, who was succeeded by Jim Davidson, Sandra Sorensen, Bruce Campbell, and then Peter Bleyer.\n\nIn 1997, the CCPA opened its [[Vancouver]] office with Seth Klein as the British Columbia director. This was followed by [[Winnipeg]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], and [[Toronto]].\n\nThe CCPA publishes books, research studies, reports, and provides media commentary. Its flagship publication is the CCPA Monitor which was founded and previously edited by [[Ed Finn]]. As of 2014, Stuart Trew is senior editor of the Monitor.\n\nInitially housed at 251 Laurier West in Ottawa, the national office is now at 141 Laurier Ave. From modest beginnings, an operating budget of $125,000, and a full-time staff of two, the CCPA began to grow in the late 1980s until today it has a multimillion-dollar budget and a staff of over 20.\n\n== Projects and initiatives ==\n\n=== Alternative federal budget===\nThe CCPA publishes an annual alternative spending plan. In 2012 the CCPA alternative budget argued the federal government could avoid spending cuts by increasing revenue through higher corporate taxes and by creating a new tax bracket for people earning over $250,000.{{Sfn|Tencer|Raj|2012}}\nIn 2014 the CCPA urged the Canadian federal government to \"abandon austerity measures, raise taxes and delay their deficit-killing deadline by a year in order to revive Canada's sluggish economy, lower unemployment and reduce poverty.\" Their report claimed that Canadian corporations have not been investing enough or contributing enough towards the Canadian economy since 2012. Report authors expressed concern about an \"alarming\" rise in [[household debt]].{{Sfn|Babbage|2014}}\n\n===''The Monitor''===\n\nThe CCPA has since May 1994 published a bimonthly national magazine called ''The Monitor''.<ref name=Monitor>{{cite web|title=The Monitor|url=https://www.policyalternatives.ca/monitor/index.php|publisher=Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal \"Tax Freedom Day\" rebuttal ==\nA 2005 study by [[Osgoode Hall]] Law professor and CCPA legal scholar Neil Brooks{{Sfn|Osgoode Hall|2005}} concluded that the [[Fraser Institute]]'s widely promoted personal \"[[Tax Freedom Day]]\" (described as the date each year when the average Canadian's income no longer goes to paying government taxes){{Sfn|Fraser Institute|2011}} included flawed accounting.
