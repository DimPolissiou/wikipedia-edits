He worked as a construction worker and eventually as a construction company owner/operator during Alaska's [[Territory of Alaska|territorial days]]. Following [[World War II]], Hickel became heavily involved with real estate development, building residential subdivisions, shopping centers and hotels.

Hickel's first governorship, the second in the young state's history as well as Alaska's first Republican governorship, oversaw the discovery of oilfields at [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska|Prudhoe Bay]] in 1968, a factor that would prove politically decisive in later years. Hickel, a moderate Republican and environmentalist, did not push for heavy oil exploitation. In 1968, Hickel appointed [[Ted Stevens]] to the United States Senate to replace the recently deceased [[Bob Bartlett]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nLike his predecessor Egan, Hickel sought to improve relations with [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Natives]] in seeking resolutions on Native land claims.

In 1970 following the [[Kent State shootings|shooting of college students]] at [[Kent State University]] by the [[Ohio National Guard]], Hickel wrote a letter critical of Nixon's [[Vietnam War]] policy and urging him to give more respect to the views of young people critical of the war, writing in part, \"I believe this administration finds itself today embracing a philosophy which appears to lack appropriate concern for the attitude of a great mass of Americans \u2013 our young people.\" That dissent garnered worldwide media attention, and on November 25, 1970, Hickel was fired over the letter.

Following a contentious meeting between Sturgulewski and prominent conservative Republicans held in the home of [[David Cuddy]], Coghill felt that it was impossible to continue to run on the ticket with Sturgulewski. After Coghill met first with Hickel and then with [[Edgar Paul Boyko]], the idea was hatched to run a [[slate (elections)|slate]] of Hickel and Coghill under the [[Alaskan Independence Party]] banner.

Hickel's first governorship, the second in the young state's history as well as Alaska's first Republican governorship, oversaw the discovery of oilfields at [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska|Prudhoe Bay]] in 1968, a factor that would prove politically decisive in later years. Hickel, a moderate Republican and environmentalist, did not push for heavy oil exploitation. In 1968, Hickel appointed [[Ted Stevens]] to the United States Senate to replace the recently deceased [[Bob Bartlett]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nLike his predecessor Egan, Hickel sought to improve relations with [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Natives]] in seeking resolutions on Native land claims.

In 1970 following the [[Kent State shootings|shooting of college students]] at [[Kent State University]] by the [[Ohio National Guard]], Hickel wrote a letter critical of Nixon's [[Vietnam War]] policy and urging him to give more respect to the views of young people critical of the war, writing in part, \"I believe this administration finds itself today embracing a philosophy which appears to lack appropriate concern for the attitude of a great mass of Americans \u2013 our young people.\" That dissent garnered worldwide media attention, and on November 25, 1970, Hickel was fired over the letter.

After Coghill met first with Hickel and then with [[Edgar Paul Boyko]], the idea was hatched to run a [[slate (elections)|slate]] of Hickel and Coghill under the [[Alaskan Independence Party]] banner.
