In 1978, Georgia Tech joined another Southern Conference offshoot, the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], for all sports, where it has remained ever since.\n* [[Tulane University]] left the SEC in 1966.

The two new members began SEC competition with the 1991\u20131992 basketball season.\n\nAt the same time, the SEC organized competition for some sports into two divisions. The Western Division comprised six of the seven member schools in the [[Central Time Zone]], while the Eastern Division comprised the five member schools in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] plus Vanderbilt, which is in the Central Time Zone but was placed in the Eastern Division to preserve its rivalry with Tennessee. Initially, the divisional format was used in football, baseball, and men's basketball. The divisional format was dropped for men's basketball following the 2011\u20132012 season.\n\nFollowing expansion, the SEC was the first conference to receive permission from the NCAA to sponsor an annual [[SEC Championship Game|football championship game]] that did not count against NCAA limits on regular-season contests, featuring the winners of the conference's Eastern and Western divisions.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?change_well_id=9993&s |title=About the Southeastern Conference |publisher=Secsports.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317103552/http://www.secsports.com/index.php?change_well_id=9993&s |archivedate=March 17, 2009 }}</ref> The [[1992 SEC Championship Game|1992]] and [[1993 SEC Championship Game|1993]] championship games were held at [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham, and all championship games from [[1994 SEC Championship Game|1994]] onward have been held in [[Atlanta]]\u2014first at the [[Georgia Dome]] until its closure and demolition after the 2016 season, and since 2017 at [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]].<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n===2012 expansion===\n{{See also|2010\u201312 Southeastern Conference realignment}}\n\nOn September 25, 2011, the SEC Presidents and Chancellors, acting unanimously, announced that [[Texas A&M University]] would join the SEC effective July 1, 2012, with Texas A&M to begin competition in nineteen of the twenty sports sponsored by the SEC during the 2012\u201313 academic year.<ref>\"[http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/228257/texas-am-to-join-southeastern-conference.aspx Texas A&M To Join Southeastern Conference]\", SECSports.com (September 25, 2011).

Prior to that, the number of conference games teams played ranged from four to eight, but most played a 6-{{nbsp}} or 7-game schedule. The league adopted a uniform 6-game schedule from 1974 to 1987, and added a seventh conference game from 1988 to 1991. Through this period and through the earlier years each SEC school had five permanent opponents, developing some traditional rivalries between schools, and the other games rotated around the other members of the conference.\n\nAfter expansion to twelve programs in 1992, the SEC went to an 8-game conference schedule, with each team playing the five other teams in their division and three opponents from the other division. The winners of the two divisions would then meet in the [[SEC Championship Game]].\n\nFrom 1992 through 2002, each team had two permanent inter-divisional opponents, allowing many traditional rivalries from the pre-expansion era (such as Florida vs. Auburn, Kentucky vs. LSU, and Vanderbilt vs. Alabama) to continue. However, complaints from some league athletic directors about imbalance in the schedule (for instance, Auburn's two permanent opponents from the East were Florida and Georgia \u2013 two of the SEC's stronger football programs at the time \u2013 while Mississippi State played Kentucky and South Carolina every year) led to the SEC reducing the number of permanent inter-division opponents to one starting in the 2003 season. The TV networks televising SEC games were also pressuring for the change so attractive match-ups between non-traditional opponents would happen twice every five years instead of twice every eight years. With the subsequent expansion to 14 members in 2012, non-permanent cross-division opponents face each other in the regular season twice in a span of twelve years.\n\nUnder the current format, each school plays a total of eight conference games, consisting of the other six teams in its division, one school from the other division on a rotating basis, and one school from the other division that it plays each year. The permanent cross-division matchups are: [[Third Saturday in October|Alabama\u2013Tennessee]]; [[Battle Line Rivalry|Arkansas\u2013Missouri]]; [[Deep South's Oldest Rivalry|Auburn\u2013Georgia]]; [[Florida\u2013LSU football rivalry|LSU\u2013Florida]]; Mississippi State\u2013Kentucky; [[Ole Miss\u2013Vanderbilt football rivalry|Ole Miss\u2013Vanderbilt]]; [[South Carolina\u2013Texas A&M football rivalry|Texas A&M\u2013South Carolina]].\n\nThe current scheduling arrangement was originally set to expire after the 2015 season, but the SEC presidents voted 10\u20134<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/lsu/index.ssf/2014/04/sec_sticking_with_eight_game_f.html |title=LSU AD Joe Alleva blasts SEC decision on permanent cross-division foes in football |first=Jim |last=Kleinpeter |newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]] |location=[[New Orleans]] |date=April 27, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> in April 2014 to keep the current format for an additional six to eight seasons beyond 2015.<ref name=\"SEC 2016 FB schedules\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/250851/sec-announces-format-for-future-football-schedules.aspx |title=SEC Announces Format For Future Conference Schedules |publisher=Southeastern Conference |date=April 27, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, beginning in 2016, SEC teams will be required to schedule at least one opponent each season from the other so-called \"Power Five\" conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, or Pac-12); games against [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|football independent]] schools also qualify, including [[Army Black Knights football|Army]], [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]], and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]].<ref name=\"SEC 2016 FB schedules\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/sec-announces-continuation-of-8-game-conference-schedule-004745559.html |title=SEC to continue eight-game conference schedule |first=Nick |last=Bromberg |work=Dr. Saturday |publisher=Yahoo!

Men's basketball formerly used the East/West divisional alignment for regular-season scheduling and seeding the conference tournament, but it no longer does.\n\nBefore expansion to 14 teams, the conference schedule was 16 games. Although the divisions were eliminated beginning with the 2011\u201312 season, that season's schedule was still set according to the divisional alignments, with each team facing each team from its own division twice and each team from the opposite division once. As part of the proposal by SEC head coaches that led to the scrapping of the divisional structure, a task force of four coaches and four athletic directors was set to discuss future conference scheduling.

Each school had one permanent opponent that it played home and away every season, and faced four other opponents in a home-and-home series during a given season, and then the remaining teams one each (four home, four away). The permanent opponents were Alabama-Auburn, Arkansas-Missouri, Florida-Kentucky, Georgia-South Carolina, LSU-Texas A&M, Ole Miss-Mississippi State, and Tennessee-Vanderbilt. The home-and-home opponents, apart from the permanent opponent, rotated each season.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/235185/sec-mens-basketball-scheduletournament-formats.aspx |title=SEC Men's Basketball Schedule/Tournament Formats |publisher=Southeastern Conference |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 SEC spring meetings saw a further change to the scheduling format. While the athletic directors voted to stay with an 18-game conference schedule, they increased the number of permanent opponents for each school from one to three. Each school retained its permanent opponent from the 2012\u20132014 period while adding two others.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/251321/sec-spring-meetings-tuesday-notebook.aspx |title=SEC Spring Meetings \u2013 Tuesday Notebook |publisher=Southeastern Conference |date=May 27, 2014 |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1966-67, following Tulane's departure, through 1990-91, the year prior to the addition of Arkansas and South Carolina, teams played a double round-robin, 18-game conference schedule. No team was undefeated in this period, though three teams went 17\u20131 (Kentucky in 1970 and 1986, LSU in 1981). During the period from 1992 to 2012 when the league slate was 16 games, Kentucky went undefeated in SEC play in 1996, 2003, and 2012 (although only the 2003 team went on to win the conference tournament).\n\nSince the return to an 18-game conference schedule following the 2012 conference expansion, two teams have gone undefeated in SEC play: Florida in 2013\u201314 and Kentucky in 2014\u201315.\n\n===Scheduling partners===\nThe table below lists each school's permanent men's basketball-only scheduling partners beginning in 2014-15.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| School\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Partner 1\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Partner 2\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Partner 3\n|-\n| Alabama\n| Auburn\n| LSU\n| Mississippi State\n|-\n| Arkansas\n| LSU\n| Missouri\n| Texas A&M\n|-\n| Auburn\n| Alabama\n| Georgia \n| Ole Miss\n|-\n| Florida\n| Georgia\n| Kentucky\n| Vanderbilt\n|-\n| Georgia\n| Auburn\n| Florida\n| South Carolina\n|-\n| Kentucky\n| Florida\n| Tennessee\n| Vanderbilt\n|-\n| LSU\n| Alabama\n| Arkansas\n| Texas A&M\n|-\n| Ole Miss\n| Mississippi State\n| Auburn\n| Missouri\n|-\n| Mississippi State\n| Alabama\n| Ole Miss\n| South Carolina\n|-\n| Missouri\n| Arkansas\n| Ole Miss\n| Texas A&M\n|-\n| South Carolina\n| Georgia\n| Mississippi State\n| Tennessee\n|-\n| Tennessee\n| Kentucky\n| South Carolina\n| Vanderbilt\n|-\n| Texas A&M\n| Arkansas\n| LSU\n| Missouri\n|-\n| Vanderbilt\n| Kentucky\n| Tennessee\n| Florida\n|}\n\n===Basketball tournament===\n{{Main|SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|}}\nThe ''[[SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]]'' (also known simply as the ''[[SEC Tournament]]'') is the competition that determines the SEC's automatic bid to the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA men's basketball tournament]].

the Southeastern Conference. Various other awards, such as the best tournament player in the [[SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|SEC Tournament]] and all conference honors are given out throughout the year.\n\n==Baseball==\n{{See also|SEC Baseball Tournament}}\n\nSchools play a 30-game league schedule (10 three-game series). From 1996 through 2012, schools played all five schools within their division and five of the six schools from the opposite division. With the addition of Missouri and Texas A&M, schools will now miss three opponents from the opposite division in a given season.\n\nSince 1990, the SEC has become the most successful conference on the college baseball diamond. That year, Georgia captured the conference's first national championship at the [[College World Series]]. Following that, LSU won six of the next 19 titles, including five of ten between 1991 and 2000 and its sixth title in 2009. This was followed by South Carolina winning back-to-back titles in 2010 and 2011, Vanderbilt winning its first title in 2014, Florida winning its first title in 2017, and Vanderbilt winning again in 2019. During that same span, nine teams have also been runners-up at the CWS. The CWS final series has featured two SEC teams in 1997, 2011, and 2017. The only current SEC member that has never appeared in the CWS is [[Kentucky Wildcats baseball|Kentucky]]. Among other current SEC members, only [[Missouri Tigers baseball|Missouri]] has not appeared in the CWS while a member of the SEC (and has yet to make the NCAA tournament as an SEC member), although it made six CWS appearances in the 1950s and 1960s while in the [[Big Eight Conference]]. Both Georgia Tech and Tulane have made appearances in the CWS after leaving the SEC.\n\nSEC teams have also become leaders in total and average attendance over the years. In 2010 five of the top six drawing programs hailed from the SEC. Six more teams placed in the top 35 nationally.\n\nThe NCAA automatic berth is given to the winner of the SEC Baseball Tournament, which was first started in 1977. It is a double-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season records. Since 1998, the tournament has been held at [[Hoover Metropolitan Stadium]] in [[Hoover, Alabama]] and contested under the format used at the [[College World Series]] from 1988 through 2002, with two four-team brackets leading to a single championship game. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament]].\n\nSEC presidents and athletic directors voted to expand the SEC Tournament to ten teams starting in 2012. The division winners received a bye on the first day of competition, and the tournament became single-elimination after the field is pared to four teams.\n\nWith the addition of Missouri and Texas A&M for the 2013 baseball season, the tournament was expanded to twelve teams. The top four seeds receive a bye on the first day, with seeds 5-12 playing single elimination. The tournament is double-elimination for the next three days, then reverts to single elimination when four teams are remaining.\n\nIn addition to the winner of the SEC Baseball Tournament, the Southeastern Conference usually gets several at-large bids to the NCAA Tournament. Many teams have qualified for the NCAA Tournament despite failing to win a game in the SEC Tournament. One of those, Mississippi State, went 0-2 in the 2007 SEC Tournament, but reached the College World Series in 2007.\n\n===College World Series champions, runners-up and scores===\nNote: Teams in '''bold''' are current SEC members who advanced to the CWS while in the conference.

On several occasions match-ups between the two have drawn national record-setting attendances. Tulane reached its first [[College World Series]] in 2001 by defeating LSU in three games in the NCAA Super Regional. In 2002, the Tigers and Green Wave drew an NCAA regular season record crowd of 27,673 to the [[Louisiana Superdome]].\n* [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU]]\u2013[[Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball|Mississippi State]]\n:Before the arrival of [[Skip Bertman]] as LSU's baseball coach in 1984, Mississippi State had long dominated the conference in baseball, with most of that success coming under coach [[Ron Polk]], who returned to coach the Bulldogs in 2002 after retiring in 1997. When Bertman arrived in Baton Rouge, LSU's long-dormant program took off, winning eleven SEC championships and five [[College World Series]] championships between 1984 and 2001.\n* [[South Carolina Gamecocks baseball|South Carolina]]\u2013[[Clemson Tigers|Clemson]]\n:This instate rivalry is an intense local affair, with the Gamecocks and Tigers meeting each regular season, and has gained national prominence as both teams are often ranked in the top ten nationally. The highlights of the rivalry include the [[2002 College World Series|2002]] and [[2010 College World Series|2010]] meetings in the final four of the [[College World Series]]. Each time, South Carolina emerged from the losers bracket to beat Clemson twice and advance to the national championship series.\n* [[South Carolina Gamecocks baseball|South Carolina]]\u2013[[North Carolina Tar Heels baseball|North Carolina]]\n:The Gamecocks and Tar Heels met five times in the NCAA tournament between 2002 and 2013, including the [[2002 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2002 NCAA Regional]], [[2003 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2003 NCAA Super Regional]], [[2004 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2004 NCAA Regional]] and [[2013 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2013 NCAA Regional]], with the Gamecocks holding a 3\u20132 edge.\n\n==Women's basketball==\nThe SEC has historically been the most dominant conference in women's basketball.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/women/news/2000/11/17/sec_one/ |title=As Strong As Ever |last=Traub |first=Seth |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604092803/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/women/news/2000/11/17/sec_one/ |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |date=November 17, 2000 |publisher=CNNSI.com |url-status=live }}</ref> Since the 2009\u201310 season, teams have played a 16-game conference schedule with a single league table; prior to that time the conference schedule was 14 games, again in a single table.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdispatch.com/sports/article.asp?aid=5083 |title=SEC women's schedule affects seedings for tournament |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |date=March 3, 2010 |work=The Starkville Dispatch |last=Minichino |first=Adam |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708130712/http://www.cdispatch.com/sports/article.asp?aid=5083 |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Like SEC men's basketball, women's basketball used the divisional alignment for scheduling purposes through the 2011\u201312 season; however, the women's scheduling format was significantly different from the men's.

Arkansas and LSU are no longer permanent opponents, with the Razorbacks picking up Missouri and the Lady Tigers picking up Texas A&M. The other permanent opponents are the same as men's basketball, except for Florida-Georgia and Kentucky-South Carolina (both pairs had been permanent women's basketball opponents before the 2012 expansion).

Like the men's version, it is a single-elimination tournament involving all conference members, with seeding based on regular season records. With the expansion to 14 schools, the bottom four teams in the conference standings play opening-round games, and the top four receive \"double byes\" into the quarterfinals. The winner earns the conference's automatic bid to the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship|NCAA women's basketball tournament]]. Also paralleling the men's tournament, the women's tournament does not determine the SEC champion; that honor has been awarded based on regular-season record since the 1985\u201386 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/Portals/3/SEC%20Website/wbasketball/2012-13_sec_wbb_guide.pdf |title=Championships: SEC Champions |work=2012\u201313 SEC Women's Basketball Media Guide |publisher=Southeastern Conference |format=PDF |page=88 |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |quote=From 1980 to 1985, the SEC champion was the winner of the SEC Tournament.

The two most frequent sites for the tournament have been [[McKenzie Arena]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] (seven times) and the [[Albany Civic Center]] in [[Albany, Georgia]] (six times); however, the tournament was last played in Albany in 1992 and Chattanooga in 2000. Because demand for women's tournament tickets is generally lower than for the men's tournament, it is typically played in a smaller venue than the men's tournament in the same season. The most frequent venues since 2000 have been Bridgestone Arena in Nashville (five times), [[Infinite Energy Arena]] in [[Duluth, Georgia]] (four), and [[Simmons Bank Arena]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas]] (four).\n\n===NCAA tournament champions, runners-up and locations===\n''\u2020 denotes overtime games.

basketball|UConn]]\n{{See also|Tennessee\u2013UConn women's basketball rivalry}}\n:The Lady Vols have historically been one of the nation's dominant programs in that sport. Starting in the mid-1990s, UConn has emerged as Tennessee's main rival for national prominence. The Huskies won four national titles between 2000 and 2004; in three of those years, their opponent in the NCAA final was Tennessee. Connecticut also defeated Tennessee in the 1995 Championship game, the Huskies' first-ever title. The [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] brokered a deal that will see the teams renew their rivalry with a home-and-home series in 2020 and 2021.\n\n==Other sports==\nBesides football, basketball, and baseball, there are a number of other sports in which the Southeastern Conference actively competes.\n\n===Rivalries===\n* [[Alabama Crimson Tide women's gymnastics|Alabama]]&ndash;[[Georgia Gym Dogs|Georgia]], women's gymnastics{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n:These two storied programs have often butted heads for not only SEC titles, but NCAA titles as well. Georgia has won ten national championships to Alabama's six. For decades the rivalry was dominated by the two long standing coaches of the two schools, [[Suzanne Yoculan]] of Georgia and [[Sarah Patterson (coach)|Sarah Patterson]] of Alabama. Yoculan and Patterson have since retired, bringing their personal rivalry to an end.\n* [[University of Alabama athletics|Alabama]]&ndash;[[University of Florida|Florida]], women's softball{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n:These two nationally acclaimed softball programs have proven to be the elite of the SEC and the nation. While consistently being ranked in the nation's Top Ten, both teams find their way to the SEC Tournament Finals and often clash once more in the Women's College Softball World Series.\n* [[Tennessee Volunteers softball|Tennessee]]&ndash;[[Louisiana State Tigers softball|LSU]], women's softball\n* [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn]]&ndash;[[Texas Longhorns|Texas]], men's swimming and diving{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n:One of the youngest rivalries featuring an SEC team, the Tigers and Texas Longhorns are the two most successful swimming and diving programs in the country. The two have combined for 17 NCAA National Titles since 1981 (nine for Texas, eight for Auburn) and between 1999 and 2007 won every national title awarded. The two regularly face off in a meet during the regular season, Auburn's men own a 12\u20139 record over the Longhorns. The women just recently began an annual series, with the Tigers winning the series so far 3\u20131.

Prior to 1992, championships for major college football were determined by a \"consensus\" of major polling services, including the [[AP Poll|Associated Press]] and [[United Press International]] college football polls. Recognized [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women championships|women's championships]] from 1972 to 1982 were administered by the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] (AIAW), not the NCAA. There was a one-year overlap period during the 1981\u201382 school year, when both the AIAW and the NCAA operated women's championship tournaments; since 1982, only the NCAA has sponsored women's championship tournaments. National equestrian tournament championships are currently sponsored by the [[National Collegiate Equestrian Association]] (NCEA), not the NCAA. Those national championships dating from before 1933 predate the founding of the SEC in December 1932; championships won by Arkansas and South Carolina before the 1992\u201393 school year predate

In 1978, Georgia Tech joined another Southern Conference offshoot, the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], for all sports, where it has remained ever since.\n* [[Tulane University]] left the SEC in 1966.

The two new members began SEC competition with the 1991\u20131992 basketball season.\n\nAt the same time, the SEC organized competition for some sports into two divisions. The Western Division comprised six of the seven member schools in the [[Central Time Zone]], while the Eastern Division comprised the five member schools in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] plus Vanderbilt, which is in the Central Time Zone but was placed in the Eastern Division to preserve its rivalry with Tennessee. Initially, the divisional format was used in football, baseball, and men's basketball. The divisional format was dropped for men's basketball following the 2011\u20132012 season.\n\nFollowing expansion, the SEC was the first conference to receive permission from the NCAA to sponsor an annual [[SEC Championship Game|football championship game]] that did not count against NCAA limits on regular-season contests, featuring the winners of the conference's Eastern and Western divisions.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?change_well_id=9993&s |title=About the Southeastern Conference |publisher=Secsports.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317103552/http://www.secsports.com/index.php?change_well_id=9993&s |archivedate=March 17, 2009 }}</ref> The [[1992 SEC Championship Game|1992]] and [[1993 SEC Championship Game|1993]] championship games were held at [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham, and all championship games from [[1994 SEC Championship Game|1994]] onward have been held in [[Atlanta]]\u2014first at the [[Georgia Dome]] until its closure and demolition after the 2016 season, and since 2017 at [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]].<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\n===2012 expansion===\n{{See also|2010\u201312 Southeastern Conference realignment}}\n\nOn September 25, 2011, the SEC Presidents and Chancellors, acting unanimously, announced that [[Texas A&M University]] would join the SEC effective July 1, 2012, with Texas A&M to begin competition in nineteen of the twenty sports sponsored by the SEC during the 2012\u201313 academic year.<ref>\"[http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/228257/texas-am-to-join-southeastern-conference.aspx Texas A&M To Join Southeastern Conference]\", SECSports.com (September 25, 2011).

Prior to that, the number of conference games teams played ranged from four to eight, but most played a 6-{{nbsp}} or 7-game schedule. The league adopted a uniform 6-game schedule from 1974 to 1987, and added a seventh conference game from 1988 to 1991. Through this period and through the earlier years each SEC school had five permanent opponents, developing some traditional rivalries between schools, and the other games rotated around the other members of the conference.\n\nAfter expansion to twelve programs in 1992, the SEC went to an 8-game conference schedule, with each team playing the five other teams in their division and three opponents from the other division. The winners of the two divisions would then meet in the [[SEC Championship Game]].\n\nFrom 1992 through 2002, each team had two permanent inter-divisional opponents, allowing many traditional rivalries from the pre-expansion era (such as Florida vs. Auburn, Kentucky vs. LSU, and Vanderbilt vs. Alabama) to continue. However, complaints from some league athletic directors about imbalance in the schedule (for instance, Auburn's two permanent opponents from the East were Florida and Georgia \u2013 two of the SEC's stronger football programs at the time \u2013 while Mississippi State played Kentucky and South Carolina every year) led to the SEC reducing the number of permanent inter-division opponents to one starting in the 2003 season. The TV networks televising SEC games were also pressuring for the change so attractive match-ups between non-traditional opponents would happen twice every five years instead of twice every eight years. With the subsequent expansion to 14 members in 2012, non-permanent cross-division opponents face each other in the regular season twice in a span of twelve years.\n\nUnder the current format, each school plays a total of eight conference games, consisting of the other six teams in its division, one school from the other division on a rotating basis, and one school from the other division that it plays each year. The permanent cross-division matchups are: [[Third Saturday in October|Alabama\u2013Tennessee]]; [[Battle Line Rivalry|Arkansas\u2013Missouri]]; [[Deep South's Oldest Rivalry|Auburn\u2013Georgia]]; [[Florida\u2013LSU football rivalry|LSU\u2013Florida]]; Mississippi State\u2013Kentucky; [[Ole Miss\u2013Vanderbilt football rivalry|Ole Miss\u2013Vanderbilt]]; [[South Carolina\u2013Texas A&M football rivalry|Texas A&M\u2013South Carolina]].\n\nThe current scheduling arrangement was originally set to expire after the 2015 season, but the SEC presidents voted 10\u20134<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/lsu/index.ssf/2014/04/sec_sticking_with_eight_game_f.html |title=LSU AD Joe Alleva blasts SEC decision on permanent cross-division foes in football |first=Jim |last=Kleinpeter |newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]] |location=[[New Orleans]] |date=April 27, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> in April 2014 to keep the current format for an additional six to eight seasons beyond 2015.<ref name=\"SEC 2016 FB schedules\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/250851/sec-announces-format-for-future-football-schedules.aspx |title=SEC Announces Format For Future Conference Schedules |publisher=Southeastern Conference |date=April 27, 2014 |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> Additionally, beginning in 2016, SEC teams will be required to schedule at least one opponent each season from the other so-called \"Power Five\" conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, or Pac-12); games against [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|football independent]] schools also qualify, including [[Army Black Knights football|Army]], [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]], and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]].<ref name=\"SEC 2016 FB schedules\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/sec-announces-continuation-of-8-game-conference-schedule-004745559.html |title=SEC to continue eight-game conference schedule |first=Nick |last=Bromberg |work=Dr. Saturday |publisher=Yahoo!

Men's basketball formerly used the East/West divisional alignment for regular-season scheduling and seeding the conference tournament, but it no longer does.\n\nBefore expansion to 14 teams, the conference schedule was 16 games. Although the divisions were eliminated beginning with the 2011\u201312 season, that season's schedule was still set according to the divisional alignments, with each team facing each team from its own division twice and each team from the opposite division once. As part of the proposal by SEC head coaches that led to the scrapping of the divisional structure, a task force of four coaches and four athletic directors was set to discuss future conference scheduling.

Each school had one permanent opponent that it played home and away every season, and faced four other opponents in a home-and-home series during a given season, and then the remaining teams one each (four home, four away). The permanent opponents were Alabama-Auburn, Arkansas-Missouri, Florida-Kentucky, Georgia-South Carolina, LSU-Texas A&M, Ole Miss-Mississippi State, and Tennessee-Vanderbilt. The home-and-home opponents, apart from the permanent opponent, rotated each season.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/235185/sec-mens-basketball-scheduletournament-formats.aspx |title=SEC Men's Basketball Schedule/Tournament Formats |publisher=Southeastern Conference |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=June 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe 2014 SEC spring meetings saw a further change to the scheduling format. While the athletic directors voted to stay with an 18-game conference schedule, they increased the number of permanent opponents for each school from one to three. Each school retained its permanent opponent from the 2012\u20132014 period while adding two others.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/NEWS/tabid/473/Article/251321/sec-spring-meetings-tuesday-notebook.aspx |title=SEC Spring Meetings \u2013 Tuesday Notebook |publisher=Southeastern Conference |date=May 27, 2014 |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1966-67, following Tulane's departure, through 1990-91, the year prior to the addition of Arkansas and South Carolina, teams played a double round-robin, 18-game conference schedule. No team was undefeated in this period, though three teams went 17\u20131 (Kentucky in 1970 and 1986, LSU in 1981). During the period from 1992 to 2012 when the league slate was 16 games, Kentucky went undefeated in SEC play in 1996, 2003, and 2012 (although only the 2003 team went on to win the conference tournament).\n\nSince the return to an 18-game conference schedule following the 2012 conference expansion, two teams have gone undefeated in SEC play: Florida in 2013\u201314 and Kentucky in 2014\u201315.\n\n===Scheduling partners===\nThe table below lists each school's permanent men's basketball-only scheduling partners beginning in 2014-15.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| School\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Partner 1\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Partner 2\n! style=\"width:200px;\"| Partner 3\n|-\n| Alabama\n| Auburn\n| LSU\n| Mississippi State\n|-\n| Arkansas\n| LSU\n| Missouri\n| Texas A&M\n|-\n| Auburn\n| Alabama\n| Georgia \n| Ole Miss\n|-\n| Florida\n| Georgia\n| Kentucky\n| Vanderbilt\n|-\n| Georgia\n| Auburn\n| Florida\n| South Carolina\n|-\n| Kentucky\n| Florida\n| Tennessee\n| Vanderbilt\n|-\n| LSU\n| Alabama\n| Arkansas\n| Texas A&M\n|-\n| Ole Miss\n| Mississippi State\n| Auburn\n| Missouri\n|-\n| Mississippi State\n| Alabama\n| Ole Miss\n| South Carolina\n|-\n| Missouri\n| Arkansas\n| Ole Miss\n| Texas A&M\n|-\n| South Carolina\n| Georgia\n| Mississippi State\n| Tennessee\n|-\n| Tennessee\n| Kentucky\n| South Carolina\n| Vanderbilt\n|-\n| Texas A&M\n| Arkansas\n| LSU\n| Missouri\n|-\n| Vanderbilt\n| Kentucky\n| Tennessee\n| Florida\n|}\n\n===Basketball tournament===\n{{Main|SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|}}\nThe ''[[SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]]'' (also known simply as the ''[[SEC Tournament]]'') is the competition that determines the SEC's automatic bid to the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA men's basketball tournament]].

the Southeastern Conference. Various other awards, such as the best tournament player in the [[SEC Men's Basketball Tournament|SEC Tournament]] and all conference honors are given out throughout the year.\n\n==Baseball==\n{{See also|SEC Baseball Tournament}}\n\nSchools play a 30-game league schedule (10 three-game series). From 1996 through 2012, schools played all five schools within their division and five of the six schools from the opposite division. With the addition of Missouri and Texas A&M, schools will now miss three opponents from the opposite division in a given season.\n\nSince 1990, the SEC has become the most successful conference on the college baseball diamond. That year, Georgia captured the conference's first national championship at the [[College World Series]]. Following that, LSU won six of the next 19 titles, including five of ten between 1991 and 2000 and its sixth title in 2009. This was followed by South Carolina winning back-to-back titles in 2010 and 2011, Vanderbilt winning its first title in 2014, Florida winning its first title in 2017, and Vanderbilt winning again in 2019. During that same span, nine teams have also been runners-up at the CWS. The CWS final series has featured two SEC teams in 1997, 2011, and 2017. The only current SEC member that has never appeared in the CWS is [[Kentucky Wildcats baseball|Kentucky]]. Among other current SEC members, only [[Missouri Tigers baseball|Missouri]] has not appeared in the CWS while a member of the SEC (and has yet to make the NCAA tournament as an SEC member), although it made six CWS appearances in the 1950s and 1960s while in the [[Big Eight Conference]]. Both Georgia Tech and Tulane have made appearances in the CWS after leaving the SEC.\n\nSEC teams have also become leaders in total and average attendance over the years. In 2010 five of the top six drawing programs hailed from the SEC. Six more teams placed in the top 35 nationally.\n\nThe NCAA automatic berth is given to the winner of the SEC Baseball Tournament, which was first started in 1977. It is a double-elimination tournament and seeding is based on regular season records. Since 1998, the tournament has been held at [[Hoover Metropolitan Stadium]] in [[Hoover, Alabama]] and contested under the format used at the [[College World Series]] from 1988 through 2002, with two four-team brackets leading to a single championship game. The winner receives the conference's automatic bid to the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament]].\n\nSEC presidents and athletic directors voted to expand the SEC Tournament to ten teams starting in 2012. The division winners received a bye on the first day of competition, and the tournament became single-elimination after the field is pared to four teams.\n\nWith the addition of Missouri and Texas A&M for the 2013 baseball season, the tournament was expanded to twelve teams. The top four seeds receive a bye on the first day, with seeds 5-12 playing single elimination. The tournament is double-elimination for the next three days, then reverts to single elimination when four teams are remaining.\n\nIn addition to the winner of the SEC Baseball Tournament, the Southeastern Conference usually gets several at-large bids to the NCAA Tournament. Many teams have qualified for the NCAA Tournament despite failing to win a game in the SEC Tournament. One of those, Mississippi State, went 0-2 in the 2007 SEC Tournament, but reached the College World Series in 2007.\n\n===College World Series champions, runners-up and scores===\nNote: Teams in '''bold''' are current SEC members who advanced to the CWS while in the conference.

On several occasions match-ups between the two have drawn national record-setting attendances. Tulane reached its first [[College World Series]] in 2001 by defeating LSU in three games in the NCAA Super Regional. In 2002, the Tigers and Green Wave drew an NCAA regular season record crowd of 27,673 to the [[Louisiana Superdome]].\n* [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU]]\u2013[[Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball|Mississippi State]]\n:Before the arrival of [[Skip Bertman]] as LSU's baseball coach in 1984, Mississippi State had long dominated the conference in baseball, with most of that success coming under coach [[Ron Polk]], who returned to coach the Bulldogs in 2002 after retiring in 1997. When Bertman arrived in Baton Rouge, LSU's long-dormant program took off, winning eleven SEC championships and five [[College World Series]] championships between 1984 and 2001.\n* [[South Carolina Gamecocks baseball|South Carolina]]\u2013[[Clemson Tigers|Clemson]]\n:This instate rivalry is an intense local affair, with the Gamecocks and Tigers meeting each regular season, and has gained national prominence as both teams are often ranked in the top ten nationally. The highlights of the rivalry include the [[2002 College World Series|2002]] and [[2010 College World Series|2010]] meetings in the final four of the [[College World Series]]. Each time, South Carolina emerged from the losers bracket to beat Clemson twice and advance to the national championship series.\n* [[South Carolina Gamecocks baseball|South Carolina]]\u2013[[North Carolina Tar Heels baseball|North Carolina]]\n:The Gamecocks and Tar Heels met five times in the NCAA tournament between 2002 and 2013, including the [[2002 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2002 NCAA Regional]], [[2003 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2003 NCAA Super Regional]], [[2004 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2004 NCAA Regional]] and [[2013 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|2013 NCAA Regional]], with the Gamecocks holding a 3\u20132 edge.\n\n==Women's basketball==\nThe SEC has historically been the most dominant conference in women's basketball.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/women/news/2000/11/17/sec_one/ |title=As Strong As Ever |last=Traub |first=Seth |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604092803/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/college/women/news/2000/11/17/sec_one/ |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |date=November 17, 2000 |publisher=CNNSI.com |url-status=live }}</ref> Since the 2009\u201310 season, teams have played a 16-game conference schedule with a single league table; prior to that time the conference schedule was 14 games, again in a single table.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cdispatch.com/sports/article.asp?aid=5083 |title=SEC women's schedule affects seedings for tournament |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |date=March 3, 2010 |work=The Starkville Dispatch |last=Minichino |first=Adam |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708130712/http://www.cdispatch.com/sports/article.asp?aid=5083 |archive-date=July 8, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Like SEC men's basketball, women's basketball used the divisional alignment for scheduling purposes through the 2011\u201312 season; however, the women's scheduling format was significantly different from the men's.

Arkansas and LSU are no longer permanent opponents, with the Razorbacks picking up Missouri and the Lady Tigers picking up Texas A&M. The other permanent opponents are the same as men's basketball, except for Florida-Georgia and Kentucky-South Carolina (both pairs had been permanent women's basketball opponents before the 2012 expansion).

Like the men's version, it is a single-elimination tournament involving all conference members, with seeding based on regular season records. With the expansion to 14 schools, the bottom four teams in the conference standings play opening-round games, and the top four receive \"double byes\" into the quarterfinals. The winner earns the conference's automatic bid to the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship|NCAA women's basketball tournament]]. Also paralleling the men's tournament, the women's tournament does not determine the SEC champion; that honor has been awarded based on regular-season record since the 1985\u201386 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secdigitalnetwork.com/Portals/3/SEC%20Website/wbasketball/2012-13_sec_wbb_guide.pdf |title=Championships: SEC Champions |work=2012\u201313 SEC Women's Basketball Media Guide |publisher=Southeastern Conference |format=PDF |page=88 |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |quote=From 1980 to 1985, the SEC champion was the winner of the SEC Tournament.

The two most frequent sites for the tournament have been [[McKenzie Arena]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] (seven times) and the [[Albany Civic Center]] in [[Albany, Georgia]] (six times); however, the tournament was last played in Albany in 1992 and Chattanooga in 2000. Because demand for women's tournament tickets is generally lower than for the men's tournament, it is typically played in a smaller venue than the men's tournament in the same season. The most frequent venues since 2000 have been Bridgestone Arena in Nashville (five times), [[Infinite Energy Arena]] in [[Duluth, Georgia]] (four), and [[Simmons Bank Arena]] in [[North Little Rock, Arkansas]] (four).\n\n===NCAA tournament champions, runners-up and locations===\n''\u2020 denotes overtime games.

basketball|UConn]]\n{{See also|Tennessee\u2013UConn women's basketball rivalry}}\n:The Lady Vols have historically been one of the nation's dominant programs in that sport. Starting in the mid-1990s, UConn has emerged as Tennessee's main rival for national prominence. The Huskies won four national titles between 2000 and 2004; in three of those years, their opponent in the NCAA final was Tennessee. Connecticut also defeated Tennessee in the 1995 Championship game, the Huskies' first-ever title. The [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] brokered a deal that will see the teams renew their rivalry with a home-and-home series in 2020 and 2021.\n\n==Other sports==\nBesides football, basketball, and baseball, there are a number of other sports in which the Southeastern Conference actively competes.\n\n===Rivalries===\n* [[Alabama Crimson Tide women's gymnastics|Alabama]]&ndash;[[Georgia Gym Dogs|Georgia]], women's gymnastics{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n:These two storied programs have often butted heads for not only SEC titles, but NCAA titles as well. Georgia has won ten national championships to Alabama's six. For decades the rivalry was dominated by the two long standing coaches of the two schools, [[Suzanne Yoculan]] of Georgia and [[Sarah Patterson (coach)|Sarah Patterson]] of Alabama. Yoculan and Patterson have since retired, bringing their personal rivalry to an end.\n* [[University of Alabama athletics|Alabama]]&ndash;[[University of Florida|Florida]], women's softball{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n:These two nationally acclaimed softball programs have proven to be the elite of the SEC and the nation. While consistently being ranked in the nation's Top Ten, both teams find their way to the SEC Tournament Finals and often clash once more in the Women's College Softball World Series.\n* [[Tennessee Volunteers softball|Tennessee]]&ndash;[[Louisiana State Tigers softball|LSU]], women's softball\n* [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn]]&ndash;[[Texas Longhorns|Texas]], men's swimming and diving{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n:One of the youngest rivalries featuring an SEC team, the Tigers and Texas Longhorns are the two most successful swimming and diving programs in the country. The two have combined for 17 NCAA National Titles since 1981 (nine for Texas, eight for Auburn) and between 1999 and 2007 won every national title awarded. The two regularly face off in a meet during the regular season, Auburn's men own a 12\u20139 record over the Longhorns. The women just recently began an annual series, with the Tigers winning the series so far 3\u20131.

Prior to 1992, championships for major college football were determined by a \"consensus\" of major polling services, including the [[AP Poll|Associated Press]] and [[United Press International]] college football polls. Recognized [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women championships|women's championships]] from 1972 to 1982 were administered by the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] (AIAW), not the NCAA. There was a one-year overlap period during the 1981\u201382 school year, when both the AIAW and the NCAA operated women's championship tournaments; since 1982, only the NCAA has sponsored women's championship tournaments. National equestrian tournament championships are currently sponsored by the [[National Collegiate Equestrian Association]] (NCEA), not the NCAA. Those national championships dating from before 1933 predate the founding of the SEC in December 1932; championships won by Arkansas and South Carolina before the 1992\u201393 school year predate

Priya's parents, brothers and best friend, Ajay ([[Chandrachur Singh]]) love and support her. Ajay is secretly in love with Priya and wishes to marry her in the future.\n\nPriya enters her first year of university and quickly catches the eye of wealthy playboy Rahul ([[Saif Ali Khan]]), who becomes attracted to her. She succumbs to his charm but Ajay and her brother Vicky are unsure about Rahul. His reputation and womanizing ways worry them, and they warn her to stay away from him. However, Priya believes that Rahul is in love with her, and the two begin a relationship and have sex. Priya convinces her parents to meet Rahul, but when they prematurely talk about marriage and the future, he mocks them and leaves Priya. Priya is heartbroken but tries to move on with her life. She later learns that she is pregnant with Rahul's child. Her parents go back to Rahul to talk about marriage once again. He acknowledges that he is the father but still does not want to marry Priya. Rahul's mother also berates Priya's family, believing that they are looking for financial compensation. Priya is faced with a decision, and she chooses to keep the child. Her decision prompts her father to reluctantly banish her from the house due to the shame, however, her family finds it hard to live without her and they bring her back, supporting her during her pregnancy.\n\nPriya goes back to university, where she is shunned due to her pregnancy and 'spoiled' character. Rahul's mother, who is part of the university's board of directors, tries to convince the other parents that Priya should be expelled due to her character. Ostracised by friends, neighbours, and society, Priya realises Ajay's love and dedication for her.\nThe university holds a year-end performance, where a group of students put on a play which mocks and vilifies Priya and her pregnancy. After the play, Priya makes a passionate speech about love, honour, and respect. Her words move many in the audience, including Rahul. Her friends apologise to her, and she gains the support of the community. Later, Ajay declares his love for Priya and desire to marry her. However, Priya worries whether Ajay will accept her and her unborn child. Ajay tells her he is fully willing to accept both her and her child as his own. Unknown to Priya and Ajay a remorseful Rahul approaches Priya family and reveals he is ready to apologise and raise his and Priya's child together to which they agree. Priya water breaks before she can answer Ajay's proposal and she goes to the hospital to give birth, where she's joined by Rahul and her family.\n\nAt an event to celebrate the birth of Priya's baby, Rahul proposes to Priya, stating that he is ready for marriage and to raise their child. Ajay wishes them well and begins to walk away. However, Priya rejects Rahul and confesses her love for Ajay, asking him whether he's still willing to accept her and her child, Ajay agrees to this. Rahul accepts Priya's decision, wishes them well and leaves.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Preity Zinta]] as Priya Bakshi\n* [[Saif Ali Khan]] as Rahul Modi\n* [[Chandrachur Singh]] as Ajay\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Gulshan Bakshi \n* [[Farida Jalal]] as Rohini Bakshi\n* [[Puneet Vasishtha]] as Priya's brother\n* [[Nivedita Bhattacharya]] as Priya's Sister-In-Law\n* [[Mamik Singh]] as Priya's brother\n* [[Amit Mistry]] as Priya's brother\n* [[Navneet Nishan]] as Rahul's mother\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Kya Kehna\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Rajesh Roshan]]\n| cover      = KyaKehnaCD.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{Start date|df=y|2000}}\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Tips Music Films]]\n| producer   = [[Rajesh Roshan]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\nThe soundtrack of the film contains 8 songs.

In 1959, the governments of Egypt and [[Sudan]] requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched an appeal to the member states for an International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429024818/https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172 |date=29 April 2009 }} World Heritage Convention, UNESCO</ref> This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples, the most famous of which are the temple complexes of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] and [[Philae]]. The campaign, which ended in 1980, was considered a success. As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] was moved to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] was moved to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222650/https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |date=27 February 2015 }}, UNESCO</ref>\n\nThe project cost $80&nbsp;million, about $40&nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.<ref name=\"WHC-history\">\"[https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention \u2013 Brief History]\".

UNESCO then initiated, with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], a draft convention to protect cultural heritage.<ref name=\"WHC-history\"/>\n\n===Convention and background===\nThe United States initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation. The [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a \"World Heritage Trust\" to preserve \"the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry\". The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, and they were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]]. Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the World Heritage Committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a \"snapshot\" of current conditions at World Heritage properties.\n\nBased on the draft convention that UNESCO had initiated, a single text was eventually agreed on by all parties, and the \"Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\" was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.<ref>\"[https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention \u2013 Brief History]\".

In 1959, the governments of Egypt and [[Sudan]] requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched an appeal to the member states for an International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429024818/https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172 |date=29 April 2009 }} World Heritage Convention, UNESCO</ref> This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples, the most famous of which are the temple complexes of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] and [[Philae]]. The campaign, which ended in 1980, was considered a success. As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] was moved to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] was moved to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222650/https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |date=27 February 2015 }}, UNESCO</ref>\n\nThe project cost $80&nbsp;million, about $40&nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.<ref name=\"WHC-history\">\"[https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention \u2013 Brief History]\".

UNESCO then initiated, with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], a draft convention to protect cultural heritage.<ref name=\"WHC-history\"/>\n\n===Convention and background===\nThe United States initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation. The [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a \"World Heritage Trust\" to preserve \"the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry\". The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, and they were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]]. Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the World Heritage Committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a \"snapshot\" of current conditions at World Heritage properties.\n\nBased on the draft convention that UNESCO had initiated, a single text was eventually agreed on by all parties, and the \"Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\" was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.<ref>\"[https://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ The World Heritage Convention \u2013 Brief History]\".

Whereby there is also a connection between cultural user disruption or world heritage and the cause of flight, as President of [[Blue Shield International]] Karl von Habsburg-Lorraine explained during an [[United Nations peacekeeping]] and [[UNESCO]] mission in Lebanon in April 2019: \u201cCultural assets are part of the identity of the people who live in a certain place.
