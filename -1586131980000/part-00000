The former town centre, the K\u00fcstrin fortress located on the headland between the Oder and Warta rivers, was destroyed in the war and not rebuilt.

Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] used Kostrzyn's strategic location as a staging area during his expedition to the [[Battle of Cedynia]] in 972. Likewise, his successor [[Boles\u0142aw I the Brave]] from 1002 also prepared here for conquests and battles in the [[German\u2013Polish War (1002\u201318)|German\u2013Polish War]] against King [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=//www.kostrzyn.um.gov.pl/historia/historia.htm |title=Kostrzyn nad Odr\u0105 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-03-06 |accessdate=2013-03-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306151113/http://www.kostrzyn.um.gov.pl/historia/historia.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1223 the [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Polish]] prince [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic]] granted the fortress to the [[Knights Templar]]. The name of the town was first mentioned in 1232 in a Polish letter by the [[Bishopric of Lebus|Lubusz]] bishop [[Wawrzyniec (bishop of Lubusz)|Wawrzyniec]] to the Knights Templar, in which the old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] name ''Cozsterine'' (hence the later German name ''K\u00fcstrin'') was mentioned. In the 12th century it developed into a fortified [[castellan]]y and a Polish taxation post, however, together with [[Lubusz Land]] it was seized by the [[House of Ascania|Ascanian]] margraves of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] in 1261 and incorporated into their [[Neumark]] territory east of the Oder river. By 1300 the town had received [[Magdeburg rights|Magdeburg town rights]] from Margrave [[Albert III, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel|Albert III of Brandenburg]] and started to grow rapidly, owing largely to trade on the rivers.\n\nIn 1373 the town became part of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] (or ''Czech Lands''), ruled by the [[Luxembourg dynasty]]. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Poland]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]], under which Poland was to buy Kostrzyn and the surrounding region, but eventually the Luxembourgs sold the town to the [[Teutonic Order]]. After the [[Thirteen Years\u2019 War (1454\u20131466)|Thirteen Years\u2019 War]] broke out in 1454, the Teutonic Knights sold the town to Brandenburg in order to raise funds for war against Poland.\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Kostrzyn Merian 1652.jpg|thumb|left|The town in the 17th century]]\n[[File:Kuestrin1728.jpg|thumb|left|The town in around 1728]]\nIn 1535\u20131571 the town was the seat of [[John, Margrave of Brandenburg-K\u00fcstrin|John of Brandenburg-K\u00fcstrin]], who made it the capital of the [[Neumark]] region and built a castle. With time this castle was expanded into a fortress, one of the largest such facilities in the region. While still crown prince, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] was imprisoned in the fortress, from which he is said to have witnessed the execution of his friend [[Hans Hermann von Katte]] on 6 November 1730. The town was [[Siege of K\u00fcstrin|besieged]] by the Russians during the [[Seven Years' War]]. Captured by the French in 1806, K\u00fcstrin was occupied by a French military garrison for the remainder of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the French [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|retreat from the east]] in 1814, the town was set on fire and burnt to the ground. The town recovered and became one of the most important railway hubs in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and later the [[German Empire]]. In 1857 it was linked to [[Berlin]] and [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] and in 1875 with [[Szczecin|Stettin (Szczecin)]] on the Pomeranian coast. In 1900 its population reached 16,473, including the garrison of the fortress.\n[[File:Siegelmarke Magistrat zu C\u00fcstrin.jpg|thumb|100px|right|German sealing stamp of the town]]\nIn September 1923, the [[Black Reichswehr]] [[K\u00fcstrin Putsch|attempted to occupy]] K\u00fcstrin but it was suppressed. At the outbreak of [[World War II]] K\u00fcstrin had 24,000 inhabitants. However, due to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] air raids on the railway hub and local factories and its position as a German bridgehead on the east bank of the Oder during the [[Battle of the Oder-Neisse]] and the [[Battle of the Seelow Heights]], almost 95% of its buildings were destroyed (including all 32 of the city's factories) and the town was generally deserted. The town was captured by the [[Red Army]] on 11 March 1945. The suburb Alt-Drewitz (modern [[Drzewice]], one of Kostrzyn's boroughs) contained a [[Nazism|Nazi]] POW camp, [[Stalag III-C Alt-Drewitz]], used mostly for [[United States|American]], [[France|French]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]], and [[Italy|Italian]] prisoners of war. In 1943\u201345 the town also housed a number of German forced labour camps and a sub-camp of [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].\n\n[[File:KostrzynPL 08-13 img02.jpg|thumb|Train station]]\nAfter the war the ruined town was placed under Polish administration by decision of the [[Potsdam Conference]]; Germans remaining in the town were subsequently [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled westward]]. New Polish settlers took the place of the former German inhabitants. Some of the new inhabitants were [[Repatriation of Poles (1944\u20131946)|Polish refugees]] from regions east of the [[Curzon line]], the [[Kresy]], from where they had been displaced by Soviet authorities in accordance to new borders decided at [[Yalta Conference]], while most new settlers were re-settlers from Central Poland.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe remnants of the old town within the fortress walls, including the castle in which the young Frederick the Great had been imprisoned, were razed after the war and the bricks used to rebuild Polish cities elsewhere. More recently, plans to rebuild some of the old town in a historical style was considered, but this project appears to be on hold. The section of the town on the west bank of the Oder remained in Germany and is now called [[K\u00fcstrin-Kietz]].\nSince 2004 Kostrzyn has annually hosted [[Przystanek Woodstock]] in the summer, the largest open-air music festival in Europe and one of the largest in the world.\n[[File:PL K\u00fcstrin Kietzer Tor.JPG|thumb|Kostrzyn nad Odr\u0105 Fortress]]\n[[File:Kostrzyn nad Odr\u0105, ul.Ko\u015bciuszki -

This would have undoubtedly have caused operational problems and therefore Parkside became the terminus station for trains on the WBR.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2008|p=10}}</ref> There is doubt about how any transfer of passengers took place between the lines, it is unlikely that WBR trains ran from their single-track railway into the station on the L&MR double track, they would have had to reverse to do so, the WBR train likely stopped before the junction and passengers simply walked to the L&MR station.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2008|p=12}}</ref>\n\nSweeney (2008) records there were complaints in October 1832 that passengers had to wait without shelter when changing trains, and the railways jointly funded the building of a ''waiting shed''.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2008|p=12}}</ref>\n\nIn 1834 the WBR became part of the [[North Union Railway]] (NUR).<ref>{{harvnb|Greville|1981|p=11}}</ref> By 1837 there were 5 tracks at Parkside, [[Rail directions#Up and down|Up and Down]] L&MR lines, Up and Down NUR lines (the NUR had by now installed its second running line) and a siding which ran into the point of the junction, this siding was probably used for an engine shed.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2008|p=12}}</ref> The illustration by Tate shows the new station but you can see the four lines running away from the junction to where the first station was located before the overbridge in the distance, also to be seen are the two NUR lines going to the right towards Wigan.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2008|p=12}}</ref>\n[[File:Parkside Station 1848.jpg|thumb|Parkside Station from Views on the London & North Western Railway - Tait, 1848]]\n\nThis first station remained open after the new station opened in 1838 as a goods station, being labelled a \"Luggage Station\" on the 1849 OS map (see above).

This would have undoubtedly have caused operational problems and therefore Parkside became the terminus station for trains on the WBR.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2008|p=10}}</ref> There is doubt about how any transfer of passengers took place between the lines, it is unlikely that WBR trains ran from their single-track railway into the station on the L&MR double track, they would have had to reverse to do so, the WBR train likely stopped before the junction and passengers simply walked to the L&MR station.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2008|p=12}}</ref>\n\nSweeney (2008) records there were complaints in October 1832 that passengers had to wait without shelter when changing trains, and the railways jointly funded the building of a ''waiting shed''.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2008|p=12}}</ref>\n\nIn 1834 the WBR became part of the [[North Union Railway]] (NUR).<ref>{{harvnb|Greville|1981|p=11}}</ref> By 1837 there were 5 tracks at Parkside, [[Rail directions#Up and down|Up and Down]] L&MR lines, Up and Down NUR lines (the NUR had by now installed its second running line) and a siding which ran into the point of the junction, this siding was probably used for an engine shed.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2008|p=12}}</ref> The illustration by Tate shows the new station but you can see the four lines running away from the junction to where the first station was located before the overbridge in the distance, also to be seen are the two NUR lines going to the right towards Wigan.<ref>{{harvnb|Sweeney|2008|p=12}}</ref>\n[[File:Parkside Station 1848.jpg|thumb|Parkside Station from Views on the London & North Western Railway - Tait, 1848]]\n\nThis first station remained open after the new station opened in 1838 as a goods station, being labelled a \"Luggage Station\" on the 1849 OS map (see above).

It was founded by Friedrich Speidel in 1867 as a manufacturer of [[Jewellery chain|gold and silver chains]], and the company was formed in its modern state in the [[United States]] in 1904 as 'The Speidel Chain Company'. and very soon was known for its \"Ratchet-buckle\" watchbands (introduced in 1920), the \"Scissors Action Expansion Band\" (introduced in 1936), the ladies' \"Mignon\" watchbands (introduced in 1939), plus costume jewelry. In the 1930s, Speidel was the first company in the world to introduce ID bracelets. During [[World War II]], the company briefly produced [[Cathode ray tube|cathode-ray tubes]]. Speidel experienced a boom in popularity, notably with their invention of the hugely popular [[Watch strap|expanding strap]] in the mid-1930's, and in addition to watchbands Speidel produced [[wristwatch]]es, [[lighter]]s, writing instruments, small jewelry, and other accessories, before beginning to decline by the end of the century with the struggle to compete with cheaper overseas production, and the boom in [[Quartz watch]]es.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history ===\nFriedrich Speidel founded the Speidel Company in 1867. With an initial investment equivalent to $10, Speidel started making gold and silver chains with his wife, in the basement of his home in [[Pforzheim, Germany]]. He has been credited with developing the gold-over-metal method of manufacturing called \"[[bi-metal]]\" (also incorrectly known as [[Gold plating|gold \"plating\"]]) which proved successful. In 1896 he built the company's first factory, and installed state-of-the-art machines for the production of gold chain, previously manufactured entirely by hand.\n\nFriedrich Speidel sent his three sons, Albert, Edwin and Eugene to America to establish a branch of the family's jewelry chain manufacturing business. The Speidel Chain Company was officially founded in the United States in 1904.\n\nBy 1912 the Speidel brothers hired the architectural firm Monks and Johnson to design the company's first headquarters. The [[Building|five-story building]], with its [[European architecture|European-style front]], was originally called the Doran-Speidel Building.\n\n== Early-mid 1900s and Growth ==\nAt first, only [[chain]] was made in the new facilities. During the 1920s, [[costume jewelry]] and [[watchbands]] were added to the line. Men's watchbands surged in popularity due to their introduction and use in the military during [[World War I]]. In the early 1920s Albert Speidel formed ''Speidel Brothers'', producing watch bracelets that were manufactured and sold primarily to wholesalers.<ref>http://www.speidel.com/default.cfm?PID=1.3.1</ref>\n\nIn 1928 the Speidel family in Germany and the brothers who lived in the United States, decided to merge all of the businesses into the Speidel Corporation in order to strengthen their position. The first president of Speidel Corporation was Albert Speidel, one of the Speidel brothers living in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. In 1934 Paul Levinger was hired by Speidel Corporation as a [[plant foreman]].\n\n=== WWII War effort & electronic components. ===\nWatchband production was cut back during [[World War II]] when Speidel converted most of its facilities and started manufacturing [[Cathode-ray tube|cathode ray tubes]] for [[radar]] and other electronic applications. However Speidel returned to watchbands as soon as peace returned. In 1947 Speidel brought out its first modernized version of the scissor-type [[Watch band|expansion band]] called the Golden Knight. It proved to be a tremendous success in the men's watch bracelet field. The company also introduced elaborate packaging for its line of watch bracelets.\n\n== Expansion and national prominence ==\nA planned reduction of [[costume jewelry]] production was soon instituted, leading to the discontinuation of costume jewelry in the early 1950s. National advertising for watch bracelets under the name Speidel and the building of a brand name began after the end of [[World War II]], first in magazines and then in radio with a program called \u201cStop the Music.\u201d This proved to be an outstanding success and helped make the name of Speidel nationally known. In 1949 Speidel changed with the times and discontinued [[Radio advertisement|radio advertising]]. Instead it concentrated its advertising budget in [[television]], purchasing a number of fully sponsored programs and making Speidel one of the earliest [[Television advertisement|television advertisers]] in the United States.\n\n=== Korean War and military manufacturing. ===\nIn 1951 with the advent of the [[Korean War]], Speidel began manufacturing [[Dog tag|identification bracelets]]. The first product in this category was the [[Photo identification|Photo Ident]], a combination ident bracelet with photo and an expandable wristband, which was advertised on television. It was an immediate success \u2013 of major proportions.\n\nIn 1956 Speidel started manufacturing men's jewelry. The goal was to diversify its inventory and combat the increasingly heavy competition in metal watch bracelets from Japanese imports. Heavy opposition to this move by other manufacturers made it necessary for Speidel to change its method of distribution from general jobbers to sole distributors. Over the next three years a number of such sole distributorships were established in strategic geographic locations. Its sales force was also built up to provide adequate coverage to all areas of the United States.\n\n=== Introduction & Development of the 'Fixo-Flex' bracelet ===\nAround this time, heavy investments had been made in the development of automatic equipment to produce a bracelet similar to the German Fixo-Flex. A few years earlier a German manufacturer had sent the first version of the Fixo-Flex bracelet to Paul Levinger who had worked out a license contract with the inventor, Karl E. Stiegle. In 1956 the first automatically produced bracelet under this patent was introduced as a test under the name of [[Kingsway]]. By 1959 the company officially introduced the new watchband as the \u201cTwist-O-Flex\u201d.\n\nSpeidel introduced its newest version of the highly successful Twist-O-Flex watchband in 1988, called the Euro-Flex. The new watchband incorporated heavier metals and contemporary European styling. Speidel continued to expand its line of products with the introduction of the \u201cSignet\u201d watch line in 1994; a patented plastic top shell watchband in 1995; and the first watchband with rubberized coating in 1996.\n\n=== Change of Ownership & International Expansion ===\nBy 1964 the company, now owned by Paul Levinger, had grown significantly both in size and importance to the jewelry industry. Levinger sold the company to [[Textron|Textron, Inc]]. in May of that year. By 1966 Speidel had expanded its distribution capacity and entered the men's toiletries market, with the introduction of the men's fragrance [[British Sterling]]. The company aggressively marketed the product with such enduring phrases as, \u201cMake him a legend in his own time,\u201d which helped to create a market success without parallel. Speidel became one of Textron's top local divisions \nin sales volume and performance.\n\nThe company began to expand its marketing reach internationally in the 1970s, beginning with [[Canada]] in 1971. The company furthered its sales market by branching out to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] in 1972. [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] in 1973; and [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]] in 1974.\n\n== Later period (late 1900's) ==\n\n=== Period of decline, bankruptcy and rebirth. ===\nIn the midst of their international sales expansion, Speidel started OEM ([[Original Equipment Manufacturing]]) Business Supplies in 1972. OEM manufactured metal watchbands directly for watch companies such as [[Seiko]], which at the time had just introduced the [[Quartz watch|\u201cquartz\u201d watch]], the first totally machine assembled timepiece, which dramatically reduced watch prices. That same year Speidel began its watchband replacement program for mass [[Inventory|merchandisers]], making it much easier for consumers to find the appropriately sized watchband replacement at their [[Local store marketing|local store]].\n\nIn 1997 Textron sold Speidel to the Austrian-based [[:de:Hirsch Armb\u00e4nder|Hirsch Armb\u00e4nder]] AG, the leading manufacturer of leather watchbands in [[Europe]]. The new company was '''''Hirsch Speidel Inc.''''' Two years later, as part of a global manufacturing consolidation strategy, Hirsh closed Speidel's original [[Ship Street]] property and relocated its headquarters to [[East Providence, Rhode Island|East Providence]]. In coordination with the move, Speidel closed down its manufacturing operations and [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] its workload. A portion of the production continued in [[Rhode Island]] with local manufacturing companies, and the balance moved overseas.\n\nIn 2002 the company's ownership had once again returned to the United States, when JRM holdings bought Speidel from [[:de:Hirsch Armb\u00e4nder|Hirsch Armb\u00e4nder]]. Five years later Fred Levinger acquired Speidel. In 2009 Cerce Capital LLC, purchased Speidel's assets for $US 1.65 million in a bankruptcy proceedings.<ref>[http://www.idexonline.com/FullArticle?id=32798 \"Speidel Assets Sold for $1.65 Million,\" Michelle Graf, Idexonline.com, from National Jeweler Network], accessed 2 Feb 2018</ref>\n\n== The Speidel Family ==\nIn 1937 Albert Speidel died at an early age from pneumonia. His brother Edwin, the founder of the Automatic Chain Company who had not been active in the Speidel Corporation up to this time became president of Speidel Corporation and Paul Levinger was made vice-president. At that time, the majority control of the business was held by the [[Germany|German]] family. However, in 1939, all of the shares held by the German stockholders were purchased by Edwin Speidel and Paul Levinger.\n\n=== Twist-O-Flex watch band===\nThough Speidel was very famous as an identification bracelet maker, the company is still best known as the manufacturer of the \"Twist-O-Flex\" watchband. Speidel introduced the Twist-O-Flex in 1959, after licensing the technology from its German inventor, Karl E. Stiegele. The Speidel logo is a Twist-O-Flex watchband tied into a bow.\n\nThe \"Twist-O-Flex\" consists of various styles of metal bracelet watchbands; the special link design creates a single-component, stretchable bracelet (also called an \"extension bracelet\" and once known as a \"scissor-link\" bracelet).\n\nThe Twist-O-Flex started life as a bracelet similar to the German \"Fixo-Flex\". A few years earlier, a German manufacturer had sent the first version of the \"Fixo-Flex\" bracelet to Paul Levinger, who had worked out a license contract with the inventor, Karl E. Stiegle.\n\nIn 1956 the first automatically produced bracelet under this patent was introduced under the name of \"Kingsway\". By 1959 the company officially introduced the new watchband as the \u201cTwist-O-Flex\u201d. This watch band was and is considered light years ahead of any other watchband products, was a sales phenomenon and was the fashion statement of its time.\n\nThe company's independent distributorships, such as Gluck, GKG, Gerwe Brown, and Simon Golub became enormously profitable due to the Twist-O-Flex watchbands. Speidel went on to introduce two other highly popular versions of the Twist-O-Flex: the Ladies Twist-O-Flex introduced in 1961 and the Youth Twist-O-Flex in 1963.\n\nThe Twist-O-Flex continues to be the company's most popular product. The Twist-O-Flex was popularly called the \"tank track\" due to its resemblance to the tread of a tank when laid flat. Speidel now calls one of its most popular models by the name \"Tank Trak\".<ref>http://www.speidel.com/default.cfm?PID=1.10</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.speidel.com Speidel] - official site\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1867]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the surname|Speidel (surname)}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{Infobox company\n| name                = Speidel\n| logo                = Speidel Logo.png\n| type                = [[Privately held company|Private]]\n| founder             = \n| foundation          = {{ubl|{{Start date and age|1904}}|[[East Providence, Rhode Island]],|[[United States]]}} (as The Speidel Chain Company)\n| defunct             = \n| hq_location_city    = [[East Providence, Rhode Island]], [[United States]].\n| hq_location_country = [[United States]]\n| area_served         = {{flat list|\n* Worldwide\n}}\n| industry            = [[Watch strap]]s\n| fate                = \n| products            = {{ubl|[[Straps]]s}}\n| revenue             = \n| owner               = \n| num_employees       = | parent              =  [[Textron]] (Former), [[:de:Hirsch Armb\u00e4nder|Hirsch Armb\u00e4nder]] (Former).\n| website             = {{URL|https://speidel.com/}}\n}}\n\n'''Speidel''' is a manufacturer of [[watchband]]s and related items based in [[East Providence, Rhode Island]], [[United States]].

Its sales force was also built up to provide adequate coverage to all areas of the United States.\n\n=== Introduction & Development of the 'Fixo-Flex' bracelet ===\nAround this time, heavy investments had been made in the development of automatic equipment to produce a bracelet similar to the German Fixo-Flex. A few years earlier a German manufacturer had sent the first version of the Fixo-Flex bracelet to Paul Levinger who had worked out a license contract with the inventor, Karl E. Stiegle. In 1956 the first automatically produced bracelet under this patent was introduced as a test under the name of [[Kingsway]]. By 1959 the company officially introduced the new watchband as the \u201cTwist-O-Flex\u201d.\n\nSpeidel introduced its newest version of the highly successful Twist-O-Flex watchband in 1988, called the Euro-Flex. The new watchband incorporated heavier metals and contemporary European styling. Speidel continued to expand its line of products with the introduction of the \u201cSignet\u201d watch line in 1994; a patented plastic top shell watchband in 1995; and the first watchband with rubberized coating in 1996.\n\n=== Change of Ownership & International Expansion ===\nBy 1964 the company, now owned by Paul Levinger, had grown significantly both in size and importance to the jewelry industry. Levinger sold the company to [[Textron|Textron, Inc]]. in May of that year. By 1966 Speidel had expanded its distribution capacity and entered the men's toiletries market, with the introduction of the men's fragrance [[British Sterling]]. The company aggressively marketed the product with such enduring phrases as, \u201cMake him a legend in his own time,\u201d which helped to create a market success without parallel. Speidel became one of Textron's top local divisions \nin sales volume and performance.\n\nThe company began to expand its marketing reach internationally in the 1970s, beginning with [[Canada]] in 1971. The company furthered its sales market by branching out to [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] in 1972. [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] in 1973; and [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Denmark]] and [[Finland]] in 1974.\n\n== Later period (late 1900's) ==\n\n=== Period of decline, bankruptcy and rebirth. ===\nIn the midst of their international sales expansion, Speidel started OEM ([[Original Equipment Manufacturing]]) Business Supplies in 1972. OEM manufactured metal watchbands directly for watch companies such as [[Seiko]], which at the time had just introduced the [[Quartz watch|\u201cquartz\u201d watch]], the first totally machine assembled timepiece, which dramatically reduced watch prices. That same year Speidel began its watchband replacement program for mass [[Inventory|merchandisers]], making it much easier for consumers to find the appropriately sized watchband replacement at their [[Local store marketing|local store]].\n\nIn 1997 Textron sold Speidel to the Austrian-based [[:de:Hirsch Armb\u00e4nder|Hirsch Armb\u00e4nder]] AG, the leading manufacturer of leather watchbands in [[Europe]]. The new company was '''''Hirsch Speidel Inc.''''' Two years later, as part of a global manufacturing consolidation strategy, Hirsh closed Speidel's original [[Ship Street]] property and relocated its headquarters to [[East Providence, Rhode Island|East Providence]]. In coordination with the move, Speidel closed down its manufacturing operations and [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] its workload. A portion of the production continued in [[Rhode Island]] with local manufacturing companies, and the balance moved overseas.\n\nIn 2002 the company's ownership had once again returned to the United States, when JRM holdings bought Speidel from [[:de:Hirsch Armb\u00e4nder|Hirsch Armb\u00e4nder]]. Five years later Fred Levinger acquired Speidel. In 2009 Cerce Capital LLC, purchased Speidel's assets for $US 1.65 million in a bankruptcy proceedings.<ref>[http://www.idexonline.com/FullArticle?id=32798 \"Speidel Assets Sold for $1.65 Million,\" Michelle Graf, Idexonline.com, from National Jeweler Network], accessed 2 Feb 2018</ref>\n\n== The Speidel Family ==\nIn 1937 Albert Speidel died at an early age from pneumonia. His brother Edwin, the founder of the Automatic Chain Company who had not been active in the Speidel Corporation up to this time became president of Speidel Corporation and Paul Levinger was made vice-president. At that time, the majority control of the business was held by the [[Germany|German]] family. However, in 1939, all of the shares held by the German stockholders were purchased by Edwin Speidel and Paul Levinger.\n\n=== Twist-O-Flex watch band===\nThough Speidel was very famous as an identification bracelet maker, the company is still best known as the manufacturer of the \"Twist-O-Flex\" watchband. Speidel introduced the Twist-O-Flex in 1959, after licensing the technology from its German inventor, Karl E. Stiegele. The Speidel logo is a Twist-O-Flex watchband tied into a bow.\n\nThe \"Twist-O-Flex\" consists of various styles of metal bracelet watchbands; the special link design creates a single-component, stretchable bracelet (also called an \"extension bracelet\" and once known as a \"scissor-link\" bracelet).\n\nThe Twist-O-Flex started life as a bracelet similar to the German \"Fixo-Flex\". A few years earlier, a German manufacturer had sent the first version of the \"Fixo-Flex\" bracelet to Paul Levinger, who had worked out a license contract with the inventor, Karl E. Stiegle.\n\nIn 1956 the first automatically produced bracelet under this patent was introduced under the name of \"Kingsway\". By 1959 the company officially introduced the new watchband as the \u201cTwist-O-Flex\u201d. This watch band was and is considered light years ahead of any other watchband products, was a sales phenomenon and was the fashion statement of its time.\n\nThe company's independent distributorships, such as Gluck, GKG, Gerwe Brown, and Simon Golub became enormously profitable due to the Twist-O-Flex watchbands. Speidel went on to introduce two other highly popular versions of the Twist-O-Flex: the Ladies Twist-O-Flex introduced in 1961 and the Youth Twist-O-Flex in 1963.\n\nThe Twist-O-Flex continues to be the company's most popular product. The Twist-O-Flex was popularly called the \"tank track\" due to its resemblance to the tread of a tank when laid flat. Speidel now calls one of its most popular models by the name \"Tank Trak\".<ref>http://www.speidel.com/default.cfm?PID=1.10</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.speidel.com Speidel] - official site\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1867]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speidel"}

He was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1940 to 1945, when he led Britain to victory in the [[Second World War]], and again from 1951 to 1955. Churchill represented five constituencies during his career as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP). Ideologically an [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] and [[British Empire|imperialist]], for most of his career he was a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which he led from 1940 to 1955, but from 1904 to 1924 was a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\n<!--Early life and career prior to the Second World War-->\nOf mixed [[English people|English]] and [[Americans|American]] parentage, Churchill was born in [[Oxfordshire]] to [[Spencer family|a wealthy, aristocratic family]]. He joined the [[British Army]] in 1895, and saw action in [[British Raj|British India]], the [[Mahdist War|Anglo\u2013Sudan War]], and the [[Second Boer War]], gaining fame as a [[war correspondent]] and writing books about his campaigns. Elected an MP in 1900, initially as a Conservative, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In [[H. H. Asquith]]'s [[Liberal government, 1905\u20131915|Liberal government]], Churchill served as [[President of the Board of Trade]], [[Home Secretary]], and [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], championing [[Liberal welfare reforms|prison reform and workers' social security]]. During the [[First World War]], he oversaw the [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli Campaign]]; after it proved a disaster, he resigned from government and served in the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1917, he returned to government under [[David Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]], then as [[Secretary of State for War]] and [[Secretary of State for Air|Air]], and finally [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|for the Colonies]], overseeing the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and Britain's Middle East policy. After two years out of Parliament, he served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s [[Second Baldwin ministry|Conservative government]], returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the [[gold standard]] at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy.\n\n<!--Later life, the Second World War, and Cold War-->\nOut of office during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the [[appeasement|growing threat]] from [[Nazi Germany]]. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1940 he became prime minister, replacing [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Churchill oversaw British involvement in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort against Germany and the [[Axis powers]], resulting in victory in 1945. His wartime leadership was widely praised, although acts like the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Bombing of Dresden]] and his wartime response to the [[Bengal famine of 1943|Bengal famine]] generated controversy. After the Conservatives' defeat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Amid the developing [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]], he publicly warned of an \"[[Iron Curtain|iron curtain]]\" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Re-elected Prime Minister in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]], his second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, including the [[Malayan Emergency]], [[Mau Mau Uprising]], [[Korean War]], and a UK-backed [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|Iranian coup]]. Domestically his government emphasised house-building and developed a nuclear weapon. In declining health, Churchill resigned as prime minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a [[State funerals in the United Kingdom|state funeral]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in Britain and throughout [[Western world|the West]], where he is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's [[liberal democracy]] from the spread of [[fascism]]. Praised as a social reformer and accomplished writer, among his many awards was the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].

Churchill later claimed that, on learning of his appointment, the Board of the Admiralty sent a signal to the Fleet: \"Winston is back\".{{sfn|Churchill|1967b|p=7}} Although this story was repeated by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] in a speech at [[Edmonton]] in 1966, [[Richard Langworth]] notes that neither he nor Churchill's official biographer [[Martin Gilbert]] have found contemporary evidence to confirm it, suggesting that it may well be a later invention.{{sfn|Langworth|2008|p=581}}\n\nAs First Lord, Churchill proved to be one of the highest-profile ministers during the so-called \"[[Phoney War]]\", when the only significant action was at sea and in the [[Russo-Finnish War|USSR's attack on Finland]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} He was concerned about German naval activity in the [[Baltic Sea]] and initially planned to send a naval force there but this was soon changed to a plan, codenamed [[Operation Wilfred]], to mine Norwegian waters and stop [[iron ore]] shipments from [[Narvik]] to Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} There were disagreements about mining, both in the war cabinet and with the French government. As a result, Wilfred was delayed until 8 April 1940, the day before the successful [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|German invasion of Norway]] was launched.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=573\u2013574}}\n\n==Prime Minister: 1940\u20131945==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of Winston Churchill]], [[First prime ministership of Winston Churchill]], [[Premiership of Winston Churchill]], [[Prime ministership of Winston Churchill]] -->\n{{for timeline|Timeline of the first premiership of Winston Churchill}}\n{{further|Churchill war ministry}}\n{{See also|Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|British Empire in World War II}}\n\n===The Norway Debate and Chamberlain's resignation===\nAfter the [[Norwegian campaign|allies failed to prevent]] the German occupation of Norway, the Commons held an open debate from 7 to 9 May on the government's conduct of the war.

He was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his own prestige.{{sfn|Shakespeare|2017|pp=299\u2013300}} Although the government won the vote, its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government to be formed.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=582}}\n\nIn the early hours of 10 May, German forces invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as a prelude to their [[Battle of France|assault on France]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=583}} Since the division vote, Chamberlain had been trying to form a coalition but Labour declared on the Friday afternoon that they would not serve under his leadership, although they would accept another Conservative. The only two candidates were Churchill and [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], the Foreign Secretary. The matter had already been decided at a meeting on the 9th between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill, and [[David Margesson, 1st Viscount Margesson|David Margesson]], the government [[Chief Whip]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=583}} Halifax had admitted that he could not govern effectively as a member of the House of Lords and so Chamberlain advised the King to send for Churchill, who became prime minister.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=586}} His first act was to write to Chamberlain and thank him for his support.<ref>{{cite book |last=Self |first=Robert |title=Neville Chamberlain: A Biography |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |page=431 |isbn=978-0-75-465615-9}}</ref>\n\nChurchill later wrote of feeling a profound sense of relief in that he now had authority over the whole scene.

In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended the majority of meetings.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=587\u2013588}}{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|pp=26\u201329}} The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed and there were significant additions later in 1940 when it was increased to eight after Churchill, Attlee and Greenwood were joined by [[Ernest Bevin]] as [[Secretary of State for Employment|Minister of Labour and National Service]]; [[Anthony Eden]] as Foreign Secretary \u2013 replacing Halifax, who was sent to Washington D.C. as ambassador to the United States; [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] as [[Minister of Aircraft Production]]; Sir [[Kingsley Wood]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]] as Lord President of the Council \u2013 replacing Chamberlain who died in November (Anderson later became Chancellor after Kingsley Wood's death in September 1943). In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of [[Minister of Defence (UK)|Minister of Defence]], making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in British history.{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=264, 270\u2013271}}\n\nChurchill wanted people he knew and trusted to take part in government. Among these were personal friends like Beaverbrook and [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], who became the government's scientific advisor.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=41}} Lindemann was one of several outside exports drafted in and these \"technocrats\" fulfilled vital functions, especially on the Home Front.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=41}} Churchill would proudly proclaim that his government, in the interests of national unity, was the most broadly based in British political history as it spanned far right to far left by including such figures as [[George Lloyd, 1st Baron Lloyd|Lord Lloyd]] on the right and [[Ellen Wilkinson]] on the left.{{sfn|Hermiston|2016|p=41}}\n\n====Resolve to fight on====\n{{main|War cabinet crisis, May 1940}}\nAt the end of May, with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] in retreat to [[Dunkirk]] and the [[Fall of France]] seemingly imminent, Halifax proposed that the government should explore the possibility of a negotiated peace settlement using [[Mussolini]] as an intermediary given that Italy was still neutral. There were [[War cabinet crisis, May 1940|several high-level meetings]] from 26 to 28 May, including two with the French premier [[Paul Reynaud]]. Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. In the end, by gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over. The essence of Churchill's argument was that, as he said, \"it was idle to think that, if we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out\".<ref name=\"Schneer2015\">{{cite book|last=Schneer|first=Jonathan |title=Ministers at War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVIQBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT28|date=2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-614-2|pages=28\u201331}}</ref> He therefore concluded that the only option was to fight on though, at times, he personally was pessimistic about the chances of a British victory, as on 12 June 1940 when he told General [[Hastings Ismay]] that \"[y]ou and I will be dead in three months' time\".{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=249, 252\u2013255}} Nonetheless, his use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British people for a long war.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=616\u2013646}}\n\n====Importance of Churchill's speeches====\n[[File:Churchill CCathedral H 14250.jpg|thumb|Churchill walks through the ruins of [[Coventry Cathedral]] with [[Alfred Robert Grindlay]], 1941]]\n[[Operation Dynamo]], the evacuation of 338,226 Allied servicemen from Dunkirk, ended on Tuesday, 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered. The total was far in excess of expectations and it gave rise to a popular view that Dunkirk had been a miracle, and even a victory.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=597}} Churchill himself referred to \"a miracle of deliverance\" in his \"[[We shall fight on the beaches]]\" speech to the Commons that afternoon, though he shortly reminded everyone that: \"We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory.

His first as prime minister was the famous \"I have nothing to offer but [[blood, toil, tears, and sweat]]\" speech. One historian has called its effect on Parliament \"electrifying\". The House of Commons that had ignored him during the 1930s \"was now listening, and cheering\".{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=513, 515\u2013517}} Churchill followed that closely with two other equally famous speeches, given just before the [[Battle of Britain]].

Later that day, he accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the [[National Government (United Kingdom)#the caretaker government of 1945|National Government]], like the Conservative-dominated coalition of the 1930s, but in practice known as the [[Churchill caretaker ministry]]. The government contained Conservatives, [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] and a few non-party figures such as [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]] and [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]], but not Labour or [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Archibald Sinclair]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Official Liberals]].

Clementine, who together with their daughter Mary had been at the count at Churchill's constituency in Essex (although unopposed by the major parties, Churchill had been returned with a much-reduced majority against an independent candidate), returned to meet her husband for lunch. To her suggestion that election defeat might be \"a blessing in disguise\" he retorted that \"at the moment it seems very effectively disguised\". That afternoon Churchill's doctor Lord Moran (so he later recorded in his book ''The Struggle for Survival'') commiserated with him on the \"ingratitude\" of the British public, to which Churchill replied \"I wouldn't call it that. They have had a very hard time.\" Having lost the election, despite enjoying much support amongst the British population, he resigned as Prime Minister that evening, this time handing over to a Labour Government.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=57, 107\u2013109}} Many reasons for his defeat have been given, key among them being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=789\u2013794}} Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as Prime Minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed that this would be possible.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=113}}\n\nOn the morning of 27 July, Churchill held a farewell Cabinet.

Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill's premiership would most likely have been over.

These ministerial merits are not as common as might be thought.\"{{sfn|Rhodes James|1970|pp=33\u201334}}\n\n[[File:Winston churchil statue in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Churchill in Yael's Garden, [[Mishkenot Sha'ananim|Mishkanot Sha'ananim]], Jerusalem.]]\n\nChurchill's belief in the superiority of white Europeans, a widespread view among his contemporaries, has generated accusations of [[racism]].<ref name=\"heyden\">{{cite news|title=The 10 Greatest Controversies of Winston Churchill's Career |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29701767 |date=26 January 2015 |website=BBC News |last1=Heyden |first1=Tom |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref> His role in the Bengal Famine has been one source of particular criticism;<ref name=\"Churchill_hero_villain\"/> the historian Walter Reid has stated Churchill was \"very wrong in relation to India, where his conduct fell far below his usual level.\"<ref name=\"Churchill_look_Raj\">{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/A-new-look-at-the-Raj/article16932292.ece |title=A New Look at the Raj |website=The Hindu |first=Varma |last=Nikhil |date=23 December 2016 |accessdate=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1966 and 1988, an eight-volume biography of Churchill was published, started by Randolph Churchill but completed largely by [[Martin Gilbert]] after the former's death in 1968.{{sfnm|1a1=Rhodes James|1y=1970|1p=x|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=xv}} Rhodes James suggested that this [[official biography]] was a \"labour of love\" for Randolph Churchill, and that \"what was so admirable in the son, was ... less desirable in the biographer.\"{{sfn|Rhodes James|1970|p=x}} By 1980, there was already a very extensive published array of material on Churchill.{{sfn|Addison|1980|p=23}}\n\nChurchill's legacy continues to stir intense debate among writers and historians.<ref name=\"Churchill_hero_villain\"/> In 1980, Addison noted that there are many people \"so prejudiced for or against Churchill\" that they had no interest in critically assessing him as a historical figure.{{sfn|Addison|1980|p=23}} In 2018, the broadcaster [[Afua Hirsch]] described encounters with two historians who were concerned that researching more controversial elements of Churchill's life would hinder their academic career.<ref name=\"hirsch\">{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/21/russia-propaganda-skripal-britain-churchill | title= If you talk about Russian propaganda, remember: Britain has myths too | work=The Guardian | date=21 March 2018 | accessdate=15 April 2018 | location=London | first=Afua | last=Hirsch}}</ref>\n\nChurchill has been honoured throughout the Commonwealth, particularly in Canada.

He was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1940 to 1945, when he led Britain to victory in the [[Second World War]], and again from 1951 to 1955. Churchill represented five constituencies during his career as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP). Ideologically an [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]] and [[British Empire|imperialist]], for most of his career he was a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which he led from 1940 to 1955, but from 1904 to 1924 was a member of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].\n\n<!--Early life and career prior to the Second World War-->\nOf mixed [[English people|English]] and [[Americans|American]] parentage, Churchill was born in [[Oxfordshire]] to [[Spencer family|a wealthy, aristocratic family]]. He joined the [[British Army]] in 1895, and saw action in [[British Raj|British India]], the [[Mahdist War|Anglo\u2013Sudan War]], and the [[Second Boer War]], gaining fame as a [[war correspondent]] and writing books about his campaigns. Elected an MP in 1900, initially as a Conservative, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In [[H. H. Asquith]]'s [[Liberal government, 1905\u20131915|Liberal government]], Churchill served as [[President of the Board of Trade]], [[Home Secretary]], and [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], championing [[Liberal welfare reforms|prison reform and workers' social security]]. During the [[First World War]], he oversaw the [[Gallipoli campaign|Gallipoli Campaign]]; after it proved a disaster, he resigned from government and served in the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In 1917, he returned to government under [[David Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]], then as [[Secretary of State for War]] and [[Secretary of State for Air|Air]], and finally [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|for the Colonies]], overseeing the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and Britain's Middle East policy. After two years out of Parliament, he served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s [[Second Baldwin ministry|Conservative government]], returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the [[gold standard]] at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy.\n\n<!--Later life, the Second World War, and Cold War-->\nOut of office during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the [[appeasement|growing threat]] from [[Nazi Germany]]. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In 1940 he became prime minister, replacing [[Neville Chamberlain]]. Churchill oversaw British involvement in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort against Germany and the [[Axis powers]], resulting in victory in 1945. His wartime leadership was widely praised, although acts like the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Bombing of Dresden]] and his wartime response to the [[Bengal famine of 1943|Bengal famine]] generated controversy. After the Conservatives' defeat in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he became [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]]. Amid the developing [[Cold War]] with the [[Soviet Union]], he publicly warned of an \"[[Iron Curtain|iron curtain]]\" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. Re-elected Prime Minister in [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951]], his second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, including the [[Malayan Emergency]], [[Mau Mau Uprising]], [[Korean War]], and a UK-backed [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|Iranian coup]]. Domestically his government emphasised house-building and developed a nuclear weapon. In declining health, Churchill resigned as prime minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a [[State funerals in the United Kingdom|state funeral]].\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in Britain and throughout [[Western world|the West]], where he is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's [[liberal democracy]] from the spread of [[fascism]]. Praised as a social reformer and accomplished writer, among his many awards was the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Conversely, his imperialist views and comments on race, as well as his sanctioning of human rights abuses in the suppression of [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] movements seeking independence from the [[British Empire]], have generated considerable controversy.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood and schooling: 1874\u20131895===\n[[File:Blenheim Palace from the Water Terraces October 2016.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blenheim Palace]], Churchill's ancestral home and his birthplace]]\nChurchill was born at the family's ancestral home, [[Blenheim Palace]] in [[Oxfordshire]], on 30 November 1874,{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=5}} at which time the United Kingdom was the dominant world power.{{sfn|Best|2001|p=1}} Direct descendants of the [[Dukes of Marlborough]], his family were among the highest levels of the British aristocracy,{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2pp=3, 5}} and thus he was born into the country's governing elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Best|1y=2001|1p=2|2a1=Haffner|2y=2003|2p=2}} His paternal grandfather, [[John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough]], had been a Member of Parliament (MP) for ten years, a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] who served in the government of Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]].{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2pp=7\u20138}} His own father, [[Lord Randolph Churchill]], had been elected Conservative MP for [[Woodstock (UK Parliament constituency)|Woodstock]] in 1873.{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Best|2y=2001|2p=3|3a1=Jenkins|3y=2001|3p=4|4a1=Robbins|4y=2014|4p=2}} His mother, [[Lady Randolph Churchill|Jennie Churchill]] (n\u00e9e Jerome), was from an American family whose substantial wealth derived from finance.{{sfnm|1a1=Best|1y=2001|1p=4|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2pp=5\u20136|3a1=Addison|3y=2005|3p=7}} The couple had met in August 1873, and were engaged three days later, marrying at the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Paris|British Embassy in Paris]] in April 1874.{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1pp=5, 7|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2p=9|3a1=Robbins|3y=2014|3p=2}} The couple lived beyond their income and were frequently in debt;{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=6\u20137}} according to the biographer [[Sebastian Haffner]], the family were \"rich by normal standards but poor by those of the rich\".{{sfn|Haffner|2003|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Churchill 1881 ZZZ 7555D.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Churchill, aged six, in 1881{{sfn|Haffner|2003|p=4}}]]\nIn 1876 John Spencer-Churchill was appointed [[Viceroy of Ireland]], with Randolph as his private secretary, resulting in the Churchill family's relocation to [[Dublin]], when [[History of Ireland (1801\u20131923)|the entirety of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=1|2a1=Addison|2y=2005|2p=9}} It was here that Jennie's second son, [[John Strange Spencer-Churchill|Jack]], was born in 1880;{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=7|3a1=Addison|3y=2005|3p=10}} there has been speculation that Randolph was not his biological father.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} Throughout much of the 1880s Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged, and during this time she had many suitors.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=8}} Churchill had virtually no relationship with his father;{{sfnm|1a1=Jenkins|1y=2001|1p=10|2a1=Haffner|2y=2003|2p=13}} referring to his mother, Churchill later stated that \"I loved her dearly\u2014but at a distance.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1p=2|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=8|3a1=Reagles|3a2=Larsen|3y=2013|3p=8}} His relationship with Jack was warm.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} In Dublin, the brothers were cared for primarily by their nanny, [[Elizabeth Everest]].{{sfnm|1a1=Gilbert|1y=1991|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Jenkins|2y=2001|2p=10|3a1=Reagles|3a2=Larsen|3y=2013|3p=8}} Churchill nicknamed her \"Woomany\",{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=16, 29}} and later wrote that \"She had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived.\"{{sfn|Best|2001|p=6}}\n\nAged seven, he began [[boarding school|boarding]] at [[St. George's School, Ascot|St. George's School]] in [[Ascot, Berkshire]];

In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of [[Minister of Defence (UK)|Minister of Defence]], making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in British history.{{sfn|Blake|Louis|1993|pp=264, 270\u2013271}}\n\nChurchill wanted people he knew and trusted to take part in government.

There were [[War cabinet crisis, May 1940|several high-level meetings]] from 26 to 28 May, including two with the French premier [[Paul Reynaud]]. Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. In the end, by gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over.

Later that day, he accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the [[National Government (United Kingdom)#the caretaker government of 1945|National Government]], like the Conservative-dominated coalition of the 1930s, but in practice known as the [[Churchill caretaker ministry]]. The government contained Conservatives, [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] and a few non-party figures such as [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|Sir John Anderson]] and [[Frederick Marquis, 1st Earl of Woolton|Lord Woolton]], but not Labour or [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Archibald Sinclair]]'s [[Liberal Party (UK)|Official Liberals]]. Although Churchill continued to carry out the functions of Prime Minister, including exchanging messages with the US administration about the upcoming [[Potsdam Conference]], he was not formally reappointed until 28 May.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=22\u201323, 27}}\n\nAlthough polling day was 5 July, the results of the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]] did not become known until 26 July, owing to the need to collect the votes of those serving overseas. Clementine, who together with their daughter Mary had been at the count at Churchill's constituency in Essex (although unopposed by the major parties, Churchill had been returned with a much-reduced majority against an independent candidate), returned to meet her husband for lunch. To her suggestion that election defeat might be \"a blessing in disguise\" he retorted that \"at the moment it seems very effectively disguised\". That afternoon Churchill's doctor Lord Moran (so he later recorded in his book ''The Struggle for Survival'') commiserated with him on the \"ingratitude\" of the British public, to which Churchill replied \"I wouldn't call it that. They have had a very hard time.\" Having lost the election, despite enjoying much support amongst the British population, he resigned as Prime Minister that evening, this time handing over to a Labour Government.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=57, 107\u2013109}} Many reasons for his defeat have been given, key among them being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace.{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=789\u2013794}} Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as Prime Minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed that this would be possible.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=113}}\n\nOn the morning of 27 July, Churchill held a farewell Cabinet. On the way out of the Cabinet Room he told Eden: \"Thirty years of my life have been passed in this room. I shall never sit in it again. You will, but I shall not\".

Being a strong proponent of Britain as an [[power in international relations|international power]], Churchill would often meet such moments with [[direct action]].

The Truman Administration was supporting the plans for a [[European Defence Community]] (EDC), hoping that this would allow controlled West German rearmament and enable American troop reductions. Churchill affected to believe that the proposed EDC would not work, scoffing at the supposed difficulties of language. Churchill asked in vain for a US military commitment to support Britain's position in Egypt and the Middle East (where the Truman Administration had recently pressured Attlee not to intervene against [[Mohammad Mosaddegh|Mossadeq]] in Iran); this did not meet with American approval\u2014the US expected British support to fight communism in [[Korean War|Korea]], but saw any US commitment to the Middle East as supporting British imperialism, and were unpersuaded that this would help prevent pro-Soviet regimes from coming to power.{{sfn|Charmley|1995|p=255}}\n\nBy early 1953, the Cabinet's foreign policy priority was [[Egypt]] and the nationalist, anti-imperialist [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|Egyptian Revolution]].

Egypt had been a [[History of Egypt under the British|British client state]], under varying degrees of control and military occupation, since 1883. In 1953 Britain, keen to restore friendly relations, agreed to terminate her rule in the Sudan by 1956 in return for Egypt's abandoning of her own claim over the region. In October 1954, Britain and Egypt would conclude an agreement on the phased evacuation of British troops from the Suez base, to the dismay\u2014privately shared by Churchill\u2014of the \"Suez Group\" of Conservative backbenchers.{{sfn|Charmley|1995|pp=261, 277, 285}}\n\nAfter Stalin's death, Churchill, the last of the wartime Big Three, wrote to [[Dwight D.

Eden wrote to his son on 10 April \"W gets daily older & is apt to ... waste a great deal of time ... the outside world has little idea how difficult that becomes. Please make me retire before I am 80!\" However, Eden's serious illness (he nearly died after a series of botched operations on his bile duct) allowed Churchill to take control of foreign affairs from April 1953.{{sfn|Charmley|1995|pp=263\u2013265}}<ref>Gilbert, Martin.

The US Embassy in London noted that this was a rare occasion on which Churchill did not mention Anglo-American solidarity in a speech. Ministers like [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] (acting Foreign Secretary) and [[Anthony Nutting|Nutting]] were concerned at the irritation caused to the Americans and the French, although [[Selwyn Lloyd]] supported Churchill's initiative, as did most Conservatives.

Despite being partially paralysed down one side, he presided over a Cabinet meeting the next morning without anybody noticing his incapacity. Thereafter his condition deteriorated, and it was thought that he might not survive the weekend. Had Eden been fit, Churchill's premiership would most likely have been over. News of this was kept from the public and from Parliament, who were told that Churchill was suffering from exhaustion. He went to his country home, Chartwell, to recuperate, and by the end of June he astonished his doctors by being able, dripping with perspiration, to lift himself upright from his chair. He joked that news of his illness had chased the trial of [[John Christie (murderer)|the serial killer John Christie]] off the front pages.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=846\u201357}}{{sfn|Charmley|1995|p=266}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=868\u2013871}}\n\n[[File:Churchill queen Elizabeth 1953.jpg|thumb|Churchill with Queen [[Elizabeth II]], [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], 10 February 1953.]]\nChurchill was still keen to pursue a meeting with the Soviets and was open to the idea of a reunified Germany. He refused to condemn the Soviet crushing of East Germany, commenting on 10 July 1953 that \"The Russians were surprisingly patient about the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|disturbances in East Germany]]\". He thought this might have been the reason for the removal of [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]].{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|p=863}} Churchill returned to public life in October 1953 to make a speech at the Conservative Party conference at [[Margate]].{{sfn|Jenkins|2001|pp=868\u2013871}} In December 1953, Churchill met Eisenhower in Bermuda.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=936\u2013937}}\n\nChurchill was annoyed about friction between Eden and Dulles (June 1954). On the trip home from another Anglo-American conference, the diplomat [[Pierson Dixon]] compared [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat|US actions in Guatemala]] to Soviet policy in Korea and [[Greek Civil War|Greece]], causing Churchill to retort that Guatemala was a \"bloody place\" he'd \"never heard of\". Churchill was still keen for a trip to Moscow, and threatened to resign, provoking a crisis in the Cabinet when Lord Salisbury threatened to resign if Churchill had his way. In the end the Soviets proposed a five-power conference, which did not meet until after Churchill had retired. By the autumn Churchill was again postponing his resignation.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=1009\u201317}}{{sfn|Charmley|1995|pp=289\u2013291}}\n\nEden, now partially recovered from his operations, became a major figure on the world stage in 1954, helping to negotiate [[Geneva Conference (1954)|peace]] in [[First Indochina War|Indo-China]], an agreement with Egypt and to broker an agreement between the countries of Western Europe after the French rejection of the EDC.{{sfn|Gilbert|1991|pp=298\u2013300}} Aware that he was slowing down both physically and mentally, Churchill at last retired as prime minister in 1955 and was succeeded by Anthony Eden.

Despite the Conservative landslide, his own majority fell by more than a thousand. It is widely believed that as his mental and physical faculties decayed, he began to lose a battle he had supposedly long fought against depression. However, the nature, incidence and severity of Churchill's depression is uncertain.

After initial Serbian successes, in 1915 the [[Central Powers]] forced the Serbian Army to withdraw to [[Albania]] where the surviving elements of the army were evacuated. Serbian aviators were absorbed into French squadrons to support the French-led Allied force that pushed north from [[Salonika]],{{sfn|Sanger|2002|p=121}} and towards the end of the war, separate Serbian squadrons were again raised. After the end of World War I, in 1919 the [[South Slav]] peoples determined to form a new country, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and the existing Serbian air corps became the basis for the military air service of the new state. The chief of the fledgling air force was the former head of the Austro-Hungarian [[Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops]], [[Milan Emil Uzelac|Emil Uzelac]].{{sfn|Chant|2012|p=8}}\n\n===Early developments===\n[[File:Royal Yugoslav Bomber 23 at USAF.jpg|thumb|301x301px|512nd Bomber Squadron, Detachment of Yugoslav Bombers at USAF]]\nLack of funds meant that little could be done to improve military aviation in the first years of the new state, although in 1922, Uzelac went on a European tour to study military aviation in foreign armies. Efforts were also made to develop a civil aviation sector with a view to forming a reserve pool of pilots and mechanics.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=579}} The following year, Uzelac retired, and the British military attache noted that there were several former [[Russian Empire]] aviators serving in the air force, two of whom attempted to defect to the [[Soviet Union]] with an aircraft during that year.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|pp=624\u2013625}} In 1924, the first Yugoslav-built aircraft was produced at the [[Ikarbus|Ikarus]] plant in [[Novi Sad]], albeit with a foreign-made engine. The next year, 150 [[Breguet 19]] [[biplane]] [[light bomber]] and [[reconnaissance]] aircraft were purchased on credit from the French government, signalling the first significant expansion of the air force. The new aircraft were assembled at Novi Sad, then distributed to the other military aerodromes at [[Sarajevo]], [[Mostar]], [[Zagreb]] and [[Skopje]]. The Ikarus plant was producing training aircraft and [[seaplane]]s using Austrian engines captured at the end of World War I, and imported steel tubing and wire stays.  {{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=730}} In 1926, the aerodrome at [[Zemun]] was developed in order to provide a military airfield near the capital, [[Belgrade]], and a military air race was held for the first time, with a gold cup presented by [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]].{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|pp=775 & 777}}\n\nBy 1927, the air force had acquired [[Potez 25]] biplanes and [[Dewoitine]] single-seater [[fighter aircraft]], as well as some [[Hansa-Brandenburg]] and [[Hanriot (aircraft company)|Hanriot]] training aircraft.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=59}} The following year, a government aircraft factory at [[Kraljevo]] was completed, and a privately owned factory near Belgrade went into production, building French aircraft engines under licence. By the same year, the air force had also acquired [[Fizir F1V]] reconnaissance aircraft.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=123\u2013124}} In 1929, the British [[military attach\u00e9]] reported that the air force was making slow but steady improvements, but observed that the airfield at Novi Sad was the only one capable of supporting night flying. Chief among the deficiencies of the air arm were the lack of advanced repair and maintenance facilities at the various regional airfields such as those at Zagreb or Sarajevo. It was concluded that this meant the Yugoslav air force would be unable to keep aircraft in the air for any period of conflict beyond a few weeks. The factory at Kraljevo was apparently capable of producing around 50 licence-built Breguet 19 aircraft per year.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\n===1930s===\nIn 1930, workshops were completed at the airfields at Zagreb and Mostar, allowing for repairs and modifications to be carried out without transferring aircraft to the main factories and workshops closer to the capital. In May of that year, the first aircraft of entirely Yugoslav manufacture was completed at Kraljevo, and it was estimated that factory was capable of producing 100 Breguet 19 aircraft per year. At this time, the factory had a French workforce and was under French management, but the contract was due to expire in 1932, after which the Yugoslav government would be at liberty to produce whichever aircraft it could obtain licences to build. The privately owned Ikarus plant at Zemun continued to produce seaplanes of its own design as well as Potez 25 aircraft under licence. The strength of the air force was estimated at 26 squadrons of about twelve aircraft each, indicating a total of approximately 312 aircraft, although there were almost no reserve aircraft.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=244\u2013245}}\n[[File:Hawker Fury MkI K5674 in hangar 2 (5922642350).jpg|thumb|In 1931, the air force obtained three Hawker Fury fighters for evaluation.|alt=|left]]\nDuring 1931, no additional squadrons were raised, but a reserve of aircraft was built up, so that around 200 machines were stored at the various regional airfields. The British military attache assessed that the standard of pilot training remained deficient, with a significant number of aircraft being put out of action each year due to accidents. During the same year, the air force obtained three [[Hawker Fury]] aircraft for evaluation, two fitted with [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]] engines, and one with a [[Hispano-Suiza]] engine. This was viewed with alarm by the French, who had thus far had a strong influence over Yugoslav aviation procurement.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=318}}\n\nDuring 1932, there were significant problems of morale and discipline due to subversion within the 2nd Air Regiment near Sarajevo.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=385}} Steady progress continued to be made in developing the air force, but several weaknesses were evident, including; lack of first-class aircraft, dependence on foreign sources for the bulk of aviation construction material, inadequate repair and maintenance facilities, the slow development of the home-grown aircraft industry, and the negative influence exerted by senior army officers with no aviation experience or knowledge. It was acknowledged that the air force had no difficulty in attracting high quality recruits, and the Sarajevo incident aside, that morale and discipline were high within the air arm. Two additional squadrons were added to each of the six air regiments during 1932. As a result, the number of aircraft in service increased to approximately 430, with a reserve of 300. The state factory at Kraljevo produced about 150 Breguet 19 aircraft during the year, with forty Potez 25s also being delivered from the Ikarus factory. Six bombers were obtained for evaluation during the year; two each from [[Junkers]], [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] and [[Fokker]].{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=389\u2013390}}\n\nIn the early months of 1933, a war scare with Italy betrayed significant deficiencies in stocks of aircraft bombs and fuel reserves. During that year the Yugoslav government tendered for twenty single-seat fighter aircraft. Six aircraft were recommended for consideration, in priority order; a Polish [[PZL]], the Hawker Fury, a Dewoitine, two Fokkers and a Czechoslovak [[Avia]]. The tender included the production of another twenty aircraft under licence, and a further fifty machines to either be purchased or built locally under licence. An acquisition program for medium reconnaissance aircraft was also being considered, while evaluation of bombers continued. Also in 1933, the headquarters of the 1st Air Brigade was transferred to Zemun. There were thirty-six squadrons in the six air regiments, with each regiment consisting of six squadrons split between three groups, with an additional squadron at regimental level maintained for liaison duties and skill maintenance of reserve pilots. In addition to these forty-two squadrons, there were a number of training squadrons and an experimental group. The reserve aircraft numbered approximately 250. Night flying training was carried out throughout the summer over Belgrade, and anti-aircraft training in the city was carried out in cooperation with the air force. Each regiment conducted air gunnery training once per year.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=448\u2013450}} Despite the availability of funds for the acquisition of new modern aircraft, no decision was made during 1934, although the Polish PZL fighter was ruled out as unsuitable. Little night flying was conducted, and it became apparent that reserves of aircraft were not as high as believed.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=536\u2013537}}\n\nOn 19 September 1935, the Yugoslav government signed a contract to purchase ten Hawker Fury fighters and sixty-five Rolls-Royce engines. At the same time, a licence was obtained to build the Hawker Fury locally, and an option was also taken out on building Rolls-Royce engines in-country. Despite funds being available, no other purchases were made during the year, with air force strength being estimated at 400 Breguet 19s, 200 Potez 25s, a few Avia and Dewoitine aircraft, and the six bombers previously purchased for trial purposes. Basic pilot training was fair, with less accidents, but instrument flying training was rare. The Yugoslav air service was almost entirely equipped with obsolete aircraft, but despite this, the morale of aircrew was good and there was no shortage of young men wishing to fly. A licence was also obtained for the local manufacture of captive balloons.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=638\u2013639}}\n\nIn 1936, General [[Milutin Nedi\u0107]] was replaced as chief of the VVKJ by General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] upon the appointment of the former as [[Chief of the General Staff (Yugoslavia)|Chief of the General Staff]]. Simovi\u0107 had previously served as second-in-command of the VVKJ.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=735}} There were few developments of note during the year, with the obsolete fleet continuing to decline, and even the state aircraft factory at Kraljevo was largely idle except for the production of spare parts for the large number of Breguet 19 aircraft still in service. The Ikarus and Zmaj factories at Zemun installed plant and equipment for the production of the Hawker Fury under licence, but the delivery of the ten purchased aircraft was not expected until March 1937, and it was not expected that any of the locally made aircraft would be delivered until May of that year. Ikarus also produced several [[Avia BH-33]]E fighters and overhauled a large number of Potez 25 aircraft during the year. A prototype [[Dornier Do 17]] light bomber with [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne Mistral Major|Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne]] engines were ordered, with a further order for nineteen more aircraft pending a successful trial.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=739\u2013741}}\n\n===Consolidation and modernization===\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=June 2011}}\n[[File:IK-3 piloti.jpg|thumb|right|350px|IK-3 pilots from sixth regiment.]]\n\nBy 1941 the JKRV, with a strength of 1,875 officers and 29,527 other ranks,{{sfn|Cigli\u0107|Savi\u0107|2007|p=22}} had over 460 front-line aircraft of domestic (notably the [[IK-3]]), German, Italian, French, and British origin, of which most were modern types. Organized into twenty-two bomber squadrons and nineteen fighter squadrons, the main aircraft types in operational use included seventy-three [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf 109 E]], forty-seven [[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Hurricane I]] (with more being built under licence in Yugoslavia), thirty [[Hawker Fury|Hawker Fury II]], eleven Rogozarski [[IK-3]] fighters (plus more under construction), ten [[Ikarus IK-2]], 2 [[Potez 63]], one [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]C-4 (captured in early April due to a navigational error) and one Rogozarski R 313 fighters, sixty-nine [[Dornier Do 17|Dornier Do 17 K]] (including 40 plus licence-built), sixty-one [[Bristol Blenheim|Bristol Blenheim I]] (including some 40 licence-built) and forty [[SM-79|Savoia Marchetti SM-79 K]] bombers. Army reconnaissance units comprised seven Groups with 130 obsolete Yugoslav-built [[Breguet 19]] and [[Potez 25]] light bombers. The Naval Aviation units comprised 75 aircraft in eight squadrons equipped with, amongst other auxiliary types, twelve German-built [[Dornier Do 22|Dornier Do 22 K]] and fifteen [[Rogozarski SIM-XIV-H]] locally designed and built maritime patrol float-planes.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=187\u2013192}}\n\nThe aircraft of the Yugoslav airline [[Aeroput]], consisting mainly of six [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra]]s, three [[Spartan Cruiser]]s, and one [[de Havilland Dragon]] were mobilised to provide transport services to the VVKJ.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=260}}\n\nThe situation whereby the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had to acquire or manufacture aircraft from whatever source presented itself meant that by 1941, the VVKJ was rather uniquely equipped with 11 different types of operational aircraft, 14 different types of trainers and five types of auxiliary aircraft, with 22 different engine models, four different machine guns and two types of aircraft cannon.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=173}}\n\nThe Yugoslav manufactured Dornier Do 17K, for example, was a German aircraft with French 1000&nbsp;hp Gnome-Rhone engines, Belgian armament from Fabrique Nationale, Czech photo-recon equipment and locally produced Yugoslav instrumentation.\n\nDuring 1938, the Yugoslav government purchased 12 Hurricane Is for the Royal Yugoslav Air Force and followed this up with an order for another 12 together with a manufacturing licence to allow production of the fighter at the Rogozarski (orders for 60) and Zmaj (orders for 40) factories. These plants, together with the Ikarus concern, had been designing and manufacturing sporting and training aircraft since the 1920s. Production was expected to reach eight per month from each assembly line by mid-1941. In the event, by the time of the German onslaught of April 1941, which put an end to further production, Zmaj had delivered 20 Hurricanes but Rogorzarski had delivered none.\n\nThe local design team working on improved versions of the IK-3 fighter had originally planned to power later IK-3s with new 1,100 h.p. Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51 engine. The German occupation of France had frustrated this plan, and British or German engines were considered. The Air Ministry favoured the DB 601 A, and as part of IK-3 development program, a Daimler-Benz engine was installed experimentally in a Hurricane airframe in 1940.\n\nEngineers Ilic and Sivcev at the Ikarus plant Zemun, outside Belgrade, made the conversion by the fitting of new engine bearers, cowlings and cooling systems manufactured at the Ikarus factory. The one Hurricane fitted with a DB601A engine for comparison with the Merlin-engined version was tested early in 1941. It was given the designation \"LVT-1\".\n\nThe conversion was extremely successful, and experimental aircraft displayed better take-off performance and climb rate than either the standard Hurricane or the Bf 109 E-3 and was only slightly slower than the latter. VVKJ pilots who flew the Hurricane conversion considered it to be superior to the standard model.<ref>Half-Century Hurricane in ''Air International'', Vol. 33, No. 1, July 1987. Fine Scroll, London ISSN 0306-5634</ref>\n\nAt the same time, a 1,030 h.p. Rolls-Royce Merlin III was installed in one of the IK-3 airframes, but this machine had only just been completed at the time of the German attack, and as enemy forces neared Belgrade it was destroyed by the factory workers, together with four other IK-3s undergoing overhaul or modification and a further 25 on the production line.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Avion aeroput mms-3.jpg|thumb|250px|In March 1941 the sole production [[Aeroput MMS-3]] commenced service with the 603rd Auxiliary Squadron of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force as a liaison aircraft.|alt=|left]]\nDuring [[1940 in aviation|1940]] Britain supplied significant military aid to the VVKJ, to strengthen its forces against the increasing German threat. In early March 1941, the German [[Luftwaffe]] forces started arriving in neighboring [[Bulgaria]]. On March 12, [[1941 in aviation|1941]], VVKJ units began to deploy to their wartime airfields. On 27 March 1941, the overthrow of the government that had signed the Tripartite Pact in [[Belgrade]] two days earlier, by a group of officers led by [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]], an air force general, brought an end to hopes of a settlement with Germany.{{sfn|Alexander Prusin|2017|p=22}}\n\nOn 3 April 1941, Kapetan [[Vladimir Kren]] defected in a [[Potez 25]], taking with him intelligence about the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force, documents that he handed over to the Germans. He would later become Commander in Chief of the [[Croatian Air Force (Independent State of Croatia)|ZNDH]], the air force of the nazi puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]].{{sfn|Cigli\u0107|Savi\u0107|2002|p=10}}\n\nOn April 6, 1941, ''Luftwaffe'' units in Bulgaria and [[Romania]] attacked [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during the [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|Bombing of Belgrade]]. Equipped with a combination of obsolete equipment and new aircraft still being introduced into service, the VVKJ was forced to defend the country's long borders against multiple attacks from many directions. The dubious loyalty of some military personnel did not help matters. Yugoslav fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery brought down about 90\u2013100 enemy aircraft, but defending forces were unable to make any significant impact on the enemy advance. During the attack of German aircraft on [[Ni\u0161]] Airport Medo\u0161evac on 6 April around 08:00, fire from the ground shot down the plane of German fighter ace [[Herbert Ihlefeld]]. Captain Ihlefeld, who was credited with over forty air victories, was shot down by Corporal Vlasta Beli\u0107, firing a Darne machine gun, caliber 7.69&nbsp;mm, taken from a Yugoslav [[Breguet 19]]. Having received a shot in the oil cooler, the [[Bf 109]]'s engine stopped, and the pilot was forced to leave the plane. He rescued himself with a parachute about 35 miles southeast of Nis. The German ace was captured by Serbian peasants who handed him over to the gendarmes. On April 17, 1941, the Yugoslav government surrendered. Several VVKJ aircraft escaped to [[Egypt]] via the [[Kingdom of Greece]], and the crews then served with the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).\n\nBy the outbreak of the Second World War, Yugoslavia had a substantial air force with its own aircraft, aircraft from Allied countries like Britain and aircraft from Axis countries like Germany and Italy. In 1940, Britain attempted to bring Yugoslavia to the Allied side by supplying military aid to the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, including new [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighter aircraft. However Germany sold a large number of [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters to Yugoslavia and in early 1941, and German dismay towards a Balkans campaign convinced Yugoslavia to join the Axis forces.\n\nAlthough Yugoslavia joined the Axis powers, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Fascist Italy]] demanded that their ally [[Nazi Germany]] invade Yugoslavia in order to reach Greece and help their disastrous campaign there and in the process break up Yugoslavia since Italians were laying claim on certain territories (mostly [[Dalmatia]]). The German [[Luftwaffe]] then began to mass at the borders of Yugoslavia from allied Axis nations. The VVKJ was forced to stretch out to defend Yugoslavia from an apparent invasion and imminent air war.<ref>[http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/yugo/jkrv/yugo-af1-home.htm]</ref>[[File:Spomenik pilotima 1941.JPG|thumb|250px|Monument to pilots who died defending Belgrade in the air battle against [[Luftwaffe]] on April 1941.]]Following the [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on March 25, 1941, the Yugoslav armed forces were put on alert, although the army was not fully mobilized for fear of provoking Hitler&nbsp;\u2013 to no avail. The VVKJ command decided to disperse its forces away from their main bases to a system of auxiliary airfields that had previously been prepared. However many of these airfields lacked facilities and had inadequate drainage which prevented the continued operation of all but the very lightest aircraft in the adverse weather conditions encountered in April 1941).{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=177}}\n\nDespite having, on paper at any rate, a substantially stronger force of relatively modern aircraft than the combined British and Greek air forces to the south, the VVKJ could simply not match the overwhelming ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Regia Aeronautica'' superiority in terms of numbers, tactical deployment and combat experience.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=178}}\n\nThe bomber eskadrilla (the equivalent of 22 squadrons) and maritime air force hit targets in Italy, Germany (Austria), Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania and Greece, as well as attacking German, Italian and Hungarian troops. Meanwhile, the fighter eskadrilla (the equivalent of 19 squadrons) inflicted not insignificant losses on escorted Luftwaffe bomber raids on Belgrade and Serbia, as well as upon Regia Aeronautica raids on Dalmatia and Herzegovina, whilst also providing air support to the hard pressed Yugoslav Army by strafing attacking troop columns in Croatia, Bosnia, Macedonia and Serbia (sometimes taking off and strafing the troops attacking the very base being evacuated).{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=178\u2013229}}\n\nLittle wonder then that after a combination of air combat losses, losses on the ground to enemy air attack on bases and the overrunning of airfields by enemy troops that after 11 days the VVKJ almost ceased to exist. It must, however, be noted that between 6 and 17 April 1941 the VVKJ received an additional 8 [[Hawker Hurricane]] Is, 6 [[Dornier Do 17K]]s, 4 [[Bristol Blenheim I]]s, 2 [[Ikarus IK 2]]s, 1 [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] and 1 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] from the aircraft factories and workshops.{{sfn|Cigli\u0107|Savi\u0107|2002|p=8}}\n\nSome 70 or so operational and training aircraft succeeded in escaping to Greece and 4 to Russia (8 [[Dornier Do 17K|Do 17Ks]] and [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79K|SM.79Ks]] set out, but half were lost due to poor weather conditions, mountainous terrain and/or overloading). But further tragedy was to befall even these escapees with some 44 destroyed on the ground at the airfield of Paramitia in Greece by marauding German and Italian fighters. In the end only 3 [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra|Lockheed 10s]], 2 Do 17Ks, 4 SM.79Ks, 8 [[Dornier Do 22K|Do 22K]] floatplanes and 1 [[Rogo\u017earski SIM-XIV-H|SIM XIVH]] floatplane reached the Allied base of Egypt in May 1941.\n\nThe [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] came into existence in July 1941 with over 200 captured aircraft. [[Yugoslav Partisans]] were themselves able to form an air force in 1943 from captured aircraft from the Croatian Air Force.\n\n==Inventory==\n===Aircraft (April 1941)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

After initial Serbian successes, in 1915 the [[Central Powers]] forced the Serbian Army to withdraw to [[Albania]] where the surviving elements of the army were evacuated. Serbian aviators were absorbed into French squadrons to support the French-led Allied force that pushed north from [[Salonika]],{{sfn|Sanger|2002|p=121}} and towards the end of the war, separate Serbian squadrons were again raised. After the end of World War I, in 1919 the [[South Slav]] peoples determined to form a new country, the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], and the existing Serbian air corps became the basis for the military air service of the new state. The chief of the fledgling air force was the former head of the Austro-Hungarian [[Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops]], [[Milan Emil Uzelac|Emil Uzelac]].{{sfn|Chant|2012|p=8}}\n\n===Early developments===\n[[File:Royal Yugoslav Bomber 23 at USAF.jpg|thumb|301x301px|512nd Bomber Squadron, Detachment of Yugoslav Bombers at USAF]]\nLack of funds meant that little could be done to improve military aviation in the first years of the new state, although in 1922, Uzelac went on a European tour to study military aviation in foreign armies. Efforts were also made to develop a civil aviation sector with a view to forming a reserve pool of pilots and mechanics.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=579}} The following year, Uzelac retired, and the British military attache noted that there were several former [[Russian Empire]] aviators serving in the air force, two of whom attempted to defect to the [[Soviet Union]] with an aircraft during that year.{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|pp=624\u2013625}} In 1924, the first Yugoslav-built aircraft was produced at the [[Ikarbus|Ikarus]] plant in [[Novi Sad]], albeit with a foreign-made engine. The next year, 150 [[Breguet 19]] [[biplane]] [[light bomber]] and [[reconnaissance]] aircraft were purchased on credit from the French government, signalling the first significant expansion of the air force. The new aircraft were assembled at Novi Sad, then distributed to the other military aerodromes at [[Sarajevo]], [[Mostar]], [[Zagreb]] and [[Skopje]]. The Ikarus plant was producing training aircraft and [[seaplane]]s using Austrian engines captured at the end of World War I, and imported steel tubing and wire stays.  {{sfn|Jarman|1997a|p=730}} In 1926, the aerodrome at [[Zemun]] was developed in order to provide a military airfield near the capital, [[Belgrade]], and a military air race was held for the first time, with a gold cup presented by [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]].{{sfn|Jarman|1997a|pp=775 & 777}}\n\nBy 1927, the air force had acquired [[Potez 25]] biplanes and [[Dewoitine]] single-seater [[fighter aircraft]], as well as some [[Hansa-Brandenburg]] and [[Hanriot (aircraft company)|Hanriot]] training aircraft.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=59}} The following year, a government aircraft factory at [[Kraljevo]] was completed, and a privately owned factory near Belgrade went into production, building French aircraft engines under licence. By the same year, the air force had also acquired [[Fizir F1V]] reconnaissance aircraft.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=123\u2013124}} In 1929, the British [[military attach\u00e9]] reported that the air force was making slow but steady improvements, but observed that the airfield at Novi Sad was the only one capable of supporting night flying. Chief among the deficiencies of the air arm were the lack of advanced repair and maintenance facilities at the various regional airfields such as those at Zagreb or Sarajevo. It was concluded that this meant the Yugoslav air force would be unable to keep aircraft in the air for any period of conflict beyond a few weeks. The factory at Kraljevo was apparently capable of producing around 50 licence-built Breguet 19 aircraft per year.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\n===1930s===\nIn 1930, workshops were completed at the airfields at Zagreb and Mostar, allowing for repairs and modifications to be carried out without transferring aircraft to the main factories and workshops closer to the capital. In May of that year, the first aircraft of entirely Yugoslav manufacture was completed at Kraljevo, and it was estimated that factory was capable of producing 100 Breguet 19 aircraft per year. At this time, the factory had a French workforce and was under French management, but the contract was due to expire in 1932, after which the Yugoslav government would be at liberty to produce whichever aircraft it could obtain licences to build. The privately owned Ikarus plant at Zemun continued to produce seaplanes of its own design as well as Potez 25 aircraft under licence. The strength of the air force was estimated at 26 squadrons of about twelve aircraft each, indicating a total of approximately 312 aircraft, although there were almost no reserve aircraft.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=244\u2013245}}\n[[File:Hawker Fury MkI K5674 in hangar 2 (5922642350).jpg|thumb|In 1931, the air force obtained three Hawker Fury fighters for evaluation.|alt=|left]]\nDuring 1931, no additional squadrons were raised, but a reserve of aircraft was built up, so that around 200 machines were stored at the various regional airfields. The British military attache assessed that the standard of pilot training remained deficient, with a significant number of aircraft being put out of action each year due to accidents. During the same year, the air force obtained three [[Hawker Fury]] aircraft for evaluation, two fitted with [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]] engines, and one with a [[Hispano-Suiza]] engine. This was viewed with alarm by the French, who had thus far had a strong influence over Yugoslav aviation procurement.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=318}}\n\nDuring 1932, there were significant problems of morale and discipline due to subversion within the 2nd Air Regiment near Sarajevo.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=385}} Steady progress continued to be made in developing the air force, but several weaknesses were evident, including; lack of first-class aircraft, dependence on foreign sources for the bulk of aviation construction material, inadequate repair and maintenance facilities, the slow development of the home-grown aircraft industry, and the negative influence exerted by senior army officers with no aviation experience or knowledge. It was acknowledged that the air force had no difficulty in attracting high quality recruits, and the Sarajevo incident aside, that morale and discipline were high within the air arm. Two additional squadrons were added to each of the six air regiments during 1932. As a result, the number of aircraft in service increased to approximately 430, with a reserve of 300. The state factory at Kraljevo produced about 150 Breguet 19 aircraft during the year, with forty Potez 25s also being delivered from the Ikarus factory. Six bombers were obtained for evaluation during the year; two each from [[Junkers]], [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] and [[Fokker]].{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=389\u2013390}}\n\nIn the early months of 1933, a war scare with Italy betrayed significant deficiencies in stocks of aircraft bombs and fuel reserves. During that year the Yugoslav government tendered for twenty single-seat fighter aircraft. Six aircraft were recommended for consideration, in priority order; a Polish [[PZL]], the Hawker Fury, a Dewoitine, two Fokkers and a Czechoslovak [[Avia]]. The tender included the production of another twenty aircraft under licence, and a further fifty machines to either be purchased or built locally under licence. An acquisition program for medium reconnaissance aircraft was also being considered, while evaluation of bombers continued. Also in 1933, the headquarters of the 1st Air Brigade was transferred to Zemun. There were thirty-six squadrons in the six air regiments, with each regiment consisting of six squadrons split between three groups, with an additional squadron at regimental level maintained for liaison duties and skill maintenance of reserve pilots. In addition to these forty-two squadrons, there were a number of training squadrons and an experimental group. The reserve aircraft numbered approximately 250. Night flying training was carried out throughout the summer over Belgrade, and anti-aircraft training in the city was carried out in cooperation with the air force. Each regiment conducted air gunnery training once per year.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=448\u2013450}} Despite the availability of funds for the acquisition of new modern aircraft, no decision was made during 1934, although the Polish PZL fighter was ruled out as unsuitable. Little night flying was conducted, and it became apparent that reserves of aircraft were not as high as believed.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=536\u2013537}}\n\nOn 19 September 1935, the Yugoslav government signed a contract to purchase ten Hawker Fury fighters and sixty-five Rolls-Royce engines. At the same time, a licence was obtained to build the Hawker Fury locally, and an option was also taken out on building Rolls-Royce engines in-country. Despite funds being available, no other purchases were made during the year, with air force strength being estimated at 400 Breguet 19s, 200 Potez 25s, a few Avia and Dewoitine aircraft, and the six bombers previously purchased for trial purposes. Basic pilot training was fair, with less accidents, but instrument flying training was rare. The Yugoslav air service was almost entirely equipped with obsolete aircraft, but despite this, the morale of aircrew was good and there was no shortage of young men wishing to fly. A licence was also obtained for the local manufacture of captive balloons.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=638\u2013639}}\n\nIn 1936, General [[Milutin Nedi\u0107]] was replaced as chief of the VVKJ by General [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]] upon the appointment of the former as [[Chief of the General Staff (Yugoslavia)|Chief of the General Staff]]. Simovi\u0107 had previously served as second-in-command of the VVKJ.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|p=735}} There were few developments of note during the year, with the obsolete fleet continuing to decline, and even the state aircraft factory at Kraljevo was largely idle except for the production of spare parts for the large number of Breguet 19 aircraft still in service. The Ikarus and Zmaj factories at Zemun installed plant and equipment for the production of the Hawker Fury under licence, but the delivery of the ten purchased aircraft was not expected until March 1937, and it was not expected that any of the locally made aircraft would be delivered until May of that year. Ikarus also produced several [[Avia BH-33]]E fighters and overhauled a large number of Potez 25 aircraft during the year. A prototype [[Dornier Do 17]] light bomber with [[Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne Mistral Major|Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne]] engines were ordered, with a further order for nineteen more aircraft pending a successful trial.{{sfn|Jarman|1997b|pp=739\u2013741}}\n\n===Consolidation and modernization===\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=June 2011}}\n[[File:IK-3 piloti.jpg|thumb|right|350px|IK-3 pilots from sixth regiment.]]\n\nBy 1941 the JKRV, with a strength of 1,875 officers and 29,527 other ranks,{{sfn|Cigli\u0107|Savi\u0107|2007|p=22}} had over 460 front-line aircraft of domestic (notably the [[IK-3]]), German, Italian, French, and British origin, of which most were modern types. Organized into twenty-two bomber squadrons and nineteen fighter squadrons, the main aircraft types in operational use included seventy-three [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf 109 E]], forty-seven [[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Hurricane I]] (with more being built under licence in Yugoslavia), thirty [[Hawker Fury|Hawker Fury II]], eleven Rogozarski [[IK-3]] fighters (plus more under construction), ten [[Ikarus IK-2]], 2 [[Potez 63]], one [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]C-4 (captured in early April due to a navigational error) and one Rogozarski R 313 fighters, sixty-nine [[Dornier Do 17|Dornier Do 17 K]] (including 40 plus licence-built), sixty-one [[Bristol Blenheim|Bristol Blenheim I]] (including some 40 licence-built) and forty [[SM-79|Savoia Marchetti SM-79 K]] bombers. Army reconnaissance units comprised seven Groups with 130 obsolete Yugoslav-built [[Breguet 19]] and [[Potez 25]] light bombers. The Naval Aviation units comprised 75 aircraft in eight squadrons equipped with, amongst other auxiliary types, twelve German-built [[Dornier Do 22|Dornier Do 22 K]] and fifteen [[Rogozarski SIM-XIV-H]] locally designed and built maritime patrol float-planes.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=187\u2013192}}\n\nThe aircraft of the Yugoslav airline [[Aeroput]], consisting mainly of six [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra]]s, three [[Spartan Cruiser]]s, and one [[de Havilland Dragon]] were mobilised to provide transport services to the VVKJ.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=260}}\n\nThe situation whereby the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had to acquire or manufacture aircraft from whatever source presented itself meant that by 1941, the VVKJ was rather uniquely equipped with 11 different types of operational aircraft, 14 different types of trainers and five types of auxiliary aircraft, with 22 different engine models, four different machine guns and two types of aircraft cannon.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=173}}\n\nThe Yugoslav manufactured Dornier Do 17K, for example, was a German aircraft with French 1000&nbsp;hp Gnome-Rhone engines, Belgian armament from Fabrique Nationale, Czech photo-recon equipment and locally produced Yugoslav instrumentation.\n\nDuring 1938, the Yugoslav government purchased 12 Hurricane Is for the Royal Yugoslav Air Force and followed this up with an order for another 12 together with a manufacturing licence to allow production of the fighter at the Rogozarski (orders for 60) and Zmaj (orders for 40) factories. These plants, together with the Ikarus concern, had been designing and manufacturing sporting and training aircraft since the 1920s. Production was expected to reach eight per month from each assembly line by mid-1941. In the event, by the time of the German onslaught of April 1941, which put an end to further production, Zmaj had delivered 20 Hurricanes but Rogorzarski had delivered none.\n\nThe local design team working on improved versions of the IK-3 fighter had originally planned to power later IK-3s with new 1,100 h.p. Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51 engine. The German occupation of France had frustrated this plan, and British or German engines were considered. The Air Ministry favoured the DB 601 A, and as part of IK-3 development program, a Daimler-Benz engine was installed experimentally in a Hurricane airframe in 1940.\n\nEngineers Ilic and Sivcev at the Ikarus plant Zemun, outside Belgrade, made the conversion by the fitting of new engine bearers, cowlings and cooling systems manufactured at the Ikarus factory. The one Hurricane fitted with a DB601A engine for comparison with the Merlin-engined version was tested early in 1941. It was given the designation \"LVT-1\".\n\nThe conversion was extremely successful, and experimental aircraft displayed better take-off performance and climb rate than either the standard Hurricane or the Bf 109 E-3 and was only slightly slower than the latter. VVKJ pilots who flew the Hurricane conversion considered it to be superior to the standard model.<ref>Half-Century Hurricane in ''Air International'', Vol. 33, No. 1, July 1987. Fine Scroll, London ISSN 0306-5634</ref>\n\nAt the same time, a 1,030 h.p. Rolls-Royce Merlin III was installed in one of the IK-3 airframes, but this machine had only just been completed at the time of the German attack, and as enemy forces neared Belgrade it was destroyed by the factory workers, together with four other IK-3s undergoing overhaul or modification and a further 25 on the production line.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Avion aeroput mms-3.jpg|thumb|250px|In March 1941 the sole production [[Aeroput MMS-3]] commenced service with the 603rd Auxiliary Squadron of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force as a liaison aircraft.|alt=|left]]\nDuring [[1940 in aviation|1940]] Britain supplied significant military aid to the VVKJ, to strengthen its forces against the increasing German threat. In early March 1941, the German [[Luftwaffe]] forces started arriving in neighboring [[Bulgaria]]. On March 12, [[1941 in aviation|1941]], VVKJ units began to deploy to their wartime airfields. On 27 March 1941, the overthrow of the government that had signed the Tripartite Pact in [[Belgrade]] two days earlier, by a group of officers led by [[Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107]], an air force general, brought an end to hopes of a settlement with Germany.{{sfn|Alexander Prusin|2017|p=22}} \n\nOn 3 April 1941, Kapetan [[Vladimir Kren]] defected in a [[Potez 25|Potez 25,]] taking with him intelligence about the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force, documents that he handed over to the Germans. He would later become Commander in Chief of the [[Croatian Air Force (Independent State of Croatia)|ZNDH]], the air force of the nazi puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]].{{sfn|Cigli\u0107|Savi\u0107|2002|p=10}}\n\nOn April 6, 1941, ''Luftwaffe'' units in Bulgaria and [[Romania]] attacked [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during the [[Bombing of Belgrade in World War II|Bombing of Belgrade]]. Equipped with a combination of obsolete equipment and new aircraft still being introduced into service, the VVKJ was forced to defend the country's long borders against multiple attacks from many directions. The dubious loyalty of some military personnel did not help matters. Yugoslav fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery brought down about 90\u2013100 enemy aircraft, but defending forces were unable to make any significant impact on the enemy advance. During the attack of German aircraft on [[Ni\u0161]] Airport Medo\u0161evac on 6 April around 08:00, fire from the ground shot down the plane of German fighter ace [[Herbert Ihlefeld]]. Captain Ihlefeld, who was credited with over forty air victories, was shot down by Corporal Vlasta Beli\u0107, firing a Darne machine gun, caliber 7.69&nbsp;mm, taken from a Yugoslav [[Breguet 19]]. Having received a shot in the oil cooler, the [[Bf 109]]'s engine stopped, and the pilot was forced to leave the plane. He rescued himself with a parachute about 35 miles southeast of Nis. The German ace was captured by Serbian peasants who handed him over to the gendarmes. On April 17, 1941, the Yugoslav government surrendered. Several VVKJ aircraft escaped to [[Egypt]] via the [[Kingdom of Greece]], and the crews then served with the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).\n\nBy the outbreak of the Second World War, Yugoslavia had a substantial air force with its own aircraft, aircraft from Allied countries like Britain and aircraft from Axis countries like Germany and Italy. In 1940, Britain attempted to bring Yugoslavia to the Allied side by supplying military aid to the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, including new [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighter aircraft. However Germany sold a large number of [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters to Yugoslavia and in early 1941, and German dismay towards a Balkans campaign convinced Yugoslavia to join the Axis forces.\n\nAlthough Yugoslavia joined the Axis powers, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Fascist Italy]] demanded that their ally [[Nazi Germany]] invade Yugoslavia in order to reach Greece and help their disastrous campaign there and in the process break up Yugoslavia since Italians were laying claim on certain territories (mostly [[Dalmatia]]). The German [[Luftwaffe]] then began to mass at the borders of Yugoslavia from allied Axis nations. The VVKJ was forced to stretch out to defend Yugoslavia from an apparent invasion and imminent air war.<ref>[http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/yugo/jkrv/yugo-af1-home.htm]</ref>[[File:Spomenik pilotima 1941.JPG|thumb|250px|Monument to pilots who died defending Belgrade in the air battle against [[Luftwaffe]] on April 1941.]]Following the [[Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] on March 25, 1941, the Yugoslav armed forces were put on alert, although the army was not fully mobilized for fear of provoking Hitler&nbsp;\u2013 to no avail. The VVKJ command decided to disperse its forces away from their main bases to a system of auxiliary airfields that had previously been prepared. However many of these airfields lacked facilities and had inadequate drainage which prevented the continued operation of all but the very lightest aircraft in the adverse weather conditions encountered in April 1941).{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=177}}\n\nDespite having, on paper at any rate, a substantially stronger force of relatively modern aircraft than the combined British and Greek air forces to the south, the VVKJ could simply not match the overwhelming ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Regia Aeronautica'' superiority in terms of numbers, tactical deployment and combat experience.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|p=178}}\n\nThe bomber eskadrilla (the equivalent of 22 squadrons) and maritime air force hit targets in Italy, Germany (Austria), Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania and Greece, as well as attacking German, Italian and Hungarian troops. Meanwhile, the fighter eskadrilla (the equivalent of 19 squadrons) inflicted not insignificant losses on escorted Luftwaffe bomber raids on Belgrade and Serbia, as well as upon Regia Aeronautica raids on Dalmatia and Herzegovina, whilst also providing air support to the hard pressed Yugoslav Army by strafing attacking troop columns in Croatia, Bosnia, Macedonia and Serbia (sometimes taking off and strafing the troops attacking the very base being evacuated).{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=178\u2013229}}\n\nLittle wonder then that after a combination of air combat losses, losses on the ground to enemy air attack on bases and the overrunning of airfields by enemy troops that after 11 days the VVKJ almost ceased to exist. It must, however, be noted that between 6 and 17 April 1941 the VVKJ received an additional 8 [[Hawker Hurricane]] Is, 6 [[Dornier Do 17K]]s, 4 [[Bristol Blenheim I]]s, 2 [[Ikarus IK 2]]s, 1 [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] and 1 [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] from the aircraft factories and workshops.{{sfn|Cigli\u0107|Savi\u0107|2002|p=8}}\n\nSome 70 or so operational and training aircraft succeeded in escaping to Greece and 4 to Russia (8 [[Dornier Do 17K|Do 17Ks]] and [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79K|SM.79Ks]] set out, but half were lost due to poor weather conditions, mountainous terrain and/or overloading). But further tragedy was to befall even these escapees with some 44 destroyed on the ground at the airfield of Paramitia in Greece by marauding German and Italian fighters. In the end only 3 [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra|Lockheed 10s]], 2 Do 17Ks, 4 SM.79Ks, 8 [[Dornier Do 22K|Do 22K]] floatplanes and 1 [[Rogo\u017earski SIM-XIV-H|SIM XIVH]] floatplane reached the Allied base of Egypt in May 1941.\n\nThe [[Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia]] came into existence in July 1941 with over 200 captured aircraft. [[Yugoslav Partisans]] were themselves able to form an air force in 1943 from captured aircraft from the Croatian Air Force.\n\n\n==Inventory==\n===Aircraft (April 1941)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
