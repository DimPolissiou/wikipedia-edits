{"title_page": "Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping", "text_new": "{{COI|date=December 2017}}\n'''Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping''' ('''LDDMM''') is a specific suite of algorithms used for diffeomorphic mapping and manipulating dense imagery based on  '''diffeomorphic metric mapping''' within the academic discipline of [[computational anatomy]], to be distinguished from its precursor based on '''diffeomorphic mapping'''.  The distinction between the two is that diffeomorphic metric maps satisfy the property that the length associated to their flow away from the identity induces a metric on the [[Computational anatomy#The Diffeomorphism Group of Computational Anatomy|group of diffeomorphisms]], which in turn induces a metric on the orbit of [[Computational anatomy#Shapes and forms|shapes and forms]] within the field of [[Computational anatomy|Computational Anatomy]]. The study of shapes and forms with the metric of diffeomorphic metric mapping is called [[Computational Anatomy#Diffeomorphometry:the metric space of shapes and forms|diffeomorphometry]].\n\nA '''diffeomorphic mapping''' system is a system designed to map, manipulate, and transfer information which is stored in many types of spatially distributed medical imagery.\n\nDiffeomorphic mapping is the underlying technology for mapping and analyzing information measured in human anatomical coordinate systems which have been measured via Medical imaging{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Diffeomorphic mapping is a broad term that actually refers to a number of different algorithms, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications for analysis and visualization. Diffeomorphic mapping can be used to relate various sources of information which are indexed as a function of spatial position as the key index variable. Diffeomorphisms are by their Latin root structure preserving transformations, which are in turn differentiable and therefore smooth, allowing for the calculation of metric based quantities such as arc length and surface areas. Spatial location and extents in human anatomical coordinate systems can be recorded via a variety of Medical imaging modalities, generally termed multi-modal medical imagery, providing either scalar and or vector quantities at each spatial location. Examples are scalar [[T1 (MRI)|T1]] or T2 [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance imagery]], or as 3x3 diffusion tensor matrices [[diffusion MRI]] and [[diffusion-weighted imaging]], to scalar densities associated to [[computed tomography]] (CT), or functional imagery such as temporal data of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and scalar densities such as [[Positron emission tomography|Positron emission tomography (PET)]].\n\nComputational anatomy is a subdiscipline within the broader field of [[neuroinformatics]] within [[bioinformatics]] and [[medical imaging]].

This important distinction arises from the original formulation of the [[Riemannian metric and Lie-bracket in computational anatomy|Riemannian metric]] corresponding to the right-invariance. The lengths of these geodesics give the metric in the metric space structure of human anatomy. Non-geodesic formulations of diffeomorphic mapping in general does not correspond to any metric formulation.\n\n==History of development==\nDiffeomorphic mapping 3-dimensional information across coordinate systems is central to high-resolution [[Medical imaging]] and the area of  [[Neuroinformatics]] [[Bioinformatics|within the newly emerging field of bioinformatics]].

In CA mapping of dense information measured within [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic resonance image]] (MRI) based coordinate systems such as in the brain has been solved via inexact matching of 3D MR images one onto the other. The earliest introduction of the use of '''diffeomorphic mapping''' via '''large deformation''' flows of [[diffeomorphisms]] for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Rabbitt and Miller <ref name=\"Christensen 1435\u20131447\">{{Cite journal|title=Deformable Templates Using Large Deformation Kinematics|journal=Trans.

This model becomes more appropriate for cross-sectional studies in which brains and or hearts are not necessarily deformations of one to the other. Methods based on linear or non-linear elasticity energetics which grows with distance from the identity mapping of the template, is not appropriate for cross-sectional study. Rather, in models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected.  The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's original paper, with fast and symmetric methods becoming available.<ref name=\":3\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Avants|first=B.

The study of shapes and forms with the metric of diffeomorphic metric mapping is called [[Computational Anatomy#Diffeomorphometry:the metric space of shapes and forms|diffeomorphometry]].\n\nA '''diffeomorphic mapping''' system is a system designed to map, manipulate, and transfer information which is stored in many types of spatially distributed medical imagery.\n\nDiffeomorphic mapping is the underlying technology for mapping and analyzing information measured in human anatomical coordinate systems which have been measured via Medical imaging{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Diffeomorphic mapping is a broad term that actually refers to a number of different algorithms, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications for analysis and visualization. Diffeomorphic mapping can be used to relate various sources of information which are indexed as a function of spatial position as the key index variable. Diffeomorphisms are by their Latin root structure preserving transformations, which are in turn differentiable and therefore smooth, allowing for the calculation of metric based quantities such as arc length and surface areas. Spatial location and extents in human anatomical coordinate systems can be recorded via a variety of Medical imaging modalities, generally termed multi-modal medical imagery, providing either scalar and or vector quantities at each spatial location. Examples are scalar [[T1 (MRI)|T1]] or T2 [[Magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance imagery]], or as 3x3 diffusion tensor matrices [[diffusion MRI]] and [[diffusion-weighted imaging]], to scalar densities associated to [[computed tomography]] (CT), or functional imagery such as temporal data of [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] and scalar densities such as [[Positron emission tomography|Positron emission tomography (PET)]].\n\nComputational anatomy is a subdiscipline within the broader field of [[neuroinformatics]] within [[bioinformatics]] and [[medical imaging]].

The lengths of these geodesics give the metric in the metric space structure of human anatomy.

This model becomes more appropriate for cross-sectional studies in which brains and or hearts are not necessarily deformations of one to the other. Methods based on linear or non-linear elasticity energetics which grows with distance from the identity mapping of the template, is not appropriate for cross-sectional study. Rather, in models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected.

For example, in two dimensions, three centers forming a non-degenerate triangle ensure that <math>B</math> is full rank, and in three dimensions, four centers forming a non-degenerate tetrahedron ensure that B is full rank.  As explained later, the linear transformation resulting from the restriction of the domain of the linear transformation <math>A</math> to the [[Kernel (linear algebra)|null space]] of <math>\\textstyle{ B^{\\textrm{T}} }</math> is positive definite.  This means that if <math>B</math> is full rank, the system of equations ({{EquationNote|2}}) always has a unique solution and it can be solved using the [[Cholesky decomposition]] after a suitable transformation.  The computed weights allow evaluation of the spline for any <math>\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^d</math> using equation ({{EquationNote|1}}).

For example, the [[biharmonic equation]] is <math>\\Delta^2 f = 0</math> and the triharmonic equation is <math>\\Delta^3 f = 0</math>.  All the polyharmonic radial basis functions are solutions of a polyharmonic equation (or more accurately, a modified polyharmonic equation with a [[Dirac delta function]] on the right hand side instead of 0).  For example, the thin plate radial basis function is a solution of the modified 2-dimensional biharmonic equation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.univie.ac.at/nuhag-php/bibtex/open_files/po94_M%20J%20D%20Powell%2003%2093.pdf|title = Some algorithms for thin plate spline interpolation to functions of two variables|last = Powell|first = M.

Applying the Laplace operator to <math>\\Delta f_{\\text{tp}}</math> (this is <math>\\Delta^2 f_{\\text{tp}}</math>) yields 0.  But 0 is not exactly correct.   To see this, replace <math>r^2=x^2+y^2</math> with <math>\\rho^2 = x^2+y^2+h^2</math> (where <math>h</math> is some small number tending to 0).  The Laplace operator applied to <math>4 \\log \\rho</math> yields <math>\\Delta^2 f_{\\text{tp}} = 8h^2 / \\rho^4</math>.  For <math>(x,y)=(0,0),</math> the right hand side of this equation approaches infinity as <math>h</math> approaches 0.  For any other <math>(x,y)</math>, the right hand side approaches 0 as <math>h</math> approaches 0.  This indicates that the right hand side is a Dirac delta function.

Letting <math>\\rho^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2+h^2</math> and computing <math>\\Delta(1/\\rho) = -3h^2 / \\rho^5</math> again indicates that the right hand side of the PDEs for the biharmonic and triharmonic RBFs are Dirac delta functions.

The explanation first requires deriving a simplified form of <math>\\textstyle{ \\int_{\\mathcal{B}} |\\nabla^m f|^2 \\,d\\mathbf{x}}</math> when <math>\\mathcal{B}</math> is all of <math>\\mathbb{R}^d.</math>\n\nFirst, require that <math>\\textstyle{ \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i =0. }</math>  This ensures that all derivatives of order <math>m</math> and higher of <math>\\textstyle{ f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \\phi(|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{c}_i|) }</math> vanish at infinity.  For example, let <math>m=3</math> and <math>d=3</math> and <math>\\phi</math> be the triharmonic RBF.  Then <math>\\phi_{zzy} = 3y(x^2+y^2) / (x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}</math> (considering <math>\\phi</math> as a mapping from <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> to <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>).  For a given center <math>\\mathbf{P} = (P_1,P_2,P_3),</math>\n\n:<math>\\phi_{zzy}(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{P}) = \\frac{3(y-P_2)((y-P_2)^2 + (x-P_1)^2)}{((x-P_1)^2 + (y-P_2)^2 + (z-P_3)^2)^{3/2}}.</math>\n\nOn a line <math>\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{b}</math> for arbitrary point <math>\\mathbf{a}</math> and unit vector <math>\\mathbf{b},</math>\n\n:<math>\\phi_{zzy}(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{P}) = \\frac{3(a_2+b_2t - P_2)((a_2+b_2t-P_2)^2 + (a_1+b_1t-P_1)^2)}{((a_1+b_1t-P_1)^2 + (a_2+b_2t-P_2)^2 + (a_3+b_3t-P_3)^2)^{3/2}}.</math>\n\nDividing both numerator and denominator of this by <math>t^3</math> shows that <math>\\textstyle { \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\phi_{zyy}(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{P}) = 3b_2(b_2^2 + b_1^2) / (b_1^2 + b_2^2 + b_3^2)^{3/2}},</math> a quantity independent of the center <math>\\mathbf{P}.</math>  So on the given line,\n\n:<math> \\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty} f_{zyy}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \\phi_{zyy}(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{c}_i) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N w_i\\right)3b_2(b_2^2 + b_1^2) / (b_1^2 + b_2^2 + b_3^2)^{3/2} = 0.  </math>\n\nIt is not quite enough to require that  <math>\\textstyle{ \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i =0, }</math> because in what follows it is necessary for <math>f_{\\alpha}g_{\\beta}</math> to vanish at infinity, where <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math> are multi-indices such that <math>|\\alpha|+|\\beta|=2m-1.</math>  For triharmonic <math>\\phi,</math> <math>w_i u_j\\phi_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{c}_i)\\phi_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{d}_j)</math> (where <math>u_j</math> and <math>\\mathbf{d}_j</math> are the weights and centers of <math>g</math>) is always a sum of total degree 5 polynomials in <math>x,</math> <math>y,</math> and <math>z</math> divided by the square root of a total degree 8 polynomial.  Consider the behavior of these terms on the line <math>\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{b}</math> as <math>t</math> approaches infinity.  The numerator is a degree 5 polynomial in <math>t.</math>  Dividing numerator and denominator by <math>t^4</math> leaves the degree 4 and 5 terms in the numerator and a function of <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> only in the denominator.  A degree 5 term divided by <math>t^4</math> is a product of five <math>b</math> coordinates and <math>t.</math>  The <math>\\textstyle{ \\sum w = 0}</math> (and <math>\\textstyle{\\sum u=0}</math>) constraint makes this vanish everywhere on the line.  A degree 4 term divided by <math>t^4</math> is either a product of four <math>b</math> coordinates and an <math>a</math> coordinate or a product of four <math>b</math> coordinates and a single <math>c_i</math> or <math>d_j</math> coordinate.  The <math>\\textstyle{ \\sum w = 0}</math> constraint makes the first type of term vanish everywhere on the line.  The additional constraints <math>\\textstyle{ \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i \\mathbf{c}_i = 0 }</math> will make the second type of term vanish.\n\nNow define the inner product of two functions <math>f,g:\\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}</math> defined as a linear combination of polyharmonic RBFs <math>\\phi_{m,d}</math> with <math>\\textstyle{\\sum w = 0}</math> and <math>\\textstyle{\\sum w\\mathbf{c}}=0</math> as\n\n:<math>\\langle f,g\\rangle = \\int\\limits_{\\mathbb{R}^d} (\\nabla^m f)\\cdot (\\nabla^m g) \\,d\\mathbf{x}.</math>\n\nIntegration by parts shows that\n\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math> \\langle f,g\\rangle = (-1)^m \\int\\limits_{\\mathbb{R}^d} f (\\Delta^mg) \\,d\\mathbf{x}.  </math>\n|{{EquationRef|8}}}}\n\nFor example, let <math> m=2  </math> and <math> d=2.  </math>  Then\n\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\\langle f,g\\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (f_{xx}g_{xx} + 2f_{xy}g_{xy} + f_{yy}g_{yy}) \\,dx \\,dy.</math>\n|{{EquationRef|9}}}}\n\nIntegrating the first term of this by parts once yields\n\n:<math>\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_{xx}g_{xx} \\,dx \\,dy = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_x g_{xx}\\big|_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\,dy - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f_x g_{xxx} \\,dx \\,dy = - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f_x g_{xxx} \\,dx \\,dy</math>\n\nsince <math>f_x g_{xx}</math> vanishes at infinity.

This fact enables transforming the polyharmonic smoothing spline equation system to a symmetric positive definite system of equations that can be solved twice as fast using the Cholesky decomposition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Examples ==\nThe next figure shows the interpolation through four points (marked by \"circles\") using different types of polyharmonic splines. The \"curvature\" of the interpolated curves grows with the order of the spline and the extrapolation at the left boundary (x < 0) is reasonable. The figure also includes the radial basis functions phi = exp(-r<sup>2</sup>) which gives a good interpolation as well. Finally, the figure includes also\nthe non-polyharmonic spline phi = r<sup>2</sup> to demonstrate, that this\nradial basis function is not able to pass through the predefined points\n(the linear equation has no solution and is solved in a least squares sense).\n\n[[Image:Polyharmonic-splines-example1.png|frame|none|Interpolation with different polyharmonic splines that shall pass the 4 predefined points marked by a circle (the interpolation with phi = r<sup>2</sup> is not useful, since the linear equation system of the interpolation problem has no solution; it is solved in a least squares\nsense, but then does not pass the centers)]]\n\nThe next figure shows the same interpolation as in the first figure, with the only exception that the points to be interpolated are scaled by a factor of 100 (and the case phi = r<sup>2</sup> is no longer included). Since phi = (scale*r)<sup>k</sup> =\n(scale<sup>k</sup>)*r<sup>k</sup>, the factor (scale<sup>k</sup>) can be extracted from matrix '''A''' of the linear equation system and therefore the solution is not influenced by the scaling. This is different for the logarithmic form of the spline, although the scaling has not much influence. This analysis is reflected in the figure, where the interpolation shows not much differences. Note, for other radial basis functions, such as phi = exp(-k*r<sup>2</sup>) with k=1, the interpolation is no longer reasonable and it would be necessary to adapt k.\n\n[[Image:Polyharmonic-splines-example1-scale100.png|frame|none| The same interpolation as in the first figure, but the points to be interpolated are scaled by 100]]\n\nThe next figure shows the same interpolation as in the first figure, with\nthe only exception that the polynomial term of the function is not\ntaken into account (and the case phi = r<sup>2</sup> is no longer included). As can be seen from the figure, the extrapolation for x < 0 is no longer as \"natural\" as in the first figure for some of the basis functions. This indicates, that the polynomial term is useful if extrapolation occurs.\n\n[[Image:Polyharmonic-splines-example1-no-polynomial.png|frame|none| The same interpolation as in the first figure, but without the polynomial term]]\n\n== Discussion ==\nThe main advantage of polyharmonic spline interpolation is that usually very good interpolation results are obtained for scattered data without performing any \"tuning\", so automatic interpolation is feasible. This is not the case for other radial basis functions. For example, the Gaussian function <math>e^{-k\\cdot r^2}</math> needs to be tuned, so that <math>k</math> is selected according to the underlying grid of the independent variables. If this grid is non-uniform, a proper selection of <math>k</math> to achieve a good interpolation result is difficult or impossible.\n\nMain disadvantages are:\n\n* To determine the weights, a dense linear system of equations must be solved.  Solving a dense linear system becomes impractical if the dimension <math>N</math> is large, since the memory required is <math>O(N^2)</math> and the number of operations required is <math>O(N^3).</math> \n* Evaluating the computed polyharmonic spline function at <math>M</math> data points requires <math>O(MN)</math> operations.

For example, the [[biharmonic equation]] is <math>\\Delta^2 f = 0</math> and the triharmonic equation is <math>\\Delta^3 f = 0</math>.  All the polyharmonic radial basis functions are solutions of a polyharmonic equation (or more accurately, a modified polyharmonic equation with a [[Dirac delta function]] on the right hand side instead of 0).  For example, the thin plate radial basis function is a solution of the modified 2-dimensional biharmonic equation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.univie.ac.at/nuhag-php/bibtex/open_files/po94_M%20J%20D%20Powell%2003%2093.pdf|title = Some algorithms for thin plate spline interpolation to functions of two variables|last = Powell|first = M.

Applying the Laplace operator to <math>\\Delta f_{\\text{tp}}</math> (this is <math>\\Delta^2 f_{\\text{tp}}</math>) yields 0.  But 0 is not exactly correct.   To see this, replace <math>r^2=x^2+y^2</math> with <math>\\rho^2 = x^2+y^2+h^2</math> (where <math>h</math> is some small number tending to 0).

Consider the behavior of these terms on the line <math>\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{a} + t\\mathbf{b}</math> as <math>t</math> approaches infinity.  The numerator is a degree 5 polynomial in <math>t.</math>  Dividing numerator and denominator by <math>t^4</math> leaves the degree 4 and 5 terms in the numerator and a function of <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> only in the denominator.

A degree 4 term divided by <math>t^4</math> is either a product of four <math>b</math> coordinates and an <math>a</math> coordinate or a product of four <math>b</math> coordinates and a single <math>c_i</math> or <math>d_j</math> coordinate.

This fact enables transforming the polyharmonic smoothing spline equation system to a symmetric positive definite system of equations that can be solved twice as fast using the Cholesky decomposition.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Examples ==\nThe next figure shows the interpolation through four points (marked by \"circles\") using different types of polyharmonic splines. The \"curvature\" of the interpolated curves grows with the order of the spline and the extrapolation at the left boundary (x < 0) is reasonable. The figure also includes the radial basis functions phi = exp(-r<sup>2</sup>) which gives a good interpolation as well. Finally, the figure includes also\nthe non-polyharmonic spline phi = r<sup>2</sup> to demonstrate, that this\nradial basis function is not able to pass through the predefined points\n(the linear equation has no solution and is solved in a least squares sense).\n\n[[Image:Polyharmonic-splines-example1.png|frame|none|Interpolation with different polyharmonic splines that shall pass the 4 predefined points marked by a circle (the interpolation with phi = r<sup>2</sup> is not useful, since the linear equation system of the interpolation problem has no solution; it is solved in a least squares\nsense, but then does not pass the centers)]]\n\nThe next figure shows the same interpolation as in the first figure, with the only exception that the points to be interpolated are scaled by a factor of 100 (and the case phi = r<sup>2</sup> is no longer included). Since phi = (scale*r)<sup>k</sup> =\n(scale<sup>k</sup>)*r<sup>k</sup>, the factor (scale<sup>k</sup>) can be extracted from matrix '''A''' of the linear equation system and therefore the solution is not influenced by the scaling. This is different for the logarithmic form of the spline, although the scaling has not much influence. This analysis is reflected in the figure, where the interpolation shows not much differences. Note, for other radial basis functions, such as phi = exp(-k*r<sup>2</sup>) with k=1, the interpolation is no longer reasonable and it would be necessary to adapt k.\n\n[[Image:Polyharmonic-splines-example1-scale100.png|frame|none| The same interpolation as in the first figure, but the points to be interpolated are scaled by 100]]\n\nThe next figure shows the same interpolation as in the first figure, with\nthe only exception that the polynomial term of the function is not\ntaken into account (and the case phi = r<sup>2</sup> is no longer included). As can be seen from the figure, the extrapolation for x < 0 is no longer as \"natural\" as in the first figure for some of the basis functions. This indicates, that the polynomial term is useful if extrapolation occurs.\n\n[[Image:Polyharmonic-splines-example1-no-polynomial.png|frame|none| The same interpolation as in the first figure, but without the polynomial term]]\n\n== Discussion ==\nThe main advantage of polyharmonic spline interpolation is that usually very good interpolation results are obtained for scattered data without performing any \"tuning\", so automatic interpolation is feasible. This is not the case for other radial basis functions. For example, the Gaussian function <math>e^{-k\\cdot r^2}</math> needs to be tuned, so that <math>k</math> is selected according to the underlying grid of the independent variables. If this grid is non-uniform, a proper selection of <math>k</math> to achieve a good interpolation result is difficult or impossible.\n\nMain disadvantages are:\n\n* To determine the weights, a dense linear system of equations must be solved.  Solving a dense linear system becomes impractical if the dimension <math>N</math> is large, since the memory required is <math>O(N^2)</math> and the number of operations required is <math>O(N^3).</math> \n* Evaluating the computed polyharmonic spline function at <math>M</math> data points requires <math>O(MN)</math> operations. In many applications (image processing is an example), <math>M</math> is much larger than <math>N,</math> and if both numbers are large, this is not practical.\n\nRecently, methods have been developed to overcome the aforementioned difficulties. For example Beatson et al.<ref>R.K. Beatson, M.J.D. Powell, and A.M. Tan: [http://imajna.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/27/3/427 Fast evaluation of polyharmonic splines in three dimensions].

To use the method of coordinate geometry, the axes are placed at a convenient position with respect to the curve under consideration.  For example, to study the equations of [[ellipse]]s and [[hyperbola]]s, the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] are usually located on one of the axes and are situated symmetrically with respect to the origin.  If the curve (hyperbola, [[parabola]], ellipse, etc.) is ''not'' situated conveniently with respect to the axes, the coordinate system should be changed to place the curve at a convenient and familiar location and orientation.  The process of making this change is called a [[Coordinate system#Transformations|transformation of coordinates]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|pp=314\u2013315}}</ref>\n\nThe solutions to many problems can be simplified by rotating the coordinate axes to obtain new axes through the same origin.\n\n== Derivation ==\nThe equations defining the transformation in two dimensions, which rotates the ''xy'' axes counterclockwise through an angle <math> \\theta </math> into the ''x'y<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' axes, are derived as follows.\n\nIn the ''xy'' system, let the point ''P'' have [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] <math> (r, \\alpha) </math>.

To use the method of coordinate geometry, the axes are placed at a convenient position with respect to the curve under consideration.  For example, to study the equations of [[ellipse]]s and [[hyperbola]]s, the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] are usually located on one of the axes and are situated symmetrically with respect to the origin.  If the curve (hyperbola, [[parabola]], ellipse, etc.) is ''not'' situated conveniently with respect to the axes, the coordinate system should be changed to place the curve at a convenient and familiar location and orientation.  The process of making this change is called a [[Coordinate system#Transformations|transformation of coordinates]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|pp=314\u2013315}}</ref>\n\nThe solutions to many problems can be simplified by rotating the coordinate axes to obtain new axes through the same origin.\n\n== Derivation ==\nThe equations defining the transformation in two dimensions, which rotates the ''xy'' axes counterclockwise through an angle <math> \\theta </math> into the ''x'y<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' axes, are derived as follows.\n\nIn the ''xy'' system, let the point ''P'' have [[polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]] <math> (r, \\alpha) </math>.  Then, in the ''x'y<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' system, ''P'' will have polar coordinates <math> (r, \\alpha - \\theta) </math>.\n\nUsing [[trigonometric functions]], we have\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math> x = r \\cos \\alpha </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math> y = r \\sin \\alpha </math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nand using the standard [[trigonometric formulae]] for differences, we have\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math> x' = r \\cos( \\alpha -  \\theta ) = r \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\theta + r \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\theta </math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math> y' = r \\sin( \\alpha -  \\theta ) = r \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\theta - r \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\theta .</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nSubstituting equations ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) into equations ({{EquationNote|3}}) and ({{EquationNote|4}}), we obtain\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math> x' =   x \\cos \\theta + y \\sin \\theta </math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math> y' = - x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta .</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|pp=320\u2013321}}</ref>|{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n\nEquations ({{EquationNote|5}}) and ({{EquationNote|6}}) can be represented in matrix form as\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx' \\\\\ny'\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\cos \\theta & \\sin \\theta \\\\\n- \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\n\nwhich is the standard matrix equation of a rotation of axes in two dimensions.<ref>{{harvtxt|Anton|1987|p=230}}</ref>\n\nThe inverse transformation is\n\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math> x = x' \\cos \\theta - y' \\sin \\theta </math>|{{EquationRef|7}}}}\n:{{NumBlk|:|<math> y = x' \\sin \\theta + y' \\cos \\theta ,</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|p=320}}</ref>|{{EquationRef|8}}}}\n\nor\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta & - \\sin \\theta \\\\\n\\sin \\theta &   \\cos \\theta\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx' \\\\\ny'\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n\n== Examples in two dimensions ==\n=== Example 1 ===\nFind the coordinates of the point <math> P_1 = (x, y) = (\\sqrt 3, 1) </math> after the axes have been rotated through the angle <math> \\theta_1 = \\pi / 6 </math>, or 30\u00b0.\n\n'''Solution:'''\n\n:<math> x' = \\sqrt 3 \\cos ( \\pi / 6 ) + 1 \\sin ( \\pi / 6 ) = (\\sqrt 3)({\\sqrt 3}/2) + (1)(1/2) = 2 </math>\n:<math> y' = 1 \\cos ( \\pi / 6 ) - \\sqrt 3 \\sin ( \\pi / 6 ) = (1)({\\sqrt 3}/2) - (\\sqrt 3)(1/2) = 0 .</math>\n\nThe axes have been rotated counterclockwise through an angle of <math> \\theta_1 = \\pi / 6 </math> and the new coordinates are <math> P_1 = (x', y') = (2, 0) </math>.
