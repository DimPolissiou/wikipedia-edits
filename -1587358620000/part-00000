The Breeze as of the latest survey results in September was NZ\u2019s number one music station.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years=== \nThe Breeze first started in [[Auckland]], [[Waikato]] and [[Wellington]] in 1993, when owner Independent Broadcasting Company rebranded local stations [[Magic 91FM|91FM]] (Auckland), [[Kiwi 898FM]] (Waikato) and [[Radio Windy|Windy FM]] (Wellington) to The Breeze. The Auckland and Waikato stations previously played a Hit Music format and were changed to a [[Hot AC]] format using the slogan \"Not Too Heavy, Not Too Soft\". Wellington was different; Windy FM had been playing [[Classic rock|Classic Rock]] prior to rebranding, and changed to the [[Easy Listening]] format that would be used on future The Breeze stations.\n\nAll three The Breeze stations operated separately from each other, with local shows in each market.\n\n===Change of ownership===\nIn 1995 The Breeze in Wellington was sold to the [[More FM|MORE FM Group]], and in 1996 the parent company of The Breeze in Auckland and Waikato was sold to [[Prospect Limited]].\n\nAt the end of 1996, Prospect Limited was sold to [[The Radio Network]], and in 1997 The Radio Network closed down The Breeze in Auckland and Waikato. It then used these frequencies to start [[ZM (New Zealand)|91ZM]] in Auckland, and 89.8ZM in Waikato.\n\nThe Breeze continued to broadcast in Wellington, and by 2000 the station was owned by [[CanWest]], along with MORE FM and [[Channel Z (New Zealand radio station)|Channel Z]], CanWest then purchased [[RadioWorks]], and in 2001 The Breeze became part of RadioWorks collection of local once off station known as [[LocalWorks]]. RadioWorks later became known as MediaWorks Radio.\n\n===Expansion to other markets===\nThe Breeze made a return to Waikato in 2003 when local station [[Y 99.3]] was rebranded as The Breeze, retaining Y99.3 local announcers but changing music format from adult contemporary to easy listening.\n\nIn 2004, MediaWorks made the decision to nationalise their local station branding in each market: In regions where MediaWorks operated one local radio station, it was rebranded as [[MORE FM]]. If a second local station was operating in the region, that station became The Breeze.\n\n===Networking===\nIn 2006 The Breeze launched in the Auckland market as a completely new station; this allowed MediaWorks to have the option to later network The Breeze to other markets.\n\nIn April 2007, Dunedin and Palmerston North were the first two regions to replace some of its local programming, focusing on delivering a local breakfast show only. Creating a network allowed The Breeze to launch in other markets such as Hawke's Bay, Bay of Plenty and Southland.\n\nIn March 2009, a live networked breakfast show was introduced. The networked breakfast could be heard in regions where there was no local breakfast show - regions with a live breakfast show were not affected. In 2010 the networked breakfast was replaced with the Auckland breakfast show, presented by ''The Two Robbies'' ([[Robbie Rakete]] and Robert Scott).\n\nIn 2015, The Breeze increased local programming with a local drive show introduced in the Waikato. The [[More FM]] local breakfast announcers in Dunedin and Hawke's Bay were moved to the local The Breeze stations in their respective markets.\n\nIn 2017, The Breeze Auckland moved away from a network product to become a fully local radio offering. All show day parts, including weekends and overnights, were now local to Auckland only - the only metro major radio brand offering this.\n\nIn 2018, The Breeze launched in Timaru, Oamaru, Ashburton, and the Mackenzie Country, increasing its local footprint with a local breakfast show broadcast to the regions.\n\nOn 16 April 2020, The Breeze TV launched on Freeview channel 14 and Sky channel 119.<ref name=\"threelife\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebreeze.co.nz/home/win/network/2020/04/choose-the-first-song-we-play-on-breeze-tv-first---and-win--than.html|title=The Breeze|last=|first=|date=10 February 2020|website=ThreeNow|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Format change===\nTraditionally known as an easy listening radio station, The Breeze dropped this title in 2011.

The first network breakfast shown was ''The Two Robbies Breakfast Show'' as the show was originally presented by [[Robbie Rakete]] and Robert Scott. In 2015 Robert Scott moved to the Drive show and was initially replaced by Anna Thomas, before Jeanette Thomas joined the show in 2016.\n\nIn April 2016 the Wellington breakfast show presented by Steve Joll and Kath Bier became the network breakfast show presented from the Wellington studios until the end of 2018.\n\nStarting from 2019 Kris Edwards now hosts the network show from the Auckland studios for markets that do not have local breakfast shows.\n\nThe workday show has been presented by Alison Leonard since 2011, previously this show was presented by [[Kerry Smith]] until she died in April 2011.\n\n[[Robert Scott (broadcaster)|Robert Scott]] presents the Drive show and has done so since April 2015. Previously the show was presented by [[Mark Leishman]], before he moved to newly created MediaWorks station [[Magic (New Zealand)|Magic]].\n\nAll regions take the networked night show which is presented by Tania Burgess.\n\n===Auckland===\nLaunched on 12 June 2006 on the former [[Solid Gold (radio)|Solid Gold FM]] frequency with Solid Gold moving to 93.8&nbsp;MHz. The Auckland studio is where all network shows are produced where all announcers also produce a local show for Auckland, with voice breaks tailored to the Auckland audience. In 2016 a local Auckland only breakfast show was reinstated presented by Robert Rakete and Jeanette Thomas. The major change in 2017, The Breeze Auckland is local 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The only major metro radio brand in New Zealand to offer a full local offering.\n\n'''Auckland Local Programming:''' \nBreakfast presented by Robert Rakete and Jeanette Thomas followed by Alison Leonard between 10 am \u2013 3 pm, Robert Scott 3\u20137 pm, Tania Burgess 7 pm \u2013 12 am along with local weekend shows. The Breeze Auckland is 24 hours, 7 days a week local.\n\n===Waikato===\nThis station was originally [[Waikato]]'s Y99.3 playing an Adult Contemporary Music Format.

More recently it moved to 95.8&nbsp;MHz.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Breakfast presented by Mark Eagle and Jolene James.\n\n===Rotorua===\nThe Breeze launched in [[Rotorua]] in 2008 broadcasting temporarily on 96.7. Previously 96.7 had been used to broadcast [[Mai FM]] into Rotorua, RadioWorks purchased Mai FM in March 2008 and replaced Mai FM with The Breeze. However, when [[The Radio Network]] purchased the 96.7&nbsp;MHz frequency in July, it switched frequency to 91.9&nbsp;MHz, formerly used by [[Radio Live]].\n\n===Hawke's Bay===\nCommenced broadcasting 6 August 2007, on 97.5&nbsp;MHz, the frequency previously used by Radio Pacific (now 549&nbsp;kHz), then by Radio Live (now 106.3FM). In 2015 a local breakfast was introduced when More FM Hawkes Bay announcers Kevin Wagg and Megan Banks moved to The Breeze. In April 2017, Martin Good moved from The Hits to The Breeze.

It originally broadcast on 99.8&nbsp;MHz, a frequency which had previously been used by More FM Wairarapa's Martinborough infill (which moved to 105.5&nbsp;MHz). In October 2010, the frequency was altered slightly to 99.9&nbsp;MHz as part of the nationwide realignment of FM frequencies.\n\n===Kapiti Coast===\nThe Breeze began transmission across the [[Kapiti Coast]] and [[Horowhenua District|Horowhenua]] regions in late 2004. This occurred when RadioWorks replaced all of their local stations with the More FM brand. Subsequently, local station 90.2 2XX FM was rebranded as More FM, however as there was already a local More FM station in existence on 99.6&nbsp;MHz, that frequency became The Breeze 99.6.\n\n===Wellington===\n[[Wellington]] is the home of the very first ''The Breeze'' radio station under the Easy Listening format. The history of this station dates back to the 1970s as [[Radio Windy]] and later Windy FM when the station switched to [[FM broadcasting|FM]]. Radio Windy changed formats several times from [[Easy listening|Easy Listening]] to [[Adult contemporary music|Adult Contemporary]] to [[Classic rock|Classic Rock]] before changing back to Easy Listening when the station became The Breeze in 1993. The format of The Breeze in Wellington was then rolled out to other stations in 2003 and 2004.\n\nThe local Wellington breakfast show with Steve Joll & Kath Bier became the network breakfast show into selected regions from April 2016 until December 2018. From 2019 the show reverted to being a local show for Wellington.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Steve Joll and Kath Bier present a local breakfast show. Sue White presents the local workday show from 10 am \u2013 3 pm.

In April 2007 Tracy Chambers (the daytime announcer) was moved to the breakfast show to present a local breakfast.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Breakfast presented by Damian Newell\n\n===Queenstown===\nRadioworks purchased [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] radio station Q92FM in March 2006 and later rebranded the station as Q92 The Breeze. Originally Q92FM played Adult Contemporary Music but was changed to the Easy Listening format used by The Breeze when the station was rebranded. Q92 The Breeze could also be heard in Wanaka on 96.8&nbsp;MHz and previously in Central Otago (however Central Otago now takes the networked The Breeze). In late 2009 the station traded places on the FM dial with [[More FM|99.2 More FM]] with the More FM station becoming '''Q92 99.4 More FM''' (the 99.4&nbsp;MHz frequency is for Wanaka). At the same time the local breakfast show that was on The Breeze in Queenstown was moved to More FM with The Breeze in Queenstown now running networked shows at all times.\n\n===Central Otago===\nThe Breeze began broadcasting in [[Central Otago]] in 2007 originally this station was a relay of the [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] programme with Queenstown advertising.

Previously the show was presented by [[Mark Leishman]], before he moved to newly created MediaWorks station [[Magic (New Zealand)|Magic]].\n\nAll regions take the networked night show which is presented by Tania Burgess.\n\n===Auckland===\nLaunched on 12 June 2006 on the former [[Solid Gold (radio)|Solid Gold FM]] frequency with Solid Gold moving to 93.8&nbsp;MHz. The Auckland studio is where all network shows are produced where all announcers also produce a local show for Auckland, with voice breaks tailored to the Auckland audience. In 2016 a local Auckland only breakfast show was reinstated presented by Robert Rakete and Jeanette Thomas. The major change in 2017, The Breeze Auckland is local 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The only major metro radio brand in New Zealand to offer a full local offering.\n\n'''Auckland Local Programming:''' \nBreakfast presented by Robert Rakete and Jeanette Thomas followed by Alison Leonard between 10 am \u2013 3 pm, Robert Scott 3\u20137 pm, Tania Burgess 7 pm \u2013 12 am along with local weekend shows.

The station was relaunched as The Breeze in April 2003, this was the very first station to be rebranded as The Breeze.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Breakfast presented by Stu Smith and Camille Guzzwell.\n\n=== Coromandel Peninsula ===\nThe Breeze broadcasts in Thames on 90.8&nbsp;MHz, [[Mercury Bay]] on 96.7&nbsp;MHz, [[Pauanui]]/[[Tairua]] on 90.3&nbsp;MHz and Whangamata on 99.5&nbsp;MHz.\n\n===Tauranga===\nThe Breeze launched in [[Tauranga]] around September 2007 on 96.1&nbsp;MHz, a frequency previously used by [[Radio Pacific]], (now 873&nbsp;kHz), then by [[Radio Live]], (now 1107&nbsp;kHz).  More recently it moved to 95.8&nbsp;MHz.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Breakfast presented by Mark Eagle and Jolene James.\n\n===Rotorua===\nThe Breeze launched in [[Rotorua]] in 2008 broadcasting temporarily on 96.7. Previously 96.7 had been used to broadcast [[Mai FM]] into Rotorua, RadioWorks purchased Mai FM in March 2008 and replaced Mai FM with The Breeze. However, when [[The Radio Network]] purchased the 96.7&nbsp;MHz frequency in July, it switched frequency to 91.9&nbsp;MHz, formerly used by [[Radio Live]].\n\n===Hawke's Bay===\nCommenced broadcasting 6 August 2007, on 97.5&nbsp;MHz, the frequency previously used by Radio Pacific (now 549&nbsp;kHz), then by Radio Live (now 106.3FM). In 2015 a local breakfast was introduced when More FM Hawkes Bay announcers Kevin Wagg and Megan Banks moved to The Breeze. In April 2017, Martin Good moved from The Hits to The Breeze. In September 2018, Good's former co-host from The Hits, Sarah, also moved to The Breeze Breakfast.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Breakfast presented by Martin Good and Sarah Van der Kley.

The Breeze was relaunched on 92.3&nbsp;MHz, a frequency that ironically was previously occupied by [[The Most FM]]. Before switching to a live networked breakfast in March 2009.\n\n===Manawatu===\nThis station was originally [[Manawatu District|Manawatu]]'s [[Magic 828 & 98.6FM|Magic 98.6FM]]. It was relaunched as The Breeze in 2004 when [[RadioWorks]] rebranded all their [[Easy Listening]] stations as ''The Breeze''.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Breakfast presented by Chris Burn (Burnzee).\n\n===Wairarapa===\nThe Breeze began transmission across the [[Wairarapa]] from the Popoiti transmitter southeast of [[Greytown, New Zealand|Greytown]] and northeast of [[Martinborough]] in March 2010. It originally broadcast on 99.8&nbsp;MHz, a frequency which had previously been used by More FM Wairarapa's Martinborough infill (which moved to 105.5&nbsp;MHz). In October 2010, the frequency was altered slightly to 99.9&nbsp;MHz as part of the nationwide realignment of FM frequencies.\n\n===Kapiti Coast===\nThe Breeze began transmission across the [[Kapiti Coast]] and [[Horowhenua District|Horowhenua]] regions in late 2004. This occurred when RadioWorks replaced all of their local stations with the More FM brand. Subsequently, local station 90.2 2XX FM was rebranded as More FM, however as there was already a local More FM station in existence on 99.6&nbsp;MHz, that frequency became The Breeze 99.6.\n\n===Wellington===\n[[Wellington]] is the home of the very first ''The Breeze'' radio station under the Easy Listening format. The history of this station dates back to the 1970s as [[Radio Windy]] and later Windy FM when the station switched to [[FM broadcasting|FM]]. Radio Windy changed formats several times from [[Easy listening|Easy Listening]] to [[Adult contemporary music|Adult Contemporary]] to [[Classic rock|Classic Rock]] before changing back to Easy Listening when the station became The Breeze in 1993. The format of The Breeze in Wellington was then rolled out to other stations in 2003 and 2004.\n\nThe local Wellington breakfast show with Steve Joll & Kath Bier became the network breakfast show into selected regions from April 2016 until December 2018. From 2019 the show reverted to being a local show for Wellington.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Steve Joll and Kath Bier present a local breakfast show. Sue White presents the local workday show from 10 am \u2013 3 pm. Weekend programming between 6 am \u2013 6 pm is local.\n\n===Nelson===\nThe Breeze launched in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] in March 2008 broadcasting on 97.8&nbsp;MHz. Previously this frequency was used to broadcast [[Radio Pacific]] and more recently [[BSport]], however these stations actually broadcast on 97.6&nbsp;MHz, and now broadcast on 990&nbsp;kHz. The Breeze is now on its old Radio Pacific frequency 97.6&nbsp;MHz.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Breakfast presented by Blair Kiddey\n\n===Marlborough===\nIn January 2008 RadioWorks purchased ''Malborough Media,'' which operated two local stations [[Sounds FM]] and Easy FM. Later in 2008 Easy FM was rebranded as The Breeze broadcasting on 96.1&nbsp;MHz.\n\n===Christchurch===\nThis station was originally [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury's]] [[Lite FM (New Zealand)|Lite 94.5 FM]]. It was relaunched as The Breeze in 2004 when [[RadioWorks]] rebranded all their [[Easy Listening]] stations. Programming on this station is local between 6 am and 3 pm including weekends.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Breakfast presented by Dave Dunlay & Hilary Muir and the workday show is presented by Sue White. Programming from 6 am until 6 pm on weekends is local.\n\n===South Canterbury===\nMediaWorks purchased Timaru radio station [[Port FM]] in April 2018 with Port FM being rebranded as More FM shortly after. Prior to this acquisition, MediaWorks had operated many of their network stations in the South Canterbury and West Coast of the South Island under a franchise agreement with Port FM. Following the sale of Port FM The Breeze was started in Timaru on 89.9FM and 92.3FM and the local breakfast announcer from Port FM was moved to The Breeze South Canterbury.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Breakfast presented by OJ Jackson.\n\n=== Dunedin ===\nThe Breeze began in [[Dunedin]] at 7pm on 3 December 2004 a week after the frequency's former 98 [[More FM]] switched to 97.4&nbsp;MHz. Initially, the program was a simulcast of The Breeze Christchurch. In April 2007 Tracy Chambers (the daytime announcer) was moved to the breakfast show to present a local breakfast.\n\n'''Local Programming:''' Breakfast presented by Damian Newell\n\n===Queenstown===\nRadioworks purchased [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] radio station Q92FM in March 2006 and later rebranded the station as Q92 The Breeze. Originally Q92FM played Adult Contemporary Music but was changed to the Easy Listening format used by The Breeze when the station was rebranded. Q92 The Breeze could also be heard in Wanaka on 96.8&nbsp;MHz and previously in Central Otago (however Central Otago now takes the networked The Breeze). In late 2009 the station traded places on the FM dial with [[More FM|99.2 More FM]] with the More FM station becoming '''Q92 99.4 More FM''' (the 99.4&nbsp;MHz frequency is for Wanaka). At the same time the local breakfast show that was on The Breeze in Queenstown was moved to More FM with The Breeze in Queenstown now running networked shows at all times.\n\n===Central Otago===\nThe Breeze began broadcasting in [[Central Otago]] in 2007 originally this station was a relay of the [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] programme with Queenstown advertising. In 2009 this was replaced with the Auckland-based network feed with local Central Otago advertising.\n\n===Southland===\nThe Breeze launched in [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] at 11 pm on Sunday 28 October 2007 on 91.6&nbsp;MHz, a frequency previously used by [[Radio Pacific]].

Their unique heavy western sound has brought attention from both fans and press alike. Since their debut in 1999, Ghoultown has released four CDs, as well as several compilations, movies, short films, a comic book and a video game.\n\n==Biography==\nFormed in 1999, by vocalist/guitarist Count Lyle ([[Solitude Aeturnus]], The Killcreeps), Ghoultown recorded its first 3-song EP in October of that same year. Titled ''[[Boots of Hell]]'', the EP illustrated the power of the band's Tex-Mex blend while garnering rabid reviews, a fanbase and independent radio airplay. With ''[[Boots of Hell]]'' in circulation, the band's early buzz landed them several compilation appearances. The most notable being Skully Records' (NY) ''Gothabilly 2: Rockin' Necropolis'' where they share the bill with some of the best [[psychobilly]] acts around the world. As a kick off, the band was invited to participate in the world-release show held at NY's infamous [[CBGB]]'s on Halloween 2000.\n\nIn early 2001, Ghoultown released their full-length debut ''[[Tales from the Dead West]]''. The album, produced by Kol Marshall ([[Mercyful Fate]], etc.), captured the versatility and unique sound of the Texan quintet from the powerful \"Killer in Texas\" to the Doors-esque \"Running From the Sun.\" \"This album already has a place on my best of 2001 list,\" quoted a Harder Beat reviewer who reflected the positive response. Not only were ears turned, but eyes as well as the release pushed the band into new live show territory. With highlight performances such as an Atlanta benefit, which featured Jerry Only of the legendary Misfits as an onstage guest, Ghoultown has played with an amazing variety of bands such as [[Hank III]], [[Rocket from the Crypt]], [[The Independents (band)|The Independents]], [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|DRI]], Bile, [[Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], Flametrick Subs, [[Dick Dale]], Road Kings, Men of Porn, Captured By Robots, Fear, Cruxshadows, and [[Misfits (band)|The Misfits]].\n\nBy 2002, four of the band's songs were chosen for the soundtrack of the horror-slasher ''American Nightmare'', starring B-movie queen [[Debbie Rochon]] (''[[Tromeo and Juliet]]''). The movie script was subsequently altered to include a Ghoultown performance cameo after the director witnessed the band live, and the video for their track \"Killer In Texas\" was included as a bonus on the DVD.\n\nIn the spring of 2002, the band released their follow-up ''[[Give 'Em More Rope]]'', and Angry Planet Records signed an exclusive licensing deal with Netherlands-based Corazong Records to release the Ghoultown U.S. catalog in Europe and Canada. The first Euro-Canadian release was a special version of ''[[Tales from the Dead West]]'', which included tracks from their ''[[Boots of Hell]]'' EP as well.\n\nIn the late summer, Ghoultown did a 35 date U.S. tour which included performances at NY's CBGBs to The Garage in L.A. The tour was concluded by a performance at one of the world's largest annual entertainment media conventions, Dragon*Con in Atlanta, where the band has performed for the last two years by popular demand.\n\nHitting 2003, Ghoultown's signature tune \"Killer In Texas\" made yet another appearance in a short film called ''Headcheese'' which was released on DVD with a movie called ''Freak''. Appropriately, ''Headcheese'' was filmed in the same location as ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]''... house and all! Spending the first half of 2003 performing, the band toured the midwest and east coast, in addition to numerous Texas area shows. By the end of spring, Ghoultown completed work on songs for two upcoming [[Jon Keeyes]] films, ''Slice of Life'' and ''Hallow's End'', the later in which they will also be making a cameo appearance. These are due on the market around Halloween.\n\nIn 2004, Ghoultown released a double disc set, ''Live From Texas!'', which showcased their powerful live show on both CD and DVD. \"Ghoultown puts the grit back into rock 'n' roll with a blazing hellfire vengeance!\" said Horror Garage in praise of the release, which has garnered extremely positive feedback and become the best selling release to date. Also in 2004, the band managed to creep into the video game market where several of their actual gig posters can be seen in the award-winning ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines]]'' PC game.\n\nOctober 2006 saw the release of the full-length Ghoultown album, ''Bury Them Deep'', with a cover painted by illustrator [[Dan Brereton]], creator of ''[[Nocturnals]]''.\n\nIn 2008, Ghoultown had two releases: ''Skeleton Cowboys'', a limited edition hand-numbered 7\" vinyl single; and ''Life After Sundown'', a full-length studio album (also featuring cover art by Dan Brereton).\n\nNew album entitled ''Ghost of the Southern Son'' has been released on March 15, 2017.\n\n==Band members==\n*Count Lyle - Vocals, Guitar\n*Jake Middlefinger - Guitar\n*Lizard Lazario - Acoustic Guitar, Backing Vocals\n*Santi - Bass, Backing Vocals\n*Dalton Black - Drums\n*Randy Grimm - Trumpet\n\n'''Former Band Members'''\n*Queeno DeVamps - Bass\n*X-Ray Charles - Drums\n*Dez Black - Trumpet\n*J.

{"title_page": "Summer Records", "text_new": "'''Summer Records''' was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[reggae]] record label, active between the mid-1970s and late 1980s. Based in [[Malton, Mississauga|Malton, Ontario]], a suburb of [[Toronto]], it became one of Canada's first [[Black Canadians|Black]]-owned record labels, as well as one of the first to release Canadian-made reggae music.\n\n== History ==\nThe label was founded in 1974 by Jerry Brown, a [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrant to Canada. In the 1960s, Brown had been a singer with a group known as The Jamaicans, but left the group just before they became popular. After a brief stint working on a cruise ship, Brown decided he wanted to move to the United States, but feared that if he did, he would be drafted to fight in [[Vietnam]]. So he came to Canada instead, where he found a small but growing [[Caribbean]] music scene. The majority of the music Brown heard around him was [[Ska]] and [[Calypso music|Calypso]], but he was more interested in Reggae. So with the money he made as a full-time mechanic, Brown, with partner Oswald Creary, bought a house on a dead-end street in Malton, and built a small recording studio in the basement. This would be where all of Summer Records music would be recorded.\n\nThe first two songs on the label, \"Love Makes the World Go Round\" and \"Sunrise\" by [[Johnny Osbourne]] with [[Bunny Brown]], were still built around rhythms imported from Jamaica. Released in 1974, the single sold poorly, and did not get any airplay on radio. Few radio stations in Canada played reggae at the time, and the few that did played only songs by well-known artists, such as [[Eric Clapton]]'s \"[[I Shot the Sheriff]]\". But this did not deter Brown.\n\nIn 1976, Brown met Lloyd James (aka Prince Jammy, later [[King Jammy]]) at the [[Masonic Temple (Toronto)|Masonic Temple]] in Toronto. King Jammy joined Summer Records, but his arrival caused friction between Brown and Creary. Creary soon left to found his own record label, Half Moon Records. Summer Records continued to release singles which, while ignored at home in Canada, were being noticed abroad. In Jamaica, there was some resistance to the fact that the records were not made there, but Brown got over that by putting a \"Made in Jamaica\" label on them.\n\nIn 1977, Summer Records released their first full-length record, ''Innocent Youths''. It was made by Earth, Roots & Water, a group that had played on many Summer Records artists' music. The band were also the opening act for [[The Police]], at the first gig the UK band did in Toronto. The two bands got along well, and The Police brought a copy of ''Innocent Youths'' home with them. It became one of the inspirations behind the album ''[[Outlandos d'Amour]]'', and The Police wanted to have Earth, Roots & Water open for them on their North American tour. However, by that point, poor record sales had already caused the Canadian group to disband.<ref>{{cite news | title = CBC Radio 2 Inside The Music - Right Right Time: 1960's Reggae In Toronto  | url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/programs/2010/06/rightrighttimetwo.html | accessdate = 2010-06-06 | work=CBC News }} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, former [[Sound Dimension]] and [[The Skatalites|Skatalites]] member [[Jackie Mittoo]] collaborated with [[Willi Williams]] to create a new version of the song \"Real Rock\". It was released on Summer Records as \"Armagideon Time\", and would later be covered by the UK band [[The Clash]]. Williams would latter create another version of the song, called \"Rocking Universally\" which Summer also released. A third version would be released, also known as \"Rocking Universally\", but this version was by Noel Ellis, another Summer Records artist.\n\nEllis released a self-titled album in 1983, which would be the second and last full-length LP that Summer Records would release. Sales were poor, so Brown decided that Summer would, going forward, only release singles, which were cheaper to produce.\n\nMeanwhile, King Jammy had returned to Jamaica and had created the \"[[Sleng Teng]]\" beat, a digital rhythm style named after the [[Wayne Smith (musician)|Wayne Smith]] song \"Under Me Sleng Teng\". This started a fad in reggae music for using electronic instruments. Summer Records would follow that trend by releasing songs like \"Call Me Nobody Else\" by Unique Madoo, as well as \"Ska Doo\" and \"Run Them a Run\" by Williams. \"Call Me Nobody Else\" was a hit for the label and sold several hundred copies. However, Brown preferred traditional instruments and Summer Records went back to the old school style.\n\nBy 1988, Brown who was still working full-time as a mechanic, and also had a family to support, could no longer afford to keep Summer Records going. He sold the house in Malton, as well as the equipment, and in 1992, he moved back to Jamaica. The entire Summer Records catalogue went out of print, and became scarce. This began to change in the late 2000s, as the US record label [[Light in the Attic Records]] re-released some of Summer Records music on CD, vinyl and digital formats. Releases include ''Summer Records Anthology 1974\u20131988'', as well as a reissue of ''Innocent Youths''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Light In The Attic - Summer Records  | url=http://lightintheattic.net/news/?cat=12 | accessdate = 2010-06-06}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Black Canadian culture in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Canadian independent record labels]]\n[[Category:Caribbean-Canadian culture in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Defunct record labels of Canada]]\n[[Category:Record labels disestablished in 1988]]\n[[Category:Record labels established in 1974]]\n[[Category:Reggae record labels]]\n", "text_old": "'''Summer Records''' was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[reggae]] record label, active between the mid-1970s and late 1980s.

Summer Records would follow that trend by releasing songs like \"Call Me Nobody Else\" by Unique Madoo, as well as \"Ska Doo\" and \"Run Them a Run\" by Williams. \"Call Me Nobody Else\" was a hit for the label and sold several hundred copies. However, Brown preferred traditional instruments and Summer Records went back to the old school style.\n\nBy 1988, Brown who was still working full-time as a mechanic, and also had a family to support, could no longer afford to keep Summer Records going. He sold the house in Malton, as well as the equipment, and in 1992, he moved back to Jamaica. The entire Summer Records catalogue went out of print, and became scarce. This began to change in the late 2000s, as the US record label [[Light in the Attic Records]] re-released some of Summer Records music on CD and digital format. Releases include ''Summer Records Anthology 1974\u20131988'', as well as a reissue of ''Innocent Youths''.<ref>{{cite web | title = Light In The Attic - Summer Records  | url=http://lightintheattic.net/news/?cat=12 | accessdate = 2010-06-06}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Black Canadian culture in Toronto]]\n[[Category:Canadian independent record labels]]\n[[Category:Caribbean-Canadian culture in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Defunct record labels of Canada]]\n[[Category:Record labels disestablished in 1988]]\n[[Category:Record labels established in 1974]]\n[[Category:Reggae record labels]]\n", "name_user": "Blackjays1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Records"}
