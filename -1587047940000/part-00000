After completing elementary education in his home village, he enrolled at [[Al-Azhar University]] to complete his schooling in 1849. He entered the army and moved up quickly through the ranks, reaching lieutenant colonel by age 20. The modern education and military service of \u02bbUrabi, from a ''[[fellah]]'', or peasant background, would not have been possible without the modernising reforms of Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail]], who had done much to eliminate the barriers between the bulk of the Egyptian populace and the ruling elite, who were drawn largely from the military castes that had ruled Egypt for centuries. Ismail abolished the exclusive access to the Egyptian and Sudanese military ranks by Egyptians of Balkan, Circassian, and Turkish origin. Ismail conscripted soldiers and recruited students from throughout Egypt and Sudan regardless of class and ethnic backgrounds in order to form a \"modern\" and \"national\" Egyptian military and bureaucratic elite class. Without these reforms, \u02bbUrabi's rise through the ranks of the military would likely have been far more restricted.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n== Protest against Tewfik ==\nHe was a galvanizing speaker. Because of his peasant origins, he was at the time, and is still today, viewed as an authentic voice of the Egyptian people. Indeed, he was known by his followers as 'El Wahid' (the Only One), and when the British poet and explorer [[Wilfrid Blunt]] went to meet him, he found the entrance of \u02bbUrabi's house was blocked with supplicants. When Khedive Tewfik issued a new law preventing peasants from becoming officers, \u02bbUrabi led the group protesting the preference shown to aristocratic officers (again, largely Egyptians of foreign descent). \u02bbUrabi repeatedly condemned severe prevalent racial discrimination of Egyptians in the army.<ref name=\":0\">Thompson, Elizabeth. \"Ahmad Urabi and Nazem al- Islam Kermani: Constitutional Justice in Egypt and Iran,\" ''Justice Interrupted'' (Harvard, 2013), 61\u201388.</ref> He and his followers, who included most of the army, were successful and the law was repealed. In 1879 they formed the Egyptian Nationalist Party in the hopes of fostering a stronger national identity.\n\nHe and his allies in the army joined with the reformers in February 1882 to demand change. This revolt, also known as the [[\u02bbUrabi Revolt]], was primarily inspired by his desire for social justice for the Egyptians based on equal standing before the law. With the support of the peasants as well, he launched a broader effort to try to wrest Egypt and Sudan from foreign control, and also to end the absolutist regime of the Khedive, who was himself subject to Anglo-French control under the rules of the [[Caisse de la Dette Publique]]. The Arab-Egyptian deputies demanded a constitution that granted the state parliamentary power.<ref name=\":0\" /> The revolt then spread to express resentment of the undue influence of foreigners, including the predominantly Turko-[[Circassians|Circassian]] aristocracy.\n\n== Parliament planning ==\n\u02bbUrabi was first promoted to [[Bey]], then made under-secretary of war, and ultimately a member of the cabinet. Plans were developed to create a parliamentary assembly. During the last months of the revolt (July to September 1882), it was claimed that \u02bbUrabi held the office of Prime Minister of the hastily created common law government based on popular sovereignty.<ref name=\":0\" /> Feeling threatened, Khedive Tewfik requested assistance against \u02bbUrabi from the [[Ottoman Sultan]], to whom Egypt and Sudan still owed technical fealty. The [[Sublime Porte]] hesitated in responding to the request.\n\n== British intervention ==\n[[File:Surrender of Ahmed Urabi.jpg|thumb|\u02bbUrabi surrenders to [[Drury Drury-Lowe]]]]\nThe British were especially concerned that \u02bbUrabi would default on Egypt's massive debt and that he might try to regain control of the [[Suez Canal]]. Therefore, they and the French dispatched warships to Egypt to intimidate the nationalists. Tewfik fled to their protection, moving his court to [[Alexandria]]. The strong naval presence spurred fears of an imminent invasion (as had been the case in Tunisia in 1881); [[Bombardment of Alexandria (1882)#Origins|anti-Christian riots]] to break out in [[Alexandria]] on 12 June 1882. The French fleet was recalled to France. The British warships in the harbor opened fire on the city's gun emplacements after the Egyptians ignored an ultimatum from Admiral Seymour to remove them. In September a British army landed in Alexandria but failed to reach Cairo after being checked at the [[Battle of Kafr El Dawwar]]. Another army, led by [[Sir Garnet Wolseley]], landed in the Canal Zone and on 13 September 1882 they defeated \u02bbUrabi's army at the [[Battle of Tell El Kebir]]. From there, the British cavalry advanced on Cairo which surrendered without a shot being fired, as did \u02bbUrabi and the other nationalist leaders.\n\n== Exile and return ==\n\u02bbUrabi was tried by the restored [[Khedivate of Egypt|Khedivate]] for rebellion on 3 December 1882.  He was defended by British solicitor [[Richard Eve]]<ref>Obituary for Richard Eve in ''[[The Sphere (newspaper)|The Sphere]]'', 11 July 1900, pg 93</ref> and [[Alexander Meyrick Broadley]]. According to Elizabeth Thompson, \u02bbUrabi's defense stressed the idea that despite the fact that he had been illegally incarcerated by [[Riaz Pasha|Riyad Pasha]] and the Khedive Tewfik he had still responded in a manner allowed under Egyptian law and with the hopes that the [[Khedivate of Egypt|khedivate]] remain after his intervention, thus demonstrating loyalty to the Egyptian people as required by his duties.<ref>Thompson, Elizabeth. ''Justice Interrupted: The Struggle for Constitutional Government in the Middle East''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2013. 69.</ref> In accordance with an understanding made with the British representative, [[Lord Dufferin]], \u02bbUrabi pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death, but the sentence was immediately commuted to one of banishment for life.<ref name=\"baring\">{{cite book|last1=Baring|first1=Evelyn|authorlink1=Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer|title=Modern Egypt|date=1908|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|page=336 |url=https://archive.org/stream/modernegypt01earl#page/336/mode/2up|volume=1}}</ref> He left Egypt on 28 December 1882 for [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]). His home in Halloluwa Road, [[Kandy]] (formerly owned by Mudaliyar [[Jeronis de Soysa]])<ref>{{cite book|title=The Desoyas of Alfred House|first=Rupa|last=de Soysa|page=34|publisher=Karunaratne & Sons}}</ref> is now the Orabi Pasha Cultural Center<!--sic-->. During his time in Ceylon, \u02bbUrabi worked to improve the quality of education amongst the Muslims in the country. [[Hameed Al Husseinie College]], Sri Lanka's first school for Muslims was established in 15 November 1884 and after eight years [[Zahira College, Colombo|Zahira College]], was established in 22 August 1892 under his patronage.  In May 1901, Khedive [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]], Tewfik's son and successor permitted \u02bbUrabi to return to Egypt. Abbas was a nationalist in the vein of his grandfather, Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail the Magnificent]], and was deeply opposed to the British occupation of the country. \u02bbUrabi returned on 1 October 1901, and remained in Egypt until his death on 21 September 1911.<ref>[http://www2.sis.gov.eg/Functions/S_Print.asp?ArtId=2000000000000000000097&lg=En Egypt state information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525125725/http://www2.sis.gov.eg/Functions/S_Print.asp?ArtId=2000000000000000000097&lg=En |date=May 25, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nWhile British intervention was meant to be short term, British forces continued to occupy the country.  The British instituted the ousting of Khedive Abbas II in 1914, after which Egypt once more became a sultanate and also a British [[protectorate]].

After completing elementary education in his home village, he enrolled at [[Al-Azhar University]] to complete his schooling in 1849. He entered the army and moved up quickly through the ranks, reaching lieutenant colonel by age 20. The modern education and military service of \u02bbUrabi, from a ''[[fellah]]'', or peasant background, would not have been possible without the modernising reforms of Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail]], who had done much to eliminate the barriers between the bulk of the Egyptian populace and the ruling elite, who were drawn largely from the military castes that had ruled Egypt for centuries. Ismail abolished the exclusive access to the Egyptian and Sudanese military ranks by Egyptians of Balkan, Circassian, and Turkish origin.  Ismail conscripted soldiers and recruited students from throughout Egypt and Sudan regardless of class and ethnic backgrounds in order to form a \"modern\" and \"national\" Egyptian military and bureaucratic elite class. Without these reforms, \u02bbUrabi's rise through the ranks of the military would likely have been far more restricted.{{citation_needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n== Protest against Tewfik ==\nHe was a galvanizing speaker. Because of his peasant origins, he was at the time, and is still today, viewed as an authentic voice of the Egyptian people. Indeed, he was known by his followers as 'El Wahid' (the Only One), and when the British poet and explorer [[Wilfrid Blunt]] went to meet him, he found the entrance of \u02bbUrabi's house was blocked with supplicants. When Khedive Tewfik issued a new law preventing peasants from becoming officers, \u02bbUrabi led the group protesting the preference shown to aristocratic officers (again, largely Egyptians of foreign descent). \u02bbUrabi repeatedly condemned severe prevalent racial discrimination of Egyptians in the army.<ref name=\":0\">Thompson, Elizabeth. \u201cAhmad Urabi and Nazem al- Islam Kermani: Constitutional Justice in Egypt and Iran,\u201d Justice Interrupted (Harvard, 2013), 61\u201388.</ref> He and his followers, who included most of the army, were successful and the law was repealed. In 1879 they formed the Egyptian Nationalist Party in the hopes of fostering a stronger national identity.\n\nHe and his allies in the army joined with the reformers in February 1882 to demand change. This revolt, also known as the [[\u02bbUrabi Revolt]], was primarily inspired by his desire for social justice for the Egyptians based on equal standing before the law. With the support of the peasants as well, he launched a broader effort to try to wrest Egypt and Sudan from foreign control, and also to end the absolutist regime of the Khedive, who was himself subject to Anglo-French control under the rules of the [[Caisse de la Dette Publique]]. The Arab-Egyptian deputies demanded a constitution that granted the state parliamentary power.<ref name=\":0\" /> The revolt then spread to express resentment of the undue influence of foreigners, including the predominantly Turko-[[Circassians|Circassian]] aristocracy.\n\n== Parliament planning ==\n\u02bbUrabi was first promoted to [[Bey]], then made under-secretary of war, and ultimately a member of the cabinet. Plans were developed to create a parliamentary assembly. During the last months of the revolt (July to September 1882), it was claimed that \u02bbUrabi held the office of Prime Minister of the hastily created common law government based on popular sovereignty.<ref name=\":0\" /> Feeling threatened, Khedive Tewfik requested assistance against \u02bbUrabi from the [[Ottoman Sultan]], to whom Egypt and Sudan still owed technical fealty. The [[Sublime Porte]] hesitated in responding to the request.\n\n== British intervention ==\n[[File:Surrender of Ahmed Urabi.jpg|thumb|\u02bbUrabi surrenders to [[Drury Drury-Lowe]]]]\nThe British were especially concerned that \u02bbUrabi would default on Egypt's massive debt and that he might try to regain control of the [[Suez Canal]]. Therefore, they and the French dispatched warships to Egypt to intimidate the nationalists. Tewfik fled to their protection, moving his court to [[Alexandria]]. The strong naval presence spurred fears of an imminent invasion (as had been the case in Tunisia in 1881); [[Bombardment of Alexandria (1882)#Origins|anti-Christian riots]] to break out in [[Alexandria]] on 12 June 1882. The French fleet was recalled to France. The British warships in the harbor opened fire on the city's gun emplacements after the Egyptians ignored an ultimatum from Admiral Seymour to remove them. In September a British army landed in Alexandria but failed to reach Cairo after being checked at the [[Battle of Kafr El Dawwar]]. Another army, led by [[Sir Garnet Wolseley]], landed in the Canal Zone and on 13 September 1882 they defeated \u02bbUrabi's army at the [[Battle of Tell El Kebir]]. From there, the British cavalry advanced on Cairo which surrendered without a shot being fired, as did \u02bbUrabi and the other nationalist leaders.\n\n== Exile and return ==\n\u02bbUrabi was tried by the restored [[Khedivate of Egypt|Khedivate]] for rebellion on 3 December 1882.  He was defended by British solicitor [[Richard Eve]]<ref>Obituary for Richard Eve in ''[[The Sphere (newspaper)|The Sphere]]'' 11 July 1900 pg 93</ref> and [[Alexander Meyrick Broadley]]. According to Elizabeth Thompson, \u02bbUrabi's defense stressed the idea that despite the fact that he had been illegally incarcerated by [[Riaz Pasha|Riyad Pasha]] and the Khedive Tewfik he had still responded in a manner allowed under Egyptian law and with the hopes that the [[Khedivate of Egypt|khedivate]] remain after his intervention, thus demonstrating loyalty to the Egyptian people as required by his duties.<ref>Thompson, Elizabeth.

In May 1901, Khedive [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas II]], Tewfik's son and successor permitted \u02bbUrabi to return to Egypt. Abbas was a nationalist in the vein of his grandfather, Khedive [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail the Magnificent]], and was deeply opposed to the British occupation of the country. \u02bbUrabi returned on 1 October 1901, and remained in Egypt until his death on 21 September 1911.<ref>[http://www2.sis.gov.eg/Functions/S_Print.asp?ArtId=2000000000000000000097&lg=En Egypt state information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525125725/http://www2.sis.gov.eg/Functions/S_Print.asp?ArtId=2000000000000000000097&lg=En |date=May 25, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nWhile British intervention was meant to be short term, British forces continued to occupy the country.
