It is a [[ghost story]] set in a dilapidated mansion in [[Warwickshire, England]] in the 1940s. Departing from her earlier themes of lesbian and gay fiction, Waters' fifth novel features a male narrator, a country doctor who makes friends with an old gentry family of declining fortunes who own a very old estate that is crumbling around them. The stress of reconciling the state of their finances with the familial responsibility of keeping the estate coincides with perplexing events which may or may not be of supernatural origin, culminating in tragedy.\n\nReviewers note that the themes in ''The Little Stranger'' are alternately reflections of evil and struggle related to upper class hierarchy misconfiguration in post war Britain. Waters stated that she did not set out to write a ghost story, but began her writing with an exploration of the rise of socialism in the United Kingdom and how the fading gentry dealt with losing their legacies. A mix of influences is evident to reviewers: [[Henry James]], [[Shirley Jackson]], [[Wilkie Collins]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. The novel was mostly well received by critics as Waters' strengths are exhibited in setting of mood and pacing of the story. It is Waters' third novel to be short-listed for the [[Man Booker Prize]].<ref name=\"manbooker\">[http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/397 The Little Stranger], Man Booker Prize website.

He treats a young maid who dislikes the large, draughty emptiness of the house, but strikes a friendship with Caroline Ayres, the unmarried daughter of the family, her brother Roderick, who continues to heal physically and mentally from his experiences as a pilot in World War II, and their mother, the lady of the estate. He begins treating Roderick's lingering badly-healed wounds and becomes a family friend, knowing them well enough to realise they are in dire financial straits and unable to keep the house in any comfortable condition without selling their lands or objects in the house.\n\nIn an attempt to cheer up the family and possibly match Caroline to a potential husband, they throw a party for a few family friends when disaster strikes. A couple brings their young child who is mauled by Caroline's ancient and previously gentle Labrador retriever. Roderick begins to behave moodily and drink heavily. Faraday believes the strain of managing the estate is at fault. Roderick, however, divulges that something appeared in his room the night the dog attacked the girl. He says that it was first in his room trying to harm him, and that he must keep the unseen force focussed on him so as not to direct its attention to his sister or mother. Spots begin appearing on his walls looking like burns, and, after Caroline awakes in the middle of the night to find his room on fire, Roderick is committed to a mental hospital.\n\nFaraday and Caroline waver between romance and confused platonic friendship. Other sounds in the house alarm Caroline and Mrs Ayres and their two maids. They find curious childish writing on the walls where these activities have taken place. The maids' bells sound without anyone calling them; the phone rings in the middle of the night with no one on the line. A 19th century tube communication device linking the abandoned nursery to the kitchen begins to sound, scaring the maids. When Mrs Ayres goes to investigate, she is locked in the nursery where Susan, her much-loved first daughter, died of [[diphtheria]] at eight years old. Experiencing shadows and indiscernible fluttering and frantic to escape, Mrs Ayres pounds the windows open, cutting her arms. After Caroline and the maids free her and she recovers, she comes to believe and take comfort that Susan is around her at all times, that Susan is impatient to be with her though she sometimes harms her. One morning not long after, Caroline and the maid find that Mrs Ayres has hanged herself.\n\nThe day of Mrs Ayres' funeral, Faraday and Caroline set plans to marry in six weeks' time. Caroline, however, is listless and uninterested in the wedding, eventually calling it off and making plans to sell Hundreds Hall. Faraday is unable to believe it and tries several times to talk Caroline out of it, to no avail. On the night of their would-be wedding, Faraday has a call that keeps him out. When he finally comes home, he learns that Caroline hurled herself off the second floor onto a marble landing, killing herself. The maid reports at the inquest that she awoke to hear Caroline go upstairs to investigate a sound she heard in the darkened hall. She simply said \"You!\" then fell to her death. Three years later, Faraday continues to visit the abandoned mansion, unable to find what Caroline saw.\n\n==Style==\nSara O'Leary in ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'' states that Waters' narrative voice is her strongest asset and that she has an \"uncanny ability to synthesize her research and is never expository in the telling details she draws upon\u2014tiny little things about what people wore or ate or had in their houses\".<ref>O'Leary, Sarah (16 May 2009). \"Odd doings at hundreds hall; Sarah waters takes readers somewhere unexpected\", ''The Gazette'' (Montreal), p. H11.</ref> Emma Donoghue in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' remarks on the diversion from the narrative style in ''The Little Stranger''. Waters is known in her previous four novels for providing plot twists, but this one, notes Donoghue, provides a straightforward accounting that tackles issues of insanity, [[poltergeist]]s, and family secrets \"with a minimum of tricks\".<ref name=\"donoghue\">Donoghue, Emma (16 May 2009). \"Just who's to blame for all this horror?\", ''The Globe and Mail'' (Canada), p. F10.</ref> The review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' concurs, using a quote by Henry James to say everything to be done in the way of ghost stories and [[haunted house]]s has been done. [[Ron Charles (critic)|Ron Charles]] states that the novel is not clich\u00e9 due to Waters' restraint: \"the story's sustained ambiguity is what keeps our attention, and her perfectly calibrated tone casts an unnerving spell\".<ref name=\"charles\"/> A similar review appeared in ''[[The Australian]]'' calling attention to Waters' \"moderation and flawless cadence\" that forms \"a story pulsing with malevolent energy\" and an \"atmosphere is wickedly, addictively tense\".<ref name=\"starford\"/>\n\nIn ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', John Preston writes that \"the richness of Waters's writing ensures that the air of thickening dread is very thick indeed. Everything, from Mrs Ayres's 'absurdly over-engineered shoes', to the hairs on Caroline's legs\u2014each one 'laden with dust, like an eye-blacked lash'\u2014is described with a wonderfully sharp eye.\"<ref name=\"preston\">Preston, John (17 May 2009). \"FICTION: Sarah Waters's old-style ghost story makes the hairs on the back of John Preston's neck stand up\", ''The Sunday Telegraph'' (London), p. 29.</ref> Waters herself acknowledges the light-handedness of the supernatural elements of the story, stating \"I wanted the ghost story to be fairly subtle. The ghost stories that I've enjoyed are uncanny, unsettling and eerie more than they are about in-your-face pyrotechnics. I wanted it to be very based in the social context of the time, but for it to have this extra element of strangeness.\"<ref name=\"wagner\"/>\n\nSeveral references in ''The Little Stranger'' indicate the influences Waters used in its composition. Rebecca Starford in ''The Australian'' praises Waters' ability to use elements from other authors: \"Waters is one of the great contemporary storytellers. She has never made bones about borrowing\", noting that her inspirations for this story were [[Daphne du Maurier]], [[Henry James]], [[Agatha Christie]], and [[Charles Dickens]].<ref name=\"starford\"/> As children, Roderick and Caroline changed the hands of a broken clock to twenty minutes to nine, thinking it amusing to reflect the stopped clocks of [[Miss Havisham]]'s house from Dickens' ''[[Great Expectations]]''. Like the narrator of du Maurier's ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'', Faraday has no first name; the man overcome by the house in Poe's ''The Fall of the House of Usher'' is also named Roderick. Peter Cannon in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' writes that the novel is evocative of Henry James' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' and [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]''.<ref>Cannon, Peter (13 July 2009). \"Horror for the Refined\", ''Publishers Weekly'', p. 20.</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Evil===\n[[File:Ragley Hall2.jpg|thumb|''The Little Stranger'' is set in an estate similar to [[Ragley Hall]] in [[Warwickshire]] with extensive grounds, although many rooms in Hundreds Hall are closed, making it seem partially paralysed.]]\n\nAs a doctor, Faraday is a rational narrator who confronts each member of the Ayres family and the maids in turn as they divulge their suspicions that something in the house is alive. As he consults with other physicians, they are able to explain away the strange happenings easily with answers supplied by medicine and psychology. Waters does not give definitive answers about the occurrences, leaving it more a philosophical issue. Not wanting to frustrate the reader however, she admits \"I tried to keep it strange, keep what was happening genuinely odd, without closing it down with a neat explanation at the end.\"<ref>Gilbert, Matthew (24 July 2009). \"A Ghostly Turn\", ''The Boston Globe'', p. 5.</ref> The title of the book is a reference to Faraday's continuing questions; Roderick is fearful that the house is infectious. Eventually Faraday wonders if it is \"consumed by some dark germ, some ravenous shadow-creature, some 'little stranger' spawned from the troubled unconscious of someone connected with the house itself\".<ref name=\"starford\">Starford, Rebecca (2 May 2009). \"Something wicked this way comes\", ''The Weekend Australian'', p. 12.</ref><ref>Waters, p. 463.</ref>\n\n[[Emma Donoghue]] considers the deepest theme of the story to be \"the unpindownability of evil\", as suspicion shifts to individuals who may be self-destructing from the forces around them, possible malevolent motivations from the family or house staff, an unseen force inhabiting the house, or Faraday himself.<ref name=\"donoghue\"/> Faraday's concern for the family is often intertwined for concern for the house so that he often discourages those who are obviously troubled by staying there from leaving it. He explains away the suspicions of Mrs Ayres, who believes that Susan is in the house trying to hasten their reunion; Caroline, who believes that Roderick is so upset in the mental institution that a part of him is trying to contact the family to warn them of something; and Betty, the maid who is convinced the malevolent spirit of a former domestic resides on the second floor of the home. Faraday's rationalisations become increasingly improbable as he blames all the strangeness on fatigue, stress, even the house's plumbing.<ref name=\"didock\"/> Ron Charles in ''The Washington Post'' considers Faraday's deep concern for the family that is often mixed with envy to be influenced by [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s psychopathic manipulator [[Tom Ripley]].<ref name=\"charles\"/>\n\n===Class===\nClass and ambition is repeatedly referenced in the novel. Faraday's mother was at one time a nursery maid at Hundreds Hall, much like Waters' grandparents who were domestics in a country estate;<ref name=\"allemang\"/> the reader is first given a description of its opulence when the narrator is a child and he attends a garden [[f\u00eate]], and is so entranced with the building he plies a piece of it off and puts it in his pocket. He often revisits his memory of his first significant impression of the mansion comparing it with its current state. Soldiers were billeted in its rooms during the recent war. Two centuries of wear and weather have taken their toll, and the taxes on the British gentry are too high for the family to bear. They attempt to reconcile their family legacy with the reality of having no money to keep it up. Charlotte Heathcote in ''The Sunday Express'' and Rebecca Starford in ''The Australian'' both note that the novel is preoccupied with class.<ref name=\"heathcote\">Heathcote, Charlotte, (12 July 2009). \"FICTION: Review\", ''Sunday Express'', p. 67.</ref>\n\nFaraday too is conflicted as he recounts how his family sacrificed everything, including his mother's health and life to give him his education. He laments that he has not achieved anything with it and he visits Hundreds Hall vacillating between being flattered and feeling undeserving of knowing a family like the Ayres.

It is a [[ghost story]] set in a dilapidated mansion in [[Warwickshire, England]] in the 1940s. Departing from her earlier themes of lesbian and gay fiction, Waters' fifth novel features a male narrator, a country doctor who makes friends with an old gentry family of declining fortunes who own a very old estate that is crumbling around them. The stress of reconciling the state of their finances with the familial responsibility of keeping the estate coincides with perplexing events which may or may not be of supernatural origin, culminating in tragedy.\n\nReviewers note that the themes in ''The Little Stranger'' are alternately reflections of evil and struggle related to upper class hierarchy misconfiguration in post war Britain. Waters stated that she did not set out to write a ghost story, but began her writing with an exploration of the rise of socialism in the United Kingdom and how the fading gentry dealt with losing their legacies. A mix of influences is evident to reviewers: [[Henry James]], [[Shirley Jackson]], [[Wilkie Collins]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. The novel was mostly well received by critics as Waters' strengths are exhibited in setting of mood and pacing of the story. It is Waters' third novel to be short-listed for the [[Man Booker Prize]].<ref name=\"manbooker\">[http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/397 The Little Stranger], Man Booker Prize website. Retrieved on 15 September 2009.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nWaters' writing was well-received upon the publication of her first novel, ''[[Tipping the Velvet]]'', a story set in [[Victorian London]]. She began writing in her early 30s while completing a dissertation in English literature about gay and lesbian fiction from the 1870s onward. Not enjoying the expository, she attempted fiction and finding that she liked it, followed ''Tipping the Velvet'' with ''[[Affinity (novel)|Affinity]]'', another Victorian-set novel with gothic themes, and ''[[Fingersmith (novel)|Fingersmith]]'', also Victorian yet more a [[Charles Dickens|Dickensian]] crime drama. All three have significant lesbian themes and characters; Waters often labels them as \"Victorian lesbo romps\".<ref name=\"allemang\">Allemang, John (18 May 2009). \"Ghost writer: She's known for writing Victorian-era lesbian sex romps, but best-selling author Sarah Waters haunts a new genre in her latest novel, ''The Little Stranger''\", ''The Globe and Mail'' (Canada) p. R1.</ref>  To avoid being pigeonholed as a niche writer, however (asking \"Why, oh why, did I ever allow the phrase 'lesbo Victorian romp' to cross my lips?\"<ref name=\"starford\"/>),  she followed these with ''[[The Night Watch (Waters novel)|The Night Watch]]'', which also has gay and lesbian characters, but is set in the 1940s.<ref name=\"bio\">\"Sarah Waters\", ''[http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC Contemporary Authors Online]'', Gale, 2009. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center.</ref>\n\nFor ''The Little Stranger'', Waters diverted from overt lesbian themes, but incorporated other elements from previous books. A character in ''Affinity'' talks to spirits of the dead; the setting of ''Fingersmith'' is a large country estate inhabited by a small family and house staff; ''The Night Watch'' is set in post-WWII Britain with characters who are somewhat at a loss with what to do following the upheaval of war. Barry Didock in ''The Herald'' considers ''The Night Watch'' a companion piece to ''The Little Stranger''.<ref name=\"didock\">Didock, Barry (30 May 2009). \"Capturing the spirit of the age: A haunting novel evokes the claustrophobia of postwar Britain\", ''The Herald'' (Glasgow), p. 9.</ref> Waters states that the change from a conservative to socialist society was her true impetus for writing ''The Little Stranger'': \"I didn't set out to write a haunted house novel. I wanted to write about what happened to class in that post-war setting. It was a time of turmoil in exciting ways. Working class people had come out of the war with higher expectations. They had voted in the Labour government. They want change.... So it was a culture in a state of change. But obviously for some people it was a change for the worse.\"<ref name=\"wagner\">Wagner, Vit (16 May 2009). \"Post-war Britain ripe for ghost stories; U.K. author moves forward in time with latest historical novel\", ''The Toronto Star'', p.

Researching for ''The Night Watch'' gave her background that she used in ''The Little Stranger'', leading her to call 1947 \"a miserable year\"; much of her time preparing for this novel was spent in Warwickshire estate homes and local newspaper archives.<ref name=\"mccrum\"/> She told ''The Globe and Mail'' <blockquote>I read a lot of novels from the period. And diaries were a wonderful resource. I also watched films from that period and went to museums and archives to look at ephemera from the period. I like to try to capture the idiom and slang... A writer at that time wouldn't have used profanity in a respectable novel. But if you look at diaries or letters, people were swearing all the time, in very modern-sounding ways. One of the excitements about writing about the past from the present is that you can put in a lot of the details that the mainstream novelists of the time couldn't because of the conventions of the time.<ref name=\"wagner\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Plot summary==\nFaraday, a country doctor with humble beginnings, is called to Hundreds Hall, an 18th-century estate that has lived far beyond its former glory. He treats a young maid who dislikes the large, draughty emptiness of the house, but strikes a friendship with Caroline Ayres, the unmarried daughter of the family, her brother Roderick, who continues to heal physically and mentally from his experiences as a pilot in World War II, and their mother, the lady of the estate. He begins treating Roderick's lingering badly-healed wounds and becomes a family friend, knowing them well enough to realise they are in dire financial straits and unable to keep the house in any comfortable condition without selling their lands or objects in the house.\n\nIn an attempt to cheer up the family and possibly match Caroline to a potential husband, they throw a party for a few family friends when disaster strikes. A couple brings their young child who is mauled by Caroline's ancient and previously gentle Labrador retriever. Roderick begins to behave moodily and drink heavily. Faraday believes the strain of managing the estate is at fault. Roderick, however, divulges that something appeared in his room the night the dog attacked the girl. He says that it was first in his room trying to harm him, and that he must keep the unseen force focussed on him so as not to direct its attention to his sister or mother. Spots begin appearing on his walls looking like burns, and, after Caroline awakes in the middle of the night to find his room on fire, Roderick is committed to a mental hospital.\n\nFaraday and Caroline waver between romance and confused platonic friendship. Other sounds in the house alarm Caroline and Mrs Ayres and their two maids. They find curious childish writing on the walls where these activities have taken place. The maids' bells sound without anyone calling them; the phone rings in the middle of the night with no one on the line. A 19th century tube communication device linking the abandoned nursery to the kitchen begins to sound, scaring the maids. When Mrs Ayres goes to investigate, she is locked in the nursery where Susan, her much-loved first daughter, died of [[diphtheria]] at eight years old. Experiencing shadows and indiscernible fluttering and frantic to escape, Mrs Ayres pounds the windows open, cutting her arms. After Caroline and the maids free her and she recovers, she comes to believe and take comfort that Susan is around her at all times, that Susan is impatient to be with her though she sometimes harms her. One morning not long after, Caroline and the maid find that Mrs Ayres has hanged herself.\n\nThe day of Mrs Ayres' funeral, Faraday and Caroline set plans to marry in six weeks' time. Caroline, however, is listless and uninterested in the wedding, eventually calling it off and making plans to sell Hundreds Hall. Faraday is unable to believe it and tries several times to talk Caroline out of it, to no avail. On the night of their would-be wedding, Faraday has a call that keeps him out. When he finally comes home, he learns that Caroline hurled herself off the second floor onto a marble landing, killing herself. The maid reports at the inquest that she awoke to hear Caroline go upstairs to investigate a sound she heard in the darkened hall. She simply said \"You!\" then fell to her death. Three years later, Faraday continues to visit the abandoned mansion, unable to find what Caroline saw.\n\n==Style==\nSara O'Leary in ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'' states that Waters' narrative voice is her strongest asset and that she has an \"uncanny ability to synthesize her research and is never expository in the telling details she draws upon\u2014tiny little things about what people wore or ate or had in their houses\".<ref>O'Leary, Sarah (16 May 2009). \"Odd doings at hundreds hall; Sarah waters takes readers somewhere unexpected\", ''The Gazette'' (Montreal), p. H11.</ref> Emma Donoghue in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' remarks on the diversion from the narrative style in ''The Little Stranger''. Waters is known in her previous four novels for providing plot twists, but this one, notes Donoghue, provides a straightforward accounting that tackles issues of insanity, [[poltergeist]]s, and family secrets \"with a minimum of tricks\".<ref name=\"donoghue\">Donoghue, Emma (16 May 2009). \"Just who's to blame for all this horror?\", ''The Globe and Mail'' (Canada), p. F10.</ref> The review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' concurs, using a quote by Henry James to say everything to be done in the way of ghost stories and [[haunted house]]s has been done. [[Ron Charles (critic)|Ron Charles]] states that the novel is not clich\u00e9 due to Waters' restraint: \"the story's sustained ambiguity is what keeps our attention, and her perfectly calibrated tone casts an unnerving spell\".<ref name=\"charles\"/> A similar review appeared in ''[[The Australian]]'' calling attention to Waters' \"moderation and flawless cadence\" that forms \"a story pulsing with malevolent energy\" and an \"atmosphere is wickedly, addictively tense\".<ref name=\"starford\"/>\n\nIn ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', John Preston writes that \"the richness of Waters's writing ensures that the air of thickening dread is very thick indeed. Everything, from Mrs Ayres's 'absurdly over-engineered shoes', to the hairs on Caroline's legs\u2014each one 'laden with dust, like an eye-blacked lash'\u2014is described with a wonderfully sharp eye.\"<ref name=\"preston\">Preston, John (17 May 2009). \"FICTION: Sarah Waters's old-style ghost story makes the hairs on the back of John Preston's neck stand up\", ''The Sunday Telegraph'' (London), p. 29.</ref> Waters herself acknowledges the light-handedness of the supernatural elements of the story, stating \"I wanted the ghost story to be fairly subtle. The ghost stories that I've enjoyed are uncanny, unsettling and eerie more than they are about in-your-face pyrotechnics. I wanted it to be very based in the social context of the time, but for it to have this extra element of strangeness.\"<ref name=\"wagner\"/>\n\nSeveral references in ''The Little Stranger'' indicate the influences Waters used in its composition. Rebecca Starford in ''The Australian'' praises Waters' ability to use elements from other authors: \"Waters is one of the great contemporary storytellers. She has never made bones about borrowing\", noting that her inspirations for this story were [[Daphne du Maurier]], [[Henry James]], [[Agatha Christie]], and [[Charles Dickens]].<ref name=\"starford\"/> As children, Roderick and Caroline changed the hands of a broken clock to twenty minutes to nine, thinking it amusing to reflect the stopped clocks of [[Miss Havisham]]'s house from Dickens' ''[[Great Expectations]]''. Like the narrator of du Maurier's ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'', Faraday has no first name; the man overcome by the house in Poe's ''The Fall of the House of Usher'' is also named Roderick. Peter Cannon in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' writes that the novel is evocative of Henry James' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'' and [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]''.<ref>Cannon, Peter (13 July 2009). \"Horror for the Refined\", ''Publishers Weekly'', p. 20.</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Evil===\n[[File:Ragley Hall2.jpg|thumb|''The Little Stranger'' is set in an estate similar to [[Ragley Hall]] in [[Warwickshire]] with extensive grounds, although many rooms in Hundreds Hall are closed, making it seem partially paralysed.]]\n\nAs a doctor, Faraday is a rational narrator who confronts each member of the Ayres family and the maids in turn as they divulge their suspicions that something in the house is alive. As he consults with other physicians, they are able to explain away the strange happenings easily with answers supplied by medicine and psychology. Waters does not give definitive answers about the occurrences, leaving it more a philosophical issue. Not wanting to frustrate the reader however, she admits \"I tried to keep it strange, keep what was happening genuinely odd, without closing it down with a neat explanation at the end.\"<ref>Gilbert, Matthew (24 July 2009). \"A Ghostly Turn\", ''The Boston Globe'', p. 5.</ref> The title of the book is a reference to Faraday's continuing questions; Roderick is fearful that the house is infectious. Eventually Faraday wonders if it is \"consumed by some dark germ, some ravenous shadow-creature, some 'little stranger' spawned from the troubled unconscious of someone connected with the house itself\".<ref name=\"starford\">Starford, Rebecca (2 May 2009). \"Something wicked this way comes\", ''The Weekend Australian'', p. 12.</ref><ref>Waters, p. 463.</ref>\n\n[[Emma Donoghue]] considers the deepest theme of the story to be \"the unpindownability of evil\", as suspicion shifts to individuals who may be self-destructing from the forces around them, possible malevolent motivations from the family or house staff, an unseen force inhabiting the house, or Faraday himself.<ref name=\"donoghue\"/> Faraday's concern for the family is often intertwined for concern for the house so that he often discourages those who are obviously troubled by staying there from leaving it. He explains away the suspicions of Mrs Ayres, who believes that Susan is in the house trying to hasten their reunion; Caroline, who believes that Roderick is so upset in the mental institution that a part of him is trying to contact the family to warn them of something; and Betty, the maid who is convinced the malevolent spirit of a former domestic resides on the second floor of the home. Faraday's rationalisations become increasingly improbable as he blames all the strangeness on fatigue, stress, even the house's plumbing.<ref name=\"didock\"/> Ron Charles in ''The Washington Post'' considers Faraday's deep concern for the family that is often mixed with envy to be influenced by [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s psychopathic manipulator [[Tom Ripley]].<ref name=\"charles\"/>\n\n===Class===\nClass and ambition is repeatedly referenced in the novel. Faraday's mother was at one time a nursery maid at Hundreds Hall, much like Waters' grandparents who were domestics in a country estate;<ref name=\"allemang\"/> the reader is first given a description of its opulence when the narrator is a child and he attends a garden [[f\u00eate]], and is so entranced with the building he plies a piece of it off and puts it in his pocket. He often revisits his memory of his first significant impression of the mansion comparing it with its current state. Soldiers were billeted in its rooms during the recent war. Two centuries of wear and weather have taken their toll, and the taxes on the British gentry are too high for the family to bear. They attempt to reconcile their family legacy with the reality of having no money to keep it up. Charlotte Heathcote in ''The Sunday Express'' and Rebecca Starford in ''The Australian'' both note that the novel is preoccupied with class.<ref name=\"heathcote\">Heathcote, Charlotte, (12 July 2009). \"FICTION: Review\", ''Sunday Express'', p. 67.</ref>\n\nFaraday too is conflicted as he recounts how his family sacrificed everything, including his mother's health and life to give him his education. He laments that he has not achieved anything with it and he visits Hundreds Hall vacillating between being flattered and feeling undeserving of knowing a family like the Ayres. They, however, seem resolute to not being able to afford the upkeep of the house and once Roderick is gone, Caroline and Mrs Ayres are ambivalent about staying in the house. It is Faraday who is most indignant about the family being forced to sell their land and possessions. Faraday is an [[unreliable narrator]], and reviewers noted the slight discrepancies in what he says to the family as their doctor and his devotion to the house at their expense.<ref name=\"donoghue\"/><ref name=\"thomas\"/>\n\nNear the end, as Faraday attempts to explain reasonably and scientifically why the family for which he has grown so fond is falling apart, he wonders what must be eating them alive; a friend blurts \"Something is....It's called a Labour government.\"<ref name=\"donoghue\"/><ref>Waters, p. 351.</ref> Barry Didock notes that Waters captures the stark mood of postwar Britain that [[Evelyn Waugh]] did in ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'', where the social changes the country was encountering did not make the future optimistic at all.<ref name=\"didock\"/> The anxiety about the future is so all-consuming that Scarlett Thomas in ''The New York Times'' suggests it is the cause for speculation about each character's sanity.<ref name=\"thomas\">Thomas, Scarlett (31 May 2009). \"House Calls\", ''The New York Times'', p. 20</ref> Waters concedes that although her novels are all period pieces, they are not meant to instill an overwhelming romantic sense of nostalgia: \"I'd hate to think that my writing's escapist.

Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and other animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool and dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as [[computer server]]s, [[power amplifier]]s, and to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork.\n\nAir conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an enclosed space such as a building or a [[car]] to improve [[thermal comfort]] and [[indoor air quality]]. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building.

In 1842, [[Florida]] physician [[John Gorrie]] used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]], [[Florida]]. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the \"Ice King\", [[Frederic Tudor]], for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a [[smear campaign]] against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]]'s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], Australia. His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether [[vapor]] compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced {{convert|3,000|kg}} of ice per day.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThough Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice-refrigerated beef sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. He wrote: \"Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period\", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Electrical air conditioning===\n[[File:Willis Carrier 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willis Carrier]]]]\nThe creation of the modern electrical air conditioning unit and industry is credited to the American inventor [[Willis Carrier|Willis H.

Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and [[Carrier Corporation|The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America]] was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1906, [[Stuart W.

Cramer coined the term \"air conditioning\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to \"water conditioning\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \"condition\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants.

[[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, ''[[Freon]]'' (R-12), in 1928. The name is a [[trademark]] name owned by [[DuPont]] for any [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), [[HCFC|hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] (HCFC), or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (R-22).\n\n[[Dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134A]] due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional \"shot\" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than virtually all \"R-134a\" systems whether \"converted\" or \"factory\", even $50-$100 per pound of R-12 is considered \"cheap\" by many individuals.\n\nModern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], as used in most U.S. homes before 2011) and [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]] ([[R-134a]], historically used in most cars, refrigerators and chillers) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by HFCs such as [[R-410A]], which lack chlorine.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/blog/air-conditioners-dehumidifiers-r-410-a-refrigerant/|website=Sylvane|title=Air Conditioners & Dehumidifiers|date=July 2011}}</ref> HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems.

Notice [[frost]] formation.]]\n\nCooling in traditional AC systems is accomplished using the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression]] cycle, which uses the forced circulation and [[phase transition|phase change]] of a [[refrigerant]] between gas and liquid to transfer heat.\n\nThe vapor-compression cycle can occur within a unitary, or packaged piece of equipment; or within a [[chiller]] that is connected to terminal cooling equipment (such as a [[variable refrigerant flow]] terminal or [[fan coil unit]]) on its evaporator side and [[Waste heat|heat rejection]] equipment on its condenser side.\n\n==== Heat pump ====\nMain article: [[Heat pump]]\n\nSome air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the [[refrigeration cycle]] and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as \"reverse cycle air conditioner\". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than [[electric resistance heating]]. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).\n\nAir-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4\u201313 \u00b0C (40\u201355 \u00b0F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil ''back'' to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.\n\nThe icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a [[natural gas]], [[Heating oil|oil]] or [[tree]] [[fireplace]] or [[central heating]], which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.\n\n===Evaporative cooling===\n{{Main|Evaporative cooler}}\n[[File:Evaporative cooler, CO, IMG 5681.JPG|thumb|An evaporative cooler]]\nIn very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large [[sponge (tool)|sponge]] soaked with water. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the [[total heat]] (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.\n\nEvaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hotdealsproduct.com/best-air-conditioners-in-india/|title=Top 16 Best Air Conditioners in India [2020]-Review and Buying Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.<ref>{{cite book|title=Greenhouse gardener's companion: growing food and flowers in your greenhouse or sunspace|edition=2nd |first=Shane |last=Smith |publisher=Fulcrum Publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-55591-450-9|page=62|url= https://books.google.com/?id=Onv60-c6iEIC&pg=PA62&dq=evaporative-cooler+exhaust+open+door+window&q=evaporative-cooler%20exhaust%20open%20door%20window}}</ref> These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.\n\n===Free cooling===\n{{Main|Free cooling}}\nAir conditioning can also be provided by a process called [[free cooling]] which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water-[[glycol]] mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a [[heat sink]] for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.\n\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are [[mature technology]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Snijders|first=Aart|date=2008|url= http://trca.on.ca/dotAsset/16551.pdf|title=ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe |publisher=IFTech International|website=Conservation for the Living Community Workshop (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority|accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Humidity control==\nSince humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin, reducing [[relative humidity]] can promote occupant comfort.

When the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut off to mitigate further temperature drops;{{clarify|date=October 2017}} this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} When the temperature rises again,{{clarify|reason=temperature of what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.\n\nOccasionally, to thaw any ice produced, the fan runs with the compressor shut down; this function is less effective when ambient temperatures are low.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nInverter air conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor to keep the evaporator as cold as possible. When the evaporator is too cold,{{clarify|reason=too cold for what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Dehumidifier===\n{{main|Dehumidifier}}\n[[Image:Maytag dehumidifier1.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical portable dehumidifier]]\nA specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a [[dehumidifier]]. It also uses a [[refrigeration cycle]], but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.\n\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.\n\nInside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.\n\nDehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent [[mold]] growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in [[tropical countries]].\n\n==Energy transfer==\n{{globalize section|date=March 2020}}\nIn a thermodynamically [[closed system]], any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Jan F.|editor-last=Kreider|title= Handbook of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8493-9584-0}}</ref> To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its \"efficiency\" ([[coefficient of performance]]) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100&nbsp;W [[heating element]] is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50&nbsp;W to compensate for this, thus making the 100&nbsp;W heating element cost a total of 150&nbsp;W of power.\n\nIt is typical for air conditioners to operate at \"efficiencies\" of significantly greater than 100%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winnick |first= J. |title=Chemical engineering thermodynamics|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-05590-7}}</ref> However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower [[entropy]]) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).\n\nAir conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of \"[[ton of refrigeration|tons of refrigeration]]\", with each approximately equal to the cooling power of one [[short ton]] (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 [[BTU]] per hour, or 3517 watts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|title=NIST Guide to the SI|accessdate=18 May 2007|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070528005956/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|archivedate=28 May 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3.5 to 18&nbsp;kW) in capacity.\n\n===Seasonal energy efficiency ratio===\n{{Main|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio|European seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}\nFor residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (W\u00b7h) during the same period.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=S |title=Energy Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 S|accessdate=2 July 2006|work=Energy Glossary|publisher=Energy Information Administration}}</ref>\n\n: '''SEER = BTU \u00f7 (W\u00b7h) '''\nthis can also be rewritten as:\n: '''SEER = (BTU / h) \u00f7 W''', where \"W\" is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power.\n\nFor example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.\n\nThe electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:\n\n: '''500 W \u00d7 1000 h = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 [[kWh]]'''\n\nAssuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).\n\nAnother method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:\n\n: '''5000 BTU/h \u00d7 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU'''\n\nThen, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:\n\n: '''5,000,000 BTU \u00f7 10 = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 kWh'''\n\nSEER is related to the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) commonly used in [[thermodynamics]] and also to the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] divided by an [[SI unit]]. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy ([[joule]]s) in both the [[Fraction (mathematics)|numerator]] and [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]]. They cancel out, leaving a [[dimensionless quantity]]. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071202130510/http://www.pge.com/docs/pdfs/biz/rebates/spc_contracts/2004_manuals_forms/spc_cooling_units.pdf SEER conversion formulas from Pacific Gas and Electric].

The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.\n\nIn 1971, [[General Electric]] introduced a popular portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/13/bright-ideas/B8Fuvbgy021GG95bydrHgM/story.html |title=Timeline: Bright ideas |work=The Boston Globe |date=13 January 2016|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Packaged terminal air conditioner|Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC)]] systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/packaged-terminal-air-conditioner-buying-guide.html |website=Sylvane|title=PTAC Buying Guide}}</ref> They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a [[heat pump]]. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.\n\nThe first practical semi-portable air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at [[Chrysler Motors]] and offered for sale starting in 1935.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Room-size air conditioner fits under window sill |magazine=Popular Mechanics |volume=63 |issue=6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uN4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA885 |page=885 |date=June 1935 |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Split systems===\nSplit-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) [[heat exchanger]] is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger.\n\n====Mini-split (ductless) system====\n[[File:Splitklimaanlage IMGP9925 unbranded.jpg|thumb|Condenser side of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\n[[File:GALANZ II.jpg|thumb|right|Evaporator, or terminal, side of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\nA mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |title=Mitsubishi Contractors Guide |page=16 |publisher=Mitsubishipro.com|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150226020149/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref> Multi-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce {{convert|9000|to(-)|36000|Btu|abbr=on}} per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's. Large systems are known as VRF ([[Variable refrigerant flow]]) systems. Mini split ductless systems were invented by [[Daikin]] in 1973, and VRF systems were also invented by Daikin in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daikin.com/corporate/overview/summary/history/digest/|title=History of Daikin Innovation |website=daikin.com |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdvantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh|title=Mitsubishi Electric US, Cooling & Heating &#124; HVAC|publisher=Mitsubishipro.com |date=17 February 2010|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150603025417/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |archivedate=3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity.\"<ref name=doe20120809>{{cite web|title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners|url= http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners |publisher=US Department of Energy|date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn additional possible disadvantage is that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems. However, lower operating costs and [[rebate (marketing)|rebates]] or other financial incentives\u2014offered in some areas\u2014can help offset the initial expense.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ductless, mini-Split Heat Pumps|url= http://energy.gov/energysaver/ductless-mini-split-heat-pumps |publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Multi-split system====\nA multi-split system<ref>{{cite book|title=Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning|last=Trott|first=A.R. |last2=Welch |first2=T. |publisher=Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd|year=2000|isbn=0-7506-4219-X|location=Great Britain|page=312}}</ref> is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts ([[evaporator]] and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.\n\nA large Multi Split System is called a [[Variable refrigerant flow]] system and can be used instead of a central air conditioner system, as it allows for higher energy efficiency but it is more expensive to purchase and install.\n\n''Difference between split system and multi-split system'':\n\nOther common types of air conditioning system are multi-split systems, the difference between separate split system and multi-split system in several indoor units. All of them are connected to the main external unit, but the principle of their operation is similar to a simple split-system.\n\nIts unique feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to several indoor units. Such systems might be the right solution for maintaining the microclimate in several offices, shops, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building. The main external unit can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc.\n\n=====Multi-split system installation considerations=====\nBefore selecting the installation location of air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.\n\nThe main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.\n\nThe selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc.\n\n===Air-only central air conditioning===\nCentral [[Duct (HVAC)|ducted]] A/C provides temperature control and ventilation to an area by conditioning air within an [[air handler]] and distributing it to one or more zones. The temperature of individual zones can be controlled by varying the airflow to each zone and/or reheating the air.\n\n===Central plant cooling===\n{{see also|Chiller}}\n[[File:Industrial air conditioning unit (DFdB).JPG|thumb|A central chilled water plant using air-cooled chillers, water-cooled chillers are cooled by a cooling tower]]\nCentral cooling plants are used to condition large commercial, industrial, or campus loads. At larger scales, the ductwork required to move conditioned air to and from the plant would be impractically large, so an intermediate fluid such as chilled water is used instead. The plant circulates cold water to terminal chilled water devices such as air handlers or fan/coil units.\n\n===Portable units===\nA portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about {{convert|5000|-|60000|btu/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.\n\nThe compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.\n\n====Portable split system====\nA portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit. The portable units draw indoor air and expel it outdoors through a single duct. Many portable air conditioners come with heat as well as dehumidification function.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canstarblue.com.au/appliances/portable-or-split-system-air-conditioning-the-pros-and-cons/|title=Portable Vs Split System Air Conditioning &#124; Pros & Cons|date=August 14, 2018|website=Canstar Blue}}</ref>\n\n====Portable hose system====\nHose systems, which can be ''monoblock'' or ''air-to-air'', are vented to the outside via air [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]]. The ''monoblock'' type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The ''air-to-air'' type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.\n\nA single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-difference-between-a-single-hose-design-and-a-dual-hose-design.html |title=In the two hose design the exchanged air does not come from the interior of the room or house, but enters through the second hose |publisher=Experts123.com|date=|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern units might have a [[coefficient of performance]] of approximately 3 (i.e., 1&nbsp;kW of electricity will produce 3&nbsp;kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.\n\n====Portable evaporative system====\n[[Evaporative cooler]]s, sometimes called \"swamp coolers\", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporisation]], cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by [[Perspiration|sweating]].\n\nEvaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable. They are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners.\n\n==Uses==\nAir-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into ''comfort'' and ''process'' applications.\n\n===Comfort applications===\n[[File:ACFujitsu2.jpg|thumb|An array of air conditioners outside a commercial office building]]\nComfort applications aim to provide a [[Building science|building indoor environment]] that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads.\n\nAir conditioning makes [[deep plan]] buildings feasible, for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with [[light well]]s so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via [[natural ventilation]].

In 1842, [[Florida]] physician [[John Gorrie]] used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]], [[Florida]]. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the \"Ice King\", [[Frederic Tudor]], for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a [[smear campaign]] against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n[[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]]'s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], Australia. His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether [[vapor]] compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced {{convert|3,000|kg}} of ice per day.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThough Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice-refrigerated beef sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. He wrote: \"Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period\", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Electrical air conditioning===\n[[File:Willis Carrier 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willis Carrier]]]]\nThe creation of the modern electrical air conditioning unit and industry is credited to the American inventor [[Willis Carrier|Willis H.

There, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. The first air conditioner, designed and built in [[Buffalo, New York]] by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902.<ref>http://www.williscarrier.com/m/1876-1902.php</ref>\n\nDesigned to improve manufacturing [[process control]] in a [[printing]] plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only [[temperature]] but also [[humidity]]. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and [[Carrier Corporation|The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America]] was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn 1906, [[Stuart W. Cramer]] of [[Charlotte]] was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term \"air conditioning\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to \"water conditioning\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \"condition\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants.

[[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, ''[[Freon]]'' (R-12), in 1928. The name is a [[trademark]] name owned by [[DuPont]] for any [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), [[HCFC|hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] (HCFC), or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (R-22).\n\n[[Dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134A]] due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems requiring only an occasional \"shot\" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than virtually all \"R-134a\" systems whether \"converted\" or \"factory\", even $50-$100 per pound of R-12 is considered \"cheap\" by many individuals.\n\nModern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], as used in most U.S. homes before 2011) and [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]] ([[R-134a]], historically used in most cars, refrigerators and chillers) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by HFCs such as [[R-410A]], which lack chlorine.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/blog/air-conditioners-dehumidifiers-r-410-a-refrigerant/|website=Sylvane|title=Air Conditioners & Dehumidifiers|date=July 2011}}</ref> HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems.

Notice [[frost]] formation.]]\n\nCooling in traditional AC systems is accomplished using the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression]] cycle, which uses the forced circulation and [[phase transition|phase change]] of a [[refrigerant]] between gas and liquid to transfer heat.\n\nThe vapor-compression cycle can occur within a unitary, or packaged piece of equipment; or within a [[chiller]] that is connected to terminal cooling equipment (such as a [[variable refrigerant flow]] terminal or [[fan coil unit]]) on its evaporator side and [[Waste heat|heat rejection]] equipment on its condenser side.\n\n==== Heat pump ====\nMain article: [[Heat pump]]\n\nSome air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the [[refrigeration cycle]] and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as \"reverse cycle air conditioner\". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than [[electric resistance heating]]. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).\n\nAir-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4\u201313 \u00b0C (40\u201355 \u00b0F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil ''back'' to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.\n\nThe icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a [[natural gas]], [[Heating oil|oil]] or [[tree]] [[fireplace]] or [[central heating]], which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.\n\n===Evaporative cooling===\n{{Main|Evaporative cooler}}\n[[File:Evaporative cooler, CO, IMG 5681.JPG|thumb|An evaporative cooler]]\nIn very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large [[sponge (tool)|sponge]] soaked with water. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the [[total heat]] (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.\n\nEvaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.<ref>{{cite book|title=Greenhouse gardener's companion: growing food and flowers in your greenhouse or sunspace|edition=2nd |first=Shane |last=Smith |publisher=Fulcrum Publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-55591-450-9|page=62|url= https://books.google.com/?id=Onv60-c6iEIC&pg=PA62&dq=evaporative-cooler+exhaust+open+door+window&q=evaporative-cooler%20exhaust%20open%20door%20window}}</ref> These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.\n\n===Free cooling===\n{{Main|Free cooling}}\nAir conditioning can also be provided by a process called [[free cooling]] which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water-[[glycol]] mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a [[heat sink]] for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.\n\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are [[mature technology]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Snijders|first=Aart|date=2008|url= http://trca.on.ca/dotAsset/16551.pdf|title=ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe |publisher=IFTech International|website=Conservation for the Living Community Workshop (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority|accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Humidity control==\nSince humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin, reducing [[relative humidity]] can promote occupant comfort.

Moisture from the air will condense on the coil and must be disposed of or recycled.\n\n===Dehumidification program===\n\nMost modern air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} to reduce the evaporator temperature and therefore condense more water. When the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut off to mitigate further temperature drops;{{clarify|date=October 2017}} this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} When the temperature rises again,{{clarify|reason=temperature of what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.\n\nOccasionally, to thaw any ice produced, the fan runs with the compressor shut down; this function is less effective when ambient temperatures are low.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nInverter air conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor to keep the evaporator as cold as possible. When the evaporator is too cold,{{clarify|reason=too cold for what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Dehumidifier===\n{{main|Dehumidifier}}\n[[Image:Maytag dehumidifier1.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical portable dehumidifier]]\nA specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a [[dehumidifier]]. It also uses a [[refrigeration cycle]], but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.\n\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.\n\nInside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.\n\nDehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent [[mold]] growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in [[tropical countries]].\n\n==Energy transfer==\n{{globalize section|date=March 2020}}\nIn a thermodynamically [[closed system]], any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Jan F.|editor-last=Kreider|title= Handbook of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8493-9584-0}}</ref> To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its \"efficiency\" ([[coefficient of performance]]) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100&nbsp;W [[heating element]] is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50&nbsp;W to compensate for this, thus making the 100&nbsp;W heating element cost a total of 150&nbsp;W of power.\n\nIt is typical for air conditioners to operate at \"efficiencies\" of significantly greater than 100%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Winnick |first= J. |title=Chemical engineering thermodynamics|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-05590-7}}</ref> However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower [[entropy]]) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).\n\nAir conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of \"[[ton of refrigeration|tons of refrigeration]]\", with each approximately equal to the cooling power of one [[short ton]] (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 [[BTU]] per hour, or 3517 watts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|title=NIST Guide to the SI|accessdate=18 May 2007|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070528005956/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|archivedate=28 May 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref> Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3.5 to 18&nbsp;kW) in capacity.\n\n===Seasonal energy efficiency ratio===\n{{Main|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio|European seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}\nFor residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (W\u00b7h) during the same period.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=S |title=Energy Glossary&nbsp;\u2013 S|accessdate=2 July 2006|work=Energy Glossary|publisher=Energy Information Administration}}</ref>\n\n: '''SEER = BTU \u00f7 (W\u00b7h) '''\nthis can also be rewritten as:\n: '''SEER = (BTU / h) \u00f7 W''', where \"W\" is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power.\n\nFor example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.\n\nThe electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:\n\n: '''500 W \u00d7 1000 h = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 [[kWh]]'''\n\nAssuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).\n\nAnother method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:\n\n: '''5000 BTU/h \u00d7 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU'''\n\nThen, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:\n\n: '''5,000,000 BTU \u00f7 10 = 500,000 W\u00b7h = 500 kWh'''\n\nSEER is related to the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) commonly used in [[thermodynamics]] and also to the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] divided by an [[SI unit]]. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy ([[joule]]s) in both the [[Fraction (mathematics)|numerator]] and [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]]. They cancel out, leaving a [[dimensionless quantity]].

The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.\n\nIn 1971, [[General Electric]] introduced a popular portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/13/bright-ideas/B8Fuvbgy021GG95bydrHgM/story.html |title=Timeline: Bright ideas |work=The Boston Globe |date=13 January 2016|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Packaged terminal air conditioner|Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC)]] systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/packaged-terminal-air-conditioner-buying-guide.html |website=Sylvane|title=PTAC Buying Guide}}</ref> They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a [[heat pump]]. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.\n\nThe first practical semi-portable air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at [[Chrysler Motors]] and offered for sale starting in 1935.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Room-size air conditioner fits under window sill |magazine=Popular Mechanics |volume=63 |issue=6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uN4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA885 |page=885 |date=June 1935 |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Split systems===\nSplit-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) [[heat exchanger]] is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger.\n\n====Mini-split (ductless) system====\n[[File:Splitklimaanlage IMGP9925 unbranded.jpg|thumb|Condenser side of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\n[[File:GALANZ II.jpg|thumb|right|Evaporator, or terminal, side of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]\nA mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |title=Mitsubishi Contractors Guide |page=16 |publisher=Mitsubishipro.com|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150226020149/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref> Multi-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce {{convert|9000|to(-)|36000|Btu|abbr=on}} per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's. Large systems are known as VRF ([[Variable refrigerant flow]]) systems. Mini split ductless systems were invented by [[Daikin]] in 1973, and VRF systems were also invented by Daikin in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daikin.com/corporate/overview/summary/history/digest/|title=History of Daikin Innovation |website=daikin.com |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdvantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh|title=Mitsubishi Electric US, Cooling & Heating &#124; HVAC|publisher=Mitsubishipro.com |date=17 February 2010|url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150603025417/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |archivedate=3 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity.\"<ref name=doe20120809>{{cite web|title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners|url= http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners |publisher=US Department of Energy|date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAn additional possible disadvantage is that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems. However, lower operating costs and [[rebate (marketing)|rebates]] or other financial incentives\u2014offered in some areas\u2014can help offset the initial expense.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ductless, mini-Split Heat Pumps|url= http://energy.gov/energysaver/ductless-mini-split-heat-pumps |publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Multi-split system====\nA multi-split system<ref>{{cite book|title=Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning|last=Trott|first=A.R. |last2=Welch |first2=T. |publisher=Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd|year=2000|isbn=0-7506-4219-X|location=Great Britain|page=312}}</ref> is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts ([[evaporator]] and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.\n\nA large Multi Split System is called a [[Variable refrigerant flow]] system and can be used instead of a central air conditioner system, as it allows for higher energy efficiency but it is more expensive to purchase and install.\n\n''Difference between split system and multi-split system'':\n\nOther common types of air conditioning system are multi-split systems, the difference between separate split system and multi-split system in several indoor units. All of them are connected to the main external unit, but the principle of their operation is similar to a simple split-system.\n\nIts unique feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to several indoor units. Such systems might be the right solution for maintaining the microclimate in several offices, shops, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building. The main external unit can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc.\n\n=====Multi-split system installation considerations=====\nBefore selecting the installation location of air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.\n\nThe main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.\n\nThe selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc.\n\n===Air-only central air conditioning===\nCentral [[Duct (HVAC)|ducted]] A/C provides temperature control and ventilation to an area by conditioning air within an [[air handler]] and distributing it to one or more zones. The temperature of individual zones can be controlled by varying the airflow to each zone and/or reheating the air.\n\n===Central plant cooling===\n{{see also|Chiller}}\n[[File:Industrial air conditioning unit (DFdB).JPG|thumb|A central chilled water plant using air-cooled chillers, water-cooled chillers are cooled by a cooling tower]]\nCentral cooling plants are used to condition large commercial, industrial, or campus loads. At larger scales, the ductwork required to move conditioned air to and from the plant would be impractically large, so an intermediate fluid such as chilled water is used instead. The plant circulates cold water to terminal chilled water devices such as air handlers or fan/coil units.\n\n===Portable units===\nA portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about {{convert|5000|-|60000|btu/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.\n\nThe compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.\n\n====Portable split system====\nA portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit. The portable units draw indoor air and expel it outdoors through a single duct. Many portable air conditioners come with heat as well as dehumidification function.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canstarblue.com.au/appliances/portable-or-split-system-air-conditioning-the-pros-and-cons/|title=Portable Vs Split System Air Conditioning &#124; Pros & Cons|date=August 14, 2018|website=Canstar Blue}}</ref>\n\n====Portable hose system====\nHose systems, which can be ''monoblock'' or ''air-to-air'', are vented to the outside via air [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]]. The ''monoblock'' type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The ''air-to-air'' type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.\n\nA single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-difference-between-a-single-hose-design-and-a-dual-hose-design.html |title=In the two hose design the exchanged air does not come from the interior of the room or house, but enters through the second hose |publisher=Experts123.com|date=|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern units might have a [[coefficient of performance]] of approximately 3 (i.e., 1&nbsp;kW of electricity will produce 3&nbsp;kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.\n\n====Portable evaporative system====\n[[Evaporative cooler]]s, sometimes called \"swamp coolers\", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporisation]], cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by [[Perspiration|sweating]].\n\nEvaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable. They are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners.\n\n==Uses==\nAir-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into ''comfort'' and ''process'' applications.\n\n===Comfort applications===\n[[File:ACFujitsu2.jpg|thumb|An array of air conditioners outside a commercial office building]]\nComfort applications aim to provide a [[Building science|building indoor environment]] that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads.\n\nAir conditioning makes [[deep plan]] buildings feasible, for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with [[light well]]s so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via [[natural ventilation]].

Old R-12 systems can be retrofitted to R-134a by a complete flush and filter/dryer replacement to remove the mineral oil, which is not compatible with R-134a.\n\n[[Chlorodifluoromethane|R22]] (also known as HCFC-22) has a [[global warming potential]] about 1,800 times higher than [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf |title=Chapter.2_FINAL.indd|date=|accessdate=9 August 2010}}</ref> It was phased out for use in new equipment by 2010, and is to be completely discontinued by 2020.

The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a \"top-up\" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.\n\nThe manufacture and use of CFCs has been banned or severely restricted due to concerns about ozone depletion (see also [[Montreal Protocol]]).<ref name=\"sciencedaily\">{{cite web|url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030730080139.htm |title=Destruction Of Ozone Layer Is Slowing After Worldwide Ban On CFC Release |date=July 30, 2003 |website=ScienceDaily |accessdate=January 31, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Schlossberg|first=Tatiana|authorlink=Tatiana Schlossberg|date=9 August 2016|title=How Bad Is Your Air-Conditioner for the Planet?|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/science/air-conditioner-global-warming.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=17 August 2016}}</ref> In light of these environmental concerns, beginning on November 14, 1994, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]] Environmental Protection Agency has restricted the sale, possession and use of refrigerant to only licensed technicians, per rules under sections 608 and 609 of the Clean Air Act.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.epa.gov/ozone/title6/608/608fact.html |title=Complying With The Section 608 Refrigerant Recycling Rule &#124; Ozone Layer Protection - Regulatory Programs &#124; US EPA|publisher=Epa.gov|date=21 April 2015|accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs an alternative to conventional refrigerants, other gases, such as CO<sub>2</sub> ([[R-744]]), have been proposed.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.r744.com/knowledge/papers_result_free.php?page_no=0&txt_key_free=air%20conditioning&sortby=year%20DESC |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514012832/http://www.r744.com/knowledge/papers_result_free.php?page_no=0&txt_key_free=air%20conditioning&sortby=year%20DESC |url-status=dead|archivedate=14 May 2008|title=The current status in Air Conditioning \u2013 papers & presentations|publisher=R744.com|date=}}</ref> R-744 is being adopted as a refrigerant in Europe and Japan.
