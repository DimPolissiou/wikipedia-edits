The [[United States]] has never had religious parties (unlike much of the world, especially in [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]]). There has never been an American Catholic religious party, either local, state or national.\n\nIn 1776 Catholics comprised less than 1% of the population of the new nation, but  their presence grew rapidly after 1840 with [[immigration to the United States|immigration]] from Germany, Ireland, and later from Italy, Poland and elsewhere in [[Catholic Europe]] from 1840 to 1914, and also from Latin America in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Catholics now comprise 25% to 27% of the national vote, with over 68 million members today. 85% of today's Catholics report their faith to be \"somewhat\" to \"very important\" to them.<ref>[http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/cathusa.htm CARA's New Book Identifies Trends in U.S. Catholic Church] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226151441/http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/cathusa.htm# |date=2006-02-26 }}, Catholicism USA</ref><ref>[http://www.officialcatholicdirectory.com/ ''The Official Catholic Directory'' 2009].</ref> From the mid-19th century down to 1964 Catholics were solidly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], sometimes at the 80\u201390% level. From the 1930s to the 1950s Catholics formed a core part of the [[New Deal Coalition]], with overlapping memberships in the church, [[labor union]]s, big city [[political machine|machines]], and the working class, all of which promoted [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal policy positions]] in domestic affairs and [[anti-communism]] during the [[Cold War]].\n\nSince the election of a Catholic President in 1960, Catholics have split about 50\u201350 between the two major parties in national elections. With the decline of unions and big city machines, and with upward mobility into the middle classes, Catholics have drifted away from liberalism and toward [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] on economic issues (such as taxes). Since the end of the [[Cold War]], their strong anti-Communism has faded in importance. On social issues the Catholic Church takes strong positions against [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]] and has formed coalitions with Protestant evangelicals.<ref>[[Donald T.

By 1840, there were about 600,000 Catholics in the United States. In the 1840s, 200,000 Irish immigrated to escape poverty.  The [[Irish Potato Famine]] in 1845 caused the Irish population in America to reach 962,000, the number doubling in the next ten years.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/history/americanhistory/immigrants-and-immigration-aaw-02/ Immigrants and Immigration], Americans at War, Macmillan Reference USA</ref> Even larger numbers of immigrants arrived from traditionally Catholic regions of Germany and other parts of Europe. To the extent that these new arrivals remained inside ethnic communities, they typically joined the local Catholic church that through the local diocese was in communion with Rome; how many cut their ties with the Catholic Church is a matter of speculation.<ref>Roger Finke and Rodney Stark, ''The Churching of America, 1776-1990: Winners and Losers in Our Religious Economy'' (1993) p. 273. Apart from the formation in 1897 of a [[Polish National Catholic Church]], there were no alternative Catholic denominations formed for immigrants. By contrast the Lutherans formed numerous denominations in the U.S.</ref> The Irish Catholics took controlling positions in the Catholic Church, labor unions, and Democratic organizations in the big cities, thus forming overlapping centers of strength. The sudden new arrival of so many Catholics, charges of political corruption, and fears of papal interference caused [[anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholicism]] to grow, including the short-lived [[Know Nothings]] party in the 1850s which demanded a purification of elections and statutes from Catholic influence.{{r|silk20081103}}\n\nMany Catholics served in the Civil War armies, both North and South, and the bishops rejected the antiwar and anti-draft sentiments of some members. The rapid rise of the Irish out of poverty, and the continued growth in membership, especially in industrial and urban areas, made the church the largest denomination in the U.S. Distrusting public schools dominated by Protestants, Catholics built their own network of parochial elementary schools (and, later, high schools), as well as colleges, and public funding for parochial schools was a controversial issue.{{r|silk20081103}} As the [[Bennett Law]] episode in 1890 in Wisconsin demonstrated, Catholics were willing to cooperate politically with German Lutherans to protect their parochial schools. A distinct Catholic vote existed, however; in the late 19th century, 75% of Irish and German Catholics in America voted for Democratic presidential candidates. {{r|silk20081103}}  The Irish increasingly controlled the Democratic party machinery in major cities.<ref>Steven P. Erie, ''Rainbow's end: Irish-Americans and the dilemmas of urban machine politics, 1840-1985'' (1990)</ref>\n\nReligious lines were sharply drawn in the North in the [[Third Party System]] that lasted from the 1850s to the 1890s.  (In the South the Catholics voted the same as Protestants, with race as the main dividing line.)<ref name=\"Kleppner 1979\">Kleppner (1979)</ref>  Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Scandinavian Lutherans and other Protestant [[pietists]] in the North were tightly linked to the GOP. In sharp contrast, [[liturgical]] groups, especially the Catholics, Episcopalians, and German Lutherans, looked to the Democratic Party for protection from pietistic moralism, especially prohibition.  While both parties cut across economic class structures, the Democrats were supported more heavily by its lower tiers.\n\nCultural issues, especially prohibition and foreign language schools, became important because of the sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50% of the voters were pietistic Protestants who believed the government should be used to reduce social sins, such as drinking. Liturgical churches comprised over a quarter of the vote and wanted the government to stay out of personal morality issues. Prohibition debates and referendums heated up elections in most states over a period of decades, as national prohibition was finally passed in 1918 (and repealed in 1932), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry GOP.<ref name=\"Kleppner 1979\"/>\n\n[[File:Grant to Hayes - I guess that reform bait wont work this side.

From the onset of significant immigration in the 1840s, the Church in the United States was predominantly urban, with both its leaders and congregants usually of the laboring classes. Over the course of the second half of the nineteenth century, nativism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-unionism coalesced in Republican elections, and Catholics gravitated toward unions and the Democratic Party.{{r|silk20081103}}\n\nThe [[Knights of Labor]] was the earliest labor organization in the United States, and in the 1880s, this was the largest labor union in the United States.  It is estimated that at least half its membership was Catholic (including [[Terence Powderly]], its president from 1881 onward).\n\nIn ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891), [[Pope Leo XIII]] criticized the concentration of wealth and power, spoke out against the abuses that workers faced and demanded that workers should be granted certain rights and safety regulations.  He upheld the right of voluntary association, specifically commending labor unions. At the same time, he reiterated the Church's defense of private property, condemned socialism, and emphasized the need for Catholics to form and join unions that were not compromised by secular and revolutionary ideologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html |title=''Rerum novarum'' |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n''Rerum novarum'' provided new impetus for Catholics to become active in the labor movement, even if its exhortation to form specifically Catholic labor unions was widely interpreted as irrelevant to the pluralist context of the United States. While atheism underpinned many European unions and stimulated Catholic unionists to form separate labor federations, the religious neutrality of unions in the U.S. provided no such impetus. American Catholics seldom dominated unions, but they exerted influence across organized labor. Catholic union members and leaders played important roles in steering American unions away from socialism.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==20th century==\n\nBy 1900, Catholics represented 14 percent of the total U.S. population, soon became the single largest religious denomination in the country.<ref>Terry Matthews: [http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html Catholicism in Nineteenth Century America] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20010529012128/http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html# |date=2001-05-29 }}, Lectures for Religion, Wake Forrest University</ref> Still, Catholics did not hold many high offices in government. Only one of the first 54 justices on the [[United States Supreme Court]] was Catholic, [[Roger B. Taney]], appointed in 1836.\n\n===Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction===\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], many hoped that a new commitment to social reform would characterize the ensuing peace. The Council saw an opportunity to use its national voice to shape reform and in April 1918 created a Committee for Reconstruction. [[John A. Ryan]] wrote the Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction. Combining Progressive thought and Catholic theology, Ryan believed that government intervention was the most effective means of affecting positive change for his church as well as working people and the poor. On February 12, 1919, the National Catholic War Council issued the \"Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction\".\n\nThe Program received a mixed reception both within the Church and outside it. The National Catholic War Council was a voluntary organization with no canonical status. Its ability to speak authoritatively was therefore questioned. Many bishops threw their support behind the Program, but some, including Bishop William Turner of Buffalo and William Henry O'Connell of Boston, opposed it. O'Connell believed some aspects of the plan smacked too much of socialism. Response outside the Church was also divided: labor organizations backed it, for example, and business groups criticized it.\n\n===Defense of parochial school system===\n{{Main|Oregon Compulsory Education Act}}\n\nAfter World War I, some states concerned about the influence of immigrants and \"foreign\" values looked to public schools for help. The states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture.\n\nIn 1921, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] arrived in [[Oregon]] and quickly attracted as many as 14,000 members, establishing 58 klaverns by the end of 1922. Given the small population of non-white minorities outside Portland, the Oregon Klan directed its attention almost exclusively against Catholics, who numbered about 8% of the population.\n\nIn 1922, the [[Freemasons|Masonic]] Grand Lodge of Oregon sponsored a bill to require all school-age children to attend public schools.  With support of the Klan and Democratic Governor [[Walter M. Pierce]], endorsed by the Klan, the Compulsory Education Act was passed by a vote of 115,506 to 103,685.  Its primary purpose was to shut down Catholic schools in Oregon, but it also affected other private and military schools. The constitutionality of the law was challenged in court and ultimately struck down by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) before it went into effect,<ref>Howard, J. Paul. [http://www.shibleyrighton.com/pdf/Howard/CEAArticleApril2001.pdf \"Cross-Border Reflections, Parents' Right to Direct Their Children's Education Under the U.S. and Canadian Constitutions\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029102538/http://www.shibleyrighton.com/pdf/Howard/CEAArticleApril2001.pdf |date=2008-10-29 }}, ''Education Canada'', v41 n2 p36-37 Sum 2001.</ref> in a ruling that has been called \"the Magna Carta of the parochial school system.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The law caused outraged Catholics to organize locally and nationally for the right to send their children to Catholic schools.\n\n[[Pope Pius XI]], in 1929, explicitly referenced this Supreme Court case in his [[encyclical]] ''Divini illius magistri''<ref>{{cite web|title=Divini illius magistri |author=Pope Pius XI |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html |date=1929-12-31 |accessdate=2010-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923233927/https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_31121929_divini-illius-magistri_en.html |archivedate=2010-09-23 |author-link=Pope Pius XI }}</ref> on Catholic education. He quoted in a footnote the part of the case:\n\n<blockquote>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right coupled with the high duty, to recognize, and prepare him for additional duties.</blockquote>\n\n===Catholic Worker Movement===\n{{Main|Catholic Worker Movement}}\n[[File:Dorothy Day 1934.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dorothy Day]]]]\n\nThe Catholic Worker movement began as a means to combine [[Dorothy Day]]'s history in American social activism, [[anarchism]], and [[pacifism]] with the tenets of Catholicism (including a strong current of [[distributism]]), five years after her 1927 conversion.<ref>\"[http://www.cjd.org/paper/pacifism.html \"Dorothy Day, Prophet of Pacifism for the Catholic Church\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927232314/http://www.cjd.org/paper/pacifism.html |date=2008-09-27 }}\" from \"Houston Catholic Worker\" newspaper, October 1997</ref>\n\nThe group started with the ''[[Catholic Worker]]'' [[newspaper]], created to promote [[Catholic social teaching]] and stake out a neutral, [[pacifism|pacifist]] position in the wartorn 1930s. It grew into a \"[[house of hospitality]]\" in the slums of New York City and then a series of farms for people to live together communally. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States and to [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; more than 30 independent but affiliated CW communities had been founded by 1941. Well over 100 communities exist today, including several in [[Australia]], the United Kingdom, Canada, [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web |title=List of Catholic Worker Communities |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm |accessdate=2008-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220122836/http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm |archivedate=2008-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nSimilar houses of hospitality were established by Russian immigrant and Catholic social worker, [[Catherine Doherty]], founder of Madonna House.\n\n====National Catholic Welfare Conference====\n{{main|National Catholic Welfare Council#National Catholic Welfare Conference}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n===1930s===\nHistorian John McGreevey notes, \"Priests across the country in the 1930s encouraged their parishioners to join unions, and some like [[Pittsburgh]]'s Monsignor [[Charles Owen Rice|Charles Rice]], Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo's]] Monsignor [[John P. Boland (labor priest)|John P. Boland]], served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations.\"  The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and [[Dorothy Day]] grew out of the same impetuses to put [[Catholic social teaching]] into action.\n\n===Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems===\nThe [[Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems]] (1923\u20131937) was conceived by Fr. Raymond McGowan as a way of bringing together Catholic leaders in the fields of theology, labor, and business, with a view to promoting awareness and discussion of Catholic social teaching. Its first meeting was held in Milwaukee. While it was the venue for important discussions during its existence, its demise was due partly by lack of participation by business executives who perceived the dominant tone of the group as anti-business.\n\n==Party affiliation==\nBefore the 1960s, when cultural changes lead to an incremental liberalization of the Democratic Party, Catholics were seen as staunch Democrats. The Democratic Party ran Al Smith, the first Catholic presidential candidate by a major party, in 1928, and, except when the ticket was headed by a [[Southern United States|Southern]] candidate, has nominated a Catholic for president or vice president in every election since 1960 except for [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] (where a [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Michael Dukakis]], was the presidential nominee).\n\nSince the 1960s, the Catholic vote has come to reflect the nation as a whole instead of being predominantly Democratic.{{r|silk20081103}} In the 60s and early 70s, a number of Catholics and Southern whites abandoned their traditional affiliation with the Democratic Party and began to support the Republican Party.  This shift is evidenced by the fact that Nixon received 33% of the Catholic vote in the 1968 election compared to 52% in 1972.  As a group, Catholics represented a quarter of the nation's electorate and were now one of the nation's largest swing groups.  Both parties began to aggressively woo the Catholic voters.  Although the Catholic hierarchy could not dictate who Catholics voted for, they did have a substantial influence over the faithful in their dioceses.  Politicians were aware that the bishops could direct significant time, energy and money to support the issues that were important to them.  From their perspective, the bishops were eager to regain some of the influence that their predecessors had wielded in the earlier part of the 20th century.<ref name=\"HeyerRozell2008_17\">{{cite book|last1=Heyer|first1=Kristin E.|last2=Rozell|first2=Mark J.|last3=Genovese|first3=Michael A.|title=Catholics and politics: the dynamic tension between faith and power|url=https://archive.org/details/catholicspolitic0000kris|url-access=registration|accessdate=19 January 2012|year=2008|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=978-1-58901-215-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/catholicspolitic0000kris/page/17 17]}}</ref>  Since the 1970s non-Hispanic white Catholics have voted majority Republican very reliably while a majority of Hispanic or Latino Catholics have voted Democrat.<ref name=\"Religion, Race page 65-66\">Religion, Race, and the American Presidency  edited by Gaston Espinosa page 65-66</ref>\n\nIn his successful [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] campaign against [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]] won about half of the Catholic vote and a majority of Catholics who were non-Hispanic whites.<ref>Religion, Race, and the American Presidency  edited by Gaston Espinosa page 66</ref> \"[[Reagan Democrats]]\", many of them non-Hispanic white, blue-collar Catholics, comprised 25% of the Democrats who voted for Reagan, and formed an important part of his support in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] as well. Despite Catholic [[Geraldine Ferraro]]'s presence on the Democratic ticket as [[Walter Mondale]]'s vice-presidential running mate that year Reagan won 54 to 61% of the Catholic vote, only slightly different from the overall 59%. Although the majority of Catholics in 1984 remained Democrats, compared to 1980 Catholic votes switched to Reagan at about the same level as most Protestant groups. Reagan's vice president [[George H. W. Bush]] won about the same number of votes as [[Michael Dukakis]], making [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] the third presidential election in a row in which Catholics failed to support the Democratic candidate as they traditionally did.{{r|prendergast1999}}{{rp|186\u2013187,191\u2013192,194}}\n\nAlthough about one third of Catholics voted for Bush's reelection in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], most Catholic defectors switched to independent [[Ross Perot]], not the successful Democrat [[Bill Clinton]]. Unlike previous elections (such as in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], when [[George McGovern]]'s Catholic support was eight percentage points higher than overall) the Catholic vote was not more Democratic than the overall electorate, but split almost identically to it. The trend away from a Democratic dominance of the Catholic vote continued in [[United States elections, 1994|1994]], when for the first time in history Democrats did not receive a majority of Catholic votes in elections for the House of Representatives; as with 1992, the Catholic vote split resembled that of the overall electorate.

Many feared that he would answer to the pope and not the constitution.\nAnother major controversial issue was the continuation of [[Prohibition]]. Smith was personally in favor of relaxation or repeal of Prohibition laws despite its status as part of the nation's Constitution, but the Democratic Party split north and south on the issue. During the campaign Smith tried to duck the issue with noncommittal statements.  He was also criticized for being a drunkard because of the stereotypes placed on Irish Catholics of the day.<ref>DeGregorio, (1984).</ref><ref>Lichtman (1979)</ref>\n\nSmith swept the entire Catholic vote, which had been split in 1920 and 1924, and brought millions of Catholics to the polls for the first time, especially women.  The fact that Smith was Catholic garnered him support from [[immigrant]] populations in New England, which may explain his narrow victories in traditionally Republican [[Massachusetts]] and [[Rhode Island]], as well as his narrow 2% loss in [[New York (state)|New York]] (which previous Democratic presidential candidates had lost by double digits).<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Haskell House Publishers |isbn = 978-0-8383-1427-2 | last = Rice | first = Arnold S.  | title = The Ku Klux Klan in American Politics | year = 1972}}</ref>\n\n===1960 Presidential election===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1960}}\n[[File:John F. Kennedy, White House color photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[John F. Kennedy]], 35th President of the United States]]\n\nReligion became a divisive issue during the [[1960 United States presidential election|presidential campaign of 1960]]. Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] of Massachusetts was vying to become the nation's first Catholic president.  A key factor that was hurting  Kennedy in his campaign was the widespread prejudice against his Roman Catholic religion; some [[Protestants]] believed that, if he were elected President, Kennedy would have to take orders from the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]].  When offered the opportunity to speak before a convention of Baptist ministers, he decided to try to put the issue to rest.\n\nTo address fears that his Roman Catholicism would influence his decision-making, [[John F. Kennedy]] famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, \"I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters \u2014 and the Church does not speak for me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html|title=Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association|accessdate=2007-09-17|last=Kennedy|first=John F.|date=2002-06-18|website=American Rhetoric|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911175450/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html|archivedate=2007-09-11}}</ref> He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy to him.  Kennedy also raised the question of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Roman Catholic.\n\nEven so, it was widely believed after the election that Kennedy lost some heavily Protestant states because of his Catholicism.  His address did not please everyone: many non-Catholics remained unconvinced that a Catholic could be president without divided loyalties; and many Catholics thought he conceded too much in his profession of belief in an absolute [[separation of church and state]]. The speech is widely considered to be an important marker in the history of Catholicism (and anti-Catholicism) in the United States.\n\nKennedy went on to win the national popular vote over [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]] by just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) - the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the [[United States electoral college|electoral college]], Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).  There was a \"narrow consensus\" among the experts that Kennedy had won more votes than he lost as a result of his Catholicism,<ref>''New York Times'', November 20, 1960, Section 4, p. E5</ref> as Catholics rallied to Kennedy as an affirmation of their religion and their right to have a Catholic president.\n\n==Representation in government==\n\n===Congress===\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, Catholics represent 30.5% of [[Demographics of the United States Congress|the United States Congress]] as of January 2019. There are 141 [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] and 22 [[United States Senate|Senators]] that are Catholic, which split as 99 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 64 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].\n\nOn January 4, 2007, [[Nancy Pelosi]], a Catholic, became the first woman elected as the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. She was elected again as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] on January 3, 2019, after serving as [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] from 2003-2007 and 2011\u20132019. [[Paul Ryan]] is Catholic as well and served recently as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] from 2015 to 2019.\n\n[[Edward Kavanagh]] was nationally noticed as the first [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] elected from New England. Kavanagh was elected as a [[Jacksonian Democrats|Jacksonian]] to the Twenty-second and Twenty-third Congresses, serving from March 4, 1831, to March 3, 1835.\n\n===Supreme Court===\nIn the early 1980s, there was one Catholic justice.  This changed in the mid 1980s when President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Anthony Kennedy]] to the court, both Catholic. The first President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] nominated [[Clarence Thomas]] (a Catholic who at the time of his appointment was attending Episcopalian services, though he has since become an active Catholic) along with [[David Souter]], an Episcopalian. The second President [[George W. Bush]] appointed [[John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]], both Catholics. President [[Barack Obama]] appointed Catholic [[Sonia Sotomayor]].  For the seven years beginning with the 2009 appointment of Sotomayor and ending with the 2016 death of Scalia, the Supreme Court had a Catholic majority of five justices, including Chief Justice Roberts.\n\nThe four Catholic Supreme Court justices nominated in recent decades have consistently stood as reliable votes for abortion restriction. In ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' (1989), ''[[City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health]]'' (1990), ''[[Hodgson v. Minnesota]]'' (1990), and ''[[Rust v.

By 1840, there were about 600,000 Catholics in the United States. In the 1840s, 200,000 Irish immigrated to escape poverty.  The [[Irish Potato Famine]] in 1845 caused the Irish population in America to reach 962,000, the number doubling in the next ten years.<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/history/americanhistory/immigrants-and-immigration-aaw-02/ Immigrants and Immigration], Americans at War, Macmillan Reference USA</ref> Even larger numbers of immigrants arrived from traditionally Catholic regions of Germany and other parts of Europe. To the extent that these new arrivals remained inside ethnic communities, they typically joined the local Catholic church that through the local diocese was in communion with Rome; how many cut their ties with the Catholic Church is a matter of speculation.<ref>Roger Finke and Rodney Stark, ''The Churching of America, 1776-1990: Winners and Losers in Our Religious Economy'' (1993) p. 273. Apart from the formation in 1897 of a [[Polish National Catholic Church]], there were no alternative Catholic denominations formed for immigrants. By contrast the Lutherans formed numerous denominations in the U.S.</ref> The Irish Catholics took controlling positions in the Catholic Church, labor unions, and Democratic organizations in the big cities, thus forming overlapping centers of strength. The sudden new arrival of so many Catholics, charges of political corruption, and fears of papal interference caused [[anti-Catholicism in the United States|anti-Catholicism]] to grow, including the short-lived [[Know Nothings]] party in the 1850s which demanded a purification of elections and statutes from Catholic influence.{{r|silk20081103}}\n\nMany Catholics served in the Civil War armies, both North and South, and the bishops rejected the antiwar and anti-draft sentiments of some members. The rapid rise of the Irish out of poverty, and the continued growth in membership, especially in industrial and urban areas, made the church the largest denomination in the U.S. Distrusting public schools dominated by Protestants, Catholics built their own network of parochial elementary schools (and, later, high schools), as well as colleges, and public funding for parochial schools was a controversial issue.{{r|silk20081103}} As the [[Bennett Law]] episode in 1890 in Wisconsin demonstrated, Catholics were willing to cooperate politically with German Lutherans to protect their parochial schools. A distinct Catholic vote existed, however; in the late 19th century, 75% of Irish and German Catholics in America voted for Democratic presidential candidates. {{r|silk20081103}}  The Irish increasingly controlled the Democratic party machinery in major cities.<ref>Steven P. Erie, ''Rainbow's end: Irish-Americans and the dilemmas of urban machine politics, 1840-1985'' (1990)</ref>\n\nReligious lines were sharply drawn in the North in the [[Third Party System]] that lasted from the 1850s to the 1890s.  (In the South the Catholics voted the same as Protestants, with race as the main dividing line.)<ref name=\"Kleppner 1979\">Kleppner (1979)</ref>  Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Scandinavian Lutherans and other Protestant [[pietists]] in the North were tightly linked to the GOP. In sharp contrast, [[liturgical]] groups, especially the Catholics, Episcopalians, and German Lutherans, looked to the Democratic Party for protection from pietistic moralism, especially prohibition.  While both parties cut across economic class structures, the Democrats were supported more heavily by its lower tiers.\n\nCultural issues, especially prohibition and foreign language schools, became important because of the sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50% of the voters were pietistic Protestants who believed the government should be used to reduce social sins, such as drinking. Liturgical churches comprised over a quarter of the vote and wanted the government to stay out of personal morality issues. Prohibition debates and referendums heated up elections in most states over a period of decades, as national prohibition was finally passed in 1918 (and repealed in 1932), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry GOP.<ref name=\"Kleppner 1979\"/>\n\n[[File:Grant to Hayes - I guess that reform bait wont work this side.

From the onset of significant immigration in the 1840s, the Church in the United States was predominantly urban, with both its leaders and congregants usually of the laboring classes. Over the course of the second half of the nineteenth century, nativism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-unionism coalesced in Republican elections, and Catholics gravitated toward unions and the Democratic Party.{{r|silk20081103}}\n\nThe [[Knights of Labor]] was the earliest labor organization in the United States, and in the 1880s, this was the largest labor union in the United States.  It is estimated that at least half its membership was Catholic (including [[Terence Powderly]], its president from 1881 onward).\n\nIn ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891), [[Pope Leo XIII]] criticized the concentration of wealth and power, spoke out against the abuses that workers faced and demanded that workers should be granted certain rights and safety regulations.  He upheld the right of voluntary association, specifically commending labor unions. At the same time, he reiterated the Church's defense of private property, condemned socialism, and emphasized the need for Catholics to form and join unions that were not compromised by secular and revolutionary ideologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html |title=''Rerum novarum'' |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n''Rerum novarum'' provided new impetus for Catholics to become active in the labor movement, even if its exhortation to form specifically Catholic labor unions was widely interpreted as irrelevant to the pluralist context of the United States. While atheism underpinned many European unions and stimulated Catholic unionists to form separate labor federations, the religious neutrality of unions in the U.S. provided no such impetus. American Catholics seldom dominated unions, but they exerted influence across organized labor. Catholic union members and leaders played important roles in steering American unions away from socialism.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==20th century==\n\nBy 1900, Catholics represented 14 percent of the total U.S. population, soon became the single largest religious denomination in the country.<ref>Terry Matthews: [http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html Catholicism in Nineteenth Century America] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20010529012128/http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/seventeen.html# |date=2001-05-29 }}, Lectures for Religion, Wake Forrest University</ref> Still, Catholics did not hold many high offices in government. Only one of the first 54 justices on the [[United States Supreme Court]] was Catholic, [[Roger B. Taney]], appointed in 1836.\n\n===Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction===\n\nFollowing [[World War I]], many hoped that a new commitment to social reform would characterize the ensuing peace. The Council saw an opportunity to use its national voice to shape reform and in April 1918 created a Committee for Reconstruction. [[John A. Ryan]] wrote the Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction. Combining Progressive thought and Catholic theology, Ryan believed that government intervention was the most effective means of affecting positive change for his church as well as working people and the poor. On February 12, 1919, the National Catholic War Council issued the \"Bishops' Program of Social Reconstruction\".\n\nThe Program received a mixed reception both within the Church and outside it. The National Catholic War Council was a voluntary organization with no canonical status. Its ability to speak authoritatively was therefore questioned. Many bishops threw their support behind the Program, but some, including Bishop William Turner of Buffalo and William Henry O'Connell of Boston, opposed it. O'Connell believed some aspects of the plan smacked too much of socialism. Response outside the Church was also divided: labor organizations backed it, for example, and business groups criticized it.\n\n===Defense of parochial school system===\n{{Main|Oregon Compulsory Education Act}}\n\nAfter World War I, some states concerned about the influence of immigrants and \"foreign\" values looked to public schools for help. The states drafted laws designed to use schools to promote a common American culture.\n\nIn 1921, the [[Ku Klux Klan]] arrived in [[Oregon]] and quickly attracted as many as 14,000 members, establishing 58 klaverns by the end of 1922. Given the small population of non-white minorities outside Portland, the Oregon Klan directed its attention almost exclusively against Catholics, who numbered about 8% of the population.\n\nIn 1922, the [[Freemasons|Masonic]] Grand Lodge of Oregon sponsored a bill to require all school-age children to attend public schools.  With support of the Klan and Democratic Governor [[Walter M. Pierce]], endorsed by the Klan, the Compulsory Education Act was passed by a vote of 115,506 to 103,685.  Its primary purpose was to shut down Catholic schools in Oregon, but it also affected other private and military schools. The constitutionality of the law was challenged in court and ultimately struck down by the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Pierce v. Society of Sisters]]'' (1925) before it went into effect,<ref>Howard, J. Paul.

He quoted in a footnote the part of the case:\n\n<blockquote>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only.

It grew into a \"[[house of hospitality]]\" in the slums of New York City and then a series of farms for people to live together communally. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States and to [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]]; more than 30 independent but affiliated CW communities had been founded by 1941. Well over 100 communities exist today, including several in [[Australia]], the United Kingdom, Canada, [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web |title=List of Catholic Worker Communities |url=http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm |accessdate=2008-11-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220122836/http://www.catholicworker.org/communities/commlistall.cfm |archivedate=2008-12-20 }}</ref>\n\nSimilar houses of hospitality were established by Russian immigrant and Catholic social worker, [[Catherine Doherty]], founder of Madonna House.\n\n====National Catholic Welfare Conference====\n{{main|National Catholic Welfare Council#National Catholic Welfare Conference}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\n===1930s===\nHistorian John McGreevey notes, \"Priests across the country in the 1930s encouraged their parishioners to join unions, and some like [[Pittsburgh]]'s Monsignor [[Charles Owen Rice|Charles Rice]], Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo's]] Monsignor [[John P. Boland (labor priest)|John P.Boland]], served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations.\"  The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] and [[Dorothy Day]] grew out of the same impetuses to put [[Catholic social teaching]] into action.\n\n===Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems===\nThe [[Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems]] (1923\u20131937) was conceived by Fr. Raymond McGowan as a way of bringing together Catholic leaders in the fields of theology, labor, and business, with a view to promoting awareness and discussion of Catholic social teaching. Its first meeting was held in Milwaukee. While it was the venue for important discussions during its existence, its demise was due partly by lack of participation by business executives who perceived the dominant tone of the group as anti-business.\n\n==Party affiliation==\nBefore the 1960s, when cultural changes lead to an incremental liberalization of the Democratic Party, Catholics were seen as staunch Democrats. The Democratic Party ran Al Smith, the first Catholic presidential candidate by a major party, in 1928, and, except when the ticket was headed by a [[Southern United States|Southern]] candidate, has nominated a Catholic for president or vice president in every election since 1960 except for [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] (where a [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Michael Dukakis]], was the presidential nominee).\n\nSince the 1960s, the Catholic vote has come to reflect the nation as a whole instead of being predominantly Democratic.{{r|silk20081103}} In the 60s and early 70s, a number of Catholics and Southern whites abandoned their traditional affiliation with the Democratic Party and began to support the Republican Party.  This shift is evidenced by the fact that Nixon received 33% of the Catholic vote in the 1968 election compared to 52% in 1972.  As a group, Catholics represented a quarter of the nation's electorate and were now one of the nation's largest swing groups.  Both parties began to aggressively woo the Catholic voters.  Although the Catholic hierarchy could not dictate who Catholics voted for, they did have a substantial influence over the faithful in their dioceses.  Politicians were aware that the bishops could direct significant time, energy and money to support the issues that were important to them.  From their perspective, the bishops were eager to regain some of the influence that their predecessors had wielded in the earlier part of the 20th century.<ref name=\"HeyerRozell2008_17\">{{cite book|last1=Heyer|first1=Kristin E.|last2=Rozell|first2=Mark J.|last3=Genovese|first3=Michael A.|title=Catholics and politics: the dynamic tension between faith and power|url=https://archive.org/details/catholicspolitic0000kris|url-access=registration|accessdate=19 January 2012|year=2008|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=978-1-58901-215-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/catholicspolitic0000kris/page/17 17]}}</ref>  Since the 1970s non-Hispanic white Catholics have voted majority Republican very reliably while a majority of Hispanic or Latino Catholics have voted Democrat.<ref name=\"Religion, Race page 65-66\">Religion, Race, and the American Presidency  edited by Gaston Espinosa page 65-66</ref>\n\nIn his successful [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]] campaign against [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]] won about half of the Catholic vote and a majority of Catholics who were non-Hispanic whites.<ref>Religion, Race, and the American Presidency  edited by Gaston Espinosa page 66</ref> \"[[Reagan Democrats]]\", many of them non-Hispanic white, blue-collar Catholics, comprised 25% of the Democrats who voted for Reagan, and formed an important part of his support in [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] as well.

Although the majority of Catholics in 1984 remained Democrats, compared to 1980 Catholic votes switched to Reagan at about the same level as most Protestant groups. Reagan's vice president [[George H. W. Bush]] won about the same number of votes as [[Michael Dukakis]], making [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] the third presidential election in a row in which Catholics failed to support the Democratic candidate as they traditionally did.{{r|prendergast1999}}{{rp|186\u2013187,191\u2013192,194}}\n\nAlthough about one third of Catholics voted for Bush's reelection in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], most Catholic defectors switched to independent [[Ross Perot]], not the successful Democrat [[Bill Clinton]]. Unlike previous elections (such as in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]], when [[George McGovern]]'s Catholic support was eight percentage points higher than overall) the Catholic vote was not more Democratic than the overall electorate, but split almost identically to it. The trend away from a Democratic dominance of the Catholic vote continued in [[United States elections, 1994|1994]], when for the first time in history Democrats did not receive a majority of Catholic votes in elections for the House of Representatives; as with 1992, the Catholic vote split resembled that of the overall electorate.

Many feared that he would answer to the pope and not the constitution.\nAnother major controversial issue was the continuation of [[Prohibition]]. Smith was personally in favor of relaxation or repeal of Prohibition laws despite its status as part of the nation's Constitution, but the Democratic Party split north and south on the issue. During the campaign Smith tried to duck the issue with noncommittal statements.  He was also criticized for being a drunkard because of the stereotypes placed on Irish Catholics of the day.<ref>DeGregorio, (1984).</ref><ref>Lichtman (1979)</ref>\n\nSmith swept the entire Catholic vote, which had been split in 1920 and 1924, and brought millions of Catholics to the polls for the first time, especially women.  The fact that Smith was Catholic garnered him support from [[immigrant]] populations in New England, which may explain his narrow victories in traditionally Republican [[Massachusetts]] and [[Rhode Island]], as well as his narrow 2% loss in [[New York (state)|New York]] (which previous Democratic presidential candidates had lost by double digits).<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = Haskell House Publishers |isbn = 978-0-8383-1427-2 | last = Rice | first = Arnold S.  | title = The Ku Klux Klan in American Politics | year = 1972}}</ref>\n\n===1960 Presidential election===\n{{Main|United States presidential election, 1960}}\n[[File:John F. Kennedy, White House color photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[John F. Kennedy]], 35th President of the United States]]\n\nReligion became a divisive issue during the [[1960 United States presidential election|presidential campaign of 1960]]. Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] of Massachusetts was vying to become the nation's first Catholic president.  A key factor that was hurting  Kennedy in his campaign was the widespread prejudice against his Roman Catholic religion; some [[Protestants]] believed that, if he were elected President, Kennedy would have to take orders from the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]].  When offered the opportunity to speak before a convention of Baptist ministers, he decided to try to put the issue to rest.\n\nTo address fears that his Roman Catholicism would influence his decision-making, [[John F. Kennedy]] famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960, \"I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party's candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters \u2014 and the Church does not speak for me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html|title=Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association|accessdate=2007-09-17|last=Kennedy|first=John F.|date=2002-06-18|website=American Rhetoric|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911175450/http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/jfkhoustonministers.html|archivedate=2007-09-11}}</ref> He promised to respect the separation of church and state and not to allow Catholic officials to dictate public policy to him.  Kennedy also raised the question of whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Roman Catholic.\n\nEven so, it was widely believed after the election that Kennedy lost some heavily Protestant states because of his Catholicism.  His address did not please everyone: many non-Catholics remained unconvinced that a Catholic could be president without divided loyalties; and many Catholics thought he conceded too much in his profession of belief in an absolute [[separation of church and state]]. The speech is widely considered to be an important marker in the history of Catholicism (and anti-Catholicism) in the United States.\n\nKennedy went on to win the national popular vote over [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]] by just one tenth of one percentage point (0.1%) - the closest popular-vote margin of the 20th century. In the [[United States electoral college|electoral college]], Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).  There was a \"narrow consensus\" among the experts that Kennedy had won more votes than he lost as a result of his Catholicism,<ref>''New York Times'', November 20, 1960, Section 4, p. E5</ref> as Catholics rallied to Kennedy as an affirmation of their religion and their right to have a Catholic president.\n\n==Representation in government==\n\n===Congress===\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, Catholics represent 30.5% of [[Demographics of the United States Congress|the United States Congress]] as of January 2019. There are 141 [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] and 22 [[United States Senate|Senators]] that are Catholic, which split as 99 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 64 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].\n\nOn January 4, 2007, [[Nancy Pelosi]], a Catholic, became the first woman elected as the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. She was elected again as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] on January 3, 2019, after serving as [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] from 2003-2007 and 2011\u20132019. [[Paul Ryan]] is Catholic as well and served recently as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] from 2015 to 2019.\n\n[[Edward Kavanagh]] was nationally noticed as the first [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] elected from New England. Kavanagh was elected as a [[Jacksonian Democrats|Jacksonian]] to the Twenty-second and Twenty-third Congresses, serving from March 4, 1831, to March 3, 1835.\n\n===Supreme Court===\nIn the early 1980s, there was one Catholic justice.  This changed in the mid 1980s when President [[Ronald Reagan]] nominated [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Anthony Kennedy]] to the court, both Catholic. The first President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] nominated [[Clarence Thomas]] (a Catholic who at the time of his appointment was attending Episcopalian services, though he has since become an active Catholic) along with [[David Souter]], an Episcopalian. The second President [[George W. Bush]] appointed [[John Roberts]] and [[Samuel Alito]], both Catholics. President [[Barack Obama]] appointed Catholic [[Sonia Sotomayor]].  For the seven years beginning with the 2009 appointment of Sotomayor and ending with the 2016 death of Scalia, the Supreme Court had a Catholic majority of five justices, including Chief Justice Roberts.\n\nThe four Catholic Supreme Court justices nominated in recent decades have consistently stood as reliable votes for abortion restriction. In ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' (1989), ''[[City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health]]'' (1990), ''[[Hodgson v. Minnesota]]'' (1990), and ''[[Rust v.

In its early years the school was primarily an undergraduate institution, although this began to change in the 1950s after the appointment of [[Neil H. Jacoby]] as dean; the last undergraduate degree was awarded in 1969. UCLA is rare among public universities in the U.S. for not offering undergraduate business administration degrees.  Undergraduate degrees in business economics are offered.\n\nIn 1950, the school was renamed the School of Business Administration.  Five years later it became the Graduate School of Business Administration; in the 1970s the school\u2019s name was changed again to the Graduate School of Management.\n\nIn 1987, [[John E. Anderson]] (1917\u20132011), class of 1940, donated $15 million to the school and prompted the construction of a new complex at the north end of UCLA\u2019s campus. He later donated additional $25 million. The 6-building, {{convert|285000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility, was designed by [[Henry N. Cobb]] of the architectural firm [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]] and Executive Architects [[Leidenfrost/Horowitz & Associates]]. It cost $75 million to construct and opened officially in 1995. \n\nOn May 13, 2015, Marion Anderson, widow of the late John Anderson, announced a $100 million donation (4th single-largest donation to a business school in the United States) to the school for fellowships and research, along with $40 million earmarked for initiating development of what is now known as the Marion Anderson Hall.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.anderson.ucla.edu/anderson/2017/10/marion-anderson-hall-a-link-to-the-past-a-bridge-to-the-future.html|title=Marion Anderson Hall: A Link to the Past, a Bridge to the Future|website=UCLA Anderson School of Management Blog|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref> \n\nRecently, the school has been mostly self-funded, with only $6 million of government funding out of its $96 million budget in 2010-11.<ref name=\"insidehighered\">''Pushback on a B-School's Bold Plan'', Inside Higher Ed., November 23, 2010, [http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/11/23/ucla URL]</ref> In fall 2010, the school proposed \"financial self-sufficiency\": Giving up all state funding, in return for freedom from some state rules and freedom to raise tuition.<ref name=\"insidehighered\" /> Critics called this proposal \"privatization\", but the school rejected this description, with former Dean Judy Olian saying, \"This is not privatization....

And, sir, to say because a man pleads that every man hath a voice by right of nature, that therefore it destroys by the same argument all property \u2013 this is to forget the Law of God. That there's a property, the Law of God says it; else why hath God made that law, Thou shalt not steal? I am a poor man, therefore I must be oppressed: if I have no interest in the kingdom, I must suffer by all their laws be they right or wrong. Nay thus: a gentleman lives in a country and hath three or four lordships, as some men have (God knows how they got them); and when a Parliament is called he must be a Parliament-man; and it may be he sees some poor men, they live near this man, he can crush them \u2013 I have known an invasion to make sure he hath turned the poor men out of doors; and I would fain know whether the potency of rich men do not this, and so keep them under the greatest tyranny that was ever thought of in the world.

His first [[law of nature (precept)|law of nature]] is that \"every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war\". In the state of nature, \"every man has a right to every thing, even to then go for one another's body\", but the second law is that in order to secure the advantages of peace \"that a man be willing, when others are so too [...] to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much [[liberty]] against other men as he would allow other men against himself\". This is the beginning of contracts/covenants; performing of which is the third law of nature. Therefore, injustice is failure to perform in a covenant and all else is just.\n* 1656 \u2013 [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] (''[[The Commonwealth of Oceana]]'') uses the term to describe a situation where the [[people]] use force to impose a government on an economic base composed of either solitary land ownership (absolute [[monarchy]]), or land in the ownership of a few (mixed monarchy). He distinguishes it from [[commonwealth]], the situation when both land ownership and governance shared by the population at large, seeing it as a temporary situation arising from an imbalance between the form of government and the form of property relations.\n\n=== French Revolution (1789\u20131799) ===\n{{main|French Revolution|Reign of Terror}}\n[[File:Heads on pikes.jpg|thumb|Heads of aristocrats on spikes]]\n[[Thomas Carlyle]], Scottish essayist of the Victorian era known foremost for his widely influential work of history, ''[[The French Revolution (Carlyle)|The French Revolution]]'', wrote that the French Revolution was a war against both aristocracy and anarchy: {{quote|Meanwhile, we will hate Anarchy as Death, which it is; and the things worse than Anarchy shall be hated more!

For my part, as I think, you forgot something that was in my speech, and you do not only yourselves believe that some men believe that the government is never correct, but you hate all men that believe that. And, sir, to say because a man pleads that every man hath a voice by right of nature, that therefore it destroys by the same argument all property \u2013 this is to forget the Law of God. That there's a property, the Law of God says it; else why hath God made that law, Thou shalt not steal? I am a poor man, therefore I must be oppressed: if I have no interest in the kingdom, I must suffer by all their laws be they right or wrong. Nay thus: a gentleman lives in a country and hath three or four lordships, as some men have (God knows how they got them); and when a Parliament is called he must be a Parliament-man; and it may be he sees some poor men, they live near this man, he can crush them \u2013 I have known an invasion to make sure he hath turned the poor men out of doors; and I would fain know whether the potency of rich men do not this, and so keep them under the greatest tyranny that was ever thought of in the world.

His first [[law of nature (precept)|law of nature]] is that \"every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war\". In the state of nature, \"every man has a right to every thing, even to then go for one another's body\", but the second law is that in order to secure the advantages of peace \"that a man be willing, when others are so too [...] to lay down this right to all things; and be contented with so much [[liberty]] against other men as he would allow other men against himself\". This is the beginning of contracts/covenants; performing of which is the third law of nature. Therefore, injustice is failure to perform in a covenant and all else is just.\n* 1656 \u2013 [[James Harrington (author)|James Harrington]] (''[[The Commonwealth of Oceana]]'') uses the term to describe a situation where the [[people]] use force to impose a government on an economic base composed of either solitary land ownership (absolute [[monarchy]]), or land in the ownership of a few (mixed monarchy). He distinguishes it from [[commonwealth]], the situation when both land ownership and governance shared by the population at large, seeing it as a temporary situation arising from an imbalance between the form of government and the form of property relations.\n\n=== French Revolution (1789\u20131799) ===\n{{main|French Revolution|Reign of Terror}}\n[[File:Heads on pikes.jpg|thumb|Heads of aristocrats on spikes]]\n[[Thomas Carlyle]], Scottish essayist of the Victorian era known foremost for his widely influential work of history, ''[[The French Revolution (Carlyle)|The French Revolution]]'', wrote that the French Revolution was a war against both aristocracy and anarchy: {{quote|Meanwhile, we will hate Anarchy as Death, which it is; and the things worse than Anarchy shall be hated more!

Lawes describes the government as being \"anarchical, but nearest to any form of [[Aristocracy]]\", further arguing: \"Must the King's good subjects at home who are as capable to begin plantations, as their Fathers, and themselves were, be excluded from their Liberty of settling Plantations in this noble Island, for ever and the King and Nation at home be deprived of so much riches, to make a few upstart [[Gentleman|Gentlemen]] Princes?\"<ref>''Jamaica: Description of the Principal Persons there'' (about 1720, Sir Nicholas Lawes, Governor) in ''[[Caribbeana]]'' Vol. III (1911), edited by [[Vere Langford Oliver]]</ref>\n\n=== Russian Civil War (1917\u20131922) ===\n[[File:Makhno en 1918.JPG|thumb|[[Nestor Makhno]], the leader of the anarchist [[Free Territory]] in Ukraine during the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918]]\nDuring the [[Russian Civil War]] which initially started as a confrontation between the [[Bolsheviks]] and [[White movement|monarchists]], on the territory of today's Ukraine a new force emerged, namely the [[Anarchist]] [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]].
