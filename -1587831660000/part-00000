He served as chancellor of King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] from 1255 and was elected [[Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg|Bishop of Bamberg]] in 1257 and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Passau|Bishop of Passau]] in 1265. W\u0142adys\u0142aw became [[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]] in the same year, and from 1268 also served as [[Diocesan administrator|administrator]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wroc\u0142aw|Wroc\u0142aw diocese]].\n\n==Family==\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw was the fifth and youngest son of the [[Dukes of Silesia|Silesian]] duke [[Henry II the Pious]], by his wife [[Anne of Bohemia, Duchess of Silesia|Anna]], daughter of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslid]] king [[Ottokar I of Bohemia]]. The Silesian Piasts, elder line of the [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Polish]] ruling [[Piast dynasty]], had been restored into their Silesian heritage by the aid of Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] in 1163. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's grandfather, Duke [[Henry the Bearded]], also regained the [[Seniorate Province]] and the Polish Crown as [[List of Polish monarchs|High Duke]] in 1232.\n\nDuke Henry II became co-ruler of his father in 1226 and was able to succeed him as Silesian duke and High Duke of Poland in 1238. When he was killed during the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasion]] in the [[Battle of Legnica]] on 9 April 1241, W\u0142adys\u0142aw's eldest brother [[Boles\u0142aw II Rogatka|Boles\u0142aw II the Bald]] assumed the rule over the [[Lower Silesia]]n lands and the guardianship of his minor siblings. Stuck in internal conflicts with his brothers [[Henry III the White]] and [[Mieszko, Duke of Lubusz|Mieszko]], he was not able to secure the Polish throne, which he had to cede to his Piast cousin [[Konrad I of Masovia|Konrad of Masovia]].\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Silesia 1249-1273.jpg|thumb|left|Silesia in 1248/51: Creation of the Lower Silesian duchies of Legnica (violet) and G\u0142og\u00f3w (green)]]\nWith the approval of their mother Anna of Bohemia and with the purpose to not further divide the paternal lands, the younger sons of late Henry II, W\u0142adys\u0142aw and [[Konrad I, Duke of G\u0142og\u00f3w|Konrad I]], were sent to study at the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italian]] university of [[University of Padua|Padua]], with the idea that both prepare for an ecclesiastical career. In 1248, their rivalling elder brothers Henry III and Boles\u0142aw II finally came to terms: Henry assumed the government over the Lower Silesian lands around [[Wroc\u0142aw]], after he made a land division with Boles\u0142aw II. He chose W\u0142adys\u0142aw as co-ruler, while Konrad I supposedly became co-ruler in the newly established [[Duchy of Legnica]] under Boles\u0142aw. However, the Duke of Legnica refused to share the power with anybody. Konrad fled to [[Duchy of Greater Poland|Greater Poland]] and, backed by his brother-in-law Duke [[Przemys\u0142 I of Greater Poland|Przemys\u0142 I]], eventually obtained the [[Duchy of G\u0142og\u00f3w]] as his own share in 1251.\n\nIn the case of Henry III and W\u0142adys\u0142aw, the cooperation between the brothers was a mutual agreement with few opportunities to frictions, as W\u0142adys\u0142aw mainly stayed in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] capital [[Prague]] at the court of his maternal cousin King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottokar II]]. His role in the undivided Duchy of Wroc\u0142aw was limited to receive his rents; Henry III took under his hands all the government. Nevertheless, W\u0142adys\u0142aw too issued numerous deeds and in 1261 he and his brother jointly vested the Wroc\u0142aw citizens with [[Magdeburg rights]]. With the support of the Bohemian king, W\u0142adys\u0142aw continued his spiritual career: about 1255 he became a [[Provost (religion)|provost]] at the cathedral chapter of the [[Basilica of St Peter and St Paul|St Peter and Paul]] collegiate church in [[Vy\u0161ehrad]] (today a part of Prague) and thus was appointed Bohemian Royal Chancellor, a post exclusively reserved for the Vy\u0161ehrad provosts. The close alliance between the Silesian Piasts and the P\u0159emyslid dynasty strengthened the ties between the lands of Silesia and Bohemia.\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw joined the cathedral chapter in Bamberg in 1256 and was elected bishop in the following year, however, he had to resign, as he received no [[Dispensation (canon law)|dispensation]] by [[Pope Alexander IV]] due to his [[Person (canon law)|young age]]. Backed by King Ottokar II, he became a member of the Wroc\u0142aw chapter and in April 1265 he was elected Bishop of Passau. In October he was elected Archbishop of Salzburg; this time he received the consent of [[Pope Clement IV]]. W\u0142adys\u0142aw arrived in [[Salzburg]] in Spring 1266. He had to return to Silesia upon the death of his brother Duke Henry III the White on 3 December 1266. In his will, he left W\u0142adys\u0142aw the guardianship of his infant son [[Henryk IV Probus|Henry IV Probus]] and with this, the regency of the whole Silesian duchy of Wroc\u0142aw.\n\nHenry III's government had not been too beneficial to the church; W\u0142adys\u0142aw, now as a bishop and also regent, was not inclined to preserve the prerogatives of the nobility, but at the end he was forced to accept this. The bishop-regent was an advocate, with his late brother Henry III, for the [[canonization]] of their paternal grandmother, Duchess [[Hedwig of Silesia]] (''n\u00e9e'' of [[Counts of Andechs|Andechs]]). The process was finally completed, when Saint Hedwig was canonized by Pope Clement on 26 March 1267. This was certainly W\u0142adys\u0142aw's great personal success and gave much prestige to the whole family.\n\nThe final chord of his great church's career was his nomination in 1268 to the Bishopric of Wroc\u0142aw. W\u0142adys\u0142aw had no intention to sacrifice the Archbishopric of Salzburg, but thanks to his influence in Prague and [[Rome]] he was appointed an ''apostolic administrator'' with all the rights of a bishop. W\u0142adys\u0142aw fulfilled all his duties honestly, a quite uncommon attitude among the medieval princes. When he was Archbishop of Salzburg and shortly afterwards received the title of an administrator in the Diocese of Wroclaw, he was able to combine the two positions so that no one can say that these features overwhelm them. The last four years of life he was in constant travels between Salzburg and Wroc\u0142aw.\n\nW\u0142adys\u0142aw died on 27 April 1270 and was buried in [[Salzburg Cathedral]]. In his will, he left his rights over the half of the Duchy of Wroclaw to his nephew Henry IV Probus. There were some rumours that the cause of death of the young bishop, with not more than thirty-three years, was poisoning. Guilty of this crime have to be among the nobility, who four years earlier apparently killed Duke Henry III the White, and almost twenty years later his nephew Henry IV shared the same fate. The mere fact of mentioning the same source (the ''Chronicle of the Silesian Piast Dukes'' and his likes) stated that the subsequent death of the Dukes of Wroclaw in a short term appears to be somewhat suspect. Likely source of sensational suit has gone, but few credible rumors. The sudden death of a young prince caused by natural factors in the time, when the medical service was not the best, could easily be interpreted as a poisoning. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's death was likely, however, natural, which indicates the presumable place of his death, Salzburg. If the Polish nobles actually wanted to kill him, they presumably would have made this when he stayed in Wroclaw and may not have chosen a long journey to [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] to eliminate the bishop-regent.\n\n==Sources==\n*\"''Henryk III Bia\u0142y''\" (\"Henryk III the White\"), ''Encyklopedia Polski'' (Encyclopedia of Poland), Krak\u00f3w, Wydawnictwo Ryszard Kluszczy\u0144ski, 1996, p.&nbsp;216.\n*''This article was translated from his original in Polish Wikipedia''.\n*{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SILESIA.htm#KonradIGlogaudied12731274A |title-date= |title= SILESIA|date=August 2012}}\n*{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/piast/piast4.html#K1 |title= Complete Genealogy of the House of Piast: Silesia-Wroclaw |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}\n*[http://www8.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/cgi-bin/stoyan/l1/LANG=span/INDEX=I108845 Chronological Dates in Stoyan]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[Piast Dynasty]]||{{circa|1237}}|27 April|1270|}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{s-bef | before=[[Boles\u0142aw II Rogatka|Boles\u0142aw II the Bald]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Duke of Silesia|Duke of Wroc\u0142aw]]|regent1=[[Henry III the White]]|years1=1248&ndash;1266|regent2=[[Henry IV Probus]]|years2=1266&ndash;1290| years=1248&ndash;1270}}\n{{s-aft | after=[[Henry IV Probus]]}}\n{{s-rel|ca}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{s-bef | before={{ill|Henry of Bilversheim|lt=Henry I|de|3=Heinrich I. von Bilversheim}} }}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg|Prince-Bishop of Bamberg]]<br/><small>only elect: too young, therefore not papally confirmed</small> | years=1257 }}\n{{s-aft | after={{ill|Bertold of Leiningen|de|Berthold von Leiningen}}}}\n{{s-bef | before=[[Otto of Lonsdorf]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Passau|Prince-Bishop of Passau]]<br/><small>only elect: succeeded to Salzburg see</small>| years=1265}}\n{{s-aft | after={{ill|Petrus, prince-bishop of Passau|lt=Petrus|de|Petrus von Passau}}}}\n{{s-rel|ca}}\n{{s-bef | before={{ill|Ulrich of Seckau|de|Ulrich von Seckau}} }}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Archbishopric of Salzburg|Archbishop of Salzburg]]<br/><small>papally [[dispensation (canon law)|dispensed]] though too young and lacking Holy Orders</small> | years=1265\u20131270}}\n{{s-aft | after={{ill|Frederick of Walchen|lt=Frederick II|de|Friedrich II. von Walchen}} }}\n{{s-bef | before=[[Thomas I, bishop of Wroc\u0142aw|Thomas I]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]]<br>''as [[diocesan administrator|administrator]]'' | years=1268\u20131270}}\n{{s-aft | after=[[Thomas II, bishop of Wroc\u0142aw|Thomas II Zaremba]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:1237 births]]\n[[Category:1270 deaths]]\n[[Category:Canons of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n[[Category:Piast dynasty]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic archbishops of Salzburg]]\n", "text_old": "{{ infobox nobility\n| name         = Ladislaus\n| title        = Bishop of Bamberg and Passau<br>Archbishop of Salzburg\n| image        = POL wojew\u00f3dztwo dolno\u015bl\u0105skie COA.svg\n| image_size   = 150px\n| caption      = Black eagle of the Silesian Piasts.\n| noble family = [[Silesian Piasts]]\n| father       = \n| mother       = \n| spouse       = \n| issue        = \n| birth_date   = 1237\n| birth_place  = \n| death_date   = 27 April 1270\n| death_place  = \n}}\n'''W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Salzburg''', also known as '''W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Wroc\u0142aw'''  ({{lang-pl|W\u0142adys\u0142aw Wroc\u0142awski}}) or '''W\u0142adys\u0142aw of Silesia''' ({{lang-de|Wladislaw von Schlesien}}, {{lang-cs|Vladislav Slezsk\u00fd}}; {{circa|1237}} \u2013 27 April 1270), a member of the [[Silesian Piasts]], was co-ruler in the [[Duchy of Silesia|Duchy of Wroclaw]] since 1248.

The author referred to Joseph as \"a muscle-bound B.T.\", the main character from his earlier series ''Cool Shock B.T.''; a ''[[sh\u014dnen manga]]'' hero who bends the rules as he fights.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Battle Tendency|volume=1|page=365|date=April 21, 2015|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-7882-8}}</ref> Having not been able to show a friendly rivalry between Jonathan and Dio, Araki introduced Caesar Zeppeli to present a more positive friendly rivalry between him and Joseph. Wanting each user to have a different type of Hamon with a unique design, he gave Caesar the seemingly fleeting-bubbles as a \"representation of his fate and the burden he is carrying.\" He enjoys giving characters weapons with faults and having them make up for it with strategy. The author stated that these \"spheres\" were inherited by both Gyro Zeppeli in ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' and Josuke Higashikata in ''[[JoJolion]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Battle Tendency|volume=3|page=[https://archive.org/details/jojosbizarreadve0000arak/page/265 265]|date=November 17, 2015|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-7884-2|url=https://archive.org/details/jojosbizarreadve0000arak/page/265}}</ref> Araki created the warrior-type Lisa Lisa, based on a neighborhood girl he knew as a child, to stand out compared to previous ''sh\u014dnen manga'' female characters who were typically cute and designed to be \"a man's ideal woman\".

Araki designed Kars with a turban to show his superior intelligence and that he is their king, his Brilliant Bone Blade ability harkening to Araki's earlier series ''[[Baoh]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Battle Tendency|volume=4|page=409|date=March 15, 2016|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-7885-9}}</ref>\n\n'''''Part 3: Stardust Crusaders'''''\n\nAlthough a Japanese protagonist, Araki modeled Jotaro after American actor [[Clint Eastwood]], including his poses and catchphrases. Although the author said the character might seem \"rough\" compared to other ''Jump'' protagonists, Jotaro fits his own image of a hero perfectly as a \"loner\" who does not do the right thing for attention. Araki said the character wearing his school uniform in the desert has its roots in [[Mitsuteru Yokoyama]]'s ''[[Babel II]]'', and that if he were to draw the part over again, he would base the Stands on ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=1|page=273|date=November 1, 2016|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9065-3}}</ref> Araki said he had a lot of readers asking him to bring older characters back. Although he is not a fan of bringing them back simply for nostalgia, he did not hesitate having Joseph return to save his daughter because it is completely true to the character. The author thought of having Joseph drop out partway through due to his age, but ended up \"playing it by ear\" as serialization continued. He gave him the role of \"navigator\", introducing the readers to the Joestar family, Dio, Hamon and Stands, and his own Stand being a support ability rather than offensive.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=2|page=267|date=February 7, 2017|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9157-5}}</ref> Araki said he gave Avdol an \"ethnic\" design to have some sort of connection to Egypt and that at the time of serialization, he and most of the readers had a strong interest in the \"birthplaces of civilization,\" making the design a \"product of the times.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=6|page=323|date=February 6, 2018|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9172-8}}</ref>\n\nAraki stated that he had Kakyoin act as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Jotaro. Although they both wear school uniforms, Kakyoin's well-tailored one gives him the feel of an honor student, while Jotaro's loose-fitting one and accessories convey that he is a delinquent. He made him Jotaro's first real Stand opponent to visually convey the concepts between short-range and long-range Stand abilities. The author revealed that he always read the [[kanji]] for Kakyoin's given name as \"Tenmei,\" but his editor approved the reading Noriaki for the ''tank\u014dbon'' much to his surprise.<ref>{{cite book|author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=5|page=305|date=November 7, 2017|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9171-1}}</ref> In order to not have him overlap with Jotaro and Joseph, Polnareff was given a distinctive look and personality, which in turn made him shine on his own. Because he is a versatile character who could say goofy lines or serious ones, he \"needed\" to make more appearances. More appearances means more fights, and because he made it through so many life-or-death situations, Araki feels that Polnareff grew the most in the story. The author used foreign models as reference for his hair, and also drew it like Rudol von Stroheim's from ''Battle Tendency''. The character's name was inspired by those of Araki's three favorite French people, actors [[Alain Delon]] and [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], and musician [[Michel Polnareff]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=9|page=390 |date=November 6, 2018|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9175-9}}</ref> Not having any limitations on what he can put in the series, Araki has animals appear and even had one join the Joestar party. Although he feels that The Fool is a perfect fit for Iggy, it just happened to be the last tarot card for him to assign aside from The World. Additionally, he thought of assigning The Fool to an enemy instead, but things just \"ended up working out the way they did.\" Being the first time he made an animal a major character and the first time he showed one in battle, Araki used [[Yoshihiro Takahashi]]'s ''[[Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin]]'' as a reference.<ref>{{cite book|author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=8|page=231|date=August 7, 2018|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9174-2}}</ref>\n\nWith the series meant to be long-running, Araki took great care in deciding which unique Stand user to put the main cast against and when, in order to keep readers interested. He designed Strength, Ebony Devil, and Yellow Temperance so that their appearances and abilities did not overlap. But as these were all one-on-one battles, he then decided to introduce Hol Horse and J. Geil as a team. He had always planned on having Noriaki Kakyoin and Jean Pierre Polnareff switch allegiances to the good guys, but not Hol Horse. Although he drew a color illustration with Hol Horse alongside the Joestar group and had the character return several times through the story, he suspects he did not go through with it because his personality overlaps with Polnareff's. He also said that because he did not put many limitations on Hol Horse's Stand, it kind of got out of control, plus it overlaps with Kakyoin's Emerald Splash. He did enjoy Hol Horse's \"why be number one when you can be number two\" philosophy, which the author carried over to Yoshikage Kira in ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'', and his outlaw appearance is similar to that of Gyro Zeppeli from ''Steel Ball Run'' and might have been inspired by [[Buichi Terasawa]]'s ''[[Cobra (manga)|Cobra]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=3|page=287|date=May 2, 2017|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9169-8}}</ref>\n\n'''''Part 4: Diamond Is Unbreakable'''''\n\nWith Part 4, Araki said that he moved away from \"muscle men\" as they fell out of popularity with his readers and he wanted to focus more on fashion.

In Parts 1\u20136, the Joestar bloodline was inherited by the {{nihongo|Kujo Family|\u7a7a\u6761\u5bb6|K\u016bj\u014d Ke}} and Josuke Higashikata. Dio, having stolen Jonathan's body at the end of Part 1, fathered a few sons bearing the Joestar bloodline while awakening use of Stands in Jonathan's descendants. In the alternate universe depicted in Parts 7 and 8, Johnny Joestar marries Rina Higashikata with the Higashikata Family becoming a distant branch of the Joestar family.\n\n===Part 1: ''Phantom Blood''===\nSet in England in the 1880s, the Joestar family adopts the orphaned Dio Brando.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Jonathan Joestar}}|\u30b8\u30e7\u30ca\u30b5\u30f3\u30fb\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Jonasan J\u014dsut\u0101}}\n:The main protagonist of ''Phantom Blood'', Jonathan is the son of George Joestar who carries his surname with pride while striving to be a gentleman who never betrays his code of honor and defending those in need even when at a grave disadvantage. Jonathan's life becomes one of misery when Dio Brando enters the household, eventually resulting in his father's death as Dio becomes a vampire. This motivates Jonathan to learn how to utilize Hamon energy from Will A. Zeppeli to settle the score with Dio, with his power later increasing drastically when a dying Zeppeli transfers his remaining Hamon into him.\n\n:Though Jonathan defeats Dio and marries his childhood sweetheart, Erina Pendleton, who bears his son George Joestar II, he is nevertheless fatally wounded by Dio's severed head during an attempt to take his body. Jonathan ultimately dies of his injuries, but not before further injuring the already severely weakened Dio and using his Hamon to cause an explosion on the ship that they and Erina are traveling aboard, with Jonathan successfully persuading Erina to escape alongside [[#Lisa Lisa|an infant]] orphaned by Dio's zombies by using Dio's coffin as a makeshift lifeboat.\n\n:Despite his death, Jonathan nevertheless has an influence throughout almost the entirety of the series thereafter; this is most noticeable in ''Stardust Crusaders'', where it is revealed that Dio managed to remove Jonathan's head and gain his body as his own. Upon his return, Dio's awakens his Stand, although doing so directly awakened one within Jonathan's body and indirectly awakened Stands within Jonathan's descendants, which in turn sets the plot of the part in motion. However, Jonathan's final effort was not in vain, as it weakened Dio to the point of him requiring blood from a Joestar descendant in order to both fully fuse with Jonathan's body and gain proper control of his respective Stand.\n\n:In addition to ''Stardust Crusaders'', Jonathan's influence is present, yet very subtle, in three other parts of the series. In ''Battle Tendency'', his significantly potent Hamon results in his grandson [[#Joseph Joestar|Joseph]] not only inheriting the ability to use Hamon, but also having an inherent aptitude for it. The orphan that Jonathan requested Erina to rescue is also revealed to be Elizabeth \"Lisa Lisa\" Joestar, who became the wife of his deceased son George II, the mother of Joseph, and an expert in Hamon. In ''Vento Aureo'', it is revealed that Jonathan is the biological father of the part's protagonist, [[#Giorno Giovanna|Giorno Giovanna]], due to DIO's impregnation of a Japanese woman some time after his return. In ''Stone Ocean'', three antagonistic Stand users (Donatello Versus, Rikiel, and Ungalo) are revealed to also be Jonathan's biological sons, albeit with personalities that are based on specific facets of DIO's personality and lack any influence from Jonathan's personality. In addition, one of Jonathan's bones is an integral fail-safe for DIO's desire of \"achieving Heaven\".\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Dio Brando}}|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc|Dio Burand\u014d}}\n{{Main|Dio Brando}}\n:The principal antagonist of the series, Dio is the son of the poor Dario Brando.

He serves loyally, and after Dio's penultimate defeat, he takes his master's head on board the ship carrying Jonathan and Erina. Despite his efforts and Jonathan being mortally wounded by Dio, Wang Chan is killed by Jonathan, who uses Hamon to destroy his head and subsequently control his corpse in order to sabotage the engine of the ship and ensure its destruction with Dio and the other zombies on board.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Robert E.

However, in the 1930s during ''Battle Tendency'' where he succeeded his mentor, Straizo admitted his desire for youth and envied Dio. This motivated him into betraying Speedwagon and using one of the newly discovered Stone Masks to become a vampire. Straizo makes an attempt on Joseph's life and is defeated on the Brooklyn Bridge, destroying himself with the Hamon he stored in his body prior to becoming a vampire.

While able to use Hamon like his grandfather, Joseph is not initially as skilled in its use until he trains under Lisa Lisa. He initially uses a pair of Hamon-empowered [[clackers]] in battle, but relies more on mind games rather than brute strength in fights, employing his uncanny ability to predict his opponent's actions down to what they say.

But Kars, motivated by his race's true potential, wiped out his people when they opposed him for endangering the world with the Stone Mask. Despite their apathy to humans and Kars's conduct, the other Pillar Men are chivalrous warriors who battle Hamon users in fair fights. Each has total control over their body, able to transform it to suit their needs while able to digest non-Hamon users via physical contact, Kars, Esidisi, and Wamuu having honed unique specialties called {{nihongo|Modes|{{ruby-ja|\u6d41\u6cd5|\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9}}|M\u014ddo}} to combat Hamon users.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Santana}}|\u30b5\u30f3\u30bf\u30ca|Santana}}\n:Santana is discovered in a Mexican pyramid in 1938 by Straizo's Speedwagon Foundation team and then taken by the [[Nazi]] forces under Stroheim for live human experiments to see if he can be used to power the German army, even using a Stone Mask vampire on him to see how much more powerful he is. Santana escapes, as he can contort his body to escape through a ventilation shaft, and shows he has mastered human language and the mechanisms of the Germans' weaponry when he manages to withstand their attacks. Joseph and Stroheim manage to stop him by escaping to the outside, as Joseph traps him in a well at high noon, turning him back to stone.

Esidisi's search for the Super Aja leads him to Venice, where he faces Joseph after murdering Loggins. Claiming to have intimate knowledge of ''[[The Art of War]]'' as he was in China during the lifetime of [[Sun Tzu]], Esidisi matches Joseph's own quick wits in a battle of deception. But Joseph takes advantage of Esidisi's lack of knowledge of [[sleight of hand]] to defeat him with a Hamon attack via a [[cut and restore rope trick]], destroying Esidisi's body. Esidisi survives, but is reduced to a disembodied nervous system, possessing the body of Suzi Q to get her to mail the Super Aja to Kars and then plans to destroy her from the inside with her heated blood killing the Hamon users. However, Joseph and Caesar's contrasting Hamon abilities force Esidisi out of Suzi Q's body, which results in the weakened Pillar Man's permanent death when exposed to the sunlight.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Wamuu}}|\u30ef\u30e0\u30a6|Wam\u016b}}\n:Wamuu is Esidisi and Kars' loyal servant, who is a strong and honorable warrior, but reflexively attacks anyone who steps on his own shadow.

He spares Joseph's life after the young man wounds him, allowing him a month's reprieve to master Hamon while placing a poison ring in the human's heart as added incentive while revealing the antidote in his lip piercing. His next fight is against Caesar, who manages to hold his own, but cannot defeat Wamuu's Wind Mode. He fatally wounds Caesar, allowing the dying man to obtain the antidote out of respect for the human's valiant effort. Wamuu later faces off against Joseph in a deadly chariot race, blinding himself to regain a psychological advantage over his opponent, before he is defeated by Joseph's wits and Hamon mastery. As Wamuu's disembodied head lays dying, Joseph eases the Pillar Man's passing by giving him drops of his own blood. Wamuu returns the favor by killing off a horde of vampires that attempts to kill Joseph in revenge, asking Joseph to take the antidote to give him peace of mind while expressing gratitude for facing such a worthy opponent.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kars}}|\u30ab\u30fc\u30ba|K\u0101zu}}\n:Kars is the leader of the Pillar Men and the creator of the Stone Masks.

This led to Kars wiping out his own people when they deemed his intention as sheer madness. Later facing Hamon users in his quest for a Super Aja stone to perfect the mask's use for his kind, Kars developed a {{nihongo|Light Mode|\u5149\u306e{{ruby-ja|\u6d41\u6cd5|\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9}}|Hikari no M\u014ddo}}, which allows him to produce saw-bladed appendages from his body which produce a radiant glow. Unlike his subordinates, Kars has no honor whatsoever and intends to fulfill his goals by any means. Kars finally succeeds in getting the stone by deceiving Lisa Lisa during their match with a vampire decoy and then tricking the Nazis into exposing him to ultraviolet rays while wearing the Aja-embedded stone mask. Once evolved, now immune to sunlight and able to tap into his own [[Atavism|genetic structure]], Kars can produce animal-like extensions of himself, undergo reactive evolutionary mutations, and utilize Hamon. In the end, Kars is defeated as a result of his own hubris, using a Hamon attack on Joseph, who uses the Super Aja to intercept the attack, in a volcano. The resulting eruption blasts Kars into the vacuum of space, causing his immortal body to freeze solid before his mind shuts down.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Lisa Lisa}}|\u30ea\u30b5\u30ea\u30b5|Risa Risa}}\n:A mysterious female Hamon master and Caesar's Hamon teacher who lives in Venice, Lisa Lisa is one of the few remaining Hamon users and keeper of the Super Aja, a perfectly cut Red Stone of Aja which she guards from the Pillar Men.

Elizabeth married Erina's son George Joestar II and was forced to go on the run after killing her husband's murderer, one of Dio's surviving vampires who infiltrated the [[Royal Air Force]]. Lisa Lisa fights with Hamon by conducting it through her specially made scarf. Because of her Hamon abilities, she appears to be in her mid 20s despite actuality being in her 50s.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Suzi Q}}|\u30b9\u30fc\u30b8\u30fcQ|S\u016bj\u012b Ky\u016b}}\n:Lisa Lisa's personal assistant who is ditzy and forgetful but loyal to her cause. She develops a crush on Joseph after seeing his face without a special Hamon training mask on for the first time. She is possessed by a disembodied Esidisi and is forced to send the Super Aja to the Pillar Man's allies and then attack the others before Caesar and Joseph manage to use Hamon to force the Pillar Man out of her body without endangering her life. She nurses Joseph back to health after his battle with Kars, and then becomes his wife in the end of ''Battle Tendency'', but forgets to let everyone else know that Joseph survived his battle with Kars. She later gives birth to their daughter Holly. Suzi Q makes a return appearance in Part 3 to watch over her daughter while Joseph is en route to Cairo to destroy Dio.\n\n===Part 3: ''Stardust Crusaders''===\nSet in 1987, the series follows Jotaro Kujo and his comrades who travel to Egypt from Japan in search of the evil and immortal vampire Dio Brando, now referred to as DIO.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Jotaro Kujo}}|\u7a7a\u6761 \u627f\u592a\u90ce|K\u016bj\u014d J\u014dtar\u014d}}\n:The main protagonist of ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' and the grandson of Joseph Joestar through Holly. He is depicted as a rough [[Yank\u012b|delinquent]] with a kind heart as he journeys to Egypt with his grandfather and allies to defeat DIO and save his mother's life. Jotaro tends to have an introverted mindset, rarely showing emotion. However, he uses this to his advantage to keep calm and make a plan in a dire situation.

He returns in ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' to aid his daughter, Jolyne Cujoh, against the forces of Enrico Pucci, but falls unconscious after both his Stand and memory discs were stolen by Pucci's Stand, Whitesnake.

Chariot Requiem, acting on its master's last command, can manipulate the souls of others in various ways like causing souls swap bodies with someone nearby. Further exposure to Chariot Requiem causes living bodies and souls to mutate. Chariot Requiem acts as a shadow to people's souls, and when they look at it, its shadow always falls in the opposite direction. It creates a sun-like light source behind them but if that light source is destroyed Chariot Requiem is destroyed as well.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Iggy}}|\u30a4\u30ae\u30fc|Ig\u012b}}\n:A [[Boston Terrier]] ally of Jotaro's who thwarted the New York animal control officers for years until Avdol managed to capture the dog for the Speedwagon Foundation.

The Fool can also use sand to shape-shift into different objects, and even people.

Upon being fired, the Emperor can control the bullet's flight path, allowing it to turn in midair. He prefers to operate with a partner, as his Stand is fairly weak and not effective without backup.

While he is kind and humble, he can erupt into a violent rage if someone insults his [[Pompadour (hairstyle)#Men's styles|pompadour hair-style]], as it is based on that of an unknown man who saved his life as a child. His Stand is {{nihongo|Crazy Diamond|\u30af\u30ec\u30a4\u30b8\u30fc\u30fb\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Kureij\u012b Daiyamondo}},{{efn|\"Shining Diamond\" in official English releases.}} which has the ability to restore objects to their original form, including healing other people's injuries.

Thus he secretly murdering women for over 15 years with Reimi Sugimoto as the first of his victims, keeping his current victim's severed hand as a \"girlfriend\" before discarding it when it begins to decay.

The Stand also possesses a secondary ability called Sheer Heart Attack, an indestructible tank-like bomb linked to Kira's left hand that relentless locks on to heat signatures.\n: Kira is eventually exposed by Josuke's group acting on Reimi's behalf and murders a man named {{nihongo|Kosaku Kawajiri|\u5ddd\u5c3b \u6d69\u4f5c}} while fleeing his pursuers, forcing Aya Tsuji into using her Stand and give him Kosaku's face and fingerprints before killing her off. Kira attempts concealing himself in the Kawajiri household while fighting his murderous urges, with Kawajiri's son Hayato eventually realizing the truth. Kira acquired a new ability when pierced by the Arrow called Bites the Dust which he implants in Hayato, placing the boy on a time-loop where anyone who learns of Kira's identity from the boy is killed with their death fixed. But Hayato exploits the time loop to trick Kira into exposing himself and cancel Bites the Dust to defend himself against Josuke, eventually killed off when run over by a speeding an ambulance and becoming a wandering spirit after being dragged off by the spectral hands of Ghost Alley. He makes a return appearance in the side-story ''Dead Man's Questions''.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Koichi Hirose}}|\u5e83\u702c \u5eb7\u4e00|Hirose K\u014dichi}}\n:A classmate of Josuke's who meets him when Jotaro is searching for Josuke, resulting in the two becoming quick friends. Koichi is a young freshman in high school, and despite his age, he is very short. Throughout the series, he forms a student-teacher relationship with Jotaro. When Koichi is stabbed by the Arrow from Keicho Nijimura, the Arrow did not choose him, which fatally wounded him. However, Josuke was able to heal Koichi before the Arrow killed him, awakening his Stand {{nihongo|Echoes|\u30a8\u30b3\u30fc\u30ba|Ek\u014dzu}},{{efn|\"Reverb\" in official English releases.}} which has three distinct forms, or ACTs, that he gains as he develops as a character. However, Koichi can only call upon one at any given time. Echoes ACT1 can replicate sound effects, such as a train alarm; he can attach these sound effects as written Kanji to anything, and if he attaches them to an opponent, he can overwhelm them with sound. Echoes ACT2 also writes out sound effects in Kanji, but rather than replicating the noise, it replicates the phenomenon that would create that sound effect (e.g. attaching the word \"whoosh\" causes a gust of wind to blow by, or \"sizzle\" will cause something to glow with heat). ACT1 & ACT2 are also long range, and Koichi can use either of them as a scout to find a specific target. Echoes ACT3 loses the former abilities and its long range, but gains the ability \"3 Freeze,\" which causes a target to become extremely heavy to the point that it is incapable of moving. ACT3 also shows its own sentience separate of Koichi, which is rare in Stands. It talks in a monotone voice, and frequently says vulgar phrases in English.\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Okuyasu Nijimura}}|\u8679\u6751 \u5104\u6cf0|Nijimura Okuyasu}}\n:The youngest of the two Nijimura brothers who are responsible for creating the majority of Stand users in Morioh via the Bow and Arrow. Okuyasu is overly dependent on his elder brother Keicho to make hard decisions. After his brother dies, he seeks revenge against the user of the Stand Red Hot Chili Pepper, Akira Otoishi, and becomes friends with Josuke and Koichi. Okuyasu's father is a bizarre creature, mutated by flesh bud made from DIO's cells when Okuyasu was only seven. At first, Okuyasu and Keicho plotted to kill their father to relieve him of his suffering, creating Stand users via the Bow and Arrow for this very purpose. His Stand is {{nihongo|The Hand|\u30b6\u30fb\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9|Za Hando}}, which erases whatever it swipes with its right hand. It can be used to erase space, drawing objects closer to Okuyasu or drawing Okuyasu himself closer to an object. Should he erase the middle of an object, the two remaining halves will snap together (demonstrated when he erases the middle of a sign, causing it to say something different with the middle portion gone). While this ability is quite useful and could be devastating in the right hands, Okuyasu himself is rather unintelligent, rarely using it to its full potential.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Rohan Kishibe}}|\u5cb8\u8fba \u9732\u4f34|Kishibe Rohan}}\n:An abrasive but well meaning [[mangaka]] who writes for ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]''.

It is revealed later that 15 years prior to the events of ''Diamond is Unbreakable'', Reimi was Rohan's babysitter. On the night Reimi was murdered by Yoshikage Kira, she sneaks the four year old Rohan out the window to save his life. This inspires him to help Jotaro and the others find and stop Yoshikage Kira.

Rohan is subject of multiple one-shot spinoffs such as ''[[Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan]]'' and ''Rohan at the Louvre''.\n\n===Part 5: ''Golden Wind''===\nSet in 2001 Italy, two years after the events of ''Diamond is Unbreakable''.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Giorno Giovanna}}|\u30b8\u30e7\u30eb\u30ce\u30fb\u30b8\u30e7\u30d0\u30a1\u30fc\u30ca|Joruno Job\u0101na|alternatively \"Giorno Giovana\"}}\n:The main protagonist of ''Golden Wind'', born {{nihongo|Haruno Shiobana|\u6c50\u83ef \u521d\u6d41\u4e43}}, Giorno is the illegitimate son of DIO Brando. However, because DIO's head was attached to the decapitated body of Jonathan Joestar at the time of Giorno's conception, he is technically a Joestar, Jonathan's biological son, and bears the Joestar birthmark. Bearing a similarity to both men in regard to personality, he is initially observed by Jotaro and Koichi in case he became a threat like DIO. Giorno dreams of becoming a \"Gang-Star\" (combining \"Gangster\" and \"Superstar\") in the Passione mob family. He is kind, caring, and calm, but he's also confident, brutal, and a cunning strategist. He aspires to overthrow Passione's Boss, to end the drug trade, and turn the gang into an organization which helps the people of Italy, much akin to Robin Hood. His Stand is named {{nihongo|Gold Experience|\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30da\u30ea\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9|G\u014drudo Ekusuperiensu}},{{efn|\"Golden Wind\" in official English releases.}} which has the ability to imbue things with life, which is mostly used to turn inorganic objects into living organisms. Later on, Giorno learns how to create body parts with Gold Experience, giving him the ability to heal himself and others. Giorno can also use Gold Experience to sense the lifeforce of others. When the stand arrow chooses Giorno, it becomes {{nihongo|Gold Experience Requiem|\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30da\u30ea\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u30fb\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0|G\u014drudo Ekusuperiensu Rekuiemu}},{{efn|\"Golden Wind Requiem\" in official English releases.}}, which has the ability to return any kind of process back to a state of \"zero\", nullifying any desired action.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Diavolo}}|\u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30dc\u30ed|Diaboro}}\n:The main antagonist of ''Golden Wind'' and dominant personality of {{nihongo|Vinegar Doppio|\u30f4\u30a3\u30cd\u30ac\u30fc\u30fb\u30c9\u30c3\u30d4\u30aa|Vineg\u0101 Doppio}}, speculated to have come about as a result of dissociative identity disorder. When he takes control of Doppio it is depicted in a similar manner to possession. The two are distinctive enough from each other that the two identities have separate souls. He is the father of Trish Una and the boss of Passione. He is obsessed with erasing any trace of his past to preserve the secret of his identity, and his appearance. He orders Bucciarati's team to protect his daughter and bring her to him so that he can murder her; he believes their link as genetic relatives could be used to track him, putting his anonymity in jeopardy. His Stand is {{nihongo|King Crimson|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30af\u30ea\u30e0\u30be\u30f3|Kingu Kurimuzon}},{{efn|\"Emperor Crimson\" in official English releases.}} which has the ability to erase the time in which an action will take place, altering what happened in between two intangible points, the effect of which is  a sudden time-skip covering up to ten seconds. Time flows normally for Diavolo in skipped time and he alone may interact with objects in erased time (visually represented as Diavolo and the object superimposed on each other, in a fashion akin to ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]''). For example, this stops Risotto Nero from killing Diavolo when he takes control of Aerosmith in a last ditch-effort to take Diavolo with him, since he uses the time skip to move out of the way of the hail of bullets. King Crimson has a secondary ability called {{nihongo|Epitaph|\u30a8\u30d4\u30bf\u30d5|Epitafu}}{{efn|\"Eulogy\" in official English releases.}} that exists as a second face on King Crimson's forehead and can be used to predict 10 seconds into the future.

For example, Sticky Fingers can place a zipper on a wall, unzip it, and then pass through the resulting opening. The zipper can also be used to take things or people apart, or even mismatch various objects, and he can use this ability on himself if necessary. Bucciarati grew up in a fishing village and after his parents divorced, he chose to live with his father. When he was twelve years old, his father was shot by drug dealers who had hired his boat and when they tried to kill him in the hospital, Bruno fatally stabbed them. He entered the world of the Passione mob for protection, but years later was horrified to discover that Passione was responsible for what happened to his father.

He soon learnt to work with the contradictions, and eventually accepted a bribe from someone who earned money by selling people's bodies to others, because he convinced him that the money was going to help the girl's father, sometime later a break-in was reported at an old man's house, and unsurprisingly it was the man who'd paid him said bribe, due to still believing in justice he was unable to bring himself to shoot the man, and as a result his partner leapt in front of a bullet fired at him by the thief, killing him. Labelled a dirty cop, he lost his job, and fell into a drunken depression, and lost hope of life. One night, Abbacchio returned to the place where it all went wrong, where he met Bucciarati, who recruited him to the gang.

Sex Pistols has no #4, due to the number 4 reminding Mista of the night he killed the gang members, by shooting four bullets.

Spanning several generations, the series is split into eight parts, each following a different descendant of the Joestar family. Parts 7 and 8 take place in a [[Fictional universe|separate continuity]] from the previous six. Many of the characters have supernatural abilities which give them a variety of unique traits.\n\n==Creation and conception==\n'''''Part 1: Phantom Blood'''''\n\nWhen first beginning the series, [[Dio Brando]] is the character that Araki looked forward to drawing the most. Inspired by [[FBI method of profiling|FBI profiling]] of serial killers and how they control their victims through psychological manipulation, he gave Dio a similar trait, using his charisma to ensure his followers do his bidding. Araki revealed that he had not thought up a weakness for the character and that it was difficult to come up with a way for Dio to be defeated.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Phantom Blood|volume=3|page=343|date=February 3, 2015|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-7881-1}}</ref> As the first Joestar, Araki created Jonathan to be \"a symbol of purity and dignity\", which he admitted might have resulted in him being \"boring.\" Jonathan's physical transformation during the seven year skip was done with his upcoming battle with Dio in mind and inspired by muscular film actors popular at the time, such as [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]]. A fan of karate manga as a child, Araki also wanted JoJo to exude an aura of strength like in ''[[Karate Baka Ichidai]]'', leading to the character learning the supernatural Hamon technique.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Phantom Blood|volume=1|page=249|date=September 2, 2014|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=978-1-4215-7879-8}}</ref> As Jonathan's teacher, Araki modeled Will A. Zeppeli after martial arts masters in [[Jackie Chan]] movies and [[Mr. Miyagi]] in ''[[The Karate Kid]]'', whose \"silly\" appearances hide their strength. Araki dressed him as a magician and modeled his mustache after those of [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and the character Iyami from ''[[Osomatsu-kun]]''. The Zeppeli name is derived from the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Phantom Blood|volume=2|page=323|date=November 4, 2014|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-7880-4}}</ref>\n\n'''''Part 2: Battle Tendency'''''\n\nBecause it was \"unprecedented\" to kill off the main character in a ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' manga, and wanting to shift from physical battles to more \"cerebral\" fights, Araki made Part 2's protagonist look very similar to Jonathan but with a more adventurous and confrontational personality. The author referred to Joseph as \"a muscle-bound B.T.\", the main character from his earlier series ''Cool Shock B.T.''; a ''[[sh\u014dnen manga]]'' hero who bends the rules as he fights.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Battle Tendency|volume=1|page=365|date=April 21, 2015|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-7882-8}}</ref> Having not been able to show a friendly rivalry between Jonathan and Dio, Araki introduced Caesar Zeppeli to present a more positive friendly rivalry between him and Joseph. Wanting each user to have a different type of Hamon with a unique design, he gave Caesar the seemingly fleeting-bubbles as a \"representation of his fate and the burden he is carrying.\" He enjoys giving characters weapons with faults and having them make up for it with strategy. The author stated that these \"spheres\" were inherited by both Gyro Zeppeli in ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' and Josuke Higashikata in ''[[JoJolion]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Battle Tendency|volume=3|page=[https://archive.org/details/jojosbizarreadve0000arak/page/265 265]|date=November 17, 2015|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-7884-2|url=https://archive.org/details/jojosbizarreadve0000arak/page/265}}</ref> Araki created the warrior-type Lisa Lisa, based on a neighborhood girl he knew as a child, to stand out compared to previous ''sh\u014dnen manga'' female characters who were typically cute and designed to be \"a man's ideal woman\". He stated that at the time it was hard to get Japanese readers to remember a foreign name, so he chose something with repetition.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Battle Tendency|volume=2|page=365|date=August 18, 2015|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-7883-5}}</ref> Having to surpass Dio, the Pillar Men's designs were based on [[Roman sculpture|Roman statues]], Egyptian [[sphinx]]es and Japanese ''[[nio]]'' statues to give them godlike features. Araki designed Kars with a turban to show his superior intelligence and that he is their king, his Brilliant Bone Blade ability harkening to Araki's earlier series ''[[Baoh]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Battle Tendency|volume=4|page=409|date=March 15, 2016|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-7885-9}}</ref>\n\n'''''Part 3: Stardust Crusaders'''''\n\nAlthough a Japanese protagonist, Araki modeled Jotaro after American actor [[Clint Eastwood]], including his poses and catchphrases. Although the author said the character might seem \"rough\" compared to other ''Jump'' protagonists, Jotaro fits his own image of a hero perfectly as a \"loner\" who does not do the right thing for attention. Araki said the character wearing his school uniform in the desert has its roots in [[Mitsuteru Yokoyama]]'s ''[[Babel II]]'', and that if he were to draw the part over again, he would base the Stands on ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=1|page=273|date=November 1, 2016|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9065-3}}</ref> Araki said he had a lot of readers asking him to bring older characters back. Although he is not a fan of bringing them back simply for nostalgia, he did not hesitate having Joseph return to save his daughter because it is completely true to the character. The author thought of having Joseph drop out partway through due to his age, but ended up \"playing it by ear\" as serialization continued.

Although they both wear school uniforms, Kakyoin's well-tailored one gives him the feel of an honor student, while Jotaro's loose-fitting one and accessories convey that he is a delinquent. He made him Jotaro's first real Stand opponent to visually convey the concepts between short-range and long-range Stand abilities. The author revealed that he always read the [[kanji]] for Kakyoin's given name as \"Tenmei,\" but his editor approved the reading Noriaki for the ''tank\u014dbon'' much to his surprise.<ref>{{cite book|author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=5|page=305|date=November 7, 2017|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9171-1}}</ref> In order to not have him overlap with Jotaro and Joseph, Polnareff was given a distinctive look and personality, which in turn made him shine on his own. Because he is a versatile character who could say goofy lines or serious ones, he \"needed\" to make more appearances. More appearances means more fights, and because he made it through so many life-or-death situations, Araki feels that Polnareff grew the most in the story. The author used foreign models as reference for his hair, and also drew it like Rudol von Stroheim's from ''Battle Tendency''. The character's name was inspired by those of Araki's three favorite French people, actors [[Alain Delon]] and [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], and musician [[Michel Polnareff]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=9|page=390 |date=November 6, 2018|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9175-9}}</ref> Not having any limitations on what he can put in the series, Araki has animals appear and even had one join the Joestar party. Although he feels that The Fool is a perfect fit for Iggy, it just happened to be the last tarot card for him to assign aside from The World. Additionally, he thought of assigning The Fool to an enemy instead, but things just \"ended up working out the way they did.\" Being the first time he made an animal a major character and the first time he showed one in battle, Araki used [[Yoshihiro Takahashi]]'s ''[[Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin]]'' as a reference.<ref>{{cite book|author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=8|page=231|date=August 7, 2018|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9174-2}}</ref>\n\nWith the series meant to be long-running, Araki took great care in deciding which unique Stand user to put the main cast against and when, in order to keep readers interested. He designed Strength, Ebony Devil, and Yellow Temperance so that their appearances and abilities did not overlap. But as these were all one-on-one battles, he then decided to introduce Hol Horse and J. Geil as a team. He had always planned on having Noriaki Kakyoin and Jean Pierre Polnareff switch allegiances to the good guys, but not Hol Horse. Although he drew a color illustration with Hol Horse alongside the Joestar group and had the character return several times through the story, he suspects he did not go through with it because his personality overlaps with Polnareff's. He also said that because he did not put many limitations on Hol Horse's Stand, it kind of got out of control, plus it overlaps with Kakyoin's Emerald Splash. He did enjoy Hol Horse's \"why be number one when you can be number two\" philosophy, which the author carried over to Yoshikage Kira in ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'', and his outlaw appearance is similar to that of Gyro Zeppeli from ''Steel Ball Run'' and might have been inspired by [[Buichi Terasawa]]'s ''[[Cobra (manga)|Cobra]]''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 3 Stardust Crusaders|volume=3|page=287|date=May 2, 2017|publisher=Viz Media|isbn=978-1-4215-9169-8}}</ref>\n\n'''''Part 4: Diamond Is Unbreakable'''''\n\nWith Part 4, Araki said that he moved away from \"muscle men\" as they fell out of popularity with his readers and he wanted to focus more on fashion.

In Parts 1\u20136, the Joestar bloodline was inherited by the {{nihongo|Kujo Family|\u7a7a\u6761\u5bb6|K\u016bj\u014d Ke}} and Josuke Higashikata. Dio, having stolen Jonathan's body at the end of Part 1, fathered a few sons bearing the Joestar bloodline while awakening use of Stands in Jonathan's descendants. In the alternate universe depicted in Parts 7 and 8, Johnny Joestar marries Rina Higashikata with the Higashikata Family becoming a distant branch of the Joestar family.\n\n===Part 1: ''Phantom Blood''===\nSet in England in the 1880s, the Joestar family adopts the orphaned Dio Brando.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Jonathan Joestar}}|\u30b8\u30e7\u30ca\u30b5\u30f3\u30fb\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Jonasan J\u014dsut\u0101}}\n:The main protagonist of ''Phantom Blood'', Jonathan is the son of George Joestar who carries his surname with pride while striving to be a gentleman who never betrays his code of honor and defending those in need even when at a grave disadvantage. Jonathan's life becomes one of misery when Dio Brando enters the household, eventually resulting in his father's death as Dio becomes a vampire. This motivates Jonathan to learn how to utilize Hamon energy from Will A. Zeppeli to settle the score with Dio, with his power later increasing drastically when a dying Zeppeli transfers his remaining Hamon into him.\n\n:Though Jonathan defeats Dio and marries his childhood sweetheart, Erina Pendleton, who bears his son George Joestar II, he is nevertheless fatally wounded by Dio's severed head during an attempt to take his body. Jonathan ultimately dies of his injuries, but not before further injuring the already severely weakened Dio and using his Hamon to cause an explosion on the ship that they and Erina are traveling aboard, with Jonathan successfully persuading Erina to escape alongside [[#Lisa Lisa|an infant]] orphaned by Dio's zombies by using Dio's coffin as a makeshift lifeboat.\n\n:Despite his death, Jonathan nevertheless has an influence throughout almost the entirety of the series thereafter; this is most noticeable in ''Stardust Crusaders'', where it is revealed that Dio managed to remove Jonathan's head and gain his body as his own. Upon his return, Dio's awakens his Stand, although doing so directly awakened one within Jonathan's body and indirectly awakened Stands within Jonathan's descendants, which in turn sets the plot of the part in motion. However, Jonathan's final effort was not in vain, as it weakened Dio to the point of him requiring blood from a Joestar descendant in order to both fully fuse with Jonathan's body and gain proper control of his respective Stand.\n\n:In addition to ''Stardust Crusaders'', Jonathan's influence is present, yet very subtle, in three other parts of the series. In ''Battle Tendency'', his significantly potent Hamon results in his grandson [[#Joseph Joestar|Joseph]] not only inheriting the ability to use Hamon, but also having an inherent aptitude for it. The orphan that Jonathan requested Erina to rescue is also revealed to be Elizabeth \"Lisa Lisa\" Joestar, who became the wife of his deceased son George II, the mother of Joseph, and an expert in Hamon. In ''Vento Aureo'', it is revealed that Jonathan is the biological father of the part's protagonist, [[#Giorno Giovanna|Giorno Giovanna]], due to DIO's impregnation of a Japanese woman some time after his return. In ''Stone Ocean'', three antagonistic Stand users (Donatello Versus, Rikiel, and Ungalo) are revealed to also be Jonathan's biological sons, albeit with personalities that are based on specific facets of DIO's personality and lack any influence from Jonathan's personality. In addition, one of Jonathan's bones is an integral fail-safe for DIO's desire of \"achieving Heaven\".\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Dio Brando}}|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc|Dio Burand\u014d}}\n{{Main|Dio Brando}}\n:The principal antagonist of the series, Dio is the son of the poor Dario Brando.

Later, he gets brought back to the Joestar Estate and narrowly escapes the flames. As Wang Chan searches for the Stone Mask in the rubble, Dio emerges and turns him into his zombie servant. He serves loyally, and after Dio's penultimate defeat, he takes his master's head on board the ship carrying Jonathan and Erina. Despite his efforts and Jonathan being mortally wounded by Dio, Wang Chan is killed by Jonathan, who uses Hamon to destroy his head and subsequently control his corpse in order to sabotage the engine of the ship and ensure its destruction with Dio and the other zombies on board.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Robert E.

Zeppeli was on a ship with a crew studying Aztec ruins as a young man, when his father put on the Stone Mask and killed everyone in the crew but his son. After this horrific event, Will travels the world in order to destroy the mask, and sees a man cure someone using Hamon. Will is then directed to his master, Tonpetty, who teaches him to use Hamon. However, Tonpetty foresees Will's death during his training, warning him that should he complete his training he will surely die. He trains Jonathan in Hamon after the Joestar's house burns down and joins him to destroy Dio and the mask.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Straizo}}|\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30c4\u30a9|Sutoreitso}}\n:Straizo is a Hamon user who first appears as one of Tonpetty's pupils, aiding Jonathan in the fight against Dio. However, in the 1930s during ''Battle Tendency'' where he succeeded his mentor, Straizo admitted his desire for youth and envied Dio. This motivated him into betraying Speedwagon and using one of the newly discovered Stone Masks to become a vampire. Straizo makes an attempt on Joseph's life and is defeated on the Brooklyn Bridge, destroying himself with the Hamon he stored in his body prior to becoming a vampire. He is also the adoptive father of Lisa Lisa.\n\n=== Part 2: ''Battle Tendency'' ===\nSet in 1938, 49 years after the events of ''Phantom Blood''.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Joseph Joestar}}|\u30b8\u30e7\u30bb\u30d5\u30fb\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Josefu J\u014dsut\u0101}}\n:Joseph is the main protagonist of ''Battle Tendency'' and the grandson of Jonathan Joestar. Having been brought up by his grandmother Erina and Speedwagon, he developed a coarser and more rebellious attitude than that of his gentlemanly grandfather, but he still has a noble heart. While able to use Hamon like his grandfather, Joseph is not initially as skilled in its use until he trains under Lisa Lisa. He initially uses a pair of Hamon-empowered [[clackers]] in battle, but relies more on mind games rather than brute strength in fights, employing his uncanny ability to predict his opponent's actions down to what they say. He returns as a main character in ''Stardust Crusaders''.

Stroheim is responsible for not only saving the life of Speedwagon, though only for intel on the Stone Mask for his government, but also helping Joseph defeat Santana by blowing himself up. He returns later as a [[cyborg]] to assist in the fight against Kars, upgrading himself with ultraviolet lamps. After providing Joseph with his artificial hand prior to [[World War II]], Stroheim dies in 1943 on the front-line during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].\n \n;{{nihongo4|{{visible anchor|Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli}}|\u30b7\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u30cb\u30aa\u30fb\u30c4\u30a7\u30da\u30ea|Sh\u012bz\u0101 Antonio Tseperi}}\n:A suave ladies' man and the grandson of Will A. Zeppeli. He is rather cool and collected, especially compared to Joseph, with whom he is grudgingly paired to fight the Pillar Men.

He infuses the Hamon into soap bubbles he creates with his specially-made gloves.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Pillar Men}}|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}\n: The Pillar Men are the main antagonists of ''Battle Tendency'', the last four members of an ancient race of humanoids encased in pillars whose extraordinary strength, intelligence, and lifespan made them revered as gods and demons. But Kars, motivated by his race's true potential, wiped out his people when they opposed him for endangering the world with the Stone Mask. Despite their apathy to humans and Kars's conduct, the other Pillar Men are chivalrous warriors who battle Hamon users in fair fights. Each has total control over their body, able to transform it to suit their needs while able to digest non-Hamon users via physical contact, Kars, Esidisi, and Wamuu having honed unique specialties called {{nihongo|Modes|{{ruby-ja|\u6d41\u6cd5|\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9}}|M\u014ddo}} to combat Hamon users.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Santana}}|\u30b5\u30f3\u30bf\u30ca|Santana}}\n:Santana is discovered in a Mexican pyramid in 1938 by Straizo's Speedwagon Foundation team and then taken by the [[Nazi]] forces under Stroheim for live human experiments to see if he can be used to power the German army, even using a Stone Mask vampire on him to see how much more powerful he is. Santana escapes, as he can contort his body to escape through a ventilation shaft, and shows he has mastered human language and the mechanisms of the Germans' weaponry when he manages to withstand their attacks. Joseph and Stroheim manage to stop him by escaping to the outside, as Joseph traps him in a well at high noon, turning him back to stone. His remains are taken to a Speedwagon Foundation laboratory while permanently exposed to ultraviolet lamps to trap him.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Esidisi}}|\u30a8\u30b7\u30c7\u30a3\u30b7|Eshidishi}}\n:Esidisi has an erratic temper, quick to sob uncontrollably and just as quick to calm himself down.

Esidisi's search for the Super Aja leads him to Venice, where he faces Joseph after murdering Loggins. Claiming to have intimate knowledge of ''[[The Art of War]]'' as he was in China during the lifetime of [[Sun Tzu]], Esidisi matches Joseph's own quick wits in a battle of deception. But Joseph takes advantage of Esidisi's lack of knowledge of [[sleight of hand]] to defeat him with a Hamon attack via a [[cut and restore rope trick]], destroying Esidisi's body. Esidisi survives, but is reduced to a disembodied nervous system, possessing the body of Suzi Q to get her to mail the Super Aja to Kars and then plans to destroy her from the inside with her heated blood killing the Hamon users. However, Joseph and Caesar's contrasting Hamon abilities force Esidisi out of Suzi Q's body, which results in the weakened Pillar Man's permanent death when exposed to the sunlight.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Wamuu}}|\u30ef\u30e0\u30a6|Wam\u016b}}\n:Wamuu is Esidisi and Kars' loyal servant, who is a strong and honorable warrior, but reflexively attacks anyone who steps on his own shadow.

He spares Joseph's life after the young man wounds him, allowing him a month's reprieve to master Hamon while placing a poison ring in the human's heart as added incentive while revealing the antidote in his lip piercing. His next fight is against Caesar, who manages to hold his own, but cannot defeat Wamuu's Wind Mode. He fatally wounds Caesar, allowing the dying man to obtain the antidote out of respect for the human's valiant effort. Wamuu later faces off against Joseph in a deadly chariot race, blinding himself to regain a psychological advantage over his opponent, before he is defeated by Joseph's wits and Hamon mastery. As Wamuu's disembodied head lays dying, Joseph eases the Pillar Man's passing by giving him drops of his own blood. Wamuu returns the favor by killing off a horde of vampires that attempts to kill Joseph in revenge, asking Joseph to take the antidote to give him peace of mind while expressing gratitude for facing such a worthy opponent.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kars}}|\u30ab\u30fc\u30ba|K\u0101zu}}\n:Kars is the leader of the Pillar Men and the creator of the Stone Masks.

Unlike his subordinates, Kars has no honor whatsoever and intends to fulfill his goals by any means. Kars finally succeeds in getting the stone by deceiving Lisa Lisa during their match with a vampire decoy and then tricking the Nazis into exposing him to ultraviolet rays while wearing the Aja-embedded stone mask. Once evolved, now immune to sunlight and able to tap into his own [[Atavism|genetic structure]], Kars can produce animal-like extensions of himself, undergo reactive evolutionary mutations, and utilize Hamon. In the end, Kars is defeated as a result of his own hubris, using a Hamon attack on Joseph, who uses the Super Aja to intercept the attack, in a volcano. The resulting eruption blasts Kars into the vacuum of space, causing his immortal body to freeze solid before his mind shuts down.\n\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Lisa Lisa}}|\u30ea\u30b5\u30ea\u30b5|Risa Risa}}\n:A mysterious female Hamon master and Caesar's Hamon teacher who lives in Venice, Lisa Lisa is one of the few remaining Hamon users and keeper of the Super Aja, a perfectly cut Red Stone of Aja which she guards from the Pillar Men.

She develops a crush on Joseph after seeing his face without a special Hamon training mask on for the first time. She is possessed by a disembodied Esidisi and is forced to send the Super Aja to the Pillar Man's allies and then attack the others before Caesar and Joseph manage to use Hamon to force the Pillar Man out of her body without endangering her life. She nurses Joseph back to health after his battle with Kars, and then becomes his wife in the end of ''Battle Tendency'', but forgets to let everyone else know that Joseph survived his battle with Kars.

Kira attempts concealing himself in the Kawajiri household while fighting his murderous urges, with Kawajiri's son Hayato eventually realizing the truth. Kira acquired a new ability when pierced by the Arrow called Bites the Dust which he implants in Hayato, placing the boy on a time-loop where anyone who learns of Kira's identity from the boy is killed with their death fixed. But Hayato exploits the time loop to trick Kira into exposing himself and cancel Bites the Dust to defend himself against Josuke, eventually killed off when run over by a speeding an ambulance and becoming a wandering spirit after being dragged off by the spectral hands of Ghost Alley.

Koichi is a young freshman in high school, and despite his age, he is very short. Throughout the series, he forms a student-teacher relationship with Jotaro. When Koichi is stabbed by the Arrow from Keicho Nijimura, the Arrow did not choose him, which fatally wounded him.

However, Koichi can only call upon one at any given time. Echoes ACT1 can replicate sound effects, such as a train alarm; he can attach these sound effects as written Kanji to anything, and if he attaches them to an opponent, he can overwhelm them with sound. Echoes ACT2 also writes out sound effects in Kanji, but rather than replicating the noise, it replicates the phenomenon that would create that sound effect (e.g. attaching the word \"whoosh\" causes a gust of wind to blow by, or \"sizzle\" will cause something to glow with heat). ACT1 & ACT2 are also long range, and Koichi can use either of them as a scout to find a specific target. Echoes ACT3 loses the former abilities and its long range, but gains the ability \"3 Freeze,\" which causes a target to become extremely heavy to the point that it is incapable of moving. ACT3 also shows its own sentience separate of Koichi, which is rare in Stands. It talks in a monotone voice, and frequently says vulgar phrases in English.\n;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Okuyasu Nijimura}}|\u8679\u6751 \u5104\u6cf0|Nijimura Okuyasu}}\n:The youngest of the two Nijimura brothers who are responsible for creating the majority of Stand users in Morioh via the Bow and Arrow. Okuyasu is overly dependent on his elder brother Keicho to make hard decisions. After his brother dies, he seeks revenge against the user of the Stand Red Hot Chili Pepper, Akira Otoishi, and becomes friends with Josuke and Koichi. Okuyasu's father is a bizarre creature, mutated by flesh bud made from DIO's cells when Okuyasu was only seven. At first, Okuyasu and Keicho plotted to kill their father to relieve him of his suffering, creating Stand users via the Bow and Arrow for this very purpose. His Stand is {{nihongo|The Hand|\u30b6\u30fb\u30cf\u30f3\u30c9|Za Hando}}, which erases whatever it swipes with its right hand. It can be used to erase space, drawing objects closer to Okuyasu or drawing Okuyasu himself closer to an object. Should he erase the middle of an object, the two remaining halves will snap together (demonstrated when he erases the middle of a sign, causing it to say something different with the middle portion gone). While this ability is quite useful and could be devastating in the right hands, Okuyasu himself is rather unintelligent, rarely using it to its full potential.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Rohan Kishibe}}|\u5cb8\u8fba \u9732\u4f34|Kishibe Rohan}}\n:An abrasive but well meaning [[mangaka]] who writes for ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]''.

However, because DIO's head was attached to the decapitated body of Jonathan Joestar at the time of Giorno's conception, he is technically a Joestar, Jonathan's biological son, and bears the Joestar birthmark. Bearing a similarity to both men in regard to personality, he is initially observed by Jotaro and Koichi in case he became a threat like DIO. Giorno dreams of becoming a \"Gang-Star\" (combining \"Gangster\" and \"Superstar\") in the Passione mob family. He is kind, caring, and calm, but he's also confident, brutal, and a cunning strategist. He aspires to overthrow Passione's Boss, to end the drug trade, and turn the gang into an organization which helps the people of Italy, much akin to Robin Hood.

When he takes control of Doppio it is depicted in a similar manner to possession. The two are distinctive enough from each other that the two identities have separate souls. He is the father of Trish Una and the boss of Passione. He is obsessed with erasing any trace of his past to preserve the secret of his identity, and his appearance. He orders Bucciarati's team to protect his daughter and bring her to him so that he can murder her; he believes their link as genetic relatives could be used to track him, putting his anonymity in jeopardy.

Time flows normally for Diavolo in skipped time and he alone may interact with objects in erased time (visually represented as Diavolo and the object superimposed on each other, in a fashion akin to ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2]]''). For example, this stops Risotto Nero from killing Diavolo when he takes control of Aerosmith in a last ditch-effort to take Diavolo with him, since he uses the time skip to move out of the way of the hail of bullets. King Crimson has a secondary ability called {{nihongo|Epitaph|\u30a8\u30d4\u30bf\u30d5|Epitafu}}{{efn|\"Eulogy\" in official English releases.}} that exists as a second face on King Crimson's forehead and can be used to predict 10 seconds into the future.

For example, Sticky Fingers can place a zipper on a wall, unzip it, and then pass through the resulting opening. The zipper can also be used to take things or people apart, or even mismatch various objects, and he can use this ability on himself if necessary. Bucciarati grew up in a fishing village and after his parents divorced, he chose to live with his father. When he was twelve years old, his father was shot by drug dealers who had hired his boat and when they tried to kill him in the hospital, Bruno fatally stabbed them. He entered the world of the Passione mob for protection, but years later was horrified to discover that Passione was responsible for what happened to his father.

He soon learnt to work with the contradictions, and eventually accepted a bribe from someone who earned money by selling people's bodies to others, because he convinced him that the money was going to help the girl's father, sometime later a break-in was reported at an old man's house, and unsurprisingly it was the man who'd paid him said bribe, due to still believing in justice he was unable to bring himself to shoot the man, and as a result his partner leapt in front of a bullet fired at him by the thief, killing him.

Somehow through the will of destiny, all of the bullets fired at him had missed, and Mista fired back four shots with pin-point accuracy whilst under fire.

Once this happens, the virus will spread and rapidly devour organic matter\u2014a human body will be annihilated in about 30 seconds. However, the virus is destroyed by sunlight.

He is well known for selling Babe Ruth to the [[New York Yankees]], which started the [[Curse of the Bambino]].\n\n== Early life==\nHarry Frazee was born June 29, 1880, in [[Peoria, Illinois]], son of William and Margaret Frazee. He attended [[Peoria High School (Peoria, Illinois)|Peoria High School]], where he was a baseball teammate of [[Harry Bay]], who later played for Major League Baseball teams in Cincinnati and Cleveland. At 16, Frazee became assistant manager of the Peoria Theater. Within a year, he was player-coach of the [[Peoria Distillers]] semi-pro baseball club. As his theatrical endeavors continued, Frazee moved to [[Chicago]], where he built the Cort Theater in 1907.\n\nAfter several successful shows, Frazee went to [[New York City]], where in 1913 he built the [[Longacre Theatre]] on West 48th Street and staged hit plays such as ''[[Fine Feathers (play)|Fine Feathers]]'' by [[Eugene Walter (playwright)|Eugene Walter]] and the musical ''[[Adele (musical)|Adele]]''. He also promoted a boxing match between [[Jess Willard]] and [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] on April 5, 1915 in [[Havana, Cuba]] and was reported by then to be a millionaire.\n\n== Life as owner of the Red Sox ==\n\nFrazee bought the [[Boston Red Sox]] baseball team from [[Joseph Lannin]] for a reported $675,000 after their victory in the [[1916 World Series]]. The Sox won another [[World Series]] title in [[1918 World Series|1918]]. The team finished sixth in 1919, and after the 1919 season Frazee started selling players to the [[New York Yankees]], most notoriously [[Babe Ruth]]. Then he left the Red Sox in bankruptcy while continuing to make theatre productions. After the sale of Ruth, the team crashed into the American League cellar and did not finish above .500 until 1934. The Red Sox did not win another pennant until {{Baseball year|1946}}, and did not win another World Series until [[2004 World Series|2004]], the third longest drought in MLB history.\n\nFrazee backed a number of New York theatrical productions (before and after Ruth's sale), the best-known of which is probably ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', which was once claimed, and later debunked, as the specific play that Ruth's sale financed (it was actually what paid off the Fenway Park mortgage that the Ruth sale included). He was the subject of an unflattering portrait in [[Fred Lieb]]'s account of the Red Sox, which further insinuated that he had sold Ruth to finance a [[Broadway musical]]. This became a central element in the [[Curse of the Bambino]].\n\nThe truth is more nuanced and has as much to do with a long-running dispute between Frazee and American League founder and president [[Ban Johnson]] as it does with Frazee's finances. Frazee was the first American League owner who hadn't been essentially hand-picked by Johnson, and wasn't willing to simply do Johnson's bidding. Although they seemed to settle their differences when Frazee hired [[Ed Barrow]], a friend of Johnson's, as manager, things heated up again when Frazee loudly criticized Johnson's handling of the issues brought about by the [[American entry into World War I|United States entering World War I]]. In response, Johnson began actively campaigning to yank the Red Sox from under Frazee.<ref name=SABR>Levitt, Dan; Armour, Mark; Levitt, Matthew. [http://sabr.org/bioproj/harry-frazee-and-the-red-sox Harry Frazee and the Boston Red Sox]. [[Society for American Baseball Research]], 2008.</ref>\n\nThe dispute finally boiled over in the summer of 1919 when pitcher [[Carl Mays]] jumped the team. Johnson ordered him suspended, but Frazee instead sold him to the then-moribund Yankees. Johnson had promised Yankee owners [[Jacob Ruppert]] and [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston|Cap Huston]] to get them better players, but never followed through. The Mays flap divided the American League into two factions\u2014the Yankees, Red Sox and [[Chicago White Sox]] on one side and the other five clubs, known as the \"Loyal Five\", on the other.<ref name=Stout/>\n\nUnder the circumstances, when Frazee finally lost patience with Ruth (see below), his options were severely limited. Under pressure from Johnson, the Loyal Five rejected Frazee's overtures almost out of hand. In effect, Johnson limited Frazee to dealing with either the White Sox or the Yankees. The White Sox offered [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|Joe Jackson]] and $60,000, but the Yankees offered an all-cash deal: $25,000 up front and three [[promissory note]]s of $25,000 each, plus a $300,000 loan to be secured by a mortgage on [[Fenway Park]]. With the note from Lannin that he'd used in part to finance his purchase of the Red Sox having come due in November 1919, Frazee had little choice but to take the Yankees' offer. Ruth officially became the property of the Yankees on January 5, 1920.<ref name=SABR/><ref name=Stout/>\n\n==Fenway Park==\nThe Ruth sale cemented the Red Sox\u2013Yankees alliance, and shifted the relationship from [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|their historically bitter rivalry]]. A few months later, the two teams drew even closer together in a dispute over [[Fenway Park]].\n\nWhen Frazee bought the Red Sox, Fenway Park was not part of the deal. Instead, he rented it for $30,000 per year from the Fenway Realty Trust. A majority of the trust's stock was controlled by the Taylor family, publishers of the ''[[Boston Globe]]''. The Taylor family had owned the Red Sox from 1904 to 1911 and built Fenway in the first place. They still held a small ownership interest. This put Frazee in a very difficult spot. If Johnson ever revoked the franchise, it would be relatively easy for a new owner to get a lease for the park. In August 1919, Frazee began negotiations to buy out the shares in the trust held by Lannin and the Taylors. In this way, if Johnson ever yanked the franchise out from under Frazee, any prospective owner of a Boston American League team  would risk being left without a place to play.\n\nHowever, Frazee had stopped paying installments because of a dispute over who owed Boston's share of MLB's settlement with the [[Federal League]]. In the spring of 1920, Lannin finally made good on a threat to slap a lien on the Red Sox. Since the lien barred Frazee from trading players or buying Fenway without Lannin's permission, Lannin effectively controlled the team. Lannin also threatened to sell his interest in the Fenway Realty Trust, which would have opened the door for a new owner to buy into the park if Frazee lost the franchise. Eventually, Lannin and Frazee reached a settlement. Lannin agreed to pay the Federal League bill and would not oppose Frazee's purchase of Fenway. In return, Frazee resumed payments. On May 3, Frazee and Taylor signed a deal to pay off the existing mortgage and make Frazee sole owner of Fenway Park.\n\nAs an additional security measure, Frazee secured a $300,000 loan from the Yankees and used a second mortgage on Fenway as collateral.\n\n==Other deals with the Yankees==\nFrazee had every intention of using the money from the Ruth deal to get better players. However, his theater interests had not done particularly well since 1918, and he found it difficult to service the debt on both Fenway Park and the Red Sox. His cash shorts became even more acute after the remortgage of Fenway Park. He was thus forced to put the team's best players on the market in order to get cash.<ref name=SABR/>  Unfortunately, he found it difficult to make deals with the \"Loyal Five\" even after Ruth left for New York. With the White Sox' reputation in tatters following the [[Black Sox Scandal]], Frazee was left with little choice but to deal with the Yankees.<ref name=Stout>Stout, Glenn.

The ''Encyclopedia'' lists about 40 trades in all made by the Red Sox in those years, including to teams ''other than'' the Yankees.\n\nIt has been argued that the deals with the Yankees made a modicum of sense at the time, and only a stroke of bad luck turned them into Yankee heists. Notably, the players sent to Boston suffered a rash of injuries<ref name=Stout/>  However, this is belied by the fact that Barrow became general manager of the Yankees in 1921. He'd managed nearly all of the players who came to New York in these deals, and was almost certainly aware of who he was getting.<ref name=SABR/>\n\n==Sale of Red Sox==\nIn 1921, an article ''[[Dearborn Independent]]'' claimed that Frazee was one of many Jews who had ruined baseball. Although Frazee was not Jewish, the article played up longstanding stereotypes about Broadway impresarios. Frazee was unable to respond, since at the time it was published he was not only dealing with a divorce, but the death of his father. The article wrecked any chance Frazee had of rehabilitating himself. Although he was forced to sell to a syndicate of Midwestern businessmen fronted by Johnson crony [[Bob Quinn (baseball)|Bob Quinn]], he held out for $1.2 million\u2014nearly double what he paid for the team in 1916. The Red Sox had some of their worst seasons ever under Quinn's ownership after one of his principal investors died.<ref name=Stout/>\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:1 Harry Frazee 800.jpg|thumb|300px|Harry Frazee's grave in [[Kensico Cemetery]]]] In 1929, Harry Frazee died of kidney failure in his [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] home with his wife and son at his side. He is interred at [[Kensico Cemetery]]. [[Lou Gehrig]] and [[Ed Barrow]] are also interred at Kensico.\n\n==''The Top 5 Reasons You Can't Blame...''==\nIn 2005, [[ESPN Classic]] aired an episode in ''[[The Top 5 Reasons You Can't Blame...]]'' series in which it examined the sale, and explained why Frazee cannot be held as the [[scapegoat]]:\n* 5. World War I: With rosters depleted because of the war, Ruth saw action as both a pitcher and outfielder; the latter made him the [[home run]] hitter he would become. After the players returned, Ruth became bigger than the team because his home runs were the talk of baseball and he no longer wanted to pitch.\n* 4. [[Ban Johnson]]: The president of the [[American League]] since its debut in [[1901 in baseball|1901]] effectively limited Frazee to the Yankees and White Sox as the only teams with whom Frazee could make a deal by pressuring the other five teams (the [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Detroit Tigers]], [[Philadelphia Athletics]], [[St. Louis Browns]] and [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]]) not to make any trades at all with Frazee.\n* 3. Babe Ruth's antics: He often spent evenings out in bars and was often drunk only hours before games. He also jumped the team several times, the final straw being in the final game of the [[1919 in baseball|1919]] season.\n[[File:Harry H. Frazee Inscription 2011C.jpg|thumb|The inscription on Harry Frazee's tomb]]\n* 2. [[Ed Barrow]]: Frazee's right-hand man, Barrow served as general manager and field manager. Like Frazee, Barrow also knew how much of a troublemaker Ruth was. When Frazee wanted to send Ruth to the Yankees, Barrow, for reasons unknown, said the Yankees didn't have any players he wanted. In a bizarre twist of fate, Barrow left the Red Sox after the 1920 season to become general manager of none other than the Yankees and built the team to World Champions by [[1923 in baseball|1923]] by acquiring as many as seven players from the Red Sox (four of whom had won the World Series in Boston in [[1918 in baseball|1918]]).\n* 1. Babe Ruth's holdout: Ruth forced Frazee's hand by holding out after the [[1919 in baseball|1919]] season, demanding $20,000 per year\u2014twice as much as he had been making during the season. During the holdout, he planned other ventures, such as becoming a [[boxing|boxer]] and going into acting. Frazee was upset over the holdout because he had given Ruth bonuses after both the [[1918 in baseball|1918]] and 1919 seasons. Finally, with Ruth's demands so high and after several occasions in which Ruth had already jumped the team, Frazee felt he had no choice but to ship Ruth out.\n\nAn \"honorable mention\" was [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]]. Frazee wanted to trade Ruth to the White Sox for Jackson, but the [[Black Sox Scandal]] scuttled those plans.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Curse of the Bambino]]\n*[[Longacre Theatre]]\n*''[[No, No, Nanette]]''\n*''[[A Pair of Sixes]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/playoffs2004/news/story?page=Curse041005 A \"Curse\" born of hate], by Glenn Stout, discussing and criticizing the various attacks against Frazee.\n*{{IBDB name}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Joseph Lannin]]}} \n{{s-ttl|title=Owner of the [[Boston Red Sox]]|years=November 2, 1916 \u2013 August 2, 1923}} \n{{s-aft|after=[[Bob Quinn (baseball)|J.

He is well known for selling Babe Ruth to the [[New York Yankees]], which started the [[Curse of the Bambino]].\n\n== Early life==\nHarry Frazee was born June 29, 1880, in [[Peoria, Illinois]], son of William and Margaret Frazee. He attended [[Peoria High School (Peoria, Illinois)|Peoria High School]], where he was a baseball teammate of [[Harry Bay]], who later played for Major League Baseball teams in Cincinnati and Cleveland. At 16, Frazee became assistant manager of the Peoria Theater. Within a year, he was player-coach of the [[Peoria Distillers]] semi-pro baseball club. As his theatrical endeavors continued, Frazee moved to [[Chicago]], where he built the Cort Theater in 1907.\n\nAfter several successful shows, Frazee went to [[New York City]], where in 1913 he built the [[Longacre Theatre]] on West 48th Street and staged hit plays such as ''[[Fine Feathers (play)|Fine Feathers]]'' by [[Eugene Walter (playwright)|Eugene Walter]] and the musical ''[[Adele (musical)|Adele]]''. He also promoted a boxing match between [[Jess Willard]] and [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] on April 5, 1915 in [[Havana, Cuba]] and was reported by then to be a millionaire.\n\n== Life as owner of the Red Sox ==\n\nFrazee bought the [[Boston Red Sox]] baseball team from [[Joseph Lannin]] for a reported $675,000 after their victory in the [[1916 World Series]]. The Sox won another [[World Series]] title in [[1918 World Series|1918]]. The team finished sixth in 1919, and after the 1919 season Frazee started selling players to the [[New York Yankees]], most notoriously [[Babe Ruth]]. Then he left the Red Sox in bankruptcy while continuing to make theatre productions. After the sale of Ruth, the team crashed into the American League cellar and did not finish above .500 until 1934. The Red Sox did not win another pennant until {{Baseball year|1946}}, and did not win another World Series until [[2004 World Series|2004]], the third longest drought in MLB history.\n\nFrazee backed a number of New York theatrical productions (before and after Ruth's sale), the best-known of which is probably ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', which was once claimed, and later debunked, as the specific play that Ruth's sale financed (it was actually what paid off the Fenway Park mortgage that the Ruth sale included). He was the subject of an unflattering portrait in [[Fred Lieb]]'s account of the Red Sox, which further insinuated that he had sold Ruth to finance a [[Broadway musical]]. This became a central element in the [[Curse of the Bambino]].\n\nThe truth is more nuanced and has as much to do with a long-running dispute between Frazee and American League founder and president [[Ban Johnson]] as it does with Frazee's finances. Frazee was the first American League owner who hadn't been essentially hand-picked by Johnson, and wasn't willing to simply do Johnson's bidding. Although they seemed to settle their differences when Frazee hired [[Ed Barrow]], a friend of Johnson's, as manager, things heated up again when Frazee loudly criticized Johnson's handling of the issues brought about by the [[American entry into World War I|United States entering World War I]]. In response, Johnson began actively campaigning to yank the Red Sox from under Frazee.<ref name=SABR>Levitt, Dan; Armour, Mark; Levitt, Matthew. [http://sabr.org/bioproj/harry-frazee-and-the-red-sox Harry Frazee and the Boston Red Sox]. [[Society for American Baseball Research]], 2008.</ref>\n\nThe dispute finally boiled over in the summer of 1919 when pitcher [[Carl Mays]] jumped the team. Johnson ordered him suspended, but Frazee instead sold him to the then-moribund Yankees. Johnson had promised Yankee owners [[Jacob Ruppert]] and [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston|Cap Huston]] to get them better players, but never followed through. The Mays flap divided the American League into two factions\u2014the Yankees, Red Sox and [[Chicago White Sox]] on one side and the other five clubs, known as the \"Loyal Five\", on the other.<ref name=Stout/>\n\nUnder the circumstances, when Frazee finally lost patience with Ruth (see below), his options were severely limited. Under pressure from Johnson, the Loyal Five rejected Frazee's overtures almost out of hand. In effect, Johnson limited Frazee to dealing with either the White Sox or the Yankees. The White Sox offered [[Shoeless Joe Jackson|Joe Jackson]] and $60,000, but the Yankees offered an all-cash deal: $25,000 up front and three [[promissory note]]s of $25,000 each, plus a $300,000 loan to be secured by a mortgage on [[Fenway Park]]. With the note from Lannin that he'd used in part to finance his purchase of the Red Sox having come due in November 1919, Frazee had little choice but to take the Yankees' offer. Ruth officially became the property of the Yankees on January 5, 1920.<ref name=SABR/><ref name=Stout/>\n\n==Fenway Park==\nThe Ruth sale cemented the Red Sox\u2013Yankees alliance, and shifted the relationship from [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry|their historically bitter rivalry]]. A few months later, the two teams drew even closer together in a dispute over [[Fenway Park]].\n\nWhen Frazee bought the Red Sox, Fenway Park was not part of the deal. Instead, he rented it for $30,000 per year from the Fenway Realty Trust. A majority of the trust's stock was controlled by the Taylor family, publishers of the ''[[Boston Globe]]''. The Taylor family had owned the Red Sox from 1904 to 1911 and built Fenway in the first place. They still held a small ownership interest. This put Frazee in a very difficult spot. If Johnson ever revoked the franchise, it would be relatively easy for a new owner to get a lease for the park. In August 1919, Frazee began negotiations to buy out the shares in the trust held by Lannin and the Taylors. In this way, if Johnson ever yanked the franchise out from under Frazee, any prospective owner of a Boston American League team  would risk being left without a place to play.\n\nHowever, Frazee had stopped paying installments because of a dispute over who owed Boston's share of MLB's settlement with the [[Federal League]]. In the spring of 1920, Lannin finally made good on a threat to slap a lien on the Red Sox. Since the lien barred Frazee from trading players or buying Fenway without Lannin's permission, Lannin effectively controlled the team. Lannin also threatened to sell his interest in the Fenway Realty Trust, which would have opened the door for a new owner to buy into the park if Frazee lost the franchise. Eventually, Lannin and Frazee reached a settlement. Lannin agreed to pay the Federal League bill and would not oppose Frazee's purchase of Fenway. In return, Frazee resumed payments. On May 3, Frazee and Taylor signed a deal to pay off the existing mortgage and make Frazee sole owner of Fenway Park.\n\nAs an additional security measure, Frazee secured a $300,000 loan from the Yankees and used a second mortgage on Fenway as collateral.\n\n==Other deals with the Yankees==\nFrazee had every intention of using the money from the Ruth deal to get better players. However, his theater interests had not done particularly well since 1918, and he found it difficult to service the debt on both Fenway Park and the Red Sox. His cash shorts became even more acute after the remortgage of Fenway Park. He was thus forced to put the team's best players on the market in order to get cash.<ref name=SABR/>  Unfortunately, he found it difficult to make deals with the \"Loyal Five\" even after Ruth left for New York. With the White Sox' reputation in tatters following the [[Black Sox Scandal]], Frazee was left with little choice but to deal with the Yankees.<ref name=Stout>Stout, Glenn.

Latvia's ''[[The Chronicles of Melanie]]'' (''Mel\u0101nijas hronika'') was released in 2016 and is, just like ''In the Crosswind'', based on the memoirs of a woman who experienced the deportation, but is told in a more conventional dramatic way.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Priim\u00e4gi|first=Tristan|date=2016-11-29|url=http://www.cineuropa.org/nw.aspx?t=newsdetail&l=en&did=320124|title=''The Chronicles of Melanie'': The dear deported|work=Cineuropa|accessdate=2017-02-05}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Soviet deportations from Estonia]]\n* [[Soviet deportations from Lithuania]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=blox>{{cite book| title=The Oxford Handbook of Genocide Studies |first1=Donald |last1=Bloxham |first2=A.

Lockheart argues that while academic literacies and writing practices are well-established in older, traditional academic disciplines, more recent disciplines such as art and design have been forced to adopt these existing academic practices or to justify their own distinctive practices, and this has been a contentious issue in the discipline of art and design (which includes diverse fields, each with their diferences and their own requirements, such as fine arts, graphic design and fashion design).<ref name=\"Writing Purposefully in Art and Design\"/>\n\nIt is in this spirit that Lockheart teaches Contextual Practice, and primarily for this reason that she co-founded an academic network, Writing-PAD, to provide a platform for these new ideas and practices (see below).<ref

\"to promote discussion about the necessary balance of consensus and dissensus that art and design fields require to remain vibrant.\"<ref name=\"Writing Purposefully in Art and

Lockheart argues that while academic literacies and writing practices are well-established in older, traditional academic disciplines, more recent disciplines such as art and design have been forced to adopt these existing academic practices or to justify their own distinctive practices, and this has been a contentious issue in the discipline of art and design (which includes diverse fields, each with their diferences and their own requirements, such as fine arts, graphic design and fashion design).<ref name=\"Writing Purposefully in Art and Design\"/>\n\nIt is in this spirit that Lockheart teaches Contextual Practice, and primarily for this reason that she co-founded an academic network, Writing-PAD, to provide a platform for these new ideas and practices (see below).<ref
