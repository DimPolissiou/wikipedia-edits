Fletcher, and the color [[flatter]] is Dee Cunniffe.\n\n''Paper Girls'' follows the story of four 12-year-old newspaper delivery girls (Erin, MacKenzie, KJ, and Tiffany) set in Stony Stream, a fictional [[suburb]] of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. While out delivering papers on [[All Saints' Day|the morning after Halloween]], the town is struck by an invasion from a mysterious force from the future. The girls become unwillingly caught up in the conflict between two warring factions of time travelers.\n\nThe series began publication on October 7, 2015 and concluded on July 31, 2019 with issue #30.<ref name=\"#30\"/> A television adaptation was announced on July 11, 2019.<ref name=\"deadline\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nErin Tieng, a new resident of Stony Stream, is a recently hired paper delivery girl. While out delivering newspapers in the early hours of the morning of November 1, 1988, Erin meets Mac, KJ, and Tiffany, a group of friends and fellow paper girls who invite Erin to join them.\n\nThe girls are soon attacked by a group of teenagers; one of the teens steals a [[walkie-talkie]] from Tiffany. The girls subsequently chase the group to a construction house and find what appears to be a time machine in the basement. They are then struck by mysterious energy emanating from the machine. The girls learn that the teenagers are time travelers from the distant future, who are engaged in an ongoing war with a group known as the \"Old-Timers\" (known as \"The Battle of the Ages\"). At the center of this conflict is the question of whether or not the past can and should be changed by future time travelers.\n\nThroughout the series, the girls are frequently (and usually, inadvertently) time-displaced, traveling between the 20th and 21st centuries, as well as eras of the distant past and future. As they travel through time, they encounter future versions of themselves and are forced to come to terms with who they will later become. Their lives also become intertwined with those of Wari and Jahpo, two \"Old-Timers\" who lead the war against their future descendants.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n*'''Erin Tieng''': A new resident of Stony Stream, she has a younger sister, Missy, of whom she is very protective. She has maternal instincts and tends to follow the rules. She attends a Catholic school called St. Pete's with Tiffany and carries a pocket knife.<ref name=#1 /> She later learns that her future self in 2016 is unmarried, still works for the ''Cleveland Preserver'', and struggles with [[anxiety]], for which she takes medication.<ref name=#7 /> When Clone Erin scatters the paper girls to different times, Erin is transported back to Halloween in 2017.<ref name=\"#25\"/> Erin realizes she must return to the house where she met Heck and Naldo; at the house, she discovers a rift in time which brings her face-to-face with Grand Father.<ref name=\"#27\"/> Erin reveals to Grand Father that time travel was invented by his \"mother\", Doctor Qanta Braunstein.<ref name=\"#28\"/> When Grand Father shoots an Editrix, he and Erin are transported to a deserted, 19th century Stony Stream where Erin reunites with her friends. Before her memory is wiped, Erin remarks that \"[[Eve]] was right\"; she is then returned to November 1, 1988.<ref name=\"#29\"/> Erin meets the other paper girls for the \"first\" time. After spending the morning together, Erin convinces the others to stay just a little while longer, hanging out as friends.<ref name=\"#30\"/>\n*'''MacKenzie \"Mac\" Coyle''': A cigarette-smoking tomboy who swears constantly, Mac was the first girl to become a paperboy in Stony Stream. Cynical and snarky, Mac comes from a [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] [[Irish Americans|Irish]]-[[Catholicity|Catholic]] family.<ref name=#1 /> She deeply admires her older brother.<ref name=#14 /> In 2016, Mac is told she will die of [[leukemia]];<ref name=#7 /> however, while in 2171 [[Anno Domini|AD]], she learns she actually has a rare, untreatable cancer called \"4DC\", which only affects time travelers.<ref name=#24 /> She is aggressively homophobic, particularly once KJ comes out to her, though it is hinted that she may reciprocate KJ's feelings.<ref name=#17 /><ref name=#23 /> Eventually, the two kiss in 2171 AD.<ref name=#25 /> Mac is later sent to the distant future just prior to the death of the Earth where she reunites with Dr. Braunstein.<ref name=\"#26\"/> Following Dr. Braunstein's death, Mac attempts to use Dr. Braunstein's time machine to travel back to 1988.<ref name=\"#28\"/> Instead, Mac is rerouted to a deserted, 19th century Stony Stream to be reunited with her friends. She and KJ share a final kiss. Mac admits she is happy to have her memory wiped, as she will no longer be weighed down by the knowledge of when she will die.<ref name=\"#29\"/> After being sent back to November 1, 1988, Mac dreams of attending KJ's [[Bar and bat mitzvah|bat mitzvah]], where the two slow-dance and KJ tells Mac that Mac loves her.

They strongly believe in preserving the original timeline and strictly enforce the rules regarding time travel. They cannot travel to their own futures.<ref name=\"#17\"/> Their leader is known by the title of \"Grand Father\".<ref name=\"#18\"/> A sub-sect of Old-Timers are known as ''Restorers'', who actively work to restore timelines altered by the events of the war. The Restorers have the ability to erase and alter a person's memory.<ref name=#17 /> Old-Timers speak in a modified version of English, heavily dependent on [[slang]] and similar to [[Old English]] in style.

They later come to a truce with the Teenagers via Grand Father, who agrees to ban time travel forever.<ref name=\"#30\"/>\n\n*'''Jahpo''': The current \"Grand Father\". His speech and attire are seemingly more in line with the 20th/21st century than his charges. He is actually the son of Wari and was born in 11,706 [[Common Era|BCE]], though this is unknown to him and everyone else. As a baby, Jahpo was saved by the girls and Dr. Braustein when a group of men from Wari's tribe attempted to kill him in a misguided sacrifice.<ref name=#14 /><ref name=#15 /> Jahpo alleges he is under the command of the Editrixes.<ref name=\"#24\"/> He does not believe Erin when she states that his \"mother\" Dr. Braustein invented time travel, not the Editrixes.

Expressing regret, he agrees to end the war with the teenagers by abolishing time travel forever.<ref name=\"#29\"/>\n*'''Wari''': Publicly known as Jahpo's \"big sister\", she is actually a woman from 11,706 BCE and Jahpo's mother. Wari originally meets and is helped by the paper girls when they inadvertently jumped to Wari's original time period.<ref name=#11 /> At some point, Wari is brought to the future by Dr. Braustein in an effort to help protect Jahpo from the inherent dangers of 11,706 BCE. Wari spent some years hiding in [[Indonesia]] with Dr. Braustein as her \"mother\". She and Jahpo later return to Cleveland where they reside in 2171 AD.<ref name=\"#24\"/> Wari is bequeathed with Dr. Braunstein's time travel machine following Dr. Braunstein's death.<ref name=\"#29\"/> She then uses it to go back in time and prevent the paper girls from being hit by a car on the morning of November 1, 1988.<ref name=\"#30\"/>\n*'''Prioress''': A commander in Jahpo's army who is romantically involved with Jahpo.

They believe in the idea of altering history. Unlike the Old-Timers, teenagers do not have any rules regarding time travel. They often seek the assistance of \"locals\" (people living in the present time) to provide them with information for the war effort.<ref name=\"#17\"/> They speak in a futuristic language that is only decipherable through translation gadgets.<ref name=#7 /> They have the ability to clone humans.<ref name=\"#8\"/> At some unknown point in time, a small group of clones and 2000-Tiffany gain the ability to transmit coded messages to the paper girls in the past via bizarre dreams. This was done in order to covertly guide the paper girls to their destiny.<ref name=\"#28\"/> This group of clones and 2000-Tiffany help to end the war by convincing Grand Father to ban all time travel forever, believing such power should never be abused again. They then erase the memories of the paper girls and return the girls to their original timeline.<ref name=\"#29\"/>\n\n*'''Heck''', '''Naldo''', and '''Jude''': Teenagers from the distant future. They are infected with a mysterious illness (\"4DC\", a rare cancer that only affects time travelers).

It was Jude who taught her about \"The Battle of the Ages\" and how to protect herself from the Old-Timers.

She believes that KJ's memories being wiped is for the best, as KJ would otherwise grow up with crushing guilt about the man she killed while protecting Wari and Jahpo in the distant past.<ref name=\"#29\" />\n*'''2000-Tiffany''': Tiffany's future self. After being saved by the girls from a battle between the Old-Timers and teenagers on January 1, 2000, she decides to travel with and assist the girls.<ref name=#18 /> She is believed to have been killed in 2171 AD while protecting the girls from a police officer, however, she is saved at the last moment and brought to live in the future after the time war.<ref name=#25 /><ref name=#27 /> It was 2000-Tiffany who was responsible for sending coded messages to the paper girls via bizarre dreams.<ref name=\"#28\"/> Alongside a small group of clones, she helps to end the time travel war.<ref name=\"#29\"/>\n\n===Minor and recurring===\n*'''Editrixes''': Mysterious beings of unknown origin from the fourth dimension who Grandfather believes are possibly responsible for the time travel war.<ref name=\"#28\"/> According to Dr. Braustein, the Editrixes can exist in the fourth dimension while allowing part of themselves to be \"observed\" by 3D beings such as humans.

I wanted something more contained and grounded with some spectacular element to it. ''Paper Girls'' is the story of four 12-year-old newspaper delivery girls growing up, like me, in the suburbs outside Cleveland in the late 1980s. They stumble upon something extraordinary and it's a mystery and an adventure and a weird book.

They're aware of them, but it doesn't define their lives. They're these sort of hard-core gangsters that are much more interested in going around, shaking down the adults who owe them money so they can get their cassettes or buy their own Nintendo systems.

Fletcher, and the color [[flatter]] is Dee Cunniffe.\n\n''Paper Girls'' follows the story of four 12-year-old newspaper delivery girls (Erin, MacKenzie, KJ, and Tiffany) set in Stony Stream, a fictional [[suburb]] of [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. While out delivering papers on [[All Saints' Day|the morning after Halloween]], the town is struck by an invasion from a mysterious force from the future. The girls become unwillingly caught up in the conflict between two warring factions of time travelers.\n\nThe series began publication on October 7, 2015 and concluded on July 31, 2019 with issue #30.<ref name=\"#30\"/> A television adaptation was announced on July 11, 2019.<ref name=\"deadline\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nErin Tieng, a new resident of Stony Stream, is a recently hired paper delivery girl. While out delivering newspapers in the early hours of the morning of November 1, 1988, Erin meets Mac, KJ, and Tiffany, a group of friends and fellow paper girls who invite Erin to join them.\n\nThe girls are soon attacked by a group of teenagers; one of the teens steals a [[walkie-talkie]] from Tiffany. The girls subsequently chase the group to a construction house and find what appears to be a time machine in the basement. They are then struck by mysterious energy emanating from the machine. The girls learn that the teenagers are time travelers from the distant future, who are engaged in an ongoing war with a group known as the \"Old-Timers\" (known as \"The Battle of the Ages\"). At the center of this conflict is the question of whether or not the past can and should be changed by future time travelers.\n\nThroughout the series, the girls are frequently (and usually, inadvertently) time-displaced, traveling between the 20th and 21st centuries, as well as eras of the distant past and future. As they travel through time, they encounter future versions of themselves and are forced to come to terms with who they will later become. Their lives also become intertwined with those of Wari and Jahpo, two \"Old-Timers\" who lead the war against their future descendants.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n*'''Erin Tieng''': A new resident of Stony Stream, she has a younger sister, Missy, of whom she is very protective.

She and KJ share a final kiss. Mac admits she is happy to have her memory wiped, as she will no longer be weighed down by the knowledge of when she will die.<ref name=\"#29\"/> After being sent back to November 1, 1988, Mac dreams of attending KJ's [[Bar and bat mitzvah|bat mitzvah]], where the two slow-dance and KJ tells Mac that Mac loves her. Mac also dreams of Erin and Tiffany, the latter of who tells Mac not to forget that they're not just paper girls. Later, Mac reunites with KJ and the others. After spending the morning together, she agrees they should hang out just a little while longer.<ref name=\"#30\"/>\n*'''Karina \"KJ\" J.''': Considered the \"smart one\" of the group, KJ attends a private school (Buttonwood Academy), plays field hockey, and is [[Jews|Jewish]].<ref name=#1 /> She carries her field hockey stick at all times and occasionally uses it as a weapon.

She attends the same Catholic school as Erin.<ref name=#1 /> When Tiffany is briefly held captive by a futuristic device, she is shown her past; Tiffany is discouraged to realize she had thus far just spent her life playing video games.<ref name=#4 /> In 2000, she discovers that her older self has adopted a [[Goth subculture|Goth]] style, attended [[New York University Stern School of Business|Stern]], and married a man named Chris.<ref name=#17 /><ref name=#18 /> Prior to the age of 13, her parents force her to give up her paper route.<ref name=\"#18\"/> After being sent to the distant future, she encounters a second Clone Erin.<ref name=\"#26\"/> This Clone Erin introduces Tiffany to her companions: a third clone of Erin (age 16), a clone of KJ (age 42), and 2000-Tiffany (now an elderly woman).

Tiffany then confesses to the others that she has decided to give up being a paper girl, wanting to just \"be\" for a while. Despite this, Tiffany agrees to hang out with the group for the rest of the morning.<ref name=\"#30\"/>\n\n===War Factions===\n\n====Old-Timers====\n\n\"Old-Timers\" are the first generation following the invention of time travel. They strongly believe in preserving the original timeline and strictly enforce the rules regarding time travel. They cannot travel to their own futures.<ref name=\"#17\"/> Their leader is known by the title of \"Grand Father\".<ref name=\"#18\"/> A sub-sect of Old-Timers are known as ''Restorers'', who actively work to restore timelines altered by the events of the war. The Restorers have the ability to erase and alter a person's memory.<ref name=#17 /> Old-Timers speak in a modified version of English, heavily dependent on [[slang]] and similar to [[Old English]] in style. When Clone Erin (first generation) scatters the girls to separate past/present timelines, she causes the Old-Timers to become stuck inside the fourth dimension.<ref name=\"#26\"/> The Old-Timer's base, \"the Cathedral\", is later destroyed when Grand Father misguidedly shoots an Editrix.<ref name=\"#29\"/> However, all of the occupants of the Cathedral are saved and restored to their original time. They later come to a truce with the Teenagers via Grand Father, who agrees to ban time travel forever.<ref name=\"#30\"/>\n\n*'''Jahpo''': The current \"Grand Father\". His speech and attire are seemingly more in line with the 20th/21st century than his charges. He is actually the son of Wari and was born in 11,706 [[Common Era|BCE]], though this is unknown to him and everyone else. As a baby, Jahpo was saved by the girls and Dr. Braustein when a group of men from Wari's tribe attempted to kill him in a misguided sacrifice.<ref name=#14 /><ref name=#15 /> Jahpo alleges he is under the command of the Editrixes.<ref name=\"#24\"/> He does not believe Erin when she states that his \"mother\" Dr. Braustein invented time travel, not the Editrixes. He shoots at an Editrix in order to save one his crew members, which leads to him being transported to a deserted, 19th century version of Stony Stream.<ref name=\"#28\"/> While there, he touches an Editrix and is shown the truth of his origin. Expressing regret, he agrees to end the war with the teenagers by abolishing time travel forever.<ref name=\"#29\"/>\n*'''Wari''': Publicly known as Jahpo's \"big sister\", she is actually a woman from 11,706 BCE and Jahpo's mother. Wari originally meets and is helped by the paper girls when they inadvertently jumped to Wari's original time period.<ref name=#11 /> At some point, Wari is brought to the future by Dr. Braustein in an effort to help protect Jahpo from the inherent dangers of 11,706 BCE. Wari spent some years hiding in [[Indonesia]] with Dr. Braustein as her \"mother\". She and Jahpo later return to Cleveland where they reside in 2171 AD.<ref name=\"#24\"/> Wari is bequeathed with Dr. Braunstein's time travel machine following Dr. Braunstein's death.<ref name=\"#29\"/> She then uses it to go back in time and prevent the paper girls from being hit by a car on the morning of November 1, 1988.<ref name=\"#30\"/>\n*'''Prioress''': A commander in Jahpo's army who is romantically involved with Jahpo. She is killed during a battle on [[Year 2000 problem|New Year's Eve]] in 1999/2000.<ref name=\"#16\"/><ref name=\"#17\"/><ref name=\"#18\"/>\n\n====Teenagers====\n\nThe descendants of the Old-Timers, from the 71st century; Grand Father refers to them as this regardless of age. They believe in the idea of altering history. Unlike the Old-Timers, teenagers do not have any rules regarding time travel. They often seek the assistance of \"locals\" (people living in the present time) to provide them with information for the war effort.<ref name=\"#17\"/> They speak in a futuristic language that is only decipherable through translation gadgets.<ref name=#7 /> They have the ability to clone humans.<ref name=\"#8\"/> At some unknown point in time, a small group of clones and 2000-Tiffany gain the ability to transmit coded messages to the paper girls in the past via bizarre dreams. This was done in order to covertly guide the paper girls to their destiny.<ref name=\"#28\"/> This group of clones and 2000-Tiffany help to end the war by convincing Grand Father to ban all time travel forever, believing such power should never be abused again. They then erase the memories of the paper girls and return the girls to their original timeline.<ref name=\"#29\"/>\n\n*'''Heck''', '''Naldo''', and '''Jude''': Teenagers from the distant future. They are infected with a mysterious illness (\"4DC\", a rare cancer that only affects time travelers). Although they in speak in an unknown, futuristic language, they are able to use a translation stone to speak to \"locals\".<ref name=#5 /> Jude travels back to 1958 where he meets Charlotte Spachefski.<ref name=\"#16\"/> While in 1958, Jude also meets a time-displaced KJ; he agrees to help KJ reunite with her friends. KJ later informs Jude of his future death and the death of his friends, Heck and Naldo.<ref name=#28 /> After meeting Erin in 1988, Heck and Naldo briefly transport Erin to their original time and help Erin heal her gunshot wound by using electronic bugs called ''iNsecs''. They both later die from injuries sustained in a time jump after returning Erin to 1988.<ref name=#5 /> Heck and Naldo were also responsible for the creation of the first generation Clone Erin.<ref name=\"#8\"/>\n*'''Charlotte \"Chuck\" Spachefski''': A [[baby boomer]] cartoonist whose work is featured in the ''Cleveland Preserver''. She took over drawing and writing the comic strip ''Frankie Tomatah'' from her father.<ref name=\"#16\"/><ref name=\"#17\"/> In 1958, she encountered Jude, a time traveler from 70,000 AD who was hiding in her basement. It was Jude who taught her about \"The Battle of the Ages\" and how to protect herself from the Old-Timers. Charlotte learned the origin of \"foldings\" (rifts in time) and where to find them; this information allowed her to leave clues in her comics to aid the teenagers against the Old-Timers.<ref name=\"#16\"/><ref name=\"#17\"/> She attempts to kill the girls in 2000, though they escape.<ref name=\"#17\"/><ref name=\"#18\"/> She is later killed by an Old-Timer.<ref name=\"#19\"/>\n*'''Clone Erin (First Generation, 12 years old)''': The first clone of Erin. Originally from the 71st century, she travels back to 2016 in search of the girls. She alleges that the girls are important to the ongoing war between the teenagers and Old-Timers. She attempts to recruit them for the war effort, but the other girls mistrust her and manage to send her back to her original time.<ref name=\"#8\"/> Unbeknownst to the girls, Clone Erin secretly tracks them through time. In 2171 AD, after tricking and luring the girls to her location, she scatters them to four separate time periods.<ref name=#25 />\n*'''Clone Erin (Unknown Generation, 12 years old)''': A \"descendant\" of the first Clone Erin. She meets Tiffany in the distant future beyond the 71st century and explains to her that the war ended some time prior, thanks to the efforts of the paper girls and this Clone Erin's companions.<ref name=\"#26\"/> Her group created a dream-message machine, which allowed 2000-Tiffany to send bizarre, coded messages to the paper girls in the past, covertly guiding them.<ref name=\"#28\"/> Later, Clone Erin and her group convince Grand Father to end the war by calling a truce: a permanent ban on all time travel.<ref name=\"#29\"/>\n*'''Clone Erin (Unknown Generation, 16 years old)''': Another \"descendant\" of the first Clone Erin who works alongside the other Clone Erin descendant and one of the creators of the dream-message machine.<ref name=\"#28\"/> She helps end the time travel war, though is disappointed that she does not get to participate in one final, decisive battle.<ref name=\"#29\"/>\n*'''Clone KJ (Unknown Generation, 42 years old)''': A clone who works alongside the both Clone Erin descendants and one of the creators of the dream-message machine.<ref name=\"#28\"/> She explains to Tiffany that they had attempted millions of times to change the past to alter the future, but were always unsuccessful.<ref name=\"#28\"/> Along with the others, she helps end the time travel war.

I wanted something more contained and grounded with some spectacular element to it. ''Paper Girls'' is the story of four 12-year-old newspaper delivery girls growing up, like me, in the suburbs outside Cleveland in the late 1980s. They stumble upon something extraordinary and it's a mystery and an adventure and a weird book.

Now being at [[Image Comics|Image]], where we could do anything we want. Here's a great opportunity to do what I always wanted to do, just a group of females and not have to defend it or explain it, and just get to write them.\" Vaughan went on to say, \"I wanted to write a story about four kids who did not give a ... about the opposite sex. They're aware of them, but it doesn't define their lives. They're these sort of hard-core gangsters that are much more interested in going around, shaking down the adults who owe them money so they can get their cassettes or buy their own Nintendo systems. It was avoiding the relationship traps that come up in those 1980 films ... and just letting them and their friendship be the story.\"<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite web |last1=Woerner |first1=Meredith |title=You all should be reading Brian K.
