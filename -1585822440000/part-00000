These chips are dry (like potato chips), contain about 4% water (table), and can be salted, spiced, sugar coated or jaggery coated. Sometimes [[Isoamyl acetate|banana flavoring]] is added. If ripe bananas are used, they come out oily. They are used for desserts, not for dry chips.\n\n==Dried==\nSome varieties of banana chips can be produced using only [[food dehydration]]. Banana slices that are only dehydrated are not dark yellow and crunchy, but rather are brown, leathery and chewy. They are very sweet and have an intense banana flavor. These are ideally made from bananas that are fully ripe. Another kind is made by baking in an oven, although this process may not result in the same intense banana flavor.\n\n==Nutrition==\nFried banana chips are 4% water, 58% [[carbohydrate]]s, 34% [[fat]], and 2% [[protein]]. In a 100 gram reference amount, fried banana chips supply 520 [[calorie]]s and are a rich source (20% or more the [[Daily Value]], DV) of [[magnesium]] (21% DV) and [[vitamin B6]] (20% DV), with moderate amounts of [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[potassium]] (10% to 11% DV) (table). Other [[micronutrient]]s are in negligible amounts.\n\n==Uses and variations==\n\n===India===\n\n[[Fried plantain]] chips, known as ''nenthra-kaaya oopperi'' or ''upperi'' in [[Kerala]], are fried in [[coconut oil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/the-taste-of-kerala/article4605855.ece |title=Banana Chips from Kerala, india|publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref> Both ripe and unripe plantains are used for this type of chip preparation. The chips may be coated with [[spice mix|masala]] or [[jaggery]] to form spicy and sweet variations. Plain banana and plantain chips are called ''pachkkaya varuthathu'' and ''kaya upperi'', respectively; sweet jaggery-banana chips are called ''sharkara upperi''. It is an integral part of the traditional Kerala meal called [[sadya]] served during weddings and festivals, such as [[Onam]].\n\n===Indonesia===\n\nBanana is a native plant of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and the people of the archipelago has developed many uses of it for ages, including as a snack. In [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], banana chip is called ''kripik pisang'', and is considered as a variant of crispy ''[[kripik]]'' (traditional chip or crisp). ''Kripik pisang'' is a popular crispy snack and can be commonly found in Indonesia, although it seems to be more prevalent in Java and Sumatra. \n\nUsually unripe green bananas are thinly sliced, soaked in lime and salt water solution, and being deep fried as chips.<ref>{{cite web | title = banana chips (keripik pisang) | work = Indonesian original recipe | url = http://indonesiaoriginalrecipes.blogspot.co.id/2013/11/banana-chips-keripik-pisang.html}}</ref> Unripe banana is well suited for [[deep frying]] due to its low content of water and sugar, while having high starch content. ''[[Pisang goreng]]'' is another fried banana snack, although it is not thinly sliced and serves as a sweet hot snack.\n\n===America===\nThe chips are often part of [[muesli]] and [[nut (fruit)|nut]] mixes.

These chips are dry (like potato chips), contain about 4% water (table), and can be salted, spiced, sugar coated or jaggery coated. Sometimes [[Isoamyl acetate|banana flavoring]] is added. If ripe bananas are used, they come out oily. They are used for desserts, not for dry chips.\n\n==Dried==\nSome varieties of banana chips can be produced using only [[food dehydration]]. Banana slices that are only dehydrated are not dark yellow and crunchy, but rather are brown, leathery and chewy. They are very sweet and have an intense banana flavor. These are ideally made from bananas that are fully ripe. Another kind is made by baking in an oven, although this process may not result in the same intense banana flavor.\n\n==Nutrition==\nFried banana chips are 4% water, 58% [[carbohydrate]]s, 34% [[fat]], and 2% [[protein]]. In a 100 gram reference amount, fried banana chips supply 520 [[calorie]]s and are a rich source (20% or more the [[Daily Value]], DV) of [[magnesium]] (21% DV) and [[vitamin B6]] (20% DV), with moderate amounts of [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[potassium]] (10% to 11% DV) (table). Other [[micronutrient]]s are in negligible amounts.\n\n==Uses and variations==\n\n===India===\n\n[[Fried plantain]] chips, known as ''nenthra-kaaya oopperi'' or ''upperi'' in [[Kerala]], are fried in [[coconut oil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/the-taste-of-kerala/article4605855.ece |title=Banana Chips from Kerala, india|publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-13}}</ref> Both ripe and unripe plantains are used for this type of chip preparation. The chips may be coated with [[spice mix|masala]] or [[jaggery]] to form spicy and sweet variations. Plain banana and plantain chips are called ''pachkkaya varuthathu'' and ''kaya upperi'', respectively; sweet jaggery-banana chips are called ''sharkara upperi''. It is an integral part of the traditional Kerala meal called [[sadya]] served during weddings and festivals, such as [[Onam]].\n\n===Indonesia===\n\nBanana is a native plant of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and the people of the archipelago has developed many uses of it for ages, including as a snack. In [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], banana chip is called ''kripik pisang'', and is considered as a variant of crispy ''[[kripik]]'' (traditional chip or crisp). ''Kripik pisang'' is a popular crispy snack and can be commonly found in Indonesia, although it seems to be more prevalent in Java and Sumatra. \n\nUsually unripe green bananas are thinly sliced, soaked in lime and salt water solution, and being deep fried as chips.<ref>{{cite web | title = banana chips (keripik pisang) | work = Indonesian original recipe | url = http://indonesiaoriginalrecipes.blogspot.co.id/2013/11/banana-chips-keripik-pisang.html}}</ref> Unripe banana is well suited for [[deep frying]] due to its low content of water and sugar, while having high starch content. ''[[Pisang goreng]]'' is another fried banana snack, although it is not thinly sliced and serves as a sweet hot snack.\n\n===America===\nThe chips are often part of [[muesli]] and [[nut (fruit)|nut]] mixes. Other chips, such as [[patacones]], are [[salt]]y.\nSimilar chips called [[chifle]] are made from [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, the family of fruit that bananas come from.

It was established by the trapper [[Miles Goodyear]] in 1846 about a mile west of where downtown Ogden sits today.\n\nIn November 1847, Captain James Brown purchased all the land now comprising Weber County together with some livestock and Fort Buenaventura for $3,000. The land was conveyed to Captain Brown in a Mexican Land Grant, this area being at that time a part of Mexico.{{Citation needed|date = August 2017}}\n\nThe settlement was then called '''Brownsville''', after Captain James Brown, but was later named Ogden for a brigade leader of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], [[Peter Skene Ogden]], who had trapped in the Weber Valley a generation earlier. There is some confusion about which \"Ogden\" was the first to set foot in the area. A [[Samuel Ogden]] traveled though the western United States on an exploration trip in 1818. The site of the original Fort Buenaventura is now a Weber County park.\n\n[[File:Ogden-utah-depot-1910.jpg|thumb|390px|right|Westbound passengers changed cars at Ogden, from Union Pacific to Southern Pacific, which took them to California]]\n\nOgden is the closest sizable city to the [[Golden Spike]] location at [[Promontory, Utah|Promontory Summit, Utah]], where the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was joined in 1869. It was known as a major passenger railroad junction owing to its location along major east\u2013west and north\u2013south routes, prompting the local chamber of commerce to adopt the motto, \"You can't get anywhere without coming to Ogden.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Ogden|url=http://www.ogdencity.com/en/about_ogden/history_demographics/ogden_history.aspx|work=Ogden City|publisher=City of Ogden, Utah|accessdate=12 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307014543/http://www.ogdencity.com/en/about_ogden/history_demographics/ogden_history.aspx|archivedate=March 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Railroad passengers traveling west to San Francisco from the eastern United States typically passed through Ogden (and not through the larger [[Salt Lake City]] to the south). However, [[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, no longer serves Ogden. Passengers who want to travel to and from Ogden by rail must travel via ''[[FrontRunner]]'' [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] to Salt Lake City and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]].\n\nIn 1972, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] completed construction of and dedicated the [[Ogden Utah Temple]] in Ogden. The [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] was built to serve the area's large [[Latter-day Saint|LDS]] population. In 2010, the LDS Church announced they would renovate the Ogden Temple and the adjacent Tabernacle. The work which began in 2011 includes an update to the exterior, the removal of the Tabernacle's steeple to make the Temple's steeple a main focus and a new underground parking garage and gardens.<ref name=\"LDS Church News\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2010-02-18/ogden-temple-renovation-to-include-significant-architectural-face-lift-35131 |title=Ogden Temple Renovation to Include Significant Architectural Facelift|work=includes photographs|date=February 18, 2010 |accessdate =February 7, 2011}}</ref>  The Temple was rededicated in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ogden Utah Temple News|url = https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/ogden/news/|website = www.ldschurchtemples.com|accessdate = 2016-01-02}}</ref>\n\nBecause Ogden has historically been Utah's second largest city, it is home to a large number of historic buildings. However, by the 1980s, several Salt Lake City suburbs and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] had surpassed Ogden in population.\n\nThe [[Defense Depot Ogden Utah]] operated in Ogden from 1941 to 1997. Some of its {{convert|1,128|acre}} have been converted into a commercial and industrial park called the [[Business Depot Ogden]].\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\nOgden is located at {{Coord|41.2196|-111.9712|type:city_region:US-UT|format=dms|display=inline}} (41.2196, &minus;111.9712),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at the foot of the [[Wasatch Range|Wasatch Mountains]]. This is at about the same latitude as [[Benevent]] in [[Campania]] in southern Italy. \n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of 26.6&nbsp;square miles (69.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), all land.  Elevations in the city range from about {{convert|4300|to|5000|ft|m}} above sea level.\n[[File:2005-0623-VK-OgdenSign.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ogden\" sign over Washington Boulevard at the [[Ogden River]]; toward downtown]]\nThe [[Ogden River|Ogden]] and [[Weber River]]s, which originate in the mountains to the east, flow through the city and meet at a confluence just west of the city limits. [[Pineview Dam]] is in the [[Ogden Canyon|Ogden River Canyon]] {{convert|7|mi|km}} east of Ogden. The reservoir behind the dam provides over {{convert|110000|acre.ft|m3}} of water storage and water recreation for the area.\n\nProminent mountain peaks near Ogden include [[Mount Ogden]] to the east and [[Ben Lomond Mountain (Utah)|Ben Lomond]] to the north.\n\n===Streetscape===\n[[File:CtyMapWeber.png|thumb|right|Ogden and its surrounding area]]\nFrom south to west to north, Ogden's neighboring towns are South Ogden, Roy, West Haven, Marriott-Slaterville, Farr West, Pleasant View and North Ogden. The city is - like many others in the USA - characterized by a spacious, [[Grid_plan|street grid]] with many blocks. The streets are numbered from north to south, which is expressed in the corresponding street names. As in Salt Lake City, counting begins at the center of the LDS church. By extending the numbers with directions (\"E\" for east and \"W\" for west) their relative relation to the central point is made clear. In the center of the city, the blocks from Union Station along 25th Street, the west-to-east oriented cross streets are named after former U.S. presidents such as Lincoln Avenue, Grant Avenue, Washington Boulevard, Adam Avenue, Jefferson Avenue or Madison Avenue. The central connecting street in north-south orientation is Harrison-Boulevard. The city area is divided into six districts: in the North End, including West Ogden, Downtown and East Central, in the East, including East Bench and Shadow Valley.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Ogden experiences either a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') or a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') depending on which variant of the system is used. Summers are hot and relatively dry, with highs frequently reaching {{convert|95|F|C}}, with a few days per year reaching {{convert|100|F|C|0}}. Rain is provided in the form of infrequent thunderstorms during summer, usually between mid-July and mid-September during the height of monsoon season. The Pacific storm season usually lasts from about October through May, with precipitation reaching its peak in spring. Snow usually first occurs in late October or early November, with the last occurring sometime in April. Winters are cool and snowy, with highs averaging {{convert|37|F|C}} in January. Snowfall averages about {{convert|22|in|cm}}, with approximately {{convert|21.98|in|mm}} of precipitation annually.

It was established by the trapper [[Miles Goodyear]] in 1846 about a mile west of where downtown Ogden sits today.\n\nIn November 1847, Captain James Brown purchased all the land now comprising Weber County together with some livestock and Fort Buenaventura for $3,000. The land was conveyed to Captain Brown in a Mexican Land Grant, this area being at that time a part of Mexico.{{Citation needed|date = August 2017}}\n\nThe settlement was then called '''Brownsville''', after Captain James Brown, but was later named Ogden for a brigade leader of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], [[Peter Skene Ogden]], who had trapped in the Weber Valley a generation earlier. There is some confusion about which \"Ogden\" was the first to set foot in the area. A [[Samuel Ogden]] traveled though the western United States on an exploration trip in 1818. The site of the original Fort Buenaventura is now a Weber County park.\n\n[[File:Ogden-utah-depot-1910.jpg|thumb|390px|right|Westbound passengers changed cars at Ogden, from Union Pacific to Southern Pacific, which took them to California]]\n\nOgden is the closest sizable city to the [[Golden Spike]] location at [[Promontory, Utah|Promontory Summit, Utah]], where the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was joined in 1869.

However, [[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, no longer serves Ogden. Passengers who want to travel to and from Ogden by rail must travel via ''[[FrontRunner]]'' [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] to Salt Lake City and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]].\n\nIn 1972, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] completed construction of and dedicated the [[Ogden Utah Temple]] in Ogden. The [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] was built to serve the area's large [[Latter-day Saint|LDS]] population. In 2010, the LDS Church announced they would renovate the Ogden Temple and the adjacent Tabernacle.

However, by the 1980s, several Salt Lake City suburbs and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] had surpassed Ogden in population.\n\nThe [[Defense Depot Ogden Utah]] operated in Ogden from 1941 to 1997. Some of its {{convert|1,128|acre}} have been converted into a commercial and industrial park called the [[Business Depot Ogden]].\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\nOgden is located at {{Coord|41.2196|-111.9712|type:city_region:US-UT|format=dms|display=inline}} (41.2196, &minus;111.9712),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> at the foot of the [[Wasatch Range|Wasatch Mountains]]. This is at about the same latitude as [[Benevent]] in [[Campania]] in southern Italy. \n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of 26.6&nbsp;square miles (69.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), all land.  Elevations in the city range from about {{convert|4300|to|5000|ft|m}} above sea level.\n[[File:2005-0623-VK-OgdenSign.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ogden\" sign over Washington Boulevard at the [[Ogden River]]; toward downtown]]\nThe [[Ogden River|Ogden]] and [[Weber River]]s, which originate in the mountains to the east, flow through the city and meet at a confluence just west of the city limits. [[Pineview Dam]] is in the [[Ogden Canyon|Ogden River Canyon]] {{convert|7|mi|km}} east of Ogden. The reservoir behind the dam provides over {{convert|110000|acre.ft|m3}} of water storage and water recreation for the area.\n\nProminent mountain peaks near Ogden include [[Mount Ogden]] to the east and [[Ben Lomond Mountain (Utah)|Ben Lomond]] to the north.\n\n===Streetscape===\n[[File:CtyMapWeber.png|thumb|right|Ogden and its surrounding area]]\nFrom south to west to north, Ogden's neighboring towns are South Ogden, Roy, West Haven, Marriott-Slaterville, Farr West, Pleasant View and North Ogden. The city is - like many others in the USA - characterized by a spacious, [[Grid_plan|street grid]] with many blocks. The streets are numbered from north to south, which is expressed in the corresponding street names. As in Salt Lake City, counting begins at the center of the LDS church. By extending the numbers with directions (\"E\" for east and \"W\" for west) their relative relation to the central point is made clear. In the center of the city, the blocks from Union Station along 25th Street, the west-to-east oriented cross streets are named after former U.S. presidents such as Lincoln Avenue, Grant Avenue, Washington Boulevard, Adam Avenue, Jefferson Avenue or Madison Avenue. The central connecting street in north-south orientation is Harrison-Boulevard. The city area is divided into six districts: in the North End, including West Ogden, Downtown and East Central, in the East, including East Bench and Shadow Valley.\n\n===Climate===\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Ogden experiences either a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') or a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') depending on which variant of the system is used. Summers are hot and relatively dry, with highs frequently reaching {{convert|95|F|C}}, with a few days per year reaching {{convert|100|F|C|0}}. Rain is provided in the form of infrequent thunderstorms during summer, usually between mid-July and mid-September during the height of monsoon season. The Pacific storm season usually lasts from about October through May, with precipitation reaching its peak in spring. Snow usually first occurs in late October or early November, with the last occurring sometime in April. Winters are cool and snowy, with highs averaging {{convert|37|F|C}} in January. Snowfall averages about {{convert|22|in|cm}}, with approximately {{convert|21.98|in|mm}} of precipitation annually.

By the end of 1989 more than 200,000 had signed the proclamation despite New Forum having been identified by the East German [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|governing party]] as illegal. By this time, in any event, [[Die Wende|the Berlin wall]] had been breached by demonstrators on the eastern side early in November 1989, and when it became clear that the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|fraternal Soviet troops]] had no instructions to prevent people from crossing it, the gate was seen to have been left open for a [[German reunification|reunification]] process that now appeared unstoppable.\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%|\n:::'''Rolf Henrich: Published Works'''\n* ''Der vormundschaftliche Staat.

Rolf Henrich participated in the Round Table discussions on behalf of [[New Forum]].<ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRH/> Henrich set himself two principal tasks within the process. The hated [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] had to be abolished. There had been some suggestion that the institution might be reconfigured as a new \"National Security Agency\" (''\"Amt f\u00fcr Nationale Sicherheit\"''). For Henrich, that would have been a mere re-labeling and as such totally unacceptable.<ref name=BerKurRH/> His second task was to help draft and enact a new election law for [[East Germany]], and to set a date for a democratically configured election to take place.<ref name=BerKurRH/> On 18 March 1990 the first, and as matters turned out, last, free [[1990 East German general election|parliamentary election]] in the history of the [[German Democratic Republic]] was held. After this Rolf Henrich was satisfied that his own contribution to the Round Table exercise had been successfully completed.<ref name=BerKurRH/> In November 1989 the de facto ban that seven months earlier had prevented him from working as a lawyer had been revoked and he was by now free to return to work at his lawyer's office in [[Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt]].<ref name=LeMORH/>\n\n===Career options===\nHenrich later told an interviewer that [[Manfred Gerlach]], who had been the East German head of state between 3 December 1989 and 18 March 1990, had offered him a job as President of the [[Supreme Court of East Germany|country's Supreme Court]], but Henrich turned down that job along with an invitation to take a government post as secretary of state in the Ministry of Justice. Henrich evidently thought he might have independence issues or become a \"figleaf\" with a high-profile post in the East German judicial-political establishment. To maximize legitimacy, such jobs should go to an \"outsider\".<ref name=BerKurRH/>\n\nThere had also been a project involving the [[Gruner + Jahr]] publishing conglomerate to set up a pan-regional daily newspaper called \"Die Ostdeutsche\", based on the model of the highly successful [[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]. That project failed because the newspaper market turned out to be overcrowded already.<ref name=BerKurRH/>\n\n[[German reunification]] formally took place in October 1990 and Rolf Henrich returned to his life as a provincial lawyer in [[Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt]]. His public profile never entirely vanished, however: he continued to give occasional press interviews and to publish the occasional book. In the courts he has worked as a defense lawyer in controversial cases including those involving former East German border guards charged in connection with shootings at the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref name=rev89RH/>\n\n==Awards and honours==\n* 2000 [[:de:Deutscher Nationalpreis|German National prize]] of the [[:de:Deutsche Nationalstiftung|German National Foundation]]<ref name=LeMORH/> (joint winner)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Henrich, Rolf}}\n[[Category:German lawyers]]\n[[Category:East German dissidents]]\n[[Category:Socialist Unity Party of Germany members]]\n[[Category:New Forum (East Germany) members]]\n[[Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians]]\n[[Category:1944 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:German male writers]]\n[[Category:People of the Stasi]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2015}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name = Rolf Henrich\n| image = \n| caption = \n| image_size = \n| birth_name = \n| birth_date  = {{b-da|24 February 1944}}\n| birth_place = [[Magdeburg]], Saxony-Anhalt, [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]\n| death_date  = \n| death_place = \n| party         = [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] (1964)<br />[[New Forum|NF]] (1989)<br />[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] (1990)\n| religion         = \n| occupation =  Writer<br />lawyer<br />politician\n| parents = \n| spouse = Heidelore\n| children = Falk\n| website  =  \n}}\n\n'''Rolf Henrich''' (born [[Magdeburg]] 24 February 1944) is a writer and lawyer.<ref name=LeMORH>{{cite web|url=http://www.hdg.de/lemo/biografie/rolf-henrich|title=Rolf Henrich geb. 1944|publisher=Stiftung Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, [[Bonn]]|date=4 December 2014|author=|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> In September 1989 he became a co-founder and leading member of the [[New Forum]] movement.<ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRH>{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=1348|author1= [[Helmut M\u00fcller-Enbergs]] |author2= Jan Wielgohs|title = Henrich, Rolf * 24.2.1944 Dissident|publisher= Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur: Biographische Datenbanken |accessdate= 27 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nHis book \"The Custodial State.

By the end of 1989 more than 200,000 had signed the proclamation despite New Forum having been identified by the East German [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|governing party]] as illegal.   By this time, in any event, [[Die Wende|the Berlin wall]] had been breached by demonstrators on the eastern side early in November 1989, and when it became clear that the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|fraternal Soviet troops]] had no instructions to prevent people from crossing it, the gate was seen to have been left open for a [[German reunification|reunification]] process that now appeared unstoppable.   \n{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%|\n:::'''Rolf Henrich: Published Works'''\n* ''Der vormundschaftliche Staat.

Rolf Henrich participated in the Round Table discussions on behalf of [[New Forum]].<ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRH/> Henrich set himself two principal tasks within the process.   The hated [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] had to be abolished.   There had been some suggestion that the institution might be reconfigured as a new \"National Security Agency\" (''\"Amt f\u00fcr Nationale Sicherheit\"'').   For Henrich, that would have been a mere re-labeling and as such totally unacceptable.<ref name=BerKurRH/> His second task was to help draft and enact a new election law for [[East Germany]], and to set a date for a democratically configured election to take place.<ref name=BerKurRH/> On 18 March 1990 the first, and as matters turned out, last, free [[1990 East German general election|parliamentary election]] in the history of the [[German Democratic Republic]] was held.   After this Rolf Henrich was satisfied that his own contribution to the Round Table exercise had been successfully completed.<ref name=BerKurRH/> In November 1989 the de facto ban that seven months earlier had prevented him from working as a lawyer had been revoked and he was by now free to return to work at his lawyer's office in [[Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt]].<ref name=LeMORH/>\n\n===Career options===\nHenrich later told an interviewer that [[Manfred Gerlach]], who had been the East German head of state between 3 December 1989 and 18 March 1990, had offered him a job as President of the [[Supreme Court of East Germany|country's Supreme Court]], but Henrich turned down that job along with an invitation to take a government post as secretary of state in the Ministry of Justice.   Henrich evidently thought he might have independence issues or become a \"figleaf\" with a high-profile post in the East German judicial-political establishment.  To maximize legitimacy, such jobs should go to an \"outsider\".<ref name=BerKurRH/>\n\nThere had also been a project involving the [[Gruner + Jahr]] publishing conglomerate to set up a pan-regional daily newspaper called \"Die Ostdeutsche\", based on the model of the highly successful [[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]].   That project failed because the newspaper market turned out to be overcrowded already.<ref name=BerKurRH/>\n\n[[German reunification]] formally took place in October 1990 and Rolf Henrich returned to his life as a provincial lawyer in [[Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt]].   His public profile never entirely vanished, however:  he continued to give occasional press interviews and to publish the occasional book.   In the courts he has worked as a defense lawyer in controversial cases including those involving former East German border guards charged in connection with shootings at the [[Berlin Wall]].<ref name=rev89RH/>\n\n==Awards and honours==\n* 2000 [[:de:Deutscher Nationalpreis|German National prize]] of the [[:de:Deutsche Nationalstiftung|German National Foundation]]<ref name=LeMORH/> (joint winner)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Henrich, Rolf}}\n[[Category:German lawyers]]\n[[Category:East German dissidents]]\n[[Category:Socialist Unity Party of Germany members]]\n[[Category:New Forum (East Germany) members]]\n[[Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany politicians]]\n[[Category:1944 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:German male writers]]\n[[Category:People of the Stasi]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix duplicate ref names \u2013You can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolf_Henrich"}
