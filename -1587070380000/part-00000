Knaphus]], located on [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake City, Utah]]\n\nThe '''Mormon pioneers''' were members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), also known as [[Latter Day Saint|Latter-day Saints]], who [[Human migration|migrated]] in the mid-1840s across the [[United States]] from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in what is today the [[U.S. state]] of [[Utah]]. At the time of the planning of the exodus in 1846, the territory was owned by the [[History of Mexico#First Republic|Republic of Mexico]], which soon after went to [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with the United States]] over the annexation of Texas. Salt Lake Valley became American territory as a result of this war.\n\nThe journey was taken by about 70,000 people beginning with advance parties sent out by church leaders in March 1846 after the 1844 martyrdom of the church's leader [[Joseph Smith]] made it clear that the group could not remain in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]{{mdash}}which the church had recently purchased, improved, renamed, and developed because of the [[Missouri Mormon War]], setting off the [[Illinois Mormon War]]. The well-organized [[wagon train]] migration began in earnest in April 1847, and the period (including the flight from Missouri in 1838 to Nauvoo), known as the ''Mormon Exodus'' is, by convention among social scientists, traditionally assumed to have ended with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. Not everyone could afford to transport a family by railroad, and the transcontinental railroad network only serviced limited main routes, so [[Emigrant Trail|wagon train migrations]] to the [[Western United States|far west]] continued sporadically until the 20th century.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Background of the migration==\n[[File:LDS1846-1869.svg|right|thumb|350px|Map showing the westward exodus of the LDS Church between 1846 and 1869. Also shown are a portion of the route followed by the Mormon Battalion and the path followed by the handcart companies to the Mormon Trail.]]\n\nSince its founding in 1830, members of the LDS Church were often harshly treated by their neighbors, partially due to their religious beliefs, sometimes as a reaction against the actions and the words of the church leaders and members. These and other reasons caused the body of the church to move from one place to another\u2014to [[Ohio]], [[Missouri]], and then to [[Illinois]], where they built the city of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. [[Sidney Rigdon]] was the First Counselor in the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], and as its spokesman, Rigdon preached several controversial sermons in Missouri, including the [[Salt Sermon]] and the [[Rigdon's July 4th oration|July 4th Oration]].<ref>[[s:Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri]], 1838</ref> These speeches have sometimes been seen as contributing to the conflict known as the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] in Missouri. As a result of the conflict, the Mormons were expelled from the state by Governor Boggs, and Rigdon and Smith were arrested and imprisoned in [[Liberty Jail]]. Rigdon was released on a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and made his way to [[Illinois]], where he joined the main body of Mormon refugees in 1839. In 1844, Smith, and his brother, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], were [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|killed]] by a mob while in custody in the city of [[Carthage, Illinois]]. In 1846, religious tensions reached their peak, and in 1848 mobs burned the Latter-day Saint [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] in [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo]].\n\nAccording to church belief, God inspired [[Brigham Young]], (Joseph Smith's successor as [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]]), to call for the Saints (as church members call themselves) to organize and head West, beyond the western frontier of the United States (into what was then [[Mexico]], though the U.S. Army had already [[Capture of Santa Fe|captured Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] and the settled parts of [[Alta California]] in late 1846). During the winter of 1846\u201347, Latter-day Saint leaders in [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]] and [[Iowa]] laid plans for the migration of the large number of Saints, their equipment, and their livestock. It was here that Young first met [[Thomas L. Kane]], a non-Mormon from Philadelphia with deep personal connections to the [[James K. Polk|Polk]] administration. Kane obtained permission for the Mormons to winter on Indian territory, and the site was originally called Kanesville. Young continued to trust Kane throughout his own lifetime, particularly as an intermediary with the often hostile [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]]. This major undertaking was a significant test of leadership capability and the existing administrative network of the recently restructured church. For his role in the migration, Brigham Young is sometimes referred to as the \"American [[Moses]].\"\n\nYoung personally reviewed all available information on the [[Salt Lake Valley]] and the [[Great Basin]], consulting with [[mountain man|mountain men]] and [[Trapping (Animal)|trappers]] who traveled through Winter Quarters, and meeting with Father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet]], a [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] familiar with the Great Basin. The wary Young insisted the Mormons should settle in a location no one else wanted, and felt the Salt Lake Valley met that requirement but would provide the Saints with many advantages as well.\n\n==Vanguard company of 1847==\nBrigham Young organized a [[wikt:vanguard#English|vanguard]] company to break the trail west to the [[Rocky Mountains]], gather information about trail conditions, including water sources and native tribes, and to ultimately select the central gathering point in the Great Basin. The initial company would select and break the primary trail with the expectation that later pioneers would maintain and improve it. It was hoped that the group could, wherever possible, establish [[Ford (crossing)|fords]] and [[Ferry|ferries]] and plant crops for later harvest. In late February, plans were made to gather portable boats, maps, scientific instruments, farm implements and seeds. Techniques for irrigating crops were investigated. A new route on the north side of the [[Platte River]] was chosen to avoid major interaction with travelers using the established [[Oregon Trail]] on the river's south side. Given the needs of the large volume of Saints who would travel west, Church leaders decided to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access and campsites.\n\n[[File:Winter Quarters by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Winter Quarters]]\nIn April 1847, Young consulted with members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] who had recently returned from the British mission. [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]], [[Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Orson Hyde]] brought money contributed by the English Saints, a map based on [[John C. Fremont]]'s recent western expedition, and instruments for calculating latitude, elevation, temperature and barometric pressure. Chosen members of the vanguard group were gathered together, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into military companies. The group consisted of 143 men, including three blacks and eight members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, one cannon, 93 horses, 52 mules, 66 oxen, 19 cows, 17 dogs and some chickens, and carried enough supplies to fully provision the group for one year. Young divided this group into 14 companies, each with a designated captain. Apprehensive of possible [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] danger, a [[militia]] and night guard was formed under the direction of [[Stephen Markham]].\n\n[[File:Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska]]\n\nOn April 5, 1847, at 2 p.m., the wagon train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin. With the afternoon start, they made three miles (5&nbsp;km) and camped in a line a few hundred yards from a stand of timber. Journal records show that Young actively managed the journey, supervising details and occasionally giving reprimands when evening and Sunday recreation became rowdy or group members failed to complete their tasks. On one occasion, he chastised the camp's hunters ''for being wasteful of flesh ... killing more than was really needed.'' <ref>May, Dean L. ''Utah: A People's History'' p. 57. Bonneville Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1987. {{ISBN|0-87480-284-9}}.</ref> Camp was awakened by a bugle at 5 a.m. and the company was expected to be prepared for travel by 7 a.m.. Each day's travel ended at 8:30&nbsp;p.m. and the camp was in bed by 9 p.m.. The company traveled six days during the week, but generally stayed in camp on Sunday to observe the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].\n\nSome camp members were assigned specific tasks. [[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]] was appointed company scribe and was expected to record an accurate description of their journey and the distance they traveled each day. After three weeks, Clayton grew tired of personally counting the revolutions of a wagon wheel and computing the day's distance by multiplying the count by the wheel's circumference. After consulting with [[Orson Pratt]], an accomplished mathematician, he designed a mechanism consisting of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism \"counting\" or recording by position the revolutions of the wheel. Clayton's design, which he called the ''roadometer'', is the basis for most modern [[odometer]]s. The apparatus was built to Clayton and Pratt's specifications by the company's carpenter Appleton Milo Harmon and was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847. The ''roadometer'' showed that the company averaged between fourteen and twenty miles per day. [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostle]] Orson Pratt was named the company's scientific observer. He made regular readings on scientific instruments, took notes on geological formations and mineral resources, and described plants and animals. Journals kept by both Clayton and Pratt have become valuable resources for historians of the Mormon trek west.\n\nWomen of the company also performed vital tasks along the way. While much time was spent on traditional activities such as cooking, sewing, and tending children, several women served as scribes and diary keepers. Harriet Page Young, wife of Lorenzo Young, was the first woman selected for the company. She was in ill health and Lorenzo Young feared to leave her and their young children behind. The other original women of the company, Ellen Sanders Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball, and Clarissa Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young, were asked to accompany the group to look after Harriet Young and keep her company. The three women were joined by a larger group of women church members from [[Mississippi]] who merged with the main party at [[Laramie, Wyoming]].\n\n[[File:Entering the Great Salt Lake Valley by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Entering the Great Salt Lake Valley]]\n\nThe first segment of the journey, from Winter Quarters to [[Fort Laramie]], took six weeks, with the company arriving at the fort on June 1. The company halted for repairs and to reshoe the draft animals. While at Fort Laramie, the vanguard company was joined by members of the [[Mormon Battalion]] who had been excused from service due to illness and sent to winter in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Also traveling in the new group were Church members from Mississippi who had taken a more southern route toward the Great Basin. At this point, the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at [[Fort Bridger, Wyoming|Ft. Bridger]]. At a difficult crossing of the Platte, just before encountering the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], the company made use of their portable boat and were able to cross with comparative ease. Seizing the opportunity to both help future travelers and increase the cash available to the migration, nine men under the direction of [[Thomas Grover]] were left behind to construct and operate a ferry at that location. Missourians and other travellers at the river paid the Saints $1.50 or more per wagon to help them cross.\n\nDuring the last week of June, [[Sam Brannan]], leader of the Mormon emigrant ship ''Brooklyn'', met the company near [[Green River, Wyoming]]. He reported to Young about his group's successful journey and their settlement in what is today [[San Francisco, California]]. He urged the vanguard company to continue on to California but was unable to shift the leader's focus away from the Great Basin. Young also met mountain man [[Jim Bridger]] on June 28. They discussed possible routes into the Salt Lake Valley, and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. Bridger was enthusiastic about settlement near Utah Lake, reporting fish, wild fruit, timber and good grazing. He told Young that local Indians raised good crops, including corn and pumpkins, but that there was ever-present danger of frost. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by thirteen more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.\n\nThe vanguard company now faced a more rugged and hazardous journey, and were concerned about negotiating the passes of the Rocky Mountains. They had received conflicting advice, but Young chose to follow the trail used by the [[Donner Party|Donner-Reed party]] on their journey to California the previous year. Shortly after leaving Fort Bridger, the group met trapper [[Miles Goodyear]], who owned a trading post at the mouth of the Weber River. He was enthusiastic about the agricultural potential of the large Weber Valley. During the trip through the rugged mountains, the vanguard company divided into three sections. Since crossing the Green River, several members of the party had suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a \"mountain fever\" probably induced by wood [[tick]]s. Young himself became ill soon after meeting Goodyear. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move ahead on the designated route.\n\nIn July 1847 the first company reached the Salt Lake Valley, with scouts [[Erastus Snow]] and [[Orson Pratt]] entering the valley on July 21. Pratt wrote: ''...we could not refrain from a shout of joy, which almost involuntarily escaped from our lips the moment this grand and lovely scenery was within our view.'' The two scouts undertook a twelve-mile (19&nbsp;km) exploratory circuit into the valley before returning to the larger party. The next day, larger segments of the valley were explored, streams and hot springs investigated and the first camp established in the Salt Lake Valley. On July 23, Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord. Ground was broken, irrigation ditches were dug, and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted.\n\nOn July 24, Young first saw the valley from a \"sick\" wagon driven by his friend [[Wilford Woodruff]]. According to Woodruff, Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared \"This is the right place, drive on.\" Today a [[This is the Place Monument|monument]] stands in the spot where he made this declaration. Young later reported that he had seen the valley, including Ensign Peak, in a vision and recognized the spot.\n\nOn July 28, Young established a location for the future [[Salt Lake Temple]] and presented a city plan to the larger group for their approval. In August 1847, Young and other selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters. By December 1847, more than two thousand Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Several hundred, including Young, returned east to gather and organize the companies scheduled for following years. Demographic estimates place 1,611 pioneers in the valley of the Great Salt Lake during the winter of 1847. The adult labor force, however, was quite small as a high percentage of the group, 53.2 percent were under the age of nineteen. Twenty five percent of the total were children under the age of eight.<ref>Walker and Dant, p. 318</ref>\n\nEach year during the Mormon migration, people continued to be organized into \"companies\", each company bearing the name of its leader. The company was further divided into groups of 10 and 50 with authority and responsibility delegated downward.\n\n==Travel conditions==\nThe pioneers traveled to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in the Great Basin using mainly large farm wagons, [[Mormon handcart pioneers|handcarts]], and, in some cases, personally carrying their belongings.<ref group=notes>According to the American Studies researchers involved with the [[Oregon Trail II]] game, such wagons had a cargo capacity of about 3,000 pounds and weighed another thousand themselves.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}</ref> Their trail along the north bank of the [[Platte River]] and [[North Platte River]] and over the [[continental divide]] climbing up to [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] and [[Pacific Springs]] from [[Fort Laramie|Fort John]] along the valley of the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] and then down to [[Fort Bridger]] and thence down to the [[Great Salt Lake]] became known as the [[Mormon Trail]].\n\nFinancial resources of the church members varied, with many families suffering from the loss of land and personal possessions in [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]]. This impacted the resources and supplies each family could draw upon as they covered the more than {{convert|1000|mi|km|-3}} to the Great Basin. Church funds were also limited at this time, but church leaders provided what funding and other material assistance they could to families and companies which were under supplied.\n\nCovered wagons pulled by oxen were common, particularly in the early American companies. In October 1845, as LDS members were preparing to leave Nauvoo, the ''[[Nauvoo Neighbor]]'' printed an extensive list of suggested provisions for each family wagon. The provisions included two to three yoke of oxen, two milk cows, other livestock, arms and ammunition, 15&nbsp;lb of iron, pulleys and ropes, fishing gear, farming and mechanical equipment, cooking equipment and at least 1000 pounds of flour plus assorted other foodstuffs. Some pioneers overestimated the amount of goods they could haul on the long journey. As the oxen weakened under the strain, wagons were lightened by discarding prized possessions, including book collections, family china and furniture. In 1847, just east of the Rocky Mountains, the Kimball family dug a large hole, wrapped their piano in buffalo skins and carefully buried it. An ox team retrieved the instrument the following spring and transported it to the Salt Lake Valley.<ref>Slaughter, William and Landon, Michael. \"Trail of Hope: The Story of the Mormon Trail\". p. 23, 24. Deseret Book Company, Salt Lake City, 1997.</ref>\n\nSeveral later companies were largely made up of people with fewer resources, who pulled or pushed handcarts (similar to [[wheelbarrow]]s) holding all of their provisions and personal belongings. Many of these pioneers walked much of the way as family members rode in the carts.\n\nDue to the weather in the American heartland, the best time to travel was April\u2013September. Some companies, however, started late in the season which resulted in hardship and sometimes disaster. The most famous of these are the Willie and the Martin handcart companies. Leaving Iowa in July 1856, they did not reach Utah until November, suffering many deaths due to winter weather and the lack of adequate supplies.\n\n==The ship ''Brooklyn''{{anchor|The ship Brooklyn}}==\nIn November 1845 [[Samuel Brannan]], newspaperman and small-scale publisher of the Mormon paper ''[[The Prophet (newspaper)|The Prophet]]'' (later the ''New York Messenger''), was directed by church elders to charter a ship that would carry its passengers away from the eastern United States to California, which was then part of Mexico. Over the course of two months, Brannan managed to recruit 70 men, 68 women, and 100 children\u2014238 persons total. Brannan negotiated a fare of $75 for adults and half-fare for children with the Captain Abel W. Richardson, master and a principal owner of the ship ''Brooklyn''.<ref name=\"Sonne, Conway B. pages 33\">Sonne, Conway B.

The ship ''Brooklyn'' sailed from Brooklyn Harbor, New York, and traveled south across the Atlantic equator, around [[Cape Horn]], stopping at the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]], then to the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] ([[Hawaii]]), finally docking in [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (now [[San Francisco]]) on July 29, 1846, having made the sea voyage in five months and twenty-seven days.\n\n[[Augusta Joyce Crocheron]], a passenger on the ship ''Brooklyn'', described the voyage:\n{{quote|As for the pleasure of the trip, we met disappointment, for we once lay becalmed in the tropics, and at another time we were \"hatched below\" during a terrific storm. Women and children were at night lashed to their berths, for in no other way could they keep in. Furniture rolled back and forth endangering limb and life.

However, they arrived in Mexican [[Alta California]] just weeks after its occupation by the United States Navy at the outset of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Despite the tensions that drove them from their homes in the Eastern States, the crew and passengers \"felt more cheerful and secure.\" Mormon historian [[B. H. Roberts]] noted in his work ''A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints'':\n\n{{quote|On the announcement of the United States naval officer, who boarded the ''Brooklyn'' as she came to anchor, that the emigrants \"were in the United States of America,\" three hearty cheers were given in reply...

They created irrigation systems, laid out farms, built houses, churches and schools. Access to water was crucial. Almost immediately, Brigham Young sent out scouting parties to identify and claim additional community sites. While it was difficult to find large areas in the [[Great Basin]] where water sources were dependable and growing seasons long enough to raise vitally important subsistence crops, satellite communities began to be formed in all directions. Church members eventually headed south into present-day Arizona and Mexico, west into California, north into Idaho and Canada, and east into Wyoming, settling many communities in those areas.  As they encountered local populations, they occupied their land, killed resisters and called on the federal government to remove them from their homes.  Mormons believed that God had given the land to them and were prepared to kill the Native Americans in order to take possession of their lands.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/the-mormons-and-the-indians/|title=Establishing Zion|author=Eugene E.

In 1848, pioneers moved into lands purchased from trapper [[Miles Goodyear]] in present-day [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]]. In 1849, [[Tooele, Utah|Tooele]] and [[Fort Utah]] in modern-day [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] were founded.

In 1855, efforts to subdue and evangelize to local native cultures led to outposts in [[Fort Lemhi]] on Idaho's [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] and [[Elk Mountain, Utah|Elk Mountain]] in east-central of present-day Utah.\n\nThe experiences of returning members of the [[Mormon Battalion]] were also important in establishing new communities. On their journey west, the Mormon soldiers had identified dependable rivers and fertile river valleys in Colorado, Arizona and southern California. In addition, as the discharged men traveled to rejoin their families in the Salt Lake Valley, they moved through southern Nevada and southern Utah. [[Jefferson Hunt]], senior Mormon officer of the Battalion, actively searched for settlement sites, minerals and other resources. His report encouraged 1851 settlement efforts in Iron Country, near present-day [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]]. These southern explorations eventually led to Mormon settlements in [[St. George, Utah]], Las Vegas and [[San Bernardino, California]], as well as communities in southern Arizona. By 1885, Mormon communities were being established in [[Mormon colonies in Mexico|northern Mexico]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:BrighamYoungCemetery.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument]] in [[Salt Lake City]]]]\nThe Mormon pioneers are celebrated annually on July 24 in the [[State of Utah]], known as [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]].

At the time of the planning of the exodus in 1846, the territory was owned by the [[History of Mexico#First Republic|Republic of Mexico]], which soon after went to [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with the United States]] over the annexation of Texas. Salt Lake Valley became American territory as a result of this war.\n\nThe journey was taken by about 70,000 people beginning with advance parties sent out by church leaders in March 1846 after the 1844 martyrdom of the church's leader [[Joseph Smith]] made it clear that the group could not remain in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]{{mdash}}which the church had recently purchased, improved, renamed, and developed because of the [[Missouri Mormon War]], setting off the [[Illinois Mormon War]]. The well-organized [[wagon train]] migration began in earnest in April 1847, and the period (including the flight from Missouri in 1838 to Nauvoo), known as the ''Mormon Exodus'' is, by convention among social scientists, traditionally assumed to have ended with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. Not everyone could afford to transport a family by railroad, and the transcontinental railroad network only serviced limited main routes, so [[Emigrant Trail|wagon train migrations]] to the [[Western United States|far west]] continued sporadically until the 20th century.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Background of the migration==\n[[File:LDS1846-1869.svg|right|thumb|350px|Map showing the westward exodus of the LDS Church between 1846 and 1869.

These and other reasons caused the body of the church to move from one place to another\u2014to [[Ohio]], [[Missouri]], and then to [[Illinois]], where they built the city of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]]. [[Sidney Rigdon]] was the First Counselor in the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], and as its spokesman, Rigdon preached several controversial sermons in Missouri, including the [[Salt Sermon]] and the [[Rigdon's July 4th oration|July 4th Oration]].<ref>[[s:Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri|Oration Delivered by Mr. S. Rigdon on the 4th of July at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri]], 1838</ref> These speeches have sometimes been seen as contributing to the conflict known as the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]] in Missouri. As a result of the conflict, the Mormons were expelled from the state by Governor Boggs, and Rigdon and Smith were arrested and imprisoned in [[Liberty Jail]]. Rigdon was released on a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and made his way to [[Illinois]], where he joined the main body of Mormon refugees in 1839. In 1844, Smith, and his brother, [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], were [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|killed]] by a mob while in custody in the city of [[Carthage, Illinois]]. In 1846, religious tensions reached their peak, and in 1848 mobs burned the Latter-day Saint [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] in [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo]].\n\nAccording to church belief, God inspired [[Brigham Young]], (Joseph Smith's successor as [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]]), to call for the Saints (as church members call themselves) to organize and head West, beyond the western frontier of the United States (into what was then [[Mexico]], though the U.S. Army had already [[Capture of Santa Fe|captured Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] and the settled parts of [[Alta California]] in late 1846). During the winter of 1846\u201347, Latter-day Saint leaders in [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]] and [[Iowa]] laid plans for the migration of the large number of Saints, their equipment, and their livestock. It was here that Young first met [[Thomas L. Kane]], a non-Mormon from Philadelphia with deep personal connections to the [[James K. Polk|Polk]] administration. Kane obtained permission for the Mormons to winter on Indian territory, and the site was originally called Kanesville. Young continued to trust Kane throughout his own lifetime, particularly as an intermediary with the often hostile [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]]. This major undertaking was a significant test of leadership capability and the existing administrative network of the recently restructured church. For his role in the migration, Brigham Young is sometimes referred to as the \"American [[Moses]].\"\n\nYoung personally reviewed all available information on the [[Salt Lake Valley]] and the [[Great Basin]], consulting with [[mountain man|mountain men]] and [[Trapping (Animal)|trappers]] who traveled through Winter Quarters, and meeting with Father [[Pierre-Jean De Smet]], a [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] familiar with the Great Basin. The wary Young insisted the Mormons should settle in a location no one else wanted, and felt the Salt Lake Valley met that requirement but would provide the Saints with many advantages as well.\n\n==Vanguard company of 1847==\nBrigham Young organized a [[wikt:vanguard#English|vanguard]] company to break the trail west to the [[Rocky Mountains]], gather information about trail conditions, including water sources and native tribes, and to ultimately select the central gathering point in the Great Basin. The initial company would select and break the primary trail with the expectation that later pioneers would maintain and improve it. It was hoped that the group could, wherever possible, establish [[Ford (crossing)|fords]] and [[Ferry|ferries]] and plant crops for later harvest. In late February, plans were made to gather portable boats, maps, scientific instruments, farm implements and seeds. Techniques for irrigating crops were investigated. A new route on the north side of the [[Platte River]] was chosen to avoid major interaction with travelers using the established [[Oregon Trail]] on the river's south side. Given the needs of the large volume of Saints who would travel west, Church leaders decided to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access and campsites.\n\n[[File:Winter Quarters by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Winter Quarters]]\nIn April 1847, Young consulted with members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] who had recently returned from the British mission. [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]], [[Parley P. Pratt]] and [[Orson Hyde]] brought money contributed by the English Saints, a map based on [[John C. Fremont]]'s recent western expedition, and instruments for calculating latitude, elevation, temperature and barometric pressure. Chosen members of the vanguard group were gathered together, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into military companies. The group consisted of 143 men, including three blacks and eight members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, one cannon, 93 horses, 52 mules, 66 oxen, 19 cows, 17 dogs and some chickens, and carried enough supplies to fully provision the group for one year. Young divided this group into 14 companies, each with a designated captain. Apprehensive of possible [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] danger, a [[militia]] and night guard was formed under the direction of [[Stephen Markham]].\n\n[[File:Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Pioneers Crossing the Plains of Nebraska]]\n\nOn April 5, 1847, at 2 p.m., the wagon train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin. With the afternoon start, they made three miles (5&nbsp;km) and camped in a line a few hundred yards from a stand of timber. Journal records show that Young actively managed the journey, supervising details and occasionally giving reprimands when evening and Sunday recreation became rowdy or group members failed to complete their tasks. On one occasion, he chastised the camp's hunters ''for being wasteful of flesh ... killing more than was really needed.'' <ref>May, Dean L. ''Utah: A People's History'' p. 57. Bonneville Books, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1987. {{ISBN|0-87480-284-9}}.</ref> Camp was awakened by a bugle at 5 a.m. and the company was expected to be prepared for travel by 7 a.m.. Each day's travel ended at 8:30&nbsp;p.m. and the camp was in bed by 9 p.m.. The company traveled six days during the week, but generally stayed in camp on Sunday to observe the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].\n\nSome camp members were assigned specific tasks. [[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]] was appointed company scribe and was expected to record an accurate description of their journey and the distance they traveled each day. After three weeks, Clayton grew tired of personally counting the revolutions of a wagon wheel and computing the day's distance by multiplying the count by the wheel's circumference. After consulting with [[Orson Pratt]], an accomplished mathematician, he designed a mechanism consisting of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism \"counting\" or recording by position the revolutions of the wheel. Clayton's design, which he called the ''roadometer'', is the basis for most modern [[odometer]]s. The apparatus was built to Clayton and Pratt's specifications by the company's carpenter Appleton Milo Harmon and was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847. The ''roadometer'' showed that the company averaged between fourteen and twenty miles per day. [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Apostle]] Orson Pratt was named the company's scientific observer. He made regular readings on scientific instruments, took notes on geological formations and mineral resources, and described plants and animals. Journals kept by both Clayton and Pratt have become valuable resources for historians of the Mormon trek west.\n\nWomen of the company also performed vital tasks along the way. While much time was spent on traditional activities such as cooking, sewing, and tending children, several women served as scribes and diary keepers. Harriet Page Young, wife of Lorenzo Young, was the first woman selected for the company. She was in ill health and Lorenzo Young feared to leave her and their young children behind. The other original women of the company, Ellen Sanders Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball, and Clarissa Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young, were asked to accompany the group to look after Harriet Young and keep her company. The three women were joined by a larger group of women church members from [[Mississippi]] who merged with the main party at [[Laramie, Wyoming]].\n\n[[File:Entering the Great Salt Lake Valley by C.C.A. Christensen.png|300px|right|thumbnail|Entering the Great Salt Lake Valley]]\n\nThe first segment of the journey, from Winter Quarters to [[Fort Laramie]], took six weeks, with the company arriving at the fort on June 1. The company halted for repairs and to reshoe the draft animals. While at Fort Laramie, the vanguard company was joined by members of the [[Mormon Battalion]] who had been excused from service due to illness and sent to winter in [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. Also traveling in the new group were Church members from Mississippi who had taken a more southern route toward the Great Basin. At this point, the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at [[Fort Bridger, Wyoming|Ft. Bridger]]. At a difficult crossing of the Platte, just before encountering the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], the company made use of their portable boat and were able to cross with comparative ease. Seizing the opportunity to both help future travelers and increase the cash available to the migration, nine men under the direction of [[Thomas Grover]] were left behind to construct and operate a ferry at that location. Missourians and other travellers at the river paid the Saints $1.50 or more per wagon to help them cross.\n\nDuring the last week of June, [[Sam Brannan]], leader of the Mormon emigrant ship ''Brooklyn'', met the company near [[Green River, Wyoming]]. He reported to Young about his group's successful journey and their settlement in what is today [[San Francisco, California]]. He urged the vanguard company to continue on to California but was unable to shift the leader's focus away from the Great Basin. Young also met mountain man [[Jim Bridger]] on June 28. They discussed possible routes into the Salt Lake Valley, and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. Bridger was enthusiastic about settlement near Utah Lake, reporting fish, wild fruit, timber and good grazing. He told Young that local Indians raised good crops, including corn and pumpkins, but that there was ever-present danger of frost. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by thirteen more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.\n\nThe vanguard company now faced a more rugged and hazardous journey, and were concerned about negotiating the passes of the Rocky Mountains. They had received conflicting advice, but Young chose to follow the trail used by the [[Donner Party|Donner-Reed party]] on their journey to California the previous year. Shortly after leaving Fort Bridger, the group met trapper [[Miles Goodyear]], who owned a trading post at the mouth of the Weber River. He was enthusiastic about the agricultural potential of the large Weber Valley. During the trip through the rugged mountains, the vanguard company divided into three sections. Since crossing the Green River, several members of the party had suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a \"mountain fever\" probably induced by wood [[tick]]s. Young himself became ill soon after meeting Goodyear. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move ahead on the designated route.\n\nIn July 1847 the first company reached the Salt Lake Valley, with scouts [[Erastus Snow]] and [[Orson Pratt]] entering the valley on July 21. Pratt wrote: ''...we could not refrain from a shout of joy, which almost involuntarily escaped from our lips the moment this grand and lovely scenery was within our view.'' The two scouts undertook a twelve-mile (19&nbsp;km) exploratory circuit into the valley before returning to the larger party. The next day, larger segments of the valley were explored, streams and hot springs investigated and the first camp established in the Salt Lake Valley. On July 23, Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord. Ground was broken, irrigation ditches were dug, and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted.\n\nOn July 24, Young first saw the valley from a \"sick\" wagon driven by his friend [[Wilford Woodruff]]. According to Woodruff, Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared \"This is the right place, drive on.\" Today a [[This is the Place Monument|monument]] stands in the spot where he made this declaration. Young later reported that he had seen the valley, including Ensign Peak, in a vision and recognized the spot.\n\nOn July 28, Young established a location for the future [[Salt Lake Temple]] and presented a city plan to the larger group for their approval. In August 1847, Young and other selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters. By December 1847, more than two thousand Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Several hundred, including Young, returned east to gather and organize the companies scheduled for following years. Demographic estimates place 1,611 pioneers in the valley of the Great Salt Lake during the winter of 1847. The adult labor force, however, was quite small as a high percentage of the group, 53.2 percent were under the age of nineteen. Twenty five percent of the total were children under the age of eight.<ref>Walker and Dant, p. 318</ref>\n\nEach year during the Mormon migration, people continued to be organized into \"companies\", each company bearing the name of its leader. The company was further divided into groups of 10 and 50 with authority and responsibility delegated downward.\n\n==Travel conditions==\nThe pioneers traveled to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in the Great Basin using mainly large farm wagons, [[Mormon handcart pioneers|handcarts]], and, in some cases, personally carrying their belongings.<ref group=notes>According to the American Studies researchers involved with the [[Oregon Trail II]] game, such wagons had a cargo capacity of about 3,000 pounds and weighed another thousand themselves.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}</ref> Their trail along the north bank of the [[Platte River]] and [[North Platte River]] and over the [[continental divide]] climbing up to [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] and [[Pacific Springs]] from [[Fort Laramie|Fort John]] along the valley of the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] and then down to [[Fort Bridger]] and thence down to the [[Great Salt Lake]] became known as the [[Mormon Trail]].\n\nFinancial resources of the church members varied, with many families suffering from the loss of land and personal possessions in [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]]. This impacted the resources and supplies each family could draw upon as they covered the more than {{convert|1000|mi|km|-3}} to the Great Basin. Church funds were also limited at this time, but church leaders provided what funding and other material assistance they could to families and companies which were under supplied.\n\nCovered wagons pulled by oxen were common, particularly in the early American companies. In October 1845, as LDS members were preparing to leave Nauvoo, the ''[[Nauvoo Neighbor]]'' printed an extensive list of suggested provisions for each family wagon. The provisions included two to three yoke of oxen, two milk cows, other livestock, arms and ammunition, 15&nbsp;lb of iron, pulleys and ropes, fishing gear, farming and mechanical equipment, cooking equipment and at least 1000 pounds of flour plus assorted other foodstuffs. Some pioneers overestimated the amount of goods they could haul on the long journey. As the oxen weakened under the strain, wagons were lightened by discarding prized possessions, including book collections, family china and furniture. In 1847, just east of the Rocky Mountains, the Kimball family dug a large hole, wrapped their piano in buffalo skins and carefully buried it. An ox team retrieved the instrument the following spring and transported it to the Salt Lake Valley.<ref>Slaughter, William and Landon, Michael. \"Trail of Hope: The Story of the Mormon Trail\". p. 23, 24. Deseret Book Company, Salt Lake City, 1997.</ref>\n\nSeveral later companies were largely made up of people with fewer resources, who pulled or pushed handcarts (similar to [[wheelbarrow]]s) holding all of their provisions and personal belongings. Many of these pioneers walked much of the way as family members rode in the carts.\n\nDue to the weather in the American heartland, the best time to travel was April\u2013September. Some companies, however, started late in the season which resulted in hardship and sometimes disaster. The most famous of these are the Willie and the Martin handcart companies. Leaving Iowa in July 1856, they did not reach Utah until November, suffering many deaths due to winter weather and the lack of adequate supplies.\n\n==The ship ''Brooklyn''{{anchor|The ship Brooklyn}}==\nIn November 1845 [[Samuel Brannan]], newspaperman and small-scale publisher of the Mormon paper ''[[The Prophet (newspaper)|The Prophet]]'' (later the ''New York Messenger''), was directed by church elders to charter a ship that would carry its passengers away from the eastern United States to California, which was then part of Mexico. Over the course of two months, Brannan managed to recruit 70 men, 68 women, and 100 children\u2014238 persons total. Brannan negotiated a fare of $75 for adults and half-fare for children with the Captain Abel W. Richardson, master and a principal owner of the ship ''Brooklyn''.<ref name=\"Sonne, Conway B. pages 33\">Sonne, Conway B.

The ship ''Brooklyn'' sailed from Brooklyn Harbor, New York, and traveled south across the Atlantic equator, around [[Cape Horn]], stopping at the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]], then to the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] ([[Hawaii]]), finally docking in [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (now [[San Francisco]]) on July 29, 1846, having made the sea voyage in five months and twenty-seven days.\n\n[[Augusta Joyce Crocheron]], a passenger on the ship ''Brooklyn'', described the voyage:\n{{quote|As for the pleasure of the trip, we met disappointment, for we once lay becalmed in the tropics, and at another time we were \"hatched below\" during a terrific storm.

They created irrigation systems, laid out farms, built houses, churches and schools. Access to water was crucial. Almost immediately, Brigham Young sent out scouting parties to identify and claim additional community sites. While it was difficult to find large areas in the [[Great Basin]] where water sources were dependable and growing seasons long enough to raise vitally important subsistence crops, satellite communities began to be formed in all directions. Church members eventually headed south into present-day Arizona and Mexico, west into California, north into Idaho and Canada, and east into Wyoming, settling many communities in those areas.  As they encountered local populations, they occupied their land, killed resisters and called on the federal government to remove them from their homes.  Mormons believed that God had given the land to them and were prepared to kill the Native Americans in order to take possession of their lands.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/the-mormons-and-the-indians/|title=Establishing Zion|author=Eugene E.

In 1855, efforts to subdue and evangelize to local native cultures led to outposts in [[Fort Lemhi]] on Idaho's [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] and [[Elk Mountain, Utah|Elk Mountain]] in east-central of present-day Utah.\n\nThe experiences of returning members of the [[Mormon Battalion]] were also important in establishing new communities. On their journey west, the Mormon soldiers had identified dependable rivers and fertile river valleys in Colorado, Arizona and southern California. In addition, as the discharged men traveled to rejoin their families in the Salt Lake Valley, they moved through southern Nevada and southern Utah. [[Jefferson Hunt]], senior Mormon officer of the Battalion, actively searched for settlement sites, minerals and other resources. His report encouraged 1851 settlement efforts in Iron Country, near present-day [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]]. These southern explorations eventually led to Mormon settlements in [[St. George, Utah]], Las Vegas and [[San Bernardino, California]], as well as communities in southern Arizona. By 1885, Mormon communities were being established in [[Mormon colonies in Mexico|northern Mexico]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:BrighamYoungCemetery.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument]] in [[Salt Lake City]]]]\nThe Mormon pioneers are celebrated annually on July 24 in the [[State of Utah]], known as [[Pioneer Day (Utah)|Pioneer Day]].

Since 1993, the court has also travelled, once or twice a year, to another part of the state to hear several cases as part of its \"Justice on Wheels\" program. The purpose of this program is to give the people of Wisconsin a better opportunity to understand the operations of the state supreme court and the court system.<ref>[https://www.wicourts.gov/courts/resources/wheels.htm Justice on Wheels]. Wisconsin Court System. Accessed February 20, 2018.</ref>\n\n==Justices==\nThe [[court]] is composed of seven [[justices]] who are elected in statewide, non-partisan elections. Each justice is elected for a ten-year term. Importantly, only one justice may be elected in any year. This avoids the sudden shifts in jurisprudence commonly seen in other state supreme courts, where the court composition can be radically shifted if two or three justices are simultaneously targeted for an electoral challenge based on their views on controversial issues. In the event of a vacancy on the court, the [[Governor of Wisconsin|governor]] has the power to appoint an individual to the vacancy, but that justice must then stand for election in the first year in which no other justice's term expires.\n\nAfter passage of a referendum on April 7, 2015, the [[chief justice]] of the court is elected for a term of 2 years by the vote of a majority of the justices then serving on the court, although the justice so elected may decline the appointment. Previous to the change, the justice with the [[Seniority#In politics|longest continuous service on the court]] served as the chief justice. Opponents of the referendum called it an attempt to remove longtime Chief Justice [[Shirley Abrahamson]], a member of the court's liberal minority, while supporters called it an effort to promote democracy on the court.\n\n===Current justices===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Position\n!Name\n!Years on court\n!Assumed office\n!Age\n!Law School\n!Term Ends\n!Appointed or Elected\n!Succeeded\n|-\n!Chief Justice\n|{{sortname|Patience D.|Roggensack}}\n|{{Age|2003|8|1}}\n|{{dts|August 1, 2003}}\n|{{Age|1940|7|7}}\n|[[University of Wisconsin Law School|Wisconsin]]\n|{{dts|July 31, 2023}}\n|Elected\n|[[William A.

A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'', holding 5-4 that a campaign expenditure of over $3 million by a corporate litigant to influence the election of a judge to the court that would hear its case, although legal, was an \"extreme fact\" that created a \"probability of bias\", thus requiring the judge to be [[recusal|recused]] from hearing the case.<ref>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-22.pdf ''Caperton v.

Voting in favor of the new rule were Prosser, Gableman, Roggensack, and Ziegler. Voting against were Abrahamson, Crooks, and A. Bradley. In the opinion of Justice Roggensack, \"when a judge is disqualified from participation, the votes of all who voted to elect that judge are cancelled for all issues presented by that case. Accordingly, recusal rules . . . must be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest.\" In dissenting, Justice A. Bradley called the decision \"a dramatic change to our judicial code of ethics\" and took issue with the majority's decision to adopt a rule \"proposed by special interest groups.\"<ref name=\"lwv\">[http://www.wisciviljusticecouncil.org/key-issues/legislative-report-special-legislative-committee-studies-judicial-discipline-and-recusal wisciviljusticecouncil.org]; accessed January 28, 2014.</ref>\n\n===Confrontation ===\nOn June 13, 2011, a confrontation between Justices [[David Prosser, Jr.]] and [[Ann Walsh Bradley]] occurred in Bradley's chambers.

Since 1993, the court has also travelled, once or twice a year, to another part of the state to hear several cases as part of its \"Justice on Wheels\" program. The purpose of this program is to give the people of Wisconsin a better opportunity to understand the operations of the state supreme court and the court system.<ref>[https://www.wicourts.gov/courts/resources/wheels.htm Justice on Wheels]. Wisconsin Court System. Accessed February 20, 2018.</ref>\n\n==Justices==\nThe [[court]] is composed of seven [[justices]] who are elected in statewide, non-partisan elections. Each justice is elected for a ten-year term. Importantly, only one justice may be elected in any year. This avoids the sudden shifts in jurisprudence commonly seen in other state supreme courts, where the court composition can be radically shifted if two or three justices are simultaneously targeted for an electoral challenge based on their views on controversial issues. In the event of a vacancy on the court, the [[Governor of Wisconsin|governor]] has the power to appoint an individual to the vacancy, but that justice must then stand for election in the first year in which no other justice's term expires.\n\nAfter passage of a referendum on April 7, 2015, the [[chief justice]] of the court is elected for a term of 2 years by the vote of a majority of the justices then serving on the court, although the justice so elected may decline the appointment. Previous to the change, the justice with the [[Seniority#In politics|longest continuous service on the court]] served as the chief justice. Opponents of the referendum called it an attempt to remove longtime Chief Justice [[Shirley Abrahamson]], a member of the court's liberal minority, while supporters called it an effort to promote democracy on the court.\n\n===Current justices===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Position\n!Name\n!Years on court\n!Assumed office\n!Age\n!Law School\n!Term Ends\n!Appointed or Elected\n!Succeeded\n|-\n!Chief Justice\n|{{sortname|Patience D.|Roggensack}}\n|{{Age|2003|8|1}}\n|{{dts|August 1, 2003}}\n|{{Age|1940|7|7}}\n|[[University of Wisconsin Law School|Wisconsin]]\n|{{dts|July 31, 2023}}\n|Elected\n|[[William A.

Voting in favor of the new rule were Prosser, Gableman, Roggensack, and Ziegler. Voting against were Abrahamson, Crooks, and A. Bradley. In the opinion of Justice Roggensack, \"when a judge is disqualified from participation, the votes of all who voted to elect that judge are cancelled for all issues presented by that case. Accordingly, recusal rules . . . must be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest.\" In dissenting, Justice A.

However, federal law regulates sex as listed on a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, and other federal documents that list sex or name, such as the [[U.S. passport]].  [[Name change#United States|Laws concerning name changes in U.S. jurisdictions]] are also a complex mix of federal and state rules.

In some cases, a parent's transgender status is not weighed in a court decision; in others, rulings are made on the basis of a transgender person being presumed to be an inherently unfit parent.\n\nCourts are generally allowed to base custody or visitation rulings only on factors that directly affect the best interests of the child. According to this principle, if a transgender parent's gender identity cannot be shown to hurt the child, contact should not be limited, and other custody and visitation orders should not be changed for this reason. Many courts have upheld this principle and have treated transgender custody cases like any other child custody determination\u2014by focusing on standard factors such as parental skills. In ''Mayfield v. Mayfield'', for instance, the court upheld a transgender parent's [[shared parenting]] plan because there was no evidence in the record that the parent would not be a \"fit, loving and capable parent.\"<ref name=\"lambdalegal.org\">{{cite web| url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/transgender/trans-parenting-faq| title=FAQ About Transgender Parenting| work=Lambda Legal| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907132020/http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/transgender/trans-parenting-faq| archivedate=September 7, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOther times, courts claiming to consider a child's interests have ruled against the transgender parent, leading to the parent losing access to their children on the basis of their [[gender identity]]. For example, in ''Cisek v. Cisek'', the court terminated a transgender parent's visitation rights, holding that there was a risk of both mental and \"social harm\" to the children. The court asked whether the parent's [[sex change]] was \"simply an indulgence of some fantasy\". An Ohio court imposed an indefinite moratorium on visitation based on the court's belief that it would be emotionally confusing for the children to see \"their father as a woman\".<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Cisek v.

Many states require [[sex reassignment surgery]] to change their name and gender marker.  Also, documents which do not match each other can present difficulties in conducting personal affairs - particularly those which require multiple, matching forms of identification.

This potentially significant change in the law was not tested until ''Smith v. City of Salem'' 378 F.3d 566, 568 (6th Cir. 2004). Smith, a trans woman, had been employed as a lieutenant in the fire department without incident for seven years. After doctors diagnosed Smith with [[Gender Identity Disorder]] (\"GID\"), she began to experience harassment and retaliation following complaint. She filed Title VII claims of sex discrimination and retaliation, equal protection and due process claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and state law claims of invasion of privacy and civil conspiracy. On appeal, the ''Price Waterhouse'' precedent was applied at p574: \"[i]t follows that employers who discriminate against men because they do wear dresses and makeup, or otherwise act femininely, are also engaging in sex discrimination, because the discrimination would not occur but for the victim's sex.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=SMITH v.

By reiterating that discrimination based on both sex and gender expression is forbidden under Title VII, the court steers transgender jurisprudence in a more expansive direction.  But dress codes, which frequently have separate rules based solely on gender, continue. ''Carroll v. Talman Fed. Savs. & Loan Association'', 604 F.2d 1028, 1032 (7th Cir.) 1979, has not been overruled.\n\n[[Harrah's]] implemented a policy named \"Personal Best\", in which it dictated a general dress code for its male and female employees. Females were required to wear makeup, and there were similar rules for males. One female employee, Darlene Jesperson, objected and sued under Title VII. In ''[[Jespersen v. Harrah's|Jespersen v. Harrah's Operating Co.]]'', No. 03-15045 (9th Cir. April 14, 2006), plaintiff conceded that dress codes could be legitimate but that certain aspects could nevertheless be demeaning; plaintiff also cited ''Price Waterhouse''.  The Ninth Circuit disagreed, upholding the practice of business-related gender-specific dress codes. When such a dress code is in force, an employee amid transition could find it impossible to obey the rules.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn ''[[Glenn v.

In some cases, a parent's transgender status is not weighed in a court decision; in others, rulings are made on the basis of a transgender person being presumed to be an inherently unfit parent.\n\nCourts are generally allowed to base custody or visitation rulings only on factors that directly affect the best interests of the child. According to this principle, if a transgender parent's gender identity cannot be shown to hurt the child, contact should not be limited, and other custody and visitation orders should not be changed for this reason. Many courts have upheld this principle and have treated transgender custody cases like any other child custody determination\u2014by focusing on standard factors such as parental skills. In ''Mayfield v. Mayfield'', for instance, the court upheld a transgender parent's [[shared parenting]] plan because there was no evidence in the record that the parent would not be a \"fit, loving and capable parent.\"<ref name=\"lambdalegal.org\">{{cite web| url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/transgender/trans-parenting-faq| title=FAQ About Transgender Parenting| work=Lambda Legal| url-status=live| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907132020/http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/transgender/trans-parenting-faq| archivedate=September 7, 2015| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOther times, courts claiming to consider a child's interests have ruled against the transgender parent, leading to the parent losing access to their children on the basis of their [[gender identity]]. For example, in ''Cisek v. Cisek'', the court terminated a transgender parent's visitation rights, holding that there was a risk of both mental and \"social harm\" to the children. The court asked whether the parent's [[sex change]] was \"simply an indulgence of some fantasy\". An Ohio court imposed an indefinite moratorium on visitation based on the court's belief that it would be emotionally confusing for the children to see \"their father as a woman\".<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Cisek v.

Different procedures and requirements for legal name changes and gender marker changes on [[birth certificate]]s, [[drivers license]]s, social security identification and [[passport]]s exist and can be inconsistent.  Many states require [[sex reassignment surgery]] to change their name and gender marker.  Also, documents which do not match each other can present difficulties in conducting personal affairs - particularly those which require multiple, matching forms of identification.  Furthermore, having documents which do not match a person's gender presentation has been reported to lead to [[harassment]] and [[discrimination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/transgender/anands-story|title=Introduction and Anand's Story|work=Lambda Legal|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828090521/http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/transgender/anands-story|archivedate=August 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://transequality.org/issues/identity-documents-privacy|title=Identity Documents & Privacy|work=National Center for Transgender Equality|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905065644/http://www.transequality.org/issues/identity-documents-privacy|archivedate=September 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Name change===\nTransgender people often seek legal recognition for a [[name change]] during a gender transition.

This potentially significant change in the law was not tested until ''Smith v. City of Salem'' 378 F.3d 566, 568 (6th Cir. 2004). Smith, a trans woman, had been employed as a lieutenant in the fire department without incident for seven years. After doctors diagnosed Smith with [[Gender Identity Disorder]] (\"GID\"), she began to experience harassment and retaliation following complaint. She filed Title VII claims of sex discrimination and retaliation, equal protection and due process claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and state law claims of invasion of privacy and civil conspiracy. On appeal, the ''Price Waterhouse'' precedent was applied at p574: \"[i]t follows that employers who discriminate against men because they do wear dresses and makeup, or otherwise act femininely, are also engaging in sex discrimination, because the discrimination would not occur but for the victim's sex.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=SMITH v.

By reiterating that discrimination based on both sex and gender expression is forbidden under Title VII, the court steers transgender jurisprudence in a more expansive direction.  But dress codes, which frequently have separate rules based solely on gender, continue. ''Carroll v. Talman Fed. Savs. & Loan Association'', 604 F.2d 1028, 1032 (7th Cir.) 1979, has not been overruled.\n\n[[Harrah's]] implemented a policy named \"Personal Best\", in which it dictated a general dress code for its male and female employees. Females were required to wear makeup, and there were similar rules for males. One female employee, Darlene Jesperson, objected and sued under Title VII. In ''[[Jespersen v. Harrah's|Jespersen v. Harrah's Operating Co.]]'', No. 03-15045 (9th Cir. April 14, 2006), plaintiff conceded that dress codes could be legitimate but that certain aspects could nevertheless be demeaning; plaintiff also cited ''Price Waterhouse''.  The Ninth Circuit disagreed, upholding the practice of business-related gender-specific dress codes. When such a dress code is in force, an employee amid transition could find it impossible to obey the rules.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nIn ''[[Glenn v.

''c'' and average (maximum) member intelligence  scores are regressed on the criterion tasks.]]\nWoolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, & Malone (2010),<ref name=\":0\" /> the originators of this scientific understanding of collective intelligence, found a single statistical factor for collective intelligence in their research across 192 groups with people randomly recruited from the public. In Woolley et al.'s two initial studies, groups worked together on different tasks from the [[The Circumplex Model of Group Tasks|McGrath Task Circumplex]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Groups: Interaction and Performance|last=McGrath, J. E.|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1984|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=}}</ref> a well-established taxonomy of group tasks. Tasks were chosen from all four quadrants of the circumplex and included visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources. The results in these tasks were taken to conduct a [[factor analysis]]. Both studies showed support for a general collective intelligence factor ''c'' underlying differences in group performance with an initial eigenvalue accounting for 43% (44% in study 2) of the variance, whereas the next factor accounted for only 18% (20%). That fits the range normally found in research regarding a [[G factor (psychometrics)|general individual intelligence factor ''g'']] typically accounting for 40% to 50% percent of between-individual performance differences on cognitive tests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfterwards, a more complex criterion task was absolved by each group measuring whether the extracted ''c'' factor had predictive power for performance outside the original task batteries. Criterion tasks were playing [[Draughts|checkers (draughts)]] against a standardized computer in the first and a complex architectural design task in the second study. In a [[regression analysis]] using both individual intelligence of group members and ''c'' to predict performance on the criterion tasks, ''c'' had a significant effect, but average and maximum individual intelligence had not. While average (r=0.15, P=0.04) and maximum intelligence (r=0.19, P=0.008) of individual group members were moderately correlated with ''c'', ''c'' was still a much better predictor of the criterion tasks. According to Woolley et al., this supports the existence of a collective intelligence factor ''c,'' because it demonstrates an effect over and beyond group members' individual intelligence and thus that ''c'' is more than just the aggregation of the individual IQs or the influence of the group member with the highest IQ.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEngel et al.<ref name=\":4\" /> (2014) replicated Woolley et al.'s findings applying an accelerated battery of tasks with a first factor in the factor analysis explaining 49% of the between-group variance in performance with the following factors explaining less than half of this amount. Moreover, they found a similar result for groups working together online communicating only via text and confirmed the role of female proportion and social sensitivity in causing collective intelligence in both cases. Similarly to Wolley et al.,<ref name=\":0\" /> they also measured social sensitivity with the RME which is actually meant to measure people's ability to detect mental states in other peoples' eyes. The online collaborating participants, however, did neither know nor see each other at all. The authors conclude that scores on the RME must be related to a broader set of abilities of social reasoning than only drawing inferences from other people's eye expressions.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=David|last2=Woolley|first2=Anita Williams|last3=Aggarwal|first3=Ishani|last4=Chabris|first4=Christopher F.|last5=Takahashi|first5=Masamichi|last6=Nemoto|first6=Keiichi|last7=Kaiser|first7=Carolin|last8=Kim|first8=Young Ji|last9=Malone|first9=Thomas W.|date=2015-01-01|title=Collective Intelligence in Computer-Mediated Collaboration Emerges in Different Contexts and Cultures|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=3769\u20133778|doi=10.1145/2702123.2702259|isbn=9781450331456}}</ref>\n\nA collective intelligence factor ''c'' in the sense of Woolley et al.<ref name=\":0\" /> was further found in groups of MBA students working together over the course of a semester,<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|author1=Aggarwal, I. |author2= Woolley, A.W. |last-author-amp=yes |date=2014|title=The effects of cognitive diversity on collective intelligence and team learning.|url=|journal=Symposium Presented at the 50th Meeting of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology, Columbus, OH.|doi=|pmid=}}</ref> in online gaming groups<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|author1=Kim, Y.

It is assumed to be an unconscious, random, parallel, and distributed computational process, run in mathematical logic by the social structure.<ref name=\"szuba\">Szuba T., ''Computational Collective Intelligence'', 420 pages, Wiley NY, 2001</ref>\n\nIn this model, beings and information are modeled as abstract information molecules carrying expressions of mathematical logic.<ref name=\"szuba\" /> They are quasi-randomly displacing due to their interaction with their environments with their intended displacements.<ref name=\"szuba\" /> Their interaction in abstract computational space creates multi-thread inference process which we perceive as collective intelligence.<ref name=\"szuba\" /> Thus, a non-[[Alan Turing|Turing]] model of computation is used. This theory allows simple formal definition of collective intelligence as the property of [[social structure]] and seems to be working well for a wide spectrum of beings, from bacterial colonies up to human social structures. Collective intelligence considered as a specific computational process is providing a straightforward explanation of several social phenomena. For this model of collective intelligence, the formal definition of IQS (IQ Social) was proposed and was defined as \"the probability function over the time and domain of N-element inferences which are reflecting inference activity of the social structure\".<ref name=\"szuba\" /> While IQS seems to be computationally hard, modeling of social structure in terms of a computational process as described above gives a chance for approximation.<ref name=\"szuba\" /> Prospective applications are optimization of companies through the maximization of their IQS, and the analysis of drug resistance against collective intelligence of bacterial colonies.<ref name=\"szuba\"/>\n\n=== Collective intelligence quotient ===\nOne measure sometimes applied, especially by more artificial intelligence focused theorists, is a \"collective intelligence quotient\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tHmKrpSeEQC&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141&dq=collective+intelligence+quotient#v=onepage&q=collective%20intelligence%20quotient&f=false|title=Computational Collective Intelligence.

For example, estimating the weight of an object, or the release date of a product or probability of success of a project etc. as seen in prediction markets like Intrade, HSX or InklingMarkets and also in several implementations of crowdsourced estimation of a numeric outcome. Essentially, we try to get the average value of the estimates provided by the members in the crowd.\n\n==== Opinion aggregation ====\nIn this situation, opinions are gathered from the crowd regarding an idea, issue or product. For example, trying to get a rating (on some scale) of a product sold online (such as Amazon's star rating system). Here, the emphasis is to collect and simply aggregate the ratings provided by customers/users.\n\n==== Idea Collection ====\nIn these problems, someone solicits ideas for projects, designs or solutions from the crowd. For example, ideas on solving a [[data science]] problem (as in [[Kaggle]]) or getting a good design for a T-shirt (as in [[Threadless]]) or in getting answers to simple problems that only humans can do well (as in Amazon's Mechanical Turk). The objective is to gather the ideas and devise some selection criteria to choose the best ideas.\n\n[[James Surowiecki]] divides the advantages of disorganized decision-making into three main categories, which are cognition, cooperation and coordination.<ref name=\"Surowiecki\"/>{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n=== Cognition ===\n==== Market judgment ====\nBecause of the Internet's ability to rapidly convey large amounts of information throughout the world, the use of collective intelligence to predict stock prices and stock price direction has become increasingly viable.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Craig A.|year=2001|url=http://www.iqco.com/consulting/Kaplan_TESADI_Final.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Conference|volume=5|pages=2893\u20132898|via=|doi=10.1109/ICSMC.2001.971949|isbn=978-0-7803-7087-6|title=Collective intelligence: A new approach to stock price forecasting}}</ref> Websites aggregate stock market information that is as current as possible so professional or amateur stock analysts can publish their viewpoints, enabling amateur investors to submit their financial opinions and create an aggregate opinion.<ref name=\":22\" /> The opinion of all investor can be weighed equally so that a pivotal premise of the effective application of collective intelligence can be applied: the masses, including a broad spectrum of stock market expertise, can be utilized to more accurately predict the behavior of financial markets.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-15420-1|last1=Ma|first1=Ying|last2=Li|first2=Guanyi|last3=Dong|first3=Yingsai|last4=Qin|first4=Zengchang|title=Minority Game Data Mining for Stock Market Predictions|journal=Agents and Data Mining Interaction, 6th International Workshopon Agents and Data Mining Interaction, ADMI 2010|volume=5980|year=2010|url=http://icmll.buaa.edu.cn/publications/Conference%20Papers/LectureNotesCS/ADMI.pdf|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-642-15419-5|bibcode=2010LNCS.5980.....C|access-date=2 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021040736/http://icmll.buaa.edu.cn/publications/Conference%20Papers/LectureNotesCS/ADMI.pdf|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-23935-9_24|last1=Yu|first1=Du|last2=Dong|first2=Yingsai|last3=Qin|first3=Zengchang|last4=Wan|first4=Tao|title=Exploring Market Behaviors with Evolutionary Mixed-Games Learning Model|journal=Computational Collective Intelligence.

The ability of new media to easily store and retrieve information, predominantly through databases and the Internet, allows for it to be shared without difficulty. Thus, through interaction with new media, knowledge easily passes between sources {{Harv|Flew|2008}} resulting in a form of collective intelligence. The use of interactive new media, particularly the internet, promotes online interaction and this distribution of knowledge between users.\n\n[[Francis Heylighen]], [[Valentin Turchin]], and Gottfried Mayer-Kress are among those who view collective intelligence through the lens of computer science and [[cybernetics]]. In their view, the Internet enables collective intelligence at the widest, planetary scale, thus facilitating the emergence of a [[global brain]].\n\nThe developer of the World Wide Web, [[Tim Berners-Lee]], aimed to promote sharing and publishing of information globally. Later his employer opened up the technology for free use. In the early '90s, the Internet's potential was still untapped, until the mid-1990s when 'critical mass', as termed by the head of the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), Dr. [[J.C.R. Licklider]], demanded more accessibility and utility.<ref name=\"Weiss, A. 2005 pp. 19-23\">Weiss, A. (2005). The Power of Collective Intelligence. Collective Intelligence, pp. 19\u201323</ref> The driving force of this Internet-based collective intelligence is the digitization of information and communication. [[Henry Jenkins]], a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and participatory culture {{Harv|Flew|2008}}. He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving into the classroom, stating \"whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals\". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities contribute to the development of such skills.<ref name=\":25\">{{Cite web|url=http://labweb.education.wisc.edu/curric606/readings/Jenkins2002.pdf|title=INTERACTIVE AUDIENCES?

With the development of the [[Internet]] and its widespread use, the opportunity to contribute to knowledge-building communities, such as [[Wikipedia]], is greater than ever before. These computer networks give participating users the opportunity to store and to retrieve knowledge through the collective access to these databases and allow them to \"harness the hive\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=New Media: an introduction.|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Oxford University Press.|year=2008|isbn=|location=Melbourne|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Researchers at the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]] research and explore collective intelligence of groups of people and computers.<ref>[http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html MIT Center for Collective Intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611041615/http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html |date=11 June 2010 }}.

The former is the sum total of information held individually by members of a community while the latter is information that is believed to be true and known by all members of the community.<ref>Jenkins, H. 2006.

Instead, smart firms are drawing on the power of mass collaboration to involve participation of the people they could not employ. This also helps generate continual interest in the firm in the form of those drawn to new idea creation as well as investment opportunities.<ref name=\"Tapscott, D. 2008\" />\n;Demand creation\n:Firms can create a new market for complementary goods by engaging in open source community. Firms also are able to expand into new fields that they previously would not have been able to without the addition of resources and collaboration from the community. This creates, as mentioned before, a new market for complementary goods for the products in said new fields.<ref name=\"Tapscott, D. 2008\" />\n;Costs reduction\n:Mass collaboration can help to reduce costs dramatically. Firms can release a specific software or product to be evaluated or debugged by online communities. The results will be more personal, robust and error-free products created in a short amount of time and costs. New ideas can also be generated and explored by collaboration of online communities creating opportunities for free R&D outside the confines of the company.<ref name=\"Tapscott, D. 2008\" />\n\n==== Open source software ====\nCultural theorist and online community developer, John Banks considered the contribution of online fan communities in the creation of the [[Trainz]] product. He argued that its commercial success was fundamentally dependent upon \"the formation and growth of an active and vibrant online fan community that would both actively promote the product and create content- extensions and additions to the game software\".<ref name=\"jbanks\">John A.L.

School of English, Media Studies and Art History. MelbourneDAC2003</ref>\n\nThe increase in user created content and interactivity gives rise to issues of control over the game itself and ownership of the player-created content. This gives rise to fundamental legal issues, highlighted by Lessig<ref>L, Lessig,(2006)Code Version 2.0 (2nd ed.). New York: Basic Books.</ref> and Bray and Konsynski,<ref>Bray, DA & Konsynski, BR, 2007, ''Virtual Worlds, Virtual Economies, Virtual Institutions'', viewed 10 October 2008, p. 1-27 <http://ssrn.com/abstract=962501></ref> such as [[intellectual property]] and property ownership rights.\n\nGosney extends this issue of Collective Intelligence in videogames one step further in his discussion of [[alternate reality gaming]]. This genre, he describes as an \"across-media game that deliberately blurs the line between the in-game and out-of-game experiences\"<ref name=\":27\">Gosney, J.W, 2005, ''Beyond Reality: A Guide to Alternate Reality Gaming'', Thomson Course Technology, Boston.</ref> as events that happen outside the game reality \"reach out\" into the player's lives in order to bring them together. Solving the game requires \"the collective and collaborative efforts of multiple players\"; thus the issue of collective and collaborative team play is essential to ARG. Gosney argues that the Alternate Reality genre of gaming dictates an unprecedented level of collaboration and \"collective intelligence\" in order to solve the mystery of the game.<ref name=\":27\" />\n\n==== Benefits of co-operation ====\nCo-operation helps to solve most important and most interesting multi-science problems. In his book, James Surowiecki mentioned that most scientists think that benefits of co-operation have much more value when compared to potential costs. Co-operation works also because at best it guarantees number of different viewpoints. Because of the possibilities of technology global co-operation is nowadays much easier and productive than before. It is clear that, when co-operation goes from university level to global it has significant benefits.\n\nFor example, why do scientists co-operate? Science has become more and more isolated and each science field has spread even more and it is impossible for one person to be aware of all developments. This is true especially in experimental research where highly advanced equipment requires special skills. With co-operation scientists can use information from different fields and use it effectively instead of gathering all the information just by reading by themselves.\"<ref name=\"Surowiecki\">Surowiecki, J., 2007 'The Wisdom of crowds.

The global accessibility and availability of the Internet has allowed more people than ever to contribute and access ideas. (Flew 2008)\n\nGames such as ''[[The Sims]]'' Series, and ''[[Second Life]]'' are designed to be non-linear and to depend on collective intelligence for expansion. This way of sharing is gradually evolving and influencing the mindset of the current and future generations.<ref name=\"Weiss, A. 2005 pp. 19-23\"/> For them, collective intelligence has become a norm.

[[Henry Jenkins]] proposes that the participatory cultures emerging between games producers, media companies, and the end-users mark a fundamental shift in the nature of media production and consumption. Jenkins argues that this new participatory culture arises at the intersection of three broad new media trends.<ref>Henry Jenkins (2002) in Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) ''Games: Technology, Industry, Culture'' in Terry Flew, New Media: An Introduction (2nd edn), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101\u2013114.</ref> Firstly, the development of new media tools/technologies enabling the creation of content.

Tasks vary from being highly independent simple tasks that require very little coordination to complex interdependent tasks that are built by many individuals and require a lot of coordination. In the article written by Kittur, Lee and Kraut the writers introduce a problem in cooperation: \"When tasks require high coordination because the work is highly interdependent, having more contributors can increase process losses, reducing the effectiveness of the group below what individual members could optimally accomplish\". Having a team too large the overall effectiveness may suffer even when the extra contributors increase the resources. In the end the overall costs from coordination might overwhelm other costs.<ref>Kittur, A., Lee, B. and Kraut, R. E.

In a bottom-up process the different characteristics of each member are involved in contributing and enhancing coordination. Top-down processes are more strict and fixed with norms, group structures and routines that in their own way enhance the group's collective work.<ref>[18] Woolley, A. W., Aggarwal, I. and Malone, T.

In Woolley et al.'s two initial studies, groups worked together on different tasks from the [[The Circumplex Model of Group Tasks|McGrath Task Circumplex]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Groups: Interaction and Performance|last=McGrath, J. E.|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1984|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=}}</ref> a well-established taxonomy of group tasks. Tasks were chosen from all four quadrants of the circumplex and included visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources. The results in these tasks were taken to conduct a [[factor analysis]]. Both studies showed support for a general collective intelligence factor ''c'' underlying differences in group performance with an initial eigenvalue accounting for 43% (44% in study 2) of the variance, whereas the next factor accounted for only 18% (20%). That fits the range normally found in research regarding a [[G factor (psychometrics)|general individual intelligence factor ''g'']] typically accounting for 40% to 50% percent of between-individual performance differences on cognitive tests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfterwards, a more complex criterion task was absolved by each group measuring whether the extracted ''c'' factor had predictive power for performance outside the original task batteries. Criterion tasks were playing [[Draughts|checkers (draughts)]] against a standardized computer in the first and a complex architectural design task in the second study. In a [[regression analysis]] using both individual intelligence of group members and ''c'' to predict performance on the criterion tasks, ''c'' had a significant effect, but average and maximum individual intelligence had not. While average (r=0.15, P=0.04) and maximum intelligence (r=0.19, P=0.008) of individual group members were moderately correlated with ''c'', ''c'' was still a much better predictor of the criterion tasks. According to Woolley et al., this supports the existence of a collective intelligence factor ''c,'' because it demonstrates an effect over and beyond group members' individual intelligence and thus that ''c'' is more than just the aggregation of the individual IQs or the influence of the group member with the highest IQ.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEngel et al.<ref name=\":4\" /> (2014) replicated Woolley et al.'s findings applying an accelerated battery of tasks with a first factor in the factor analysis explaining 49% of the between-group variance in performance with the following factors explaining less than half of this amount. Moreover, they found a similar result for groups working together online communicating only via text and confirmed the role of female proportion and social sensitivity in causing collective intelligence in both cases. Similarly to Wolley et al.,<ref name=\":0\" /> they also measured social sensitivity with the RME which is actually meant to measure people's ability to detect mental states in other peoples' eyes.

It is assumed to be an unconscious, random, parallel, and distributed computational process, run in mathematical logic by the social structure.<ref name=\"szuba\">Szuba T., ''Computational Collective Intelligence'', 420 pages, Wiley NY, 2001</ref>\n\nIn this model, beings and information are modeled as abstract information molecules carrying expressions of mathematical logic.<ref name=\"szuba\" /> They are quasi-randomly displacing due to their interaction with their environments with their intended displacements.<ref name=\"szuba\" /> Their interaction in abstract computational space creates multi-thread inference process which we perceive as collective intelligence.<ref name=\"szuba\" /> Thus, a non-[[Alan Turing|Turing]] model of computation is used. This theory allows simple formal definition of collective intelligence as the property of [[social structure]] and seems to be working well for a wide spectrum of beings, from bacterial colonies up to human social structures. Collective intelligence considered as a specific computational process is providing a straightforward explanation of several social phenomena. For this model of collective intelligence, the formal definition of IQS (IQ Social) was proposed and was defined as \"the probability function over the time and domain of N-element inferences which are reflecting inference activity of the social structure\".<ref name=\"szuba\" /> While IQS seems to be computationally hard, modeling of social structure in terms of a computational process as described above gives a chance for approximation.<ref name=\"szuba\" /> Prospective applications are optimization of companies through the maximization of their IQS, and the analysis of drug resistance against collective intelligence of bacterial colonies.<ref name=\"szuba\"/>\n\n=== Collective intelligence quotient ===\nOne measure sometimes applied, especially by more artificial intelligence focused theorists, is a \"collective intelligence quotient\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tHmKrpSeEQC&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141&dq=collective+intelligence+quotient#v=onepage&q=collective%20intelligence%20quotient&f=false|title=Computational Collective Intelligence.

For example, estimating the weight of an object, or the release date of a product or probability of success of a project etc. as seen in prediction markets like Intrade, HSX or InklingMarkets and also in several implementations of crowdsourced estimation of a numeric outcome. Essentially, we try to get the average value of the estimates provided by the members in the crowd.\n\n==== Opinion aggregation ====\nIn this situation, opinions are gathered from the crowd regarding an idea, issue or product. For example, trying to get a rating (on some scale) of a product sold online (such as Amazon's star rating system). Here, the emphasis is to collect and simply aggregate the ratings provided by customers/users.\n\n==== Idea Collection ====\nIn these problems, someone solicits ideas for projects, designs or solutions from the crowd. For example, ideas on solving a [[data science]] problem (as in [[Kaggle]]) or getting a good design for a T-shirt (as in [[Threadless]]) or in getting answers to simple problems that only humans can do well (as in Amazon's Mechanical Turk). The objective is to gather the ideas and devise some selection criteria to choose the best ideas.\n\n[[James Surowiecki]] divides the advantages of disorganized decision-making into three main categories, which are cognition, cooperation and coordination.<ref name=\"Surowiecki\"/>{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n=== Cognition ===\n==== Market judgment ====\nBecause of the Internet's ability to rapidly convey large amounts of information throughout the world, the use of collective intelligence to predict stock prices and stock price direction has become increasingly viable.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Craig A.|year=2001|url=http://www.iqco.com/consulting/Kaplan_TESADI_Final.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Conference|volume=5|pages=2893\u20132898|via=|doi=10.1109/ICSMC.2001.971949|isbn=978-0-7803-7087-6|title=Collective intelligence: A new approach to stock price forecasting}}</ref> Websites aggregate stock market information that is as current as possible so professional or amateur stock analysts can publish their viewpoints, enabling amateur investors to submit their financial opinions and create an aggregate opinion.<ref name=\":22\" /> The opinion of all investor can be weighed equally so that a pivotal premise of the effective application of collective intelligence can be applied: the masses, including a broad spectrum of stock market expertise, can be utilized to more accurately predict the behavior of financial markets.<ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-15420-1|last1=Ma|first1=Ying|last2=Li|first2=Guanyi|last3=Dong|first3=Yingsai|last4=Qin|first4=Zengchang|title=Minority Game Data Mining for Stock Market Predictions|journal=Agents and Data Mining Interaction, 6th International Workshopon Agents and Data Mining Interaction, ADMI 2010|volume=5980|year=2010|url=http://icmll.buaa.edu.cn/publications/Conference%20Papers/LectureNotesCS/ADMI.pdf|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-642-15419-5|bibcode=2010LNCS.5980.....C|access-date=2 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021040736/http://icmll.buaa.edu.cn/publications/Conference%20Papers/LectureNotesCS/ADMI.pdf|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-23935-9_24|last1=Yu|first1=Du|last2=Dong|first2=Yingsai|last3=Qin|first3=Zengchang|last4=Wan|first4=Tao|title=Exploring Market Behaviors with Evolutionary Mixed-Games Learning Model|journal=Computational Collective Intelligence.

The ability of new media to easily store and retrieve information, predominantly through databases and the Internet, allows for it to be shared without difficulty. Thus, through interaction with new media, knowledge easily passes between sources {{Harv|Flew|2008}} resulting in a form of collective intelligence. The use of interactive new media, particularly the internet, promotes online interaction and this distribution of knowledge between users.\n\n[[Francis Heylighen]], [[Valentin Turchin]], and Gottfried Mayer-Kress are among those who view collective intelligence through the lens of computer science and [[cybernetics]]. In their view, the Internet enables collective intelligence at the widest, planetary scale, thus facilitating the emergence of a [[global brain]].\n\nThe developer of the World Wide Web, [[Tim Berners-Lee]], aimed to promote sharing and publishing of information globally. Later his employer opened up the technology for free use. In the early '90s, the Internet's potential was still untapped, until the mid-1990s when 'critical mass', as termed by the head of the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), Dr. [[J.C.R. Licklider]], demanded more accessibility and utility.<ref name=\"Weiss, A. 2005 pp. 19-23\">Weiss, A. (2005). The Power of Collective Intelligence. Collective Intelligence, pp. 19\u201323</ref> The driving force of this Internet-based collective intelligence is the digitization of information and communication. [[Henry Jenkins]], a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and participatory culture {{Harv|Flew|2008}}. He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving into the classroom, stating \"whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals\". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities contribute to the development of such skills.<ref name=\":25\">{{Cite web|url=http://labweb.education.wisc.edu/curric606/readings/Jenkins2002.pdf|title=INTERACTIVE AUDIENCES?

They suggest that these communications tools enable humans to interact and to share and collaborate with both ease and speed (Flew 2008). With the development of the [[Internet]] and its widespread use, the opportunity to contribute to knowledge-building communities, such as [[Wikipedia]], is greater than ever before. These computer networks give participating users the opportunity to store and to retrieve knowledge through the collective access to these databases and allow them to \"harness the hive\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=New Media: an introduction.|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Oxford University Press.|year=2008|isbn=|location=Melbourne|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Researchers at the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]] research and explore collective intelligence of groups of people and computers.<ref>[http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html MIT Center for Collective Intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611041615/http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html |date=11 June 2010 }}.

Instead, smart firms are drawing on the power of mass collaboration to involve participation of the people they could not employ. This also helps generate continual interest in the firm in the form of those drawn to new idea creation as well as investment opportunities.<ref name=\"Tapscott, D. 2008\" />\n;Demand creation\n:Firms can create a new market for complementary goods by engaging in open source community. Firms also are able to expand into new fields that they previously would not have been able to without the addition of resources and collaboration from the community. This creates, as mentioned before, a new market for complementary goods for the products in said new fields.<ref name=\"Tapscott, D. 2008\" />\n;Costs reduction\n:Mass collaboration can help to reduce costs dramatically. Firms can release a specific software or product to be evaluated or debugged by online communities. The results will be more personal, robust and error-free products created in a short amount of time and costs. New ideas can also be generated and explored by collaboration of online communities creating opportunities for free R&D outside the confines of the company.<ref name=\"Tapscott, D. 2008\" />\n\n==== Open source software ====\nCultural theorist and online community developer, John Banks considered the contribution of online fan communities in the creation of the [[Trainz]] product. He argued that its commercial success was fundamentally dependent upon \"the formation and growth of an active and vibrant online fan community that would both actively promote the product and create content- extensions and additions to the game software\".<ref name=\"jbanks\">John A.L. Banks. ''Negotiating Participatory Culture in the New Media Environment: Auran and the Trainz Online Community&nbsp;\u2013 An (Im)possible Relation'', The University of Queensland. School of English, Media Studies and Art History. MelbourneDAC2003</ref>\n\nThe increase in user created content and interactivity gives rise to issues of control over the game itself and ownership of the player-created content. This gives rise to fundamental legal issues, highlighted by Lessig<ref>L, Lessig,(2006)Code Version 2.0 (2nd ed.). New York: Basic Books.</ref> and Bray and Konsynski,<ref>Bray, DA & Konsynski, BR, 2007, ''Virtual Worlds, Virtual Economies, Virtual Institutions'', viewed 10 October 2008, p. 1-27 <http://ssrn.com/abstract=962501></ref> such as [[intellectual property]] and property ownership rights.\n\nGosney extends this issue of Collective Intelligence in videogames one step further in his discussion of [[alternate reality gaming]]. This genre, he describes as an \"across-media game that deliberately blurs the line between the in-game and out-of-game experiences\"<ref name=\":27\">Gosney, J.W, 2005, ''Beyond Reality: A Guide to Alternate Reality Gaming'', Thomson Course Technology, Boston.</ref> as events that happen outside the game reality \"reach out\" into the player's lives in order to bring them together. Solving the game requires \"the collective and collaborative efforts of multiple players\"; thus the issue of collective and collaborative team play is essential to ARG. Gosney argues that the Alternate Reality genre of gaming dictates an unprecedented level of collaboration and \"collective intelligence\" in order to solve the mystery of the game.<ref name=\":27\" />\n\n==== Benefits of co-operation ====\nCo-operation helps to solve most important and most interesting multi-science problems. In his book, James Surowiecki mentioned that most scientists think that benefits of co-operation have much more value when compared to potential costs. Co-operation works also because at best it guarantees number of different viewpoints. Because of the possibilities of technology global co-operation is nowadays much easier and productive than before. It is clear that, when co-operation goes from university level to global it has significant benefits.\n\nFor example, why do scientists co-operate? Science has become more and more isolated and each science field has spread even more and it is impossible for one person to be aware of all developments. This is true especially in experimental research where highly advanced equipment requires special skills. With co-operation scientists can use information from different fields and use it effectively instead of gathering all the information just by reading by themselves.\"<ref name=\"Surowiecki\">Surowiecki, J., 2007 'The Wisdom of crowds.

Tasks vary from being highly independent simple tasks that require very little coordination to complex interdependent tasks that are built by many individuals and require a lot of coordination. In the article written by Kittur, Lee and Kraut the writers introduce a problem in cooperation: \"When tasks require high coordination because the work is highly interdependent, having more contributors can increase process losses, reducing the effectiveness of the group below what individual members could optimally accomplish\". Having a team too large the overall effectiveness may suffer even when the extra contributors increase the resources. In the end the overall costs from coordination might overwhelm other costs.<ref>Kittur, A., Lee, B. and Kraut, R. E. (2009) '[https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1518928 Coordination in collective intelligence: The role of team structure and task interdependence]', Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 1495\u20131504.</ref>\n\nGroup collective intelligence is a property that emerges through coordination from both bottom-up and top-down processes. In a bottom-up process the different characteristics of each member are involved in contributing and enhancing coordination. Top-down processes are more strict and fixed with norms, group structures and routines that in their own way enhance the group's collective work.<ref>[18] Woolley, A. W., Aggarwal, I. and Malone, T.

These polymaths had a rounded approach to education that reflected the ideals of the [[Renaissance Humanism|humanists]] of the time. A [[gentleman]] or [[courtier]] of that era was expected to speak several languages, play a [[musical instrument]], write [[poetry]] and so on, thus fulfilling the Renaissance [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]].\n\nThe idea of a universal education was essential to achieving polymath ability, hence the word [[university]] was used to describe a seat of learning. At this time, universities did not specialize in specific areas, but rather trained students in a broad array of science, philosophy and theology. This universal education gave them a grounding from which they could continue into apprenticeship toward becoming a [[Master (form of address)|master]] of a specific field.\n\nWhen someone is called a \"Renaissance man\" today, it is meant that rather than simply having broad interests or superficial knowledge in several fields, the individual possesses a more profound knowledge and a proficiency, or even an expertise, in at least some of those fields.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=Renaissance+man |title = Renaissance man \u2014 Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |website = M-w.com |access-date = 2012-04-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome dictionaries use the term \"Renaissance man\" to describe someone with many interests or talents,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/orexxnaissanceman?view=uk |title=Oxford concise dictionary |publisher=Askoxford.com |access-date=6 April 2012 }}</ref> while others give a meaning restricted to the Renaissance and more closely related to Renaissance ideals.\n<!-- The [[Islamic Golden Age]] produced a lot of polymaths, a movement characterized by [[Ziauddin Sardar]] as such \"the methods of studying the vast creation of God \u2013 from the movement of the stars and planets to the nature of diseases, the sting of an ant, the character of madness, the beauty of justice, the spiritual yearning of humanity, the ecstasy of a mystic \u2013 are all equally valid and shape understanding in their respective areas of inquiry.

He and colleagues, especially Mich\u00e8le Root-Bernstein, authored many important works spearheading the modern field of polymathy studies.\n\nRoot-Bernstein's works emphasize the contrast between the polymath and two other types: the specialist and the dilettante. The specialist demonstrates depth but lacks breadth of knowledge. The dilettante demonstrates superficial breadth but tend to acquire skills merely \u201cfor their own sake without regard to understanding the broader applications or implications and without integrating it\u201d (R. Root-Bernstein, 2009, p. 857). Conversely, the polymath is a person with a level of expertise that is able to \u201cput a significant amount of time and effort into their avocations and find ways to use their multiple interests to inform their vocations\u201d (R.

''Life stages of creativity''.</ref>\n\nA key point in the work of Root-Bernstein and colleagues is the argument in favor of the universality of the creative process. That is, although creative products, such as a painting, a mathematical model or a poem, can be domain-specific, at the level of the creative process, the mental tools that lead to the generation of creative ideas are the same, be it in the arts or science.<ref name=\":3\" /> These mental tools are sometimes called intuitive tools of thinking. It is therefore not surprising that many of the most innovative scientists have serious hobbies or interests in artistic activities, and that some of the most innovative artists have an interest or hobbies in the sciences.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>Root\u2010Bernstein, R.

Through their research, Root-Bernstein and colleagues conclude that there are certain comprehensive thinking skills and tools that cross the barrier of different domains and can foster creative thinking: \u201c[creativity researchers] who discuss integrating ideas from diverse fields as the basis of creative giftedness ask not \u201cwho is creative?\u201d but \u201cwhat is the basis of creative thinking?\u201d From the polymathy perspective, giftedness is the ability to combine disparate (or even apparently contradictory) ideas, sets of problems, skills, talents, and knowledge in novel and useful ways. Polymathy is therefore the main source of any individual's creative potential.\u201d (R. Root-Bernstein, 2009, p. 854). In \u201cLife Stages of Creativity\u201d, Robert and Mich\u00e8le Root-Bernstein suggest six typologies of creative life stages. These typologies based on real creative production records first published by Root-Bernstein, Bernstein, and Garnier (1993).\n\n* Type 1 represents people who specialize in developing one major talent early in life (e.g., prodigies) and successfully exploit that talent exclusively for the rest of their lives. \n* Type 2 individuals explore a range of different creative activities (e.g., through worldplay or a variety of hobbies) and then settle on exploiting one of these for the rest of their lives. \n* Type 3 people are polymathic from the outset and manage to juggle multiple careers simultaneously so that their creativity pattern is constantly varied. \n* Type 4 creators are recognized early for one major talent (e.g., math or music) but go on to explore additional creative outlets, diversifying their productivity with age. \n* Type 5 creators devote themselves serially to one creative field after another. \n* Type 6 people develop diversified creative skills early and then, like Type 5 individuals, explore these serially, one at a time.\n\nFinally, his studies suggest that understanding polymathy and learning from polymathic exemplars can help structure a new model of education that better promotes creativity and innovation: \u201cwe must focus education on principles, methods, and skills that will serve them [students] in learning and creating across many disciplines, multiple careers, and succeeding life stages\u201d (R. Root-Bernstein & M. Root-Bernstein, 2017, p.&nbsp;161).<ref>Root-Bernstein, R., & Root-Bernstein, M. (2017). People, passions, problems: The role of creative exemplars in teaching for creativity.

Springer, Cham.</ref>\n\n=== Peter Burke ===\n[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], Professor Emeritus of Cultural History and Fellow of Emmanuel College at Cambridge, discussed the theme of polymathy in some of his works. He has presented a comprehensive historical overview of the ascension and decline of the polymath as, what he calls, an \u201cintellectual species\u201d (see Burke, 2012; 2010).<ref>Burke, P. (2012). ''A social history of knowledge II: From the encyclopaedia to Wikipedia'' (Vol. 2). Polity.</ref><ref>Burke, P. (2010). The polymath: A cultural and social history of an intellectual species. ''Explorations in cultural history: Essays for Peter McCaffery'', 67\u201379.</ref>\n\nHe observes that in ancient and medieval times, scholars did not have to specialize. However, from the 17th century on, the rapid rise of new knowledge in the Western world\u2014both from the systematic investigation of the natural world and from the flow of information coming from other parts of the world\u2014was making it increasingly difficult for individual scholars to master as many disciplines as before. Thus, an intellectual retreat of the polymath species occurred: \u201cfrom knowledge in every [academic] field to knowledge in several fields, and from making original contributions in many fields to a more passive consumption of what has been contributed by others\u201d (Burke, 2010, p.&nbsp;72).\n\nGiven this change in the intellectual climate, it has since then been more common to find \u201cpassive polymaths\u201d, who consume knowledge in various domains but make their reputation in one single discipline, than \u201cproper polymaths\u201d, who\u2014through a feat of \u201cintellectual heroism\u201d\u2014manage to make serious contributions to several disciplines.\n\nHowever, Burke warns that in the age of specialization, polymathic people are more necessary than ever, both for synthesis\u2014to paint the big picture\u2014and for analysis. He says: \u201cIt takes a polymath to \u2018mind the gap\u2019 and draw attention to the knowledges that may otherwise disappear into the spaces between disciplines, as they are currently defined and organized\u201d (Burke, 2012, p.&nbsp;183).\n\nFinally, he suggests that governments and universities should nurture a habitat in which this \u201cendangered species\u201d can survive, offering students and scholars the possibility of interdisciplinary work.\n\n=== Kaufman, Beghetto and colleagues ===\n[[James C. Kaufman]], from the Neag School of Education at the University of Connecticut, and Ronald A. Beghetto, from the same university, investigated the possibility that everyone could have the potential for polymathy as well as the issue of the domain-generality or domain-specificity of creativity.<ref name=\":5\">Kaufman, J.

Do we all have multicreative potential?. ''ZDM'', ''41''(1\u20132), 39\u201344.</ref> proposed a typology of polymathy, ranging from the ubiquitous mini-c polymathy to the eminent but rare Big-C polymathy, as well as a model with some requirements for a person (polymath or not) to be able to reach the highest levels of creative accomplishment. They account for three general requirements\u2014intelligence, motivation to be creative and an environment that allows creative expression\u2014that are needed for any attempt at creativity to succeed. Then, depending on the domain of choice, more specific abilities will be required. The more that one's abilities and interests match the requirements of a domain, the better. While some will develop their specific skills and motivations for specific domains, polymathic people will display intrinsic motivation (and the ability) to pursue a variety of subject matters across different domains.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nRegarding the interplay of polymathy and education, they suggest that rather than asking whether every student has multicreative potential, educators might more actively nurture the multicreative potential of their students. As an example, the authors cite that teachers should encourage students to make connections across disciplines use different forms of media to express their reasoning and understanding (e.g., drawings, movies, and other forms of visual media).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Bharath Sriraman ===\n[[Bharath_Sriraman|Bharath Sriraman]], of the University of Montana, also investigated the role of polymathy in education. He poses that an ideal education should nurture talent in the classroom and enable individuals to pursue multiple fields of research and appreciate both the aesthetic and structural/scientific connections between mathematics, arts and the sciences.<ref>Sriraman, B., & Dahl, B. (2009). On bringing interdisciplinary ideas to gifted education. In ''International handbook on giftedness'' (pp. 1235\u20131256). Springer, Dordrecht.</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Sriraman published a paper reporting a 3-year study with 120 pre-service mathematics teachers and derived several implications for mathematics pre-service education as well as interdisciplinary education.<ref name=\":1\" /> He utilized a hermeneutic-phenomenological approach to recreate the emotions, voices and struggles of students as they tried to unravel Russell's paradox presented in its linguistic form. They found that those more engaged in solving the paradox also displayed more polymathic thinking traits. He concludes by suggesting that fostering polymathy in the classroom may help students change beliefs, discover structures and open new avenues for interdisciplinary pedagogy.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Michael Araki ===\n[[File:Developmental Model of Polymathy.jpg|thumb|550x550px|The Developmental Model of Polymathy (DMP)]]\n\nMichael Araki is a professor at Universidade Federal Fluminense in Brazil. He sought to formalize in a general model how the development of polymathy takes place. His Developmental Model of Polymathy (DMP) is presented in a 2018 article with two main objectives: (i) organize the elements involved in the process of polymathy development into a structure of relationships that is wed to the approach of polymathy as a life project, and (ii) provide an articulation with other well-developed constructs, theories and models, especially from the fields of giftedness and education.<ref name=\":7\">Araki, M. E. (2018). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324715756_Polymathy_A_New_Outlook_Journal_of_Genius_and_Eminence_2018 Polymathy: A new outlook]. ''Journal of Genius and Eminence'', ''3''(1), 66\u201382. Retrieved from: [[Researchgate.net]]</ref> The model, which was designed to reflect a structural model, has five major components: (1) polymathic antecedents, (2) polymathic mediators, (3) polymathic achievements, (4) intrapersonal moderators, and (5) environmental moderators.<ref name=\":7\" /> \n \nRegarding the definition of the term polymathy, the researcher, through an analysis of the extant literature, concluded that although there are a multitude of perspectives on polymathy, most of them ascertain that polymathy entails three core elements: breadth, depth and integration.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":0\">Araki, M. E. (2015). ''Polymathic leadership: Theoretical foundation and construct development.'' (Master\u2019s thesis), Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Available at SSRN: <nowiki>https://ssrn.com/abstract=3313137</nowiki></ref>\n\nBreadth refers to comprehensiveness, extension and diversity of knowledge. It is contrasted with the idea of narrowness, specialization, and the restriction of one's expertise to a limited domain. The possession of comprehensive knowledge at very disparate areas is a hallmark of the greatest polymaths.\n\nDepth refers to the vertical accumulation of knowledge and the degree of elaboration or sophistication of one's sets of one's conceptual network. Like Robert Root-Bernstein, Araki uses the concept of dilettancy as a contrast to the idea of profound learning that polymathy entails.\n\nIntegration, although not explicit in most definitions of polymathy, is also a core component of polymathy according to the author. Integration involves the capacity of connecting, articulating, concatenating or synthesizing different conceptual networks, which in non-polymathic persons might be segregated. In addition, integration can happen at the personality level, when the person is able to integrate his or her diverse activities in a synergic whole, which can also mean a psychic (motivational, emotional and cognitive) integration.\n\nFinally, the author also suggests that, via a psychoeconomic approach, polymathy can be seen as a \u201clife project\u201d. That is, depending on a person's temperament, endowments, personality, social situation and opportunities (or lack thereof), the project of a polymathic self-formation may present itself to the person as more or less alluring and more or less feasible to be pursued.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Angela Cotellessa ===\nOne of the most recent studies on the subject is Angela Cotellessa's doctoral Dissertation at George Washington University.<ref>Cotellessa, A. J. (2018). ''In Pursuit of Polymaths: Understanding Renaissance Persons of the 21 st Century'' (Doctoral dissertation, The George Washington University).</ref> In this work, she conducts a phenomenological study focusing on the life experiences of modern-day polymaths. Her investigation focused on accomplished polymaths with careers spanning both the arts and sciences. The participants provided insights regarding their development and lives as polymaths (Cotellessa, 2018).\nSeven conclusions were drawn from her research: (1) to be a polymath, one must accept seeming unusual and sometimes contradictory; polymaths are intra-personally diverse\u2014in other words, they have diversity within their own personhood (2) polymaths have a broad pool of experience, think both creatively and analytically, and juggle their many vocations and avocations by effectively managing their time; (3) being a polymath can be difficult but rewarding; (4) polymaths are analytically creative; (5) polymathy cannot be said to develop exclusively due to either nature nor nurture, and its continued expression throughout adulthood demands strong commitment to self-development; (6) polymathy distinguishes the individual from their peers from an early age often making them feel misunderstood; (7) family and financial resources influence the emergence of polymathy.\n\n== Related terms ==\nAside from \"Renaissance man\" as mentioned above, similar terms in use are {{lang|la|homo universalis}} ([[Latin]]) and {{lang|it|[[:it:Uomo universale|uomo universale]]}} ([[Italian language|Italian]]), which translate to \"universal man\".<ref name=\"Aus\" /> The related term \"generalist\"\u2014contrasted with a \"specialist\"\u2014is used to describe a person with a general approach to knowledge.\n\nThe term \"universal genius\" or \"versatile genius\" is also used, with [[Leonardo da Vinci]] as the prime example again. The term is used especially for people who made lasting contributions in at least one of the fields in which they were actively involved and when they took a universality of approach.\n\nWhen a person is described as having [[encyclopedic knowledge]], they exhibit a vast scope of knowledge. However, this designation may be anachronistic in the case of persons such as [[Eratosthenes]], whose reputation for having encyclopedic knowledge predates the existence of any [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedic object]].\n\n== Famous polymaths ==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2020}}\n*[[Aristotle]], Greek, 384\u2013322 BC\n*[[Seneca the Younger]], Spanish-Roman, c. 4 BC \u2013 AD 65\n*[[Zhang Heng]], Chinese, 78\u2013139\n*[[Shen Kuo]], Chinese, 1031-1095\n*[[Muhammad ibn Zakariya Razi]], Persian, 854\u2013925\n*[[Al-Farabi]], Persian, c. 872\n*[[Ibn al-Haytham]], Arab, 965\u20131040\n*[[Al-Biruni]], Persian, 973\u20131050\n*[[Avicenna]], Persian, 980\u20131037\n*[[Omar Khayyam]], Persian, 1048-1131\n*[[Hildegard of Bingen]], German, 1098\u20131179\n*[[Ibn Tufail]], Arab, 1105\u20131185\n*[[Maimonides]], Spanish, 1135\u20131204\n*[[Leon Battista Alberti]], Italian, 1404\u20131472\n*[[Antonio de Nebrija]], Spanish, 1441\u20131522\n*[[Leonardo da Vinci]], Italian, 1452\u20131519\n*[[Nicolaus Copernicus]], Polish, 1473\u20131543\n*[[Galileo Galilei]], Italian, 1564\u20131642\n*[[Fathullah Shirazi]], Persian, c. 1582 \n*[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], French, 1596\u20131650\n*[[Blaise Pascal]], French, 1623\u20131662\n*[[Isaac Newton]], English, 1642\u20131726\n*[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], German, 1646\u20131716\n*[[Benjamin Franklin]], American, 1705\u20131790\n*[[Mikhail Lomonosov]], Russian, 1711\u20131765\n*[[Thomas Jefferson]], American, 1743\u20131826 <ref>Hitchens, Christopher \"Thomas Jefferson: Author of America (2005), Harper Collins {{ISBN|0-06-059896-4}}</ref>\n*[[Alexander von Humboldt]], Prussian, 1769\u20131859\n*[[Thomas Young (scientist)]], British, 1773\u20131829\n*[[Mary Somerville]], Scottish, 1780\u20131872\n*[[Charles Babbage]], British, 1791\u20131871\n*[[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], French, 1852\u20131912\n*[[Nikola Tesla]], Serbian-Austrian, 1856\u20131942\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]], Filipino, 1861\u20131896\n*[[Bertrand Russell]], British, 1872\u20131970\n*[[Albert Schweitzer]], German, 1875\u20131965\n*[[Helen Keller]], American, 1880\u20131968\n*[[Karl Jaspers]], German, 1883\u20131969\n*[[John von Neumann]], Hungarian-American, 1903\u20131957\n*[[Jacob Bronowski]], Polish-born British, 1908\u20131974\n*[[Hedy Lamarr]], Austrian-born American, 1914\u20132000\n*[[Orson Welles]], American, 1915\u20131985\n*[[Herbert A.

In the [[Italian Renaissance]], the idea of the polymath was expressed by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472) in the statement that \"a man can do all things if he will\".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497891/Renaissance-man |title = Renaissance man \u2013 Definition, Characteristics, & Examples }}</ref>\n\nEmbodying a basic tenet of [[Renaissance humanism]] that humans are limitless in their capacity for development, the concept led to the notion that people should embrace all knowledge and develop their capacities as fully as possible.

These polymaths had a rounded approach to education that reflected the ideals of the [[Renaissance Humanism|humanists]] of the time. A [[gentleman]] or [[courtier]] of that era was expected to speak several languages, play a [[musical instrument]], write [[poetry]] and so on, thus fulfilling the Renaissance [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]].\n\nThe idea of a universal education was essential to achieving polymath ability, hence the word [[university]] was used to describe a seat of learning. At this time, universities did not specialize in specific areas, but rather trained students in a broad array of science, philosophy and theology. This universal education gave them a grounding from which they could continue into apprenticeship toward becoming a [[Master (form of address)|master]] of a specific field.\n\nWhen someone is called a \"Renaissance man\" today, it is meant that rather than simply having broad interests or superficial knowledge in several fields, the individual possesses a more profound knowledge and a proficiency, or even an expertise, in at least some of those fields.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=Renaissance+man |title = Renaissance man \u2014 Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |website = M-w.com |access-date = 2012-04-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome dictionaries use the term \"Renaissance man\" to describe someone with many interests or talents,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/orexxnaissanceman?view=uk |title=Oxford concise dictionary |publisher=Askoxford.com |access-date=6 April 2012 }}</ref> while others give a meaning restricted to the Renaissance and more closely related to Renaissance ideals.\n<!-- The [[Islamic Golden Age]] produced a lot of polymaths, a movement characterized by [[Ziauddin Sardar]] as such \"the methods of studying the vast creation of God \u2013 from the movement of the stars and planets to the nature of diseases, the sting of an ant, the character of madness, the beauty of justice, the spiritual yearning of humanity, the ecstasy of a mystic \u2013 are all equally valid and shape understanding in their respective areas of inquiry.

''Life stages of creativity''.</ref>\n\nA key point in the work of Root-Bernstein and colleagues is the argument in favor of the universality of the creative process. That is, although creative products, such as a painting, a mathematical model or a poem, can be domain-specific, at the level of the creative process, the mental tools that lead to the generation of creative ideas are the same, be it in the arts or science.<ref name=\":3\" /> These mental tools are sometimes called intuitive tools of thinking. It is therefore not surprising that many of the most innovative scientists have serious hobbies or interests in artistic activities, and that some of the most innovative artists have an interest or hobbies in the sciences.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>Root\u2010Bernstein, R.

Through their research, Root-Bernstein and colleagues conclude that there are certain comprehensive thinking skills and tools that cross the barrier of different domains and can foster creative thinking: \u201c[creativity researchers] who discuss integrating ideas from diverse fields as the basis of creative giftedness ask not \u201cwho is creative?\u201d but \u201cwhat is the basis of creative thinking?\u201d From the polymathy perspective, giftedness is the ability to combine disparate (or even apparently contradictory) ideas, sets of problems, skills, talents, and knowledge in novel and useful ways. Polymathy is therefore the main source of any individual's creative potential.\u201d (R. Root-Bernstein, 2009, p. 854). In \u201cLife Stages of Creativity\u201d, Robert and Mich\u00e8le Root-Bernstein suggest six typologies of creative life stages. These typologies based on real creative production records first published by Root-Bernstein, Bernstein, and Garnier (1993).\n\n* Type 1 represents people who specialize in developing one major talent early in life (e.g., prodigies) and successfully exploit that talent exclusively for the rest of their lives. \n* Type 2 individuals explore a range of different creative activities (e.g., through worldplay or a variety of hobbies) and then settle on exploiting one of these for the rest of their lives. \n* Type 3 people are polymathic from the outset and manage to juggle multiple careers simultaneously so that their creativity pattern is constantly varied. \n* Type 4 creators are recognized early for one major talent (e.g., math or music) but go on to explore additional creative outlets, diversifying their productivity with age. \n* Type 5 creators devote themselves serially to one creative field after another. \n* Type 6 people develop diversified creative skills early and then, like Type 5 individuals, explore these serially, one at a time.\n\nFinally, his studies suggest that understanding polymathy and learning from polymathic exemplars can help structure a new model of education that better promotes creativity and innovation: \u201cwe must focus education on principles, methods, and skills that will serve them [students] in learning and creating across many disciplines, multiple careers, and succeeding life stages\u201d (R. Root-Bernstein & M. Root-Bernstein, 2017, p.&nbsp;161).<ref>Root-Bernstein, R., & Root-Bernstein, M. (2017). People, passions, problems: The role of creative exemplars in teaching for creativity.

Springer, Cham.</ref>\n\n=== Peter Burke ===\n[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], Professor Emeritus of Cultural History and Fellow of Emmanuel College at Cambridge, discussed the theme of polymathy in some of his works. He has presented a comprehensive historical overview of the ascension and decline of the polymath as, what he calls, an \u201cintellectual species\u201d (see Burke, 2012; 2010).<ref>Burke, P. (2012). ''A social history of knowledge II: From the encyclopaedia to Wikipedia'' (Vol. 2). Polity.</ref><ref>Burke, P. (2010). The polymath: A cultural and social history of an intellectual species. ''Explorations in cultural history: Essays for Peter McCaffery'', 67\u201379.</ref>\n\nHe observes that in ancient and medieval times, scholars did not have to specialize. However, from the 17th century on, the rapid rise of new knowledge in the Western world\u2014both from the systematic investigation of the natural world and from the flow of information coming from other parts of the world\u2014was making it increasingly difficult for individual scholars to master as many disciplines as before. Thus, an intellectual retreat of the polymath species occurred: \u201cfrom knowledge in every [academic] field to knowledge in several fields, and from making original contributions in many fields to a more passive consumption of what has been contributed by others\u201d (Burke, 2010, p.&nbsp;72).\n\nGiven this change in the intellectual climate, it has since then been more common to find \u201cpassive polymaths\u201d, who consume knowledge in various domains but make their reputation in one single discipline, than \u201cproper polymaths\u201d, who\u2014through a feat of \u201cintellectual heroism\u201d\u2014manage to make serious contributions to several disciplines.\n\nHowever, Burke warns that in the age of specialization, polymathic people are more necessary than ever, both for synthesis\u2014to paint the big picture\u2014and for analysis. He says: \u201cIt takes a polymath to \u2018mind the gap\u2019 and draw attention to the knowledges that may otherwise disappear into the spaces between disciplines, as they are currently defined and organized\u201d (Burke, 2012, p.&nbsp;183).\n\nFinally, he suggests that governments and universities should nurture a habitat in which this \u201cendangered species\u201d can survive, offering students and scholars the possibility of interdisciplinary work.\n\n=== Kaufman, Beghetto and colleagues ===\n[[James C. Kaufman]], from the Neag School of Education at the University of Connecticut, and Ronald A. Beghetto, from the same university, investigated the possibility that everyone could have the potential for polymathy as well as the issue of the domain-generality or domain-specificity of creativity.<ref name=\":5\">Kaufman, J.

Do we all have multicreative potential?. ''ZDM'', ''41''(1\u20132), 39\u201344.</ref> proposed a typology of polymathy, ranging from the ubiquitous mini-c polymathy to the eminent but rare Big-C polymathy, as well as a model with some requirements for a person (polymath or not) to be able to reach the highest levels of creative accomplishment. They account for three general requirements\u2014intelligence, motivation to be creative and an environment that allows creative expression\u2014that are needed for any attempt at creativity to succeed. Then, depending on the domain of choice, more specific abilities will be required. The more that one's abilities and interests match the requirements of a domain, the better. While some will develop their specific skills and motivations for specific domains, polymathic people will display intrinsic motivation (and the ability) to pursue a variety of subject matters across different domains.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nRegarding the interplay of polymathy and education, they suggest that rather than asking whether every student has multicreative potential, educators might more actively nurture the multicreative potential of their students. As an example, the authors cite that teachers should encourage students to make connections across disciplines use different forms of media to express their reasoning and understanding (e.g., drawings, movies, and other forms of visual media).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Bharath Sriraman ===\n[[Bharath_Sriraman|Bharath Sriraman]], of the University of Montana, also investigated the role of polymathy in education. He poses that an ideal education should nurture talent in the classroom and enable individuals to pursue multiple fields of research and appreciate both the aesthetic and structural/scientific connections between mathematics, arts and the sciences.<ref>Sriraman, B., & Dahl, B. (2009). On bringing interdisciplinary ideas to gifted education. In ''International handbook on giftedness'' (pp. 1235\u20131256). Springer, Dordrecht.</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Sriraman published a paper reporting a 3-year study with 120 pre-service mathematics teachers and derived several implications for mathematics pre-service education as well as interdisciplinary education.<ref name=\":1\" /> He utilized a hermeneutic-phenomenological approach to recreate the emotions, voices and struggles of students as they tried to unravel Russell's paradox presented in its linguistic form. They found that those more engaged in solving the paradox also displayed more polymathic thinking traits. He concludes by suggesting that fostering polymathy in the classroom may help students change beliefs, discover structures and open new avenues for interdisciplinary pedagogy.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Michael Araki ===\n[[File:Developmental Model of Polymathy.jpg|thumb|550x550px|The Developmental Model of Polymathy (DMP)]]\n\nMichael Araki is a professor at Universidade Federal Fluminense in Brazil. He sought to formalize in a general model how the development of polymathy takes place. His Developmental Model of Polymathy (DMP) is presented in a 2018 article with two main objectives: (i) organize the elements involved in the process of polymathy development into a structure of relationships that is wed to the approach of polymathy as a life project, and (ii) provide an articulation with other well-developed constructs, theories and models, especially from the fields of giftedness and education.<ref name=\":7\">Araki, M. E. (2018). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324715756_Polymathy_A_New_Outlook_Journal_of_Genius_and_Eminence_2018 Polymathy: A new outlook]. ''Journal of Genius and Eminence'', ''3''(1), 66\u201382. Retrieved from: [[Researchgate.net]]</ref> The model, which was designed to reflect a structural model, has five major components: (1) polymathic antecedents, (2) polymathic mediators, (3) polymathic achievements, (4) intrapersonal moderators, and (5) environmental moderators.<ref name=\":7\" /> \n \nRegarding the definition of the term polymathy, the researcher, through an analysis of the extant literature, concluded that although there are a multitude of perspectives on polymathy, most of them ascertain that polymathy entails three core elements: breadth, depth and integration.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":0\">Araki, M. E. (2015). ''Polymathic leadership: Theoretical foundation and construct development.'' (Master\u2019s thesis), Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Available at SSRN: <nowiki>https://ssrn.com/abstract=3313137</nowiki></ref>\n\nBreadth refers to comprehensiveness, extension and diversity of knowledge. It is contrasted with the idea of narrowness, specialization, and the restriction of one's expertise to a limited domain. The possession of comprehensive knowledge at very disparate areas is a hallmark of the greatest polymaths.\n\nDepth refers to the vertical accumulation of knowledge and the degree of elaboration or sophistication of one's sets of one's conceptual network. Like Robert Root-Bernstein, Araki uses the concept of dilettancy as a contrast to the idea of profound learning that polymathy entails.\n\nIntegration, although not explicit in most definitions of polymathy, is also a core component of polymathy according to the author. Integration involves the capacity of connecting, articulating, concatenating or synthesizing different conceptual networks, which in non-polymathic persons might be segregated. In addition, integration can happen at the personality level, when the person is able to integrate his or her diverse activities in a synergic whole, which can also mean a psychic (motivational, emotional and cognitive) integration.\n\nFinally, the author also suggests that, via a psychoeconomic approach, polymathy can be seen as a \u201clife project\u201d. That is, depending on a person's temperament, endowments, personality, social situation and opportunities (or lack thereof), the project of a polymathic self-formation may present itself to the person as more or less alluring and more or less feasible to be pursued.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Angela Cotellessa ===\nOne of the most recent studies on the subject is Angela Cotellessa's doctoral Dissertation at George Washington University.<ref>Cotellessa, A. J. (2018). ''In Pursuit of Polymaths: Understanding Renaissance Persons of the 21 st Century'' (Doctoral dissertation, The George Washington University).</ref> In this work, she conducts a phenomenological study focusing on the life experiences of modern-day polymaths. Her investigation focused on accomplished polymaths with careers spanning both the arts and sciences. The participants provided insights regarding their development and lives as polymaths (Cotellessa, 2018).\nSeven conclusions were drawn from her research: (1) to be a polymath, one must accept seeming unusual and sometimes contradictory; polymaths are intra-personally diverse\u2014in other words, they have diversity within their own personhood (2) polymaths have a broad pool of experience, think both creatively and analytically, and juggle their many vocations and avocations by effectively managing their time; (3) being a polymath can be difficult but rewarding; (4) polymaths are analytically creative; (5) polymathy cannot be said to develop exclusively due to either nature nor nurture, and its continued expression throughout adulthood demands strong commitment to self-development; (6) polymathy distinguishes the individual from their peers from an early age often making them feel misunderstood; (7) family and financial resources influence the emergence of polymathy.\n\n== Related terms ==\nAside from \"Renaissance man\" as mentioned above, similar terms in use are {{lang|la|homo universalis}} ([[Latin]]) and {{lang|it|[[:it:Uomo universale|uomo universale]]}} ([[Italian language|Italian]]), which translate to \"universal man\".<ref name=\"Aus\" /> The related term \"generalist\"\u2014contrasted with a \"specialist\"\u2014is used to describe a person with a general approach to knowledge.\n\nThe term \"universal genius\" or \"versatile genius\" is also used, with [[Leonardo da Vinci]] as the prime example again. The term is used especially for people who made lasting contributions in at least one of the fields in which they were actively involved and when they took a universality of approach.\n\nWhen a person is described as having [[encyclopedic knowledge]], they exhibit a vast scope of knowledge. However, this designation may be anachronistic in the case of persons such as [[Eratosthenes]], whose reputation for having encyclopedic knowledge predates the existence of any [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedic object]].\n\n== Famous polymaths ==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2020}}\n*[[Aristotle]], Greek, 384\u2013322 BC\n*[[Seneca the Younger]], Spanish-Roman, c. 4 BC \u2013 AD 65\n*[[Zhang Heng]], Chinese, 78\u2013139\n*[[Shen Kuo]], Chinese, 1031-1095\n*[[Muhammad ibn Zakariya Razi]], Persian, 854\u2013925\n*[[Al-Farabi]], Persian, c. 872\n*[[Ibn al-Haytham]], Arab, 965\u20131040\n*[[Al-Biruni]], Persian, 973\u20131050\n*[[Avicenna]], Persian, 980\u20131037\n*[[Omar Khayyam]], Persian, 1048-1131\n*[[Hildegard of Bingen]], German, 1098\u20131179\n*[[Ibn Tufail]], Arab, 1105\u20131185\n*[[Maimonides]], Spanish, 1135\u20131204\n*[[Leon Battista Alberti]], Italian, 1404\u20131472\n*[[Antonio de Nebrija]], Spanish, 1441\u20131522\n*[[Leonardo da Vinci]], Italian, 1452\u20131519\n*[[Nicolaus Copernicus]], Polish, 1473\u20131543\n*[[Galileo Galilei]], Italian, 1564\u20131642\n*[[Fathullah Shirazi]], Persian, c. 1582 \n*[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], French, 1596\u20131650\n*[[Blaise Pascal]], French, 1623\u20131662\n*[[Isaac Newton]], English, 1642\u20131726\n*[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], German, 1646\u20131716\n*[[Benjamin Franklin]], American, 1705\u20131790\n*[[Mikhail Lomonosov]], Russian, 1711\u20131765\n*[[Thomas Jefferson]], American, 1743\u20131826 <ref>Hitchens, Christopher \"Thomas Jefferson: Author of America (2005), Harper Collins {{ISBN|0-06-059896-4}}</ref>\n*[[Alexander von Humboldt]], Prussian, 1769\u20131859\n*[[Thomas Young (scientist)]], British, 1773\u20131829\n*[[Mary Somerville]], Scottish, 1780\u20131872\n*[[Charles Babbage]], British, 1791\u20131871\n*[[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], French, 1852\u20131912\n*[[Nikola Tesla]], Serbian-Austrian, 1856\u20131942\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]], Filipino, 1861\u20131896\n*[[Bertrand Russell]], British, 1872\u20131970\n*[[Albert Schweitzer]], German, 1875\u20131965\n*[[Helen Keller]], American, 1880\u20131968\n*[[Karl Jaspers]], German, 1883\u20131969\n*[[John von Neumann]], Hungarian-American, 1903\u20131957\n*[[Jacob Bronowski]], Polish-born British, 1908\u20131974\n*[[Hedy Lamarr]], Austrian-born American, 1914\u20132000\n*[[Orson Welles]], American, 1915\u20131985\n*[[Herbert A.
