The [[Old High German]] form of the name is recorded as ''Hessun'' (dative plural of ''Hessi''), in [[Middle Latin]] as ''Hassia'', ''Hessia'', ''Hassonia''. The name of the Hessians ultimately continues the tribal name of the ''[[Chatti]]''.<ref>[[Gudmund Sch\u00fctte]], ''Our forefathers : The Gothonic nations : A manual of the ethnography of the Gothic, German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, Frisian and Scandinavian peoples'', vol. 2 (1933), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=0R9aAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA191 p. 191].</ref>\nThe ancient name ''Chatti'' by the 7th century is recorded as ''Chassi'', and from the 8th century as ''Hassi'' or ''Hessi''.<ref>\nChristian Presche, ''Kassel im Mittelalter: Zur Stadtentwicklung bis 1367'' vol. 1 (2013), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5ZfbAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 p. 41].</ref>\n\nAn inhabitant of Hessen is called a \"Hessian\" (German: ''[[:wikt:Hesse#German|Hesse]]'' (masculine) or ''Hessin'' (feminine), plural ''Hessen''). \nThe [[American English]] term [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessian]] for 18th-century British auxiliary troops originates with Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse|Frederick II]] of [[Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel|Hessen-Cassel]] hiring out regular army units to the government of Great Britain to fight in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nThe English form ''Hesse'' was in common use by the 18th century, first in the hyphenated names ''Hesse-Cassel'' and ''Hesse-Darmstadt'', but the latinate form ''Hessia'' remained in common English usage well into the 19th century.<ref>\"The Hessians, called, in the early history of Germany, Catti, lived in the present Hessia\".

It corresponds only loosely to the medieval [[Landgraviate of Hessen]].\nIn the 19th century, prior to the [[unification of Germany]], the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]], the free city of [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Electorate of Hesse]] (also known as Hesse-Cassel). \n\n=== Early history ===\n{{see|Chatti|Austrasia}}\nThe Central Hessian region was inhabited in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nFinds of tools in southern Hesse in R\u00fcsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A [[Rh\u00fcnda Skull|fossil hominid skull]] that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rh\u00fcnda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago.\nThe [[Z\u00fcschen (megalithic tomb)|Z\u00fcschen tomb]] (German: Steinkammergrab von Z\u00fcschen, sometimes also Lohne-Z\u00fcschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] and [[Z\u00fcschen, Fritzlar|Z\u00fcschen]], near [[Fritzlar]], Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone [[cist]] (''hessisch-westf\u00e4lische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in Central Europe. Dating to c. 3000 BC, it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nAn early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC [[La T\u00e8ne]]-style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in AD 69.\n\nHessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the [[Saxons]] (to the north) and the [[Franks]], who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied [[Thuringia]] (to the east) in 531.<ref>Clay 125-27, 137-39.</ref> Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is [[Fritzlar]]; it extends in the southeast to [[Hersfeld]] on the Fulda River, in the north to past [[Kassel]] and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the Rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north-south, and 80 north-west.<ref>Clay 120.</ref>\n\nThe area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a [[horse burial]] and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called ''Heilgenbron''; the name \"Geismar\" (possibly \"energetic pool\") itself may be derived from that spring. \nThe village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maden, Gudensberg|de|3=Maden (Gudensberg)}}, now a part of [[Gudensberg]] near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall [[quartzite]] [[megalith]] called the ''[[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wotanstein]]'' is at the center of the village.<ref>Clay 132\u2013137.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including [[Christenberg]].<ref>Clay 143\u2013155.</ref> By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in [[Diemelstadt|Gaulskopf]] and [[Eresburg]] across the River Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The [[B\u00fcraburg]] (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century<ref>Rau 141.</ref>) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the B\u00fcraburg was \"probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years\". Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed \"8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia\".<ref>Clay 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nFollowing Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]e'' had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]], and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon [[Hessengau]] also came under the rule of the Franconians.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\n{{see|Duchy of Franconia|Duchy of Thuringia|Landgraviate of Hesse|Free City of Frankfurt|Upper Rhenish Circle|Hesse-Marburg|Hesse-Rheinfels|Hesse-Homburg|Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt}}\n{{see|Ludovingians|House of Hesse|List of rulers of Hesse}}\n[[File:COA family de Landgrafen von Hessen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Ludovingian coat of arms with its ''lion rampant barry argent and gules'', the so-called [[Coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]]]]\nIn the 12th century, [[Hessengau]] was passed to [[Thuringia]].\nIn the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] (1247\u20131264), Hesse gained independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[kingdom of France|France]].\n\n[[File:Hessen-Darmstadt Landgrafschaft-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of Hesse-Darmstadt]]\nThe Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720\u20131785) ruled as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760\u20131785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776\u20131783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n{{see|Electorate of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Nassau|People's State of Hesse|Province of Kurhessen|Greater Hesse}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1806-1918.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]\nThe ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\n[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gie\u00dfen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself \"[[Volksstaat Hessen]]\" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. In 1929 the [[Principality of Waldeck]] was dissolved and incorporated into [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Gro\u00df-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. \n\nOn 4 December 1946 Gro\u00df-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017144544/http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}</ref>\nHesse in the 1940s received more than a million [[Heimatvertriebene|displaced ethnic Germans]].\nDue to its proximity to the [[Inner German border]], Hesse became an important location of [[NATO]] installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[United States Army Europe]]. \nThe first elected minister president of Hesse was [[Christian Stock]], followed by [[Georg-August Zinn]] (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called ''Gro\u00dfer Hessenplan''. The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under [[Walter Wallmann]] during 1987\u20131991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under [[Hans Eichel]] during 1991\u20131999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under [[Roland Koch]] (retired 2010) and [[Volker Bouffier]] (incumbent as of 2019).\n[[Frankfurt]] during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}\n[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]\n\nSituated in west-central Germany, The state of Hesse borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nMost of the population of Hesse lives in the southern part, in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The principal cities of the area include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]]. Other major towns in Hesse are [[Fulda]] in the [[East Hesse|east]], and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the [[North Hesse|north]]. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.\n\nThe most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rh\u00f6n]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and the [[Spessart]].\n\nThe Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one [[oxbow lake]] \u2014\u2013 the so-called Alt-Rhein \u2014\u2013 runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.\n\nHesse is the greenest state in Germany, as forest covers 42% of the state.<ref name=\"HesseGeography\">{{cite web|title=Our State|url=http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106184553/http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2013|publisher=State of Hesse|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\nHesse is a [[unitary state]] governed directly by the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian government]] in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called ''Regierungspr\u00e4sidien''. Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of [[home rule]].\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe state is divided into three administrative provinces (''Regierungsbezirke''): [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] in the north and east, [[Gie\u00dfen (region)|Gie\u00dfen]] in the centre, and [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt]] in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] agglomeration in its central area. The administrative regions have no legislature of their own, but are executive agencies of the state government.\n\n[[File:Map of Hesse with districts (with numbers).svg|frameless|upright=1.45]]\n[[File:0472-0490R-Hessische Staatskanzlei.jpg|thumb|The state chancellery building in the capital city of [[Wiesbaden]]]]\n[[File:FrankfurtSkyline2014.jpg|thumb|[[Frankfurt am Main]]]]\n[[File:Schlosspark Wilhelmsh\u00f6he 001.jpg|thumb|[[Kassel]]]]\n[[File:Luisenplatz.jpg|thumb|[[Darmstadt]]]]\n[[File:Offenbach am main from drone.jpg|thumb|[[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach am Main]]]]\nHesse is divided into 21 districts (Kreise) and five independent cities, each with their own local governments.

It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the \"land of the thousand hills\". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.\n\n== State symbols and politics ==\n{{Main article|Politics of Hesse}}\n\nHesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] (1933\u20131945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.\n\n=== Head of state ===\nAs Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the [[Minister-president|Minister-President]] (German: ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]].\n\n=== Most recent state election ===\nIn the [[Hessian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections]] the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse's previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the [[Hessian_state_election,_2013|2013 state election]], this marked its first entry into the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag''). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose [[Grand_coalition_(Germany)|coalition]] made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the [[Bavarian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections in Bavaria]]. In the current parliament the conservative CDU holds a 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each hold 29 seats, the right-wing AfD holds 19 seats, the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party holds 11 seats and the socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] holds 9 seats.\n\n[[File:Landtag of Hesse 2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament as of the 2018 election]]\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nAs a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.

HR is a member of the federal [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] broadcasting association. HR provides a statewide TV channel as well as a range of regional radio stations (HR&nbsp;1, HR&nbsp;2, HR&nbsp;3, HR&nbsp;4, you&nbsp;fm and HR&nbsp;info). Besides the state run HR, privately run TV stations exist and are an important line of commerce. Among the commercial radio stations that are active in Hesse, Hit Radio FFH, Planet Radio, Harmony FM, Radio BOB and Antenne Frankfurt are the most popular.\n\n== Economy ==\nWith Hesse's largest city [[Frankfurt am Main]] being home of the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB), the [[Bundesbank|German Bundesbank]] and the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]], Hesse is home to the financial capital of mainland Europe. Furthermore, Hesse has always been one of the largest and healthiest economies in Germany. Its [[GDP]] in 2013 exceeded \u20ac236&nbsp;billion (about US$316&nbsp;billion).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|title=Bruttoinlandsprodukt|publisher=Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt|year=2012|work=Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnungen|accessdate=27 March 2013|language=de|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120914010546/http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/gesamtwirtschaft-konjunktur/landesdaten/bip-wirtschaftsbereichen/grundzahlen-bruttoinlandsprodukt-bruttowertschoepfung/index.html|archivedate=14 September 2012}}</ref> This makes Hesse itself one of the largest economies in Europe and the 38th largest in the world.<ref>See the [[list of countries by GDP (nominal)]].</ref> According to GDP-per-capita figures, Hesse is the wealthiest state (after the [[city-state]]s [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]) in Germany with approx. US$52,500.\n\nThe [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]] has the second largest industrial density in Germany after the [[Ruhr area]]. The main economic fields of importance are the [[chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical]] industries with [[Sanofi]], [[Merck Group|Merck]], [[Heraeus]], [[Messer Griesheim]] and [[Degussa]]. In the mechanical and automotive engineering field [[Opel]] in R\u00fcsselsheim is worth mentioning. Frankfurt is crucial as a [[financial center]], with both the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank]]'s headquarters located there. Numerous smaller banks and [[Deutsche Bank]], [[DZ Bank]], [[KfW|KfW Bank]], [[Commerzbank]] are also headquartered in Frankfurt, with the offices of several international banks also being housed there. Frankfurt is also the location of the most important German stock exchange, the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]]. [[Insurance]] companies have settled mostly in [[Wiesbaden]]. The city's largest private employer is the [[R+V Versicherung]], with about 3,900 employees, other major employers are [[Winterthur Group|DBV-Winterthur]], the [[SV SparkassenVersicherung]] and the [[Delta Lloyd Group]]. The leather industry is predominantly settled in [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]]. The company operating [[Frankfurt Airport]] is one of the largest employers in Hesse with nearly 22.000 employees<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fraport.com/en/misc/binaer/fraport-group/investors/events-and-publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2017/_jcr_content.file/gb_2017_en_web.pdf|title=Annual Report 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>. Companies with an international reputation are located outside the Rhine-Main region in [[Wetzlar]]. There is the center of the optical, electrical and precision engineering industries, [[Esselte Leitz GmbH & Co KG|Leitz]], [[Leica Camera|Leica]], [[Minox]], Hensoldt ([[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]]), [[Buderus]] and [[Brita]] with several plants in central Hesse. In east [[Fulda]] there is the rubber plant ([[Fulda Reifen]]). In northern Hesse, in [[Baunatal]], [[Volkswagen AG]] has a large factory that manufactures spare parts. [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] has a large plant that manufactures [[Locomotive]]s in [[Kassel]].\n\nThe [[Hochtaunuskreis]] has the lowest Rate at 3.8 % while the independent city of Kassel has the highest rate nationally at 12.1%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eures/main.jsp?countryId=DE&acro=lmi&showRegion=true&lang=en&mode=text&regionId=DE0&nuts2Code=%20&nuts3Code=null&catId=366|title=EURES - Labour market information - Hessen - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref> In October 2018 the unemployment rate stood at 4.4% and was lower than the national average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/36651/umfrage/arbeitslosenquote-in-deutschland-nach-bundeslaendern/|title=Arbeitslosenquote nach Bundesl\u00e4ndern in Deutschland 2018 {{!}} Statista|website=Statista|language=de|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online/data;sid=B1C50643A60FE295E866C5D1DE88989D.GO_2_2?operation=previous&levelindex=3&levelid=1542121134059&levelid=1542121130976&step=2|title=Federal Statistical Office Germany - GENESIS-Online|last=(Destatis),|first=\u00a9 Statistisches Bundesamt|date=2018-11-13|website=www-genesis.destatis.de|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref>\n!2000\n!2001\n!2002\n!2003\n!2004\n!2005\n!2006\n!2007\n!2008\n!2009\n!2010\n!2011\n!2012\n!2013\n!2014\n!2015\n!2016\n!2017\n!2018\n|-\n|Unemployment rate in %\n|7.3\n|6.6\n|7.0\n|7.9\n|8.2\n|9.7\n|9.2\n|7.5\n|6.5\n|6.8\n|6.4\n|5.9\n|5.7\n|5.8\n|5.7\n|5.5\n|5.3\n|5.0\n|4.6\n|}\n\n== Traffic and public transportation ==\nMany trans-European and German motorways, high-speed rail lines, and waterways cross Hesse. [[Frankfurt International Airport]] is Germany's largest and Europe's third-largest airport (after [[London Heathrow]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]]). [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof]] is Germany's second-busiest railway station by passengers but the busiest in terms of traffic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n=== Road transport ===\nHesse has a dense highway network with a total of 24 motorways. The internationally important motorway routes through Hesse are the A3, A5, and A7. Close to Frankfurt Airport is the [[Frankfurter Kreuz]], Germany's busiest and one of Europe's busiest motorway junctions, where the motorways [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] (Arnhem-Cologne-Frankfurt-Nuremberg-Passau) and [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] (Hattenbach-Frankfurt-Karlsruhe-Basel) intersect. The A5 becomes as wide as four lanes in each direction near the city of Frankfurt am Main, and during the rush-hour, it is possible to use the emergency lanes on the A3 and A5 motorway in the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]], adding additional lanes. Other major leading Hesse highways are the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]], the [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]], the [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], the Federal Highway [[Bundesautobahn 66|A66]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]]. There are also a number of smaller motorways and major trunk roads, some of which are [[dual carriageway]]s.\n\n=== Railway transport ===\nHesse is accessed by many major rail lines, including the high-speed lines [[K\u00f6ln\u2013Frankfurt high-speed rail line|Cologne\u2013Frankfurt]] and [[Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg high-speed railway|Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg]]. Other north-south connections traverse major east-west routes from Wiesbaden and Mainz to Frankfurt and from Hanau and Aschaffenburg to Fulda and Kassel. The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|title=Bahn|website=Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175904/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe region around Frankfurt has an extensive [[S-Bahn]] network, the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]], which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world's ten largest. [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] lies to the south, and is frequented by [[general aviation]] and private planes. [[Kassel Airport]] offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], use [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]].\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Ingrao, Charles W.

The [[Old High German]] form of the name is recorded as ''Hessun'' (dative plural of ''Hessi''), in [[Middle Latin]] as ''Hassia'', ''Hessia'', ''Hassonia''.

It corresponds only loosely to the medieval [[Landgraviate of Hessen]].\nIn the 19th century, prior to the [[unification of Germany]], the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]], the [[Duchy of Nassau]], the free city of [[Frankfurt]] and the [[Electorate of Hesse]] (also known as Hesse-Cassel). \n\n=== Early history ===\n{{see|Chatti|Austrasia}}\nThe Central Hessian region was inhabited in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. \nFinds of tools in southern Hesse in R\u00fcsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A [[Rh\u00fcnda Skull|fossil hominid skull]] that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rh\u00fcnda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago.\nThe [[Z\u00fcschen (megalithic tomb)|Z\u00fcschen tomb]] (German: Steinkammergrab von Z\u00fcschen, sometimes also Lohne-Z\u00fcschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between [[Lohne, Germany|Lohne]] and [[Z\u00fcschen, Fritzlar|Z\u00fcschen]], near [[Fritzlar]], Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone [[cist]] (''hessisch-westf\u00e4lische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in Central Europe. Dating to c. 3000 BC, it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]].\n\nAn early [[Celt]]ic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC [[La T\u00e8ne]]-style burial uncovered at [[Glauberg]]. The region was later settled by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Chatti]] tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name ''Hesse'' is a continuation of that tribal name.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the [[Revolt of the Batavi]] in AD 69.\n\nHessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the [[Saxons]] (to the north) and the [[Franks]], who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied [[Thuringia]] (to the east) in 531.<ref>Clay 125-27, 137-39.</ref> Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is [[Fritzlar]]; it extends in the southeast to [[Hersfeld]] on the Fulda River, in the north to past [[Kassel]] and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the Rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north-south, and 80 north-west.<ref>Clay 120.</ref>\n\nThe area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a [[horse burial]] and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called ''Heilgenbron''; the name \"Geismar\" (possibly \"energetic pool\") itself may be derived from that spring. \nThe village of {{Interlanguage link multi|Maden, Gudensberg|de|3=Maden (Gudensberg)}}, now a part of [[Gudensberg]] near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall [[quartzite]] [[megalith]] called the ''[[Wotanstein (Hesse)|Wotanstein]]'' is at the center of the village.<ref>Clay 132\u2013137.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including [[Christenberg]].<ref>Clay 143\u2013155.</ref> By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in [[Diemelstadt|Gaulskopf]] and [[Eresburg]] across the River Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The [[B\u00fcraburg]] (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century<ref>Rau 141.</ref>) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the B\u00fcraburg was \"probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years\". Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed \"8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia\".<ref>Clay 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\nFollowing Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|gau]]e'' had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around [[Fritzlar]] and [[Kassel]], and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon [[Hessengau]] also came under the rule of the Franconians.\n\n=== Holy Roman Empire ===\n{{see|Duchy of Franconia|Duchy of Thuringia|Landgraviate of Hesse|Free City of Frankfurt|Upper Rhenish Circle|Hesse-Marburg|Hesse-Rheinfels|Hesse-Homburg|Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt}}\n{{see|Ludovingians|House of Hesse|List of rulers of Hesse}}\n[[File:COA family de Landgrafen von Hessen.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The Ludovingian coat of arms with its ''lion rampant barry argent and gules'', the so-called [[Coat of arms of Hesse|lion of Hesse]]]]\nIn the 12th century, [[Hessengau]] was passed to [[Thuringia]].\nIn the [[War of the Thuringian Succession]] (1247\u20131264), Hesse gained independence and became a [[Landgraviate of Hesse|Landgraviate]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It shortly rose to primary importance under Landgrave [[Philipp I of Hesse|Philip the Magnanimous]], who was one of the leaders of German [[Protestantism]]. After Philip's death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a [[Polygamy|bigamist]]) into four lines: [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], [[Hesse-Rheinfels]], and the also previously existing [[Hesse-Marburg]]. As the latter two lines died out quite soon (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when [[Hesse-Homburg]] split off from Hesse-Darmstadt. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted [[Calvinism]], while Darmstadt remained [[Lutheran]] and subsequently the two lines often found themselves on different sides of a conflict, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the [[Thirty Years' War]], when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with [[Sweden]] and [[kingdom of France|France]].\n\n[[File:Hessen-Darmstadt Landgrafschaft-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of Hesse-Darmstadt]]\nThe Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel|Frederick II]] (1720\u20131785) ruled as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] with Christian values, [[Cameralism|cameralist]] plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy.<ref>Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian Mercenary State: Ideas, Institutions, and Reform under Frederick II, 1760\u20131785'' (2003)</ref> He funded the depleted treasury of the poor nation by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to [[Great Britain]] to fight in North America during the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1776\u20131783. These soldiers, commonly known as [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessians]], fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.\n\n=== Modern history ===\n{{see|Electorate of Hesse|Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse-Nassau|People's State of Hesse|Province of Kurhessen|Greater Hesse}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Grand Duchy of Hesse 1806-1918.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|Coat of arms of the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]]]\nThe ruler of [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] was elevated to the status of [[Prince-Elector]] in 1803, but this remained without effect, as the Holy Roman Empire was disbanded in 1806. The territory was annexed by Napoleon to the Kingdom of [[Westphalia]] in 1806, but restored to the Elector in 1813. While other Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title. The name survived in the term ''Kurhessen'', denoting the region around Kassel. In 1866, it was annexed by [[Prussia]], together with the [[Free City of Frankfurt]], the small [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg]], and the [[Duchy of Nassau]], which were then combined into the province of [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\n[[Hesse-Darmstadt]] was elevated by Napoleon to the status of a Grand Duchy in 1806, becoming the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]. In the [[War of 1866]], it fought on the side of [[Austria]] against [[Prussia]], but retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the [[Main River]] and Prussia did not dare to expand beyond the Main line, as this might have provoked France. However, the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main (the region around the town of [[Gie\u00dfen]], commonly called ''Oberhessen'') were incorporated in the [[Norddeutscher Bund]], a tight federation of German states, established by Prussia in 1867. In 1871, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the rest of the Grand Duchy joined the [[German Empire]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the [[Jugendstil]]. Until 1907, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] used the Hessian red and white lion as its coat-of-arms.\n\nThe revolution of 1918 transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself \"[[Volksstaat Hessen]]\" (People's State of Hesse). The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the western banks of the Rhine (province Rheinhessen) were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. In 1929 the [[Principality of Waldeck]] was dissolved and incorporated into [[Hesse-Nassau]].\n\nAfter [[World War II]], the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, whereas the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. The French separated their part of Hesse from the rest of the region and incorporated it into the newly founded state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (Rheinland-Pfalz). The United States, on the other side, proclaimed the state of [[Greater Hesse]] (''Gro\u00df-Hessen'') on 19 September 1945, out of Hesse-Darmstadt and most of the former Prussian province of [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. \n\nOn 4 December 1946 Gro\u00df-Hessen was officially renamed Hessen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |title=Hessen - 60 stolze Jahre - Zeittafel 1945/1946 |accessdate=2006-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017144544/http://60stolzejahre.hessen.de/dynasite.cfm?dssid=77&dsmid=1898 |archivedate=2006-10-17 }}</ref>\nHesse in the 1940s received more than a million [[Heimatvertriebene|displaced ethnic Germans]].\nDue to its proximity to the [[Inner German border]], Hesse became an important location of [[NATO]] installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US [[V Corps (United States)|V Corps]] and [[United States Army Europe]]. \nThe first elected minister president of Hesse was [[Christian Stock]], followed by [[Georg-August Zinn]] (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called ''Gro\u00dfer Hessenplan''. The [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under [[Walter Wallmann]] during 1987\u20131991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under [[Hans Eichel]] during 1991\u20131999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under [[Roland Koch]] (retired 2010) and [[Volker Bouffier]] (incumbent as of 2019).\n[[Frankfurt]] during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of places in Hesse|List of mountains of Hesse}}\n[[File:Hessen topografisch Relief Karte.png|thumb|upright=1.05|The most important rivers, mountains, and cities of Hesse]]\n\nSituated in west-central Germany, The state of Hesse borders the German states of (starting in the north and proceeding clockwise) [[Lower Saxony]], [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]].\n\nMost of the population of Hesse lives in the southern part, in the [[Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region|Rhine Main Area]]. The principal cities of the area include [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Darmstadt]], [[Offenbach, Hesse|Offenbach]], [[Hanau]], [[Gie\u00dfen]], [[Wetzlar]], and [[Limburg an der Lahn|Limburg]]. Other major towns in Hesse are [[Fulda]] in the [[East Hesse|east]], and [[Kassel]] and [[Marburg an der Lahn]] in the [[North Hesse|north]]. The densely populated Rhine-Main region is much better developed than the rural areas in the middle and northern parts of Hesse.\n\nThe most important rivers in Hesse are the [[Fulda River|Fulda]] and [[Eder]] Rivers in the north, the [[Lahn]] in the central part of Hesse, and the [[Main (river)|Main]] and [[Rhine]] in the south. The countryside is hilly and the numerous mountain ranges include the [[Rh\u00f6n]], the [[Westerwald]], the [[Taunus]], the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]], the [[Kn\u00fcll]] and the [[Spessart]].\n\nThe Rhine borders Hesse on the southwest without running through the state, only one [[oxbow lake]] \u2014\u2013 the so-called Alt-Rhein \u2014\u2013 runs through Hesse. The mountain range between the Main and the Neckar Rivers is called the [[Odenwald]]. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and Neckar, and the Odenwald Mountains is called the Ried.\n\nHesse is the greenest state in Germany, as forest covers 42% of the state.<ref name=\"HesseGeography\">{{cite web|title=Our State|url=http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130106184553/http://www.hessen.eu/irj/hessen_en_Internet?cid=42734bf7b41385446b3a113d3314add9|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2013|publisher=State of Hesse|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Administration ==\nHesse is a [[unitary state]] governed directly by the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian government]] in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called ''Regierungspr\u00e4sidien''. Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of [[home rule]].\n\n=== Districts ===\nThe state is divided into three administrative provinces (''Regierungsbezirke''): [[Kassel (region)|Kassel]] in the north and east, [[Gie\u00dfen (region)|Gie\u00dfen]] in the centre, and [[Darmstadt (region)|Darmstadt]] in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the [[Frankfurt Rhine-Main]] agglomeration in its central area.

It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the \"land of the thousand hills\". Its larger towns include [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]], [[Nieder-Olm]], and [[Ingelheim]]. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.\n\n== State symbols and politics ==\n{{Main article|Politics of Hesse}}\n\nHesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during [[Nazi Germany|Nazi rule]] (1933\u20131945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the federal states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) or the center-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.\n\n=== Head of state ===\nAs Hesse is a federal state, its constitution combines the offices of the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in one office called the [[Minister-president|Minister-President]] (German: ''Ministerpr\u00e4sident'') which is comparable to the office of a [[prime minister]].\n\n=== Most recent state election ===\nIn the [[Hessian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections]] the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse's previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the [[Hessian_state_election,_2013|2013 state election]], this marked its first entry into the [[Landtag of Hesse|Hessian parliament]] (''Hessischer Landtag''). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose [[Grand_coalition_(Germany)|coalition]] made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the [[Bavarian_state_election,_2018|2018 state elections in Bavaria]]. In the current parliament the conservative CDU holds a 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each hold 29 seats, the right-wing AfD holds 19 seats, the liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] party holds 11 seats and the socialist party [[The Left (Germany)|Die Linke]] holds 9 seats.\n\n[[File:Landtag of Hesse 2018.svg|thumb|The Hessian parliament as of the 2018 election]]\n\n=== Foreign affairs ===\nAs a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the [[federal government of Germany]] and in [[Brussels]] at the [[European Union]].<ref>State of Hessen. Foreign representation offices.

[[Frankfurt International Airport]] is Germany's largest and Europe's third-largest airport (after [[London Heathrow]] and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle]]). [[Frankfurt (Main) Hauptbahnhof]] is Germany's second-busiest railway station by passengers but the busiest in terms of traffic.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n=== Road transport ===\nHesse has a dense highway network with a total of 24 motorways. The internationally important motorway routes through Hesse are the A3, A5, and A7. Close to Frankfurt Airport is the [[Frankfurter Kreuz]], Germany's busiest and one of Europe's busiest motorway junctions, where the motorways [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] (Arnhem-Cologne-Frankfurt-Nuremberg-Passau) and [[Bundesautobahn 5|A5]] (Hattenbach-Frankfurt-Karlsruhe-Basel) intersect. The A5 becomes as wide as four lanes in each direction near the city of Frankfurt am Main, and during the rush-hour, it is possible to use the emergency lanes on the A3 and A5 motorway in the [[Frankfurt/Rhine-Main|Rhine-Main Region]], adding additional lanes. Other major leading Hesse highways are the [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]], the [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]], the [[Bundesautobahn 45|A45]], the Federal Highway [[Bundesautobahn 66|A66]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 67|A67]]. There are also a number of smaller motorways and major trunk roads, some of which are [[dual carriageway]]s.\n\n=== Railway transport ===\nHesse is accessed by many major rail lines, including the high-speed lines [[K\u00f6ln\u2013Frankfurt high-speed rail line|Cologne\u2013Frankfurt]] and [[Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg high-speed railway|Hanover\u2013W\u00fcrzburg]]. Other north-south connections traverse major east-west routes from Wiesbaden and Mainz to Frankfurt and from Hanau and Aschaffenburg to Fulda and Kassel. The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|title=Bahn|website=Frankfurt am Main|accessdate=5 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905175904/https://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=2817|archive-date=5 September 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe region around Frankfurt has an extensive [[S-Bahn]] network, the [[S-Bahn Rhein-Main]], which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the [[RegioTram Kassel|RegioTram]], a [[tram-train]]-concept similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]].\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[Frankfurt Airport]] is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world's ten largest. [[Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport]] lies to the south, and is frequented by [[general aviation]] and private planes. [[Kassel Airport]] offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. [[Low-cost airline]]s, especially [[Ryanair]], use [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]] as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100&nbsp;km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. The DFS ([[Deutsche Flugsicherung|German air traffic control]]) has its headquarters in [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]].\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* Ingrao, Charles W.

[[Arian Baptistery]], Ravenna, early 6th century.]]\n\nThe '''Hetoimasia''', '''Etimasia''' (Greek \u1f11\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, \"preparation\"), '''prepared throne''', '''Preparation of the Throne''', '''ready throne''' or '''Throne of the Second Coming''' is the Christian version of the symbolic subject of the '''empty throne''' found in the art of the ancient world, whose meaning has changed over the centuries.  In [[Ancient Greece]] it represented [[Zeus]], chief of the gods, and in early [[Buddhist art]] it represented [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]].  In [[Early Christian art]] and Early [[Medieval art]] it is found in both the East and Western churches, and represents either [[Christ]], or sometimes [[God the Father]] as part of the [[Trinity]].  In the Middle Byzantine period, from about 1000, it came to represent more specifically the throne prepared for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ, a meaning it has retained in [[Eastern Orthodox]] art to the present.<ref>Schiller, II, 186.</ref>  The motif consists of an empty [[throne]] and various other symbolic objects, in later depictions surrounded when space allows by angels paying homage.  It is usually placed centrally in schemes of composition, very often in a [[roundel]], but typically is not the largest element in a scheme of decoration.<ref>Hall, 94</ref>\n\n==The empty throne in pre-Christian art==\n[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Buddhist 2nd century empty throne, attacked by [[Mara (demon)|Mara]].<ref>Krishan, pp. 1 and 5, fig 4a caption</ref>]]\n[[File:Prestol ugotovanny.jpg|thumb|200px|left|On the reverse of a Russian icon, with [[instruments of the Passion]].]]\nThe \"empty throne\" had a long pre-Christian history.  An [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] relief in Berlin of c. 1243 BCE shows King [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] kneeling before the empty throne of the fire-god [[Nusku]], occupied by what appears to be a flame.<ref>[http://arttattler.com/archivebeyondbabylon.html Berlin relief]</ref>  The [[Hittites]] put thrones in important shrines for the spirit of the dead person to occupy, and the [[Etruscans]] left an empty seat at the head of the table at religious feasts for the god to join the company.<ref>Hall, 95</ref>  A somewhat controversial theory, held by many specialists, sees the [[Israelite]] [[Ark of the Covenant]], or the figures of the [[cherubim]] above it, as an empty throne.<ref>Haran, 247-249, and later in the chapter. See his notes for further literature</ref>    A throne with a crown upon it had been a symbol for an absent monarch in Ancient Greek culture since at least the time of [[Alexander the Great]],<ref>Syndicus, 151</ref> whose deification allowed secular use for what had previously been a symbol for Zeus, where the attribute placed on the throne was a pair of zig-zag thunderbolts.<ref>Hall, 95, [http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/cilicia/olba/SNGLev_645.jpg coin 1st century CE] from [[Cilicia]]</ref> Early [[Buddhist art]] used an empty throne, often under a [[parasol]] or [[Bodhi Tree]], from before the time of Christ.  This was, in the traditional view, an [[aniconism|aniconic]] symbol for the Buddha; they [[Aniconism in Buddhism|avoided depicting]] the Buddha in human form, [[God the Father in Western art|like early Christians with God the Father]].  Alternatively, it has been argued that these images represent actual [[cetiya|relic-thrones]] at the major pilgrimage sites which were objects of worship.<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/b/buddhist-sculpture-v-and-a/ Example from the V&A museum].  The alternative theory, first advanced by Huntington (see her final paragraph), sees these images as depictions of an actual relic-throne of the Buddha as an object of worship at major Buddhist sites, but this [[Aniconism in Buddhism|remains controversial]].</ref>  The throne often contains a symbol such as the [[dharma wheel]] or [[Buddha footprint]], as well as a cushion.\n\nLike the Greeks and other ancient peoples, the Romans held ritual banquets for the gods (a ritualized \"[[theoxenia]]\"), including the annual [[Epulum Jovis]], and the [[lectisternium]], originally a rare event in times of crisis, first held in 399 BCE according to [[Livy]], but later much more common.<ref>Ramsay, 344</ref>  A seat for these was called a ''pulvinar'', from ''pulvinus'' (\"cushion\"), and many temples held these; at the banquets statues of the deity were placed on them.  There was a pulvinar at the [[Circus Maximus]], on which initially statues and attributes of the gods were placed after a procession during games, but [[Augustus]] also occupied it himself (possibly copying [[Julius Caesar]]), building a temple-like structure in the seating to house it.<ref>Humphrey, 78-80</ref>   Thrones with a jewelled wreath, portrait or [[sceptre]] and [[diadem]] sitting on them were among the symbols used in the Roman law courts and elsewhere to represent the authority of the absent emperor; this was one of the monarchical attributes awarded by the [[Roman Senate]] to Julius Caesar.<ref>Humphrey, 79; Hall, 95; Hellemo, 107; [https://books.google.com/books?id=4II_mqxM8s0C&pg=PA62&dq=pulvinar+temple&cd=4#v=onepage&q=pulvinar%20temple&f=false Fishwick]. See Temple 10, note 12 for detailed studies</ref>  A seat with jewelled wreath is seen on coins from the [[Emperor Titus]] onwards, and on those of [[Diocletian]] a seat with a helmet on it represents [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]].<ref>Hellemo, 107</ref>  [[Commodus]] chose to be represented by a seat with the club and lion skin of [[Hercules]], with whom he identified himself.  The empty throne continued to be used as a secular symbol of power by the first Christian Emperors, and appears on the [[Arch of Constantine]].\n\nLater non-Christian uses of the empty throne motif include the \"Bema Feast\", the most important annual feast of Persian [[Manichaeism]], when a \"bema\" or empty throne represented the [[Mani (prophet)|prophet Mani]] at a meal for worshippers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y7IHmyKcPtYC&pg=PA986&dq=Bema+feast+mani+empty+throne&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Bema%20feast%20mani%20empty%20throne&f=false The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods]</ref>    In the [[Bali]]nese version of [[Hinduism]], the most prominent element in most temples is the ''padmasana'' or \"Lotus Throne\", an empty throne for the supreme deity [[Acintya]].<ref>Davison and Granquist, 8-9, [http://www.baliblog.com/travel-tips/bali-travel/padmasana-the-lotus-throne.html Baliblog, with images]</ref>\n\n==Christian art==\n[[File:Poze Lucianiene 225.jpg|thumb|Modern depiction in a [[Romanian Orthodox]] church, with crown of thorns around the cross.]]\nThere are several elements found in the image which reflect its changing meaning.  The throne itself is always present, and is often backless and armless.  In Ancient Greek, a \"thronos\" was a specific but ordinary type of chair with a footstool, and there is very often a footstool in the image.   There is often a prominent cushion, and a cloth variously interpreted as Christ's mantle (especially when of imperial purple) or a [[sudarium]] may cover or sit on the throne.<ref>Schiller, I, 132</ref> There may be a crown on the throne. There is often a book, often on the cushion and sometimes open; this represents the gospels in some examples, and in others the [[Book of Life]], always closed and distinguished by its seven seals, following the [[Book of Revelation|Book of Apocalypse]].  There is nearly always a cross (except in images of councils), often a [[crux gemmata]], and in later examples a [[patriarchal cross]] with two crossbars.  The cloth may be draped round the cross, as may the [[Crown of Thorns|crown of thorns]], which first appears as an isolated motif in this context.<ref>Schiller, II, 187, noting the exception of a single occurrence in the [[Utrecht Psalter]].</ref>  This seems to have originated as a victor's wreath around or over the cross, part of the early emphasis on \"Christ as Victor\" found in much cross imagery, but later to have been transmuted into the crown of thorns.  It has also been suggested that the wreathed cross motif also was the origin of the [[Celtic cross]].\n\nThe dove of the [[Holy Spirit]] may be present.  In later versions two of the [[instruments of the Passion]], the [[Holy Lance|Spear]] and sponge on a stick, stand behind or beside the throne, or are held by angels. The nails from the cross and crown of thorns may sit on the throne, as in the Russian icon illustrated. If angels or archangels are included they are symmetrically placed on either side, either facing the throne or facing out and gesturing towards it; if there is a roundel they may be outside it.  In earlier depictions other figures may surround the throne, for example Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]] in [[Santa Prassede]], Rome (9th century). An alternative to the angels is kneeling figures of [[Adam and Eve]] in old age paying homage on either side of the throne.  These are found in several large wall-paintings and [[mosaic]]s, from the 12th century mosaics in [[Torcello Cathedral]],<ref>Hall, 94, where both are illustrated, and 141</ref> the paintings in the [[Chora Church]], and the painted church exterior at [[Vorone\u0163 Monastery]] in [[Romania]] of 1547.<ref>[http://fotopoeziemuzica.wordpress.com/2008/04/30/voronet-2-pictura/ Vorone\u0163 Monastery, feature with good image] (in Romanian)</ref>\n\n==Meaning of the image==\n[[File:CouncilOfConstantinople381BnFMSGr510.jpg|thumb|left|Byzantine miniature of about 880 of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381]]\n\nThe image was one of many aspects of imperial [[iconography]] taken up by Early Christians after the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, when the [[depiction of Jesus]] as a human figure, especially as a large figure detached from narrative contexts, was still a matter of controversy within Christianity.  At the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 an empty throne had the imperial insignia on it, representing the emperor [[Constantine I]] when he was not present.<ref>Hall, 95</ref>  However within a few decades an empty throne with a book of the [[gospels]] on it was being placed in the chamber of church councils to represent Christ, as at the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.  It has been suggested that the [[ivory]] [[Throne of Maximian]] in [[Ravenna]], probably a gift from the Eastern Emperor [[Justinian I]], was not made as a throne for personal use by [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Maximian]], who was both [[Archbishop of Ravenna]] and the viceroy of the Byzantine territories in North Italy, but as an empty throne to symbolize either the imperial or divine power; Byzantine imagery at this period was sometimes ready to conflate the two.<ref>Beckwith, 116-118</ref>  A comparable symbol is the [[bishop's throne]] from which the [[cathedral]] takes its name, which, unless the bishop happens to be present and sitting in it, functions as a permanent reminder of his authority in his [[diocese]].\n\nIn the earlier versions the throne is most often accompanied by a cross and a scroll or book, which at this stage represents the Gospels.  In this form the whole image represents Christ, but when the dove of the Holy Spirit and the cross are seen, the throne appears to represent God the Father, and the whole image the [[Trinity]], a subject that Christian art did not represent directly for several centuries, as showing the [[God the Father in Western art|Father as a human figure]] was objectionable.  An example of a Trinitarian ''hetoimasia'' is in the Church of the [[Dormition]] in [[Nicaea]].<ref>Parani, 196</ref>  From about 1000 the image may bear the title ''hetoimasia'',<ref>Parani, 196</ref> literally \"preparation\", meaning \"that which has been prepared\" or \"that which is made ready\", and specifically refers to the \"sign of the Son of Man\" and the Last Judgement.  By this time the image usually occurs in the West only under direct Byzantine influence, as in Venice and Torcello.\n\nSome Early Christians had believed that the True Cross had miraculously ascended to Heaven, where it remained in readiness to become the glorified \"sign of the Son of man\" (see below) at the Last Judgement.  The Discovery by Helena had displaced this view as to the fate of the actual cross, but the idea of the return at the Last Judgement of the glorified cross remained, as in a [[homily]] by Pope [[Leo the Great]] (d. 461), which was incorporated in the [[Roman Breviary]].<ref>Werner, 35 and note 42</ref>\n\n==Early examples==\n[[File:Hetimasia warrior saints Louvre OA11152.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Icon]] in ivory, with archangels, cross, spear and sponge, and \"Hetoimasia\" inscribed above the throne, [[Constantinople]] around 1000]]\nAlthough it is assumed that other examples existed earlier, the earliest surviving Christian ''hetoimasia'' is in the earliest major scheme of church decoration to survive, the mosaics in [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome]] (432-40), where it occupies the narrow centre of the \"triumphal arch\" separating nave and [[apse]], flanked by angels,<ref>Beckwith, 111, and 37 on date</ref> a typical placement.  It is shown, with a procession of Apostles, on a panel of the [[Pula|Pola]] ivory casket from [[Istria]].<ref>Soper, 154-157</ref>  Three now displaced stone reliefs of the subject with other symbols are among the earliest indications of Christian architectural sculpture at this period; they are in Berlin, [[San Marco, Venice]] and [[Nicosia, Cyprus]].<ref>Margaret Mullett, et al. \"Early Christian and Byzantine art.\" In [[Grove Art]] Online.

At [[Castelseprio (archaeological park)|Castelseprio]] it occupies the centre of the apse-side (west-facing) of the triumphal arch. All are central positions, prominent but not dominant.  The [[Baptistry of Neon]] (late 5th century) in Ravenna is exceptional in using repeated ''hetoimasia'' images in a circular dome frieze of eight images, four each of two types appearing alternately: a hetoimasia with cross in a garden and an altar containing an open book, flanked by two chairs.<ref>Morgan, 8. It is also known as the Orthodox Baptistry.

It would only fit a bishop with a slight figure, and has a large compartment for relics below the seat. It may have functioned as a \"throne-lectern\" or resting place for a [[gospel book]], making actual the hetoimasia images with open books.<ref>Buckton, 98-105</ref>\n\n==Later use==\nDuring the Middle Byzantine period the etimasia became a standard feature of the evolving subject of the [[Last Judgement]], found from the 11th century onwards.<ref>[[V&A Museum]], notes on ivory Last Judgement [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O94171/figure-the-last-judgement/]</ref>  As in the Western versions descended from the Byzantine images, this was on several tiers, with Christ in Judgement at the top, and in the East the etimasia almost always in the centre of the tier below, but occasionally above Christ.  This basic layout has remained in use in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] to the present day, and is found both on church walls and as a painted panel icon. The etimasia was normally omitted in Western versions, except in works under direct Byzantine influence, such as the early 12th century west wall of [[Torcello Cathedral]]. \n[[File:Last Judgment (Russia) 001.jpg|thumb|left|Russian 18th(?) century icon of the [[Last Judgement]], following what had become a standard composition in its main elements, including the etimasia.]]\n\nAnother context in which the etimasia sometimes appears from the Middle Byzantine period is [[Pentecost]], in Orthodoxy also the Feast of the Trinity.  Here a trinitarian etimasia with the dove representing the Holy Spirit may be found, as in the 12th century mosaics on the roof of the west dome of [[St Mark's, Venice]], where the centre is an etimasia with book and dove, with the [[twelve apostles]] seated round the outer rims, with flames on their heads and rays connecting them to the central throne.  Below the apostles pairs of figures representing the \"nations\", with ''tituli'', stand between the windows.  Similar images are found in the [[Chludov Psalter]] and elsewhere.  However, in this case the etimasia did not become part of a conventional composition, and it is not found in modern icons of the Pentecost.<ref>Demus, 55-57, and plate 13; also Parani, 196.

In [[Ancient Greece]] it represented [[Zeus]], chief of the gods, and in early [[Buddhist art]] it represented [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]].  In [[Early Christian art]] and Early [[Medieval art]] it is found in both the East and Western churches, and represents either [[Christ]], or sometimes [[God the Father]] as part of the [[Trinity]].  In the Middle Byzantine period, from about 1000, it came to represent more specifically the throne prepared for the [[Second Coming]] of Christ, a meaning it has retained in [[Eastern Orthodox]] art to the present.<ref>Schiller, II, 186.</ref>  The motif consists of an empty [[throne]] and various other symbolic objects, in later depictions surrounded when space allows by angels paying homage.

See his notes for further literature</ref>    A throne with a crown upon it had been a symbol for an absent monarch in Ancient Greek culture since at least the time of [[Alexander the Great]],<ref>Syndicus, 151</ref> whose deification allowed secular use for what had previously been a symbol for Zeus, where the attribute placed on the throne was a pair of zig-zag thunderbolts.<ref>Hall, 95, [http://www.wildwinds.com/coins/greece/cilicia/olba/SNGLev_645.jpg coin 1st century CE] from [[Cilicia]]</ref> Early [[Buddhist art]] used an empty throne, often under a [[parasol]] or [[Bodhi Tree]], from before the time of Christ.  This was, in the traditional view, an [[aniconism|aniconic]] symbol for the Buddha; they [[Aniconism in Buddhism|avoided depicting]] the Buddha in human form, [[God the Father in Western art|like early Christians with God the Father]].  Alternatively, it has been argued that these images represent actual [[cetiya|relic-thrones]] at the major pilgrimage sites which were objects of worship.<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/b/buddhist-sculpture-v-and-a/ Example from the V&A museum].  The alternative theory, first advanced by Huntington (see her final paragraph), sees these images as depictions of an actual relic-throne of the Buddha as an object of worship at major Buddhist sites, but this [[Aniconism in Buddhism|remains controversial]].</ref>  The throne often contains a symbol such as the [[dharma wheel]] or [[Buddha footprint]], as well as a cushion.\n\nLike the Greeks and other ancient peoples, the Romans held ritual banquets for the gods (a ritualized \"[[theoxenia]]\"), including the annual [[Epulum Jovis]], and the [[lectisternium]], originally a rare event in times of crisis, first held in 399 BCE according to [[Livy]], but later much more common.<ref>Ramsay, 344</ref>  A seat for these was called a ''pulvinar'', from ''pulvinus'' (\"cushion\"), and many temples held these; at the banquets statues of the deity were placed on them.  There was a pulvinar at the [[Circus Maximus]], on which initially statues and attributes of the gods were placed after a procession during games, but [[Augustus]] also occupied it himself (possibly copying [[Julius Caesar]]), building a temple-like structure in the seating to house it.<ref>Humphrey, 78-80</ref>   Thrones with a jewelled wreath, portrait or [[sceptre]] and [[diadem]] sitting on them were among the symbols used in the Roman law courts and elsewhere to represent the authority of the absent emperor; this was one of the monarchical attributes awarded by the [[Roman Senate]] to Julius Caesar.<ref>Humphrey, 79; Hall, 95; Hellemo, 107; [https://books.google.com/books?id=4II_mqxM8s0C&pg=PA62&dq=pulvinar+temple&cd=4#v=onepage&q=pulvinar%20temple&f=false Fishwick].

The empty throne continued to be used as a secular symbol of power by the first Christian Emperors, and appears on the [[Arch of Constantine]].\n\nLater non-Christian uses of the empty throne motif include the \"Bema Feast\", the most important annual feast of Persian [[Manichaeism]], when a \"bema\" or empty throne represented the [[Mani (prophet)|prophet Mani]] at a meal for worshippers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y7IHmyKcPtYC&pg=PA986&dq=Bema+feast+mani+empty+throne&lr=&as_brr=3&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Bema%20feast%20mani%20empty%20throne&f=false The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods]</ref>    In the [[Bali]]nese version of [[Hinduism]], the most prominent element in most temples is the ''padmasana'' or \"Lotus Throne\", an empty throne for the supreme deity [[Acintya]].<ref>Davison and Granquist, 8-9, [http://www.baliblog.com/travel-tips/bali-travel/padmasana-the-lotus-throne.html Baliblog, with images]</ref>\n\n==Christian art==\n[[File:Poze Lucianiene 225.jpg|thumb|Modern depiction in a [[Romanian Orthodox]] church, with crown of thorns around the cross.]]\nThere are several elements found in the image which reflect its changing meaning.  The throne itself is always present, and is often backless and armless.  In Ancient Greek, a \"thronos\" was a specific but ordinary type of chair with a footstool, and there is very often a footstool in the image.   There is often a prominent cushion, and a cloth variously interpreted as Christ's mantle (especially when of imperial purple) or a [[sudarium]] may cover or sit on the throne.<ref>Schiller, I, 132</ref> There may be a crown on the throne. There is often a book, often on the cushion and sometimes open; this represents the gospels in some examples, and in others the [[Book of Life]], always closed and distinguished by its seven seals, following the [[Book of Revelation|Book of Apocalypse]].  There is nearly always a cross (except in images of councils), often a [[crux gemmata]], and in later examples a [[patriarchal cross]] with two crossbars.  The cloth may be draped round the cross, as may the [[Crown of Thorns|crown of thorns]], which first appears as an isolated motif in this context.<ref>Schiller, II, 187, noting the exception of a single occurrence in the [[Utrecht Psalter]].</ref>  This seems to have originated as a victor's wreath around or over the cross, part of the early emphasis on \"Christ as Victor\" found in much cross imagery, but later to have been transmuted into the crown of thorns.  It has also been suggested that the wreathed cross motif also was the origin of the [[Celtic cross]].\n\nThe dove of the [[Holy Spirit]] may be present.  In later versions two of the [[instruments of the Passion]], the [[Holy Lance|Spear]] and sponge on a stick, stand behind or beside the throne, or are held by angels. The nails from the cross and crown of thorns may sit on the throne, as in the Russian icon illustrated. If angels or archangels are included they are symmetrically placed on either side, either facing the throne or facing out and gesturing towards it; if there is a roundel they may be outside it.  In earlier depictions other figures may surround the throne, for example Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Saint Paul|Paul]] in [[Santa Prassede]], Rome (9th century). An alternative to the angels is kneeling figures of [[Adam and Eve]] in old age paying homage on either side of the throne.  These are found in several large wall-paintings and [[mosaic]]s, from the 12th century mosaics in [[Torcello Cathedral]],<ref>Hall, 94, where both are illustrated, and 141</ref> the paintings in the [[Chora Church]], and the painted church exterior at [[Vorone\u0163 Monastery]] in [[Romania]] of 1547.<ref>[http://fotopoeziemuzica.wordpress.com/2008/04/30/voronet-2-pictura/ Vorone\u0163 Monastery, feature with good image] (in Romanian)</ref>\n\n==Meaning of the image==\n[[File:CouncilOfConstantinople381BnFMSGr510.jpg|thumb|left|Byzantine miniature of about 880 of the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381]]\n\nThe image was one of many aspects of imperial [[iconography]] taken up by Early Christians after the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, when the [[depiction of Jesus]] as a human figure, especially as a large figure detached from narrative contexts, was still a matter of controversy within Christianity.  At the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 an empty throne had the imperial insignia on it, representing the emperor [[Constantine I]] when he was not present.<ref>Hall, 95</ref>  However within a few decades an empty throne with a book of the [[gospels]] on it was being placed in the chamber of church councils to represent Christ, as at the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in 431.  It has been suggested that the [[ivory]] [[Throne of Maximian]] in [[Ravenna]], probably a gift from the Eastern Emperor [[Justinian I]], was not made as a throne for personal use by [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Maximian]], who was both [[Archbishop of Ravenna]] and the viceroy of the Byzantine territories in North Italy, but as an empty throne to symbolize either the imperial or divine power; Byzantine imagery at this period was sometimes ready to conflate the two.<ref>Beckwith, 116-118</ref>  A comparable symbol is the [[bishop's throne]] from which the [[cathedral]] takes its name, which, unless the bishop happens to be present and sitting in it, functions as a permanent reminder of his authority in his [[diocese]].\n\nIn the earlier versions the throne is most often accompanied by a cross and a scroll or book, which at this stage represents the Gospels.  In this form the whole image represents Christ, but when the dove of the Holy Spirit and the cross are seen, the throne appears to represent God the Father, and the whole image the [[Trinity]], a subject that Christian art did not represent directly for several centuries, as showing the [[God the Father in Western art|Father as a human figure]] was objectionable.  An example of a Trinitarian ''hetoimasia'' is in the Church of the [[Dormition]] in [[Nicaea]].<ref>Parani, 196</ref>  From about 1000 the image may bear the title ''hetoimasia'',<ref>Parani, 196</ref> literally \"preparation\", meaning \"that which has been prepared\" or \"that which is made ready\", and specifically refers to the \"sign of the Son of Man\" and the Last Judgement.  By this time the image usually occurs in the West only under direct Byzantine influence, as in Venice and Torcello.\n\nSome Early Christians had believed that the True Cross had miraculously ascended to Heaven, where it remained in readiness to become the glorified \"sign of the Son of man\" (see below) at the Last Judgement.  The Discovery by Helena had displaced this view as to the fate of the actual cross, but the idea of the return at the Last Judgement of the glorified cross remained, as in a [[homily]] by Pope [[Leo the Great]] (d. 461), which was incorporated in the [[Roman Breviary]].<ref>Werner, 35 and note 42</ref>\n\n==Early examples==\n[[File:Hetimasia warrior saints Louvre OA11152.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Icon]] in ivory, with archangels, cross, spear and sponge, and \"Hetoimasia\" inscribed above the throne, [[Constantinople]] around 1000]]\nAlthough it is assumed that other examples existed earlier, the earliest surviving Christian ''hetoimasia'' is in the earliest major scheme of church decoration to survive, the mosaics in [[Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome]] (432-40), where it occupies the narrow centre of the \"triumphal arch\" separating nave and [[apse]], flanked by angels,<ref>Beckwith, 111, and 37 on date</ref> a typical placement.

At [[Castelseprio (archaeological park)|Castelseprio]] it occupies the centre of the apse-side (west-facing) of the triumphal arch. All are central positions, prominent but not dominant.  The [[Baptistry of Neon]] (late 5th century) in Ravenna is exceptional in using repeated ''hetoimasia'' images in a circular dome frieze of eight images, four each of two types appearing alternately: a hetoimasia with cross in a garden and an altar containing an open book, flanked by two chairs.<ref>Morgan, 8. It is also known as the Orthodox Baptistry.

It would only fit a bishop with a slight figure, and has a large compartment for relics below the seat. It may have functioned as a \"throne-lectern\" or resting place for a [[gospel book]], making actual the hetoimasia images with open books.<ref>Buckton, 98-105</ref>\n\n==Later use==\nDuring the Middle Byzantine period the etimasia became a standard feature of the evolving subject of the [[Last Judgement]], found from the 11th century onwards.<ref>[[V&A Museum]], notes on ivory Last Judgement [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O94171/figure-the-last-judgement/]</ref>  As in the Western versions descended from the Byzantine images, this was on several tiers, with Christ in Judgement at the top, and in the East the etimasia almost always in the centre of the tier below, but occasionally above Christ.  This basic layout has remained in use in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] to the present day, and is found both on church walls and as a painted panel icon. The etimasia was normally omitted in Western versions, except in works under direct Byzantine influence, such as the early 12th century west wall of [[Torcello Cathedral]]. \n[[File:Last Judgment (Russia) 001.jpg|thumb|left|Russian 18th(?) century icon of the [[Last Judgement]], following what had become a standard composition in its main elements, including the etimasia.]]\n\nAnother context in which the etimasia sometimes appears from the Middle Byzantine period is [[Pentecost]], in Orthodoxy also the Feast of the Trinity.  Here a trinitarian etimasia with the dove representing the Holy Spirit may be found, as in the 12th century mosaics on the roof of the west dome of [[St Mark's, Venice]], where the centre is an etimasia with book and dove, with the [[twelve apostles]] seated round the outer rims, with flames on their heads and rays connecting them to the central throne.  Below the apostles pairs of figures representing the \"nations\", with ''tituli'', stand between the windows.  Similar images are found in the [[Chludov Psalter]] and elsewhere.  However, in this case the etimasia did not become part of a conventional composition, and it is not found in modern icons of the Pentecost.<ref>Demus, 55-57, and plate 13; also Parani, 196.

Entry pp. 75-86, by Hand.</ref>\n\n==Scriptural references==\nThe image has been regarded as illustrating a number of different passages from the Bible. For the later Byzantines the ''etimasia'' was the \"sign of the [[Son of man]]\" of Matthew 24:30:\n\"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory\".<ref>See Hellemo, 102-104 for arguments that the earliest examples also carried this meaning (he disagrees)</ref>  The understanding of the image as a symbol for the Second Coming also drew on [[Psalms]] 9:7: \"But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment\".<ref>Schiller, II 98 & 187</ref> where the [[Septuagint]] has \"\u1f21\u03c4\u03bf\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd\" (\"hetoimasen\") for \"prepared\".<ref>Psalms 9:7: \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f41 \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b1\u1f30\u1ff6\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f21\u03c4\u03bf\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 [http://mlbible.com/psalms/9-7.htm Biblos website]</ref> Psalm 89:14:\"Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face\" is another relevant passage, using the word in the Septuagint (instead of the \"habitation\" of the [[King James Version]]), giving \"\u1f11\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\" or \"preparation of your throne\".<ref>Temple, 8-9, [http://mlbible.com/psalms/89-14.htm Biblos website]</ref>  Throne imagery is found above all in the [[Book of Revelation]], especially chapter 4, although the throne therein is already occupied.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe Greek verb \u1f11\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd (\"hetoimasen\") means \"to prepare\" or \"to make ready\". It will be seen  that the name \"hetoimasia\", meaning \"preparation\" or \"that which has been prepared\", with \"throne\" (\"thronos\" in Greek) only implied,<ref>Contrary to many sources who should know better, and say hetoimasia \"means\" empty throne etc.</ref> is more appropriate to the Eastern images after about 1000 than to those before.  The use of the name for both groups was established in the 19th century by the French art historian Paul Durand (from 1867), and despite protests has stuck.<ref>Hellemo, 104-105</ref>  In more modern Orthodox contexts \"etimasia\" and \"prepared throne\" are typically used, and in art history relating to the earlier group \"hetoimasia\" and \"empty throne\" - exclusively the latter in non-Christian contexts where a more specialized term is not used.  There are various other transliterations and translations: \"hetimasia\", \"throne made ready\" etc.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Hetoimasia|lcfirst=yes}}\n* Beckwith, John, ''Early Christian and Byzantine Art'', Penguin History of Art (now Yale), 2nd edn. 1979, {{ISBN|0-14-056033-5}}\n* Buckton, David, et al., [http://www.metmuseum.org/research/metpublications/The_Treasury_of_San_Marco_Venice ''The Treasury of San Marco Venice''], 1984, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (fully available online or as PDF from the MMA)\n* [[Otto Demus|Demus, Otto]].
