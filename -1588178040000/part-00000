After two plays, quarterback [[Jake Fromm]] attempted a pass downfield and was intercepted by Tony Brown. Alabama began their first drive of the game, and, after eleven plays, that drive ended with kicker Andy Pappanastos missing a 40-yard [[field goal]]. The teams each had [[three-and-out]]s for the game's first two [[Punt (gridiron football)|punts]]. During Georgia's ensuing drive, the quarter ended, with no score.<ref name=nytlive>{{cite news|last1=Hoffman|first1=Benjamin|last2=Drape|first2=Joe|last3=Tracy|first3=Marc|title=National Championship Game: Georgia vs. Alabama Live Score|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/sports/national-championship-game-alabama-georgia.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 8, 2018|accessdate=January 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter a failed third down conversion, on the second play of the second quarter, Georgia kicker [[Rodrigo Blankenship]] hit a 41-yard field goal to open the scoring and put Georgia in the lead by three. Alabama's ensuing drive went nowhere, as they gained four yards on three plays and punted. Georgia took the ball and drove down the field, and found themselves with a first and goal at the Alabama 10-yard-line; the Tide defense held, however, and the Bulldogs settled for a second field goal and took a 6\u20130 lead with just over seven and a half minutes until half. On Alabama's next drive, the Georgia defense held yet again and Alabama's [[JK Scott]] punted for the third time. Just prior to the punt, Georgia wide receiver Javon Wims was shown walking to the locker room, reportedly with a left shoulder injury. Both defenses then forced punts, and Georgia took back over with 1:19 remaining in the half on their own 31-yard-line. Nine plays later, on Alabama's 1-yard-line, [[Mecole Hardman]] took a direct snap, faked a handoff, and ran into the end zone for the game's first touchdown, putting Georgia up 13\u20130 going into [[halftime]].<ref name=nytlive/>\n\nBecause they deferred the coin toss, Alabama received the ball first in the second half. They started their drive on their own 22-yard-line. [[Tua Tagovailoa]], Alabama's backup quarterback, started the second half for the Tide; that drive quickly resulted in a three-and-out. The initial punt was blocked, but an erroneous offside call gave the Tide another chance to punt. Georgia started their drive on their own 36-yard-line, but punted on 4th & 17. Alabama took over on their own 44-yard-line.<ref name=nytlive/> The teams then traded touchdowns on consecutive drives; Alabama scored their first points of the game on a 6-yard pass from Tagovailoa to Ruggs, but Georgia immediately responded with an 80-yard touchdown connection from Fromm to Mecole Hardman, putting Georgia up 20\u20137. On the second play of Alabama's ensuing drive, Tagovailoa, while scrambling to the left, threw into traffic and was intercepted by Georgia's Deandre Baker. Up 13, the Bulldogs took over possession of the ball on Alabama's 39-yard-line. The Tide defense responded immediately, however, as [[Raekwon Davis]] intercepted a Jake Fromm pass on the first play of Georgia's drive, returning the pick to the UGA 40-yard-line. The Tide gained fifteen yards on six plays and kicker Andy Pappanastos avenged his earlier miss with a 43-yard field goal that put Bama within ten. The teams then traded punts. Just prior to Alabama's punt, it was announced that an Alabama defensive back, Kyriq McDonald, had collapsed on the sideline; the situation was described as a \"serious medical emergency\". He was loaded onto a medical stretcher awake and conscious. Georgia could not muster anything on offense that drive, and punted. The fourth quarter saw Tagovailoa lead the Tide to come back and tie the game at 20 with 3:49. With three seconds remaining in the game, Andy Pappanastos missed a potential game-winning 36-yard field goal to the left, sending the game to overtime.<ref name=nytlive/>\n\nIn overtime, Georgia had an unsuccessful drive that resulted in both a three-and-out, and a 13-yard loss sack to Fromm.  Georgia opted to attempt a 51-yard field goal, which they successfully made. On Alabama's first offensive play in overtime, Tagovailoa was sacked for a 16-yard loss, but immediately followed that with a game-winning 41-yard touchdown pass to [[DeVonta Smith]], in a play that has since been called \"2nd and 26\" by fans.<ref name=nytlive/> Tagovailoa was named the offensive player of the game, and [[Daron Payne]] was named the defensive player of the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2018/01/09/cfp-players-game-alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-and-daron-payne/1015832001/|title=CFP players of the game: Alabama's Tua Tagovailoa and Daron Payne|first=A.J.|last=Perez|work=USA Today|date=January 9, 2018|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Scoring summary===\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart|VisitorName=Alabama|HomeName=Georgia|state=}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=14:14\n| Team=Georgia\n| DrivePlays=14\n| DriveLength=55\n| DriveTime=7:40\n| Type=FG\n| yards=41\n| Kicker=[[Rodrigo Blankenship]]\n| Visitor=0\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=7:33\n| Team=Georgia\n| DrivePlays=13\n| DriveLength=70\n| DriveTime=5:19\n| Type=FG\n| yards=27\n| Kicker=Rodrigo Blankenship\n| Visitor=0\n| Home=6\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=0:07\n| Team=Georgia\n| DrivePlays=9\n| DriveLength=69\n| DriveTime=1:12\n| Type=RushTD\n| Runner=Mecole Hardman\n| yards=1\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Rodrigo Blankenship\n| Visitor=0\n| Home=13\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=3\n| Time=8:52\n| Team=Alabama\n| DrivePlays=7\n| DriveLength=56\n| DriveTime=1:59\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=[[Henry Ruggs|Henry Ruggs III]]\n| QB=[[Tua Tagovailoa]]\n| yards=6\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Andy Pappanastos\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=13\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=3\n| Time=6:52\n| Team=Georgia\n| DrivePlays=4\n| DriveLength=93\n| DriveTime=1:55\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=Mecole Hardman\n| QB=[[Jake Fromm]]\n| yards=80\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Rodrigo Blankenship\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=20\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=3\n| Time=5:20\n| Team=Alabama\n| DrivePlays=6\n| DriveLength=15\n| DriveTime=1:06\n| Type=FG\n| yards=43\n| Kicker=Andy Pappanastos\n| Visitor=10\n| Home=20\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=4\n| Time=9:24\n| Team=Alabama\n| DrivePlays=8\n| DriveLength=71\n| DriveTime=2:15\n| Type=FG\n| yards=30\n| Kicker=Andy Pappanastos\n| Visitor=13\n| Home=20\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=4\n| Time=3:49\n| Team=Alabama\n| DrivePlays=8\n| DriveLength=66\n| DriveTime=3:21\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=[[Calvin Ridley]]\n| QB=Tua Tagovailoa\n| yards=7\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Andy Pappanastos\n| Visitor=20\n| Home=20\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=OT\n| Time=\n| Team=Georgia\n| DrivePlays=4\n| DriveLength=-9\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=FG\n| yards=51\n| Kicker=Rodrigo Blankenship\n| Visitor=20\n| Home=23\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=OT\n| Time=\n| Team=Alabama\n| DrivePlays=2\n| DriveLength=25\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=Other\n| Other=DeVonta Smith 41-yard touchdown reception from Tua Tagovailoa\n| Visitor=26\n| Home=23\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEnd|Visitor=26|Home=23}}\n\n===Statistics===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''No. 4 Crimson Tide'''\n|R1=0|R2=0|R3=10|R4=10|R5=6\n|Home=No. 3 Bulldogs\n|H1=0|H2=13|H3=7|H4=0|H5=3\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

After two plays, quarterback [[Jake Fromm]] attempted a pass downfield and was intercepted by Tony Brown. Alabama began their first drive of the game, and, after eleven plays, that drive ended with kicker Andy Pappanastos missing a 40-yard [[field goal]]. The teams each had [[three-and-out]]s for the game's first two [[Punt (gridiron football)|punts]]. During Georgia's ensuing drive, the quarter ended, with no score.<ref name=nytlive>{{cite news|last1=Hoffman|first1=Benjamin|last2=Drape|first2=Joe|last3=Tracy|first3=Marc|title=National Championship Game: Georgia vs. Alabama Live Score|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/sports/national-championship-game-alabama-georgia.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 8, 2018|accessdate=January 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter a failed third down conversion, on the second play of the second quarter, Georgia kicker [[Rodrigo Blankenship]] hit a 41-yard field goal to open the scoring and put Georgia in the lead by three. Alabama's ensuing drive went nowhere, as they gained four yards on three plays and punted. Georgia took the ball and drove down the field, and found themselves with a first and goal at the Alabama 10-yard-line; the Tide defense held, however, and the Bulldogs settled for a second field goal and took a 6\u20130 lead with just over seven and a half minutes until half. On Alabama's next drive, the Georgia defense held yet again and Alabama's [[JK Scott]] punted for the third time. Just prior to the punt, Georgia wide receiver Javon Wims was shown walking to the locker room, reportedly with a left shoulder injury. Both defenses then forced punts, and Georgia took back over with 1:19 remaining in the half on their own 31-yard-line. Nine plays later, on Alabama's 1-yard-line, [[Mecole Hardman]] took a direct snap, faked a handoff, and ran into the end zone for the game's first touchdown, putting Georgia up 13\u20130 going into [[halftime]].<ref name=nytlive/>\n\nBecause they deferred the coin toss, Alabama received the ball first in the second half. They started their drive on their own 22-yard-line. [[Tua Tagovailoa]], Alabama's backup quarterback, started the second half for the Tide; that drive quickly resulted in a three-and-out. The initial punt was blocked, but an erroneous offside call gave the Tide another chance to punt. Georgia started their drive on their own 36-yard-line, but punted on 4th & 17. Alabama took over on their own 44-yard-line.<ref name=nytlive/> The teams then traded touchdowns on consecutive drives; Alabama scored their first points of the game on a 6-yard pass from Tagovailoa to Ruggs, but Georgia immediately responded with an 80-yard touchdown connection from Fromm to Mecole Hardman, putting Georgia up 20\u20137. On the second play of Alabama's ensuing drive, Tagovailoa, while scrambling to the left, threw into traffic and was intercepted by Georgia's Deandre Baker. Up 13, the Bulldogs took over possession of the ball on Alabama's 39-yard-line. The Tide defense responded immediately, however, as [[Raekwon Davis]] intercepted a Jake Fromm pass on the first play of Georgia's drive, returning the pick to the UGA 40-yard-line. The Tide gained fifteen yards on six plays and kicker Andy Pappanastos avenged his earlier miss with a 43-yard field goal that put Bama within ten. The teams then traded punts. Just prior to Alabama's punt, it was announced that an Alabama defensive back, Kyriq McDonald, had collapsed on the sideline; the situation was described as a \"serious medical emergency\". He was loaded onto a medical stretcher awake and conscious. Georgia could not muster anything on offense that drive, and punted. The fourth quarter saw Tagovailoa lead the Tide to come back and tie the game at 20 with 3:49.

Volleys of stones and other missiles followed. The police then charged at them in two divisions and there were some cuts and bruises on both sides, but the demolition work then went on uninterrupted. Among the incidents of eviction mentioned by historian [[Alexander Mackenzie (historian)|Alexander Mackenzie]] was that of an old woman who attacked an officer with her stick, knocking off his hat, but then she was carried out by two police officers.

Variations exist regionally, as cultures shape the dishes to their own preferences. In countries near or in the Caribbean, these dishes are simply known as ''rice and beans'', in which the dish is cooked in coconut milk. Variations of gallo pinto are the following:\n\n* [[Brazil|Brasil]]: ''feijoada''\n* [[Chile]]: ''arroz con porotos.''\n* [[Colombia]]: ''[[calentao]]''\n** [[Archipelago of San Andr\u00e9s, Providencia and Santa Catalina]]:  ''rice and beans'' \n* [[Costa Rica]]:  ''gallo pinto''; there are three main variations: \n** [[Costa Rican Central Valley|Valle Central]]: gallo pinto is more moist, less greasy and is seasoned with chili, cilantro and onions. One variant includes Lizano sauce, an English sauce that was created and patented for the first time in Costa Rica by [[Salsa Lizano|Prospero Lizano]] in 1920 with native ingredients and is a version of the Worcestershire sauce.\n** [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]]: with a more fatty and roasted gallo pinto; made with red beans\n** Caribbean Coast ([[Lim\u00f3n|Puerto Lim\u00f3n]] and [[Puerto Viejo de Talamanca|Puerto Viejo]]): ''rice and beans'' in which rice and beans are cooked with coconut milk and [[Habanero|habanero chili]] (locally known as Panamanian chile) is added.\n* [[Cuba]]: There are two main variations:\n** [[Moros y cristianos]]: also known as ''moros'', it is made with black beans. If made with red beans, it would be considered ''congris''.\n** Congris: made with red beans, its preparation is different from that of gallo pinto, since the beans are cooked first with onion, green chili, garlic, tomato, bay leaf, touch of cumin and oregano, salt, and dry wine; before they soften completely, the raw rice is added, letting them cook together, until they consume the broth and the rice is dry and loose. The beans are also prepared in their broth with the rice separate.\n* [[Dominican Republic]]:  ''moro;''  made with pigeon beans, similar to Panama and Puerto Rico dishes\n* [[El Salvador]]:  ''casamiento'';  despite not having a Caribbean coast, this dish is very typical in El Salvador.;\n* [[Guatemala]]:  ''casado''; regionally known as ''gallo pinto'' and ''rice and beans''\n** On the Caribbean coast and parts of eastern or eastern Guatemala ([[Izabal Department|Izabal]]): it is known as ''rice and beans'' and it includes coconut milk.\n* [[Honduras]]:  ''casamiento''\n** Caribbean coast: ''rice and beans''\n* [[Jamaica]]:  ''rice and peas''.\n* [[Mexico]]:  ''pispiote, rice and beans''\n* [[Nicaragua]]:  ''gallo pinto''; made mainly with red beans. In addition, vegetable oil is used for cooking (includes onions). It should be added that in the Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast, as in other countries, it is called \"rice and beans\" (rice and beans) and is made with coconut milk. The Gallo Pinto can be eaten in Nicaragua at any time and is the main companion of the different dishes sold in a ''[[fritanga]]'' (food stall).\n* [[Panama]]:  ''gallopinto''\n** Caribbean coast ([[Col\u00f3n, Panama|Col\u00f3n]], [[Bocas del Toro Province|Bocas del Toro]]): known as ''rice and beans,'' and prepared with coconut milk, like in the Dominican Republic.\n* [[Peru]]: There are two main variations:\n** ''calentado'' \n** ''[[:es:Tacu-tacu|tacu-tacu]]''\n* [[Puerto Rico]]:  ''[[arroz junto]]'' and ''[[arroz con gandules]]''; made with red beans or pigeon beans, and prepared with meat all in same pot.\n* [[Trinidad & Tobago]]:  ''rice and peas''.\n* [[Venezuela]]: These dishes may include fried plantains called \"tajadas\" as it is commonly found in many Venezuelan dishes:\n** ''[[Pabell\u00f3n Criollo]]'': Made with rice, beans or refried black beans and well seasoned shredded beef. It is then surrounded by slices of ripe fried plantain. The plantain give the name \"Pabellon con barandas\".\n** ''[[Arroz con Caraotas]]'': When Pabell\u00f3n Criollo omits the fried plantains, it has a different name. It is colloquially known as \"poor man's lunch\" since it is more common in low-income families. However, it can be made and enjoyed by whomever. Fried eggs can also be included. \n** ''[[Palo A Pique Llanero]]'': Made with rice, brown beans and well seasoned shredded beef, chicken and pork. It is surrounded by slices of ripe plantain and pieces of potatoes. Some areas like [[Barinas (state)|Barinas]], [[Apure]] or [[Bol\u00edvar (state)|Bolivar]] add green plantains.\n\n==See also==\n{{Cookbook|Gallo pinto}}\n*[[Hoppin' John]] - the equivalent dish in the [[Southern United States]]\n*[[Pabell\u00f3n criollo]] - a dish with these ingredients in [[Venezuela]]\n*[[Platillo Moros y Cristianos]] - the [[Cuba]]n equivalent\n* [[List of legume dishes]]\n* {{portal-inline|Food}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rice dishes}}\n{{Legume dishes}}\n\n[[Category:Legume dishes]]\n[[Category:Rice dishes]]\n[[Category:Costa Rican cuisine]]\n[[Category:Nicaraguan cuisine]]\n[[Category:Panamanian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Salvadoran cuisine]]\n[[Category:National dishes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox food\n| name             = Gallo Pinto\n| image            = File:CRI 07 2018 0120.jpg\n| caption          = Gallo pinto, served at breakfast with fried eggs, [[Cooking banana|plantain]], bacon, avocado, a corn tortilla and [[sour cream]]\n| country          = Nicaragua<ref>https://theculturetrip.com/central-america/costa-rica/articles/costa-rica-vs-nicaragua-who-really-invented-gallo-pinto/</ref>{{Unreliable source|sure=y|reason=Source is a blog.

They ate primarily beans and European or African rice, along with maize, yams, cassava and sponge cake.<ref>Ross, 2001, p. 62</ref><ref name=\":0\">Ross, 2001, p. 63</ref>\n\nAs Africans were forced to settle in the continent, various forms of rice and beans began to take form. Because the Americas had many types of beans cultivated by Indigenous people, they gave rise to a range of dishes when combined with rice.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Variations==\nIn the Americas, there are many dishes with a base of beans and rice, which vary in their cooking and additional ingredients. Variations exist regionally, as cultures shape the dishes to their own preferences. In countries near or in the Caribbean, these dishes are simply known as ''rice and beans'', in which the dish is cooked in coconut milk. Variations of gallo pinto are the following:\n\n* [[Brazil|Brasil]]: ''feijoada''\n* [[Chile]]: ''arroz con porotos.''\n* [[Colombia]]: ''[[calentao]]''\n** [[Archipelago of San Andr\u00e9s, Providencia and Santa Catalina]]:  ''rice and beans'' \n* [[Costa Rica]]:  ''gallo pinto''; there are three main variations: \n** [[Costa Rican Central Valley|Valle Central]]: gallo pinto is more moist, less greasy and is seasoned with chili, cilantro and onions. One variant includes Lizano sauce, an English sauce that was created and patented for the first time in Costa Rica by [[Salsa Lizano|Prospero Lizano]] in 1920 with native ingredients and is a version of the Worcestershire sauce.\n** [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]]: with a more fatty and roasted gallo pinto; made with red beans\n** Caribbean Coast ([[Lim\u00f3n|Puerto Lim\u00f3n]] and [[Puerto Viejo de Talamanca|Puerto Viejo]]): ''rice and beans'' in which rice and beans are cooked with coconut milk and [[Habanero|habanero chili]] (locally known as Panamanian chile) is added.\n* [[Cuba]]: There are two main variations:\n** [[Moros y cristianos]]: also known as ''moros'', it is made with black beans. If made with red beans, it would be considered ''congris''.\n** Congris: made with red beans, its preparation is different from that of gallo pinto, since the beans are cooked first with onion, green chili, garlic, tomato, bay leaf, touch of cumin and oregano, salt, and dry wine; before they soften completely, the raw rice is added, letting them cook together, until they consume the broth and the rice is dry and loose. The beans are also prepared in their broth with the rice separate.\n* [[Dominican Republic]]:  ''moro;''  made with pigeon beans, similar to Panama and Puerto Rico dishes\n* [[El Salvador]]:  ''casamiento'';  despite not having a Caribbean coast, this dish is very typical in El Salvador.;\n* [[Guatemala]]:  ''casado''; regionally known as ''gallo pinto'' and ''rice and beans''\n** On the Caribbean coast and parts of eastern or eastern Guatemala ([[Izabal Department|Izabal]]): it is known as ''rice and beans'' and it includes coconut milk.\n* [[Honduras]]:  ''casamiento''\n** Caribbean coast: ''rice and beans''\n* [[Jamaica]]:  ''rice and peas''.\n* [[Mexico]]:  ''pispiote, rice and beans''\n* [[Nicaragua]]:  ''gallo pinto''; made mainly with red beans. In addition, vegetable oil is used for cooking (includes onions). It should be added that in the Nicaraguan Caribbean Coast, as in other countries, it is called \"rice and beans\" (rice and beans) and is made with coconut milk. The Gallo Pinto can be eaten in Nicaragua at any time and is the main companion of the different dishes sold in a ''[[fritanga]]'' (food stall).\n* [[Panama]]:  ''gallopinto''\n** Caribbean coast ([[Col\u00f3n, Panama|Col\u00f3n]], [[Bocas del Toro Province|Bocas del Toro]]): known as ''rice and beans,'' and prepared with coconut milk, like in the Dominican Republic.\n* [[Peru]]: There are two main variations:\n** ''calentado'' \n** ''[[:es:Tacu-tacu|tacu-tacu]]''\n* [[Puerto Rico]]:  ''[[arroz junto]]'' and ''[[arroz con gandules]]''; made with red beans or pigeon beans, and prepared with meat all in same pot.\n* [[Trinidad & Tobago]]:  ''rice and peas''.\n* [[Venezuela]]: These dishes may include fried plantains called \"tajadas\" as it is commonly found in many Venezuelan dishes:\n** ''[[Pabell\u00f3n Criollo]]'': Made with rice, beans or refried black beans and well seasoned shredded beef. It is then surrounded by slices of ripe fried plantain. The plantain give the name \"Pabellon con barandas\".\n** ''[[Arroz con Caraotas]]'': When Pabell\u00f3n Criollo omits the fried plantains, it has a different name. It is colloquially known as \"poor man's lunch\" since it is more common in low-income families. However, it can be made and enjoyed by whomever. Fried eggs can also be included. \n** ''[[Palo A Pique Llanero]]'': Made with rice, brown beans and well seasoned shredded beef, chicken and pork. It is surrounded by slices of ripe plantain and pieces of potatoes. Some areas like [[Barinas (state)|Barinas]], [[Apure]] or [[Bol\u00edvar (state)|Bolivar]] add green plantains.\n\n==See also==\n{{Cookbook|Gallo pinto}}\n*[[Hoppin' John]] - the equivalent dish in the [[Southern United States]]\n*[[Pabell\u00f3n criollo]] - a dish with these ingredients in [[Venezuela]]\n*[[Platillo Moros y Cristianos]] - the [[Cuba]]n equivalent\n* [[List of legume dishes]]\n* {{portal-inline|Food}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rice dishes}}\n{{Legume dishes}}\n\n[[Category:Legume dishes]]\n[[Category:Rice dishes]]\n[[Category:Costa Rican cuisine]]\n[[Category:Nicaraguan cuisine]]\n[[Category:Panamanian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Salvadoran cuisine]]\n[[Category:National dishes]]\n", "name_user": "Roy McCoy", "label": "safe", "comment": "; > , etc.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallo_pinto"}

On 12 May an Allied liaison team arrived in Flensburg and took quarters aboard the passenger ship ''Patria''. The liaison officers and the Supreme Allied Headquarters soon realized that they had no need to act through the Flensburg government and that its members should be arrested. On 23 May, acting on SHAEF's orders and with the approval of the Soviets, American Major General Rooks summoned D\u00f6nitz aboard the ''Patria'' and communicated to him that he and all the members of his Government were under arrest, and that their government was dissolved. The Allies had a problem, because they realized that although the German armed forces had surrendered unconditionally, SHAEF had failed to use the document created by the \"[[European Advisory Commission]]\" (EAC) and so there had been no formal surrender by the civilian German government. This was considered a very important issue, because just as the civilian, but not military, surrender in 1918 had been used by Hitler to create the \"[[Dolchstosslegende|stab in the back]]\" argument, the Allies did not want to give any future hostile German regime a legal argument to resurrect an old quarrel.\n\n'''[[Morgenthau Plan|Order JCS 1067]]''' was signed into effect by President [[Harry S.

This was exactly the same negotiating position that von Friedeburg had initially made to Montgomery, and like Montgomery the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], threatened to break off all negotiations unless the Germans agreed to a complete unconditional surrender to all the Allies on all fronts.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=130}} Eisenhower explicitly told Jodl that he would order western lines closed to German soldiers, thus forcing them to surrender to the Soviets.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=130}} Jodl sent a signal to D\u00f6nitz, who was in [[Flensburg]], informing him of Eisenhower's declaration.

The Soviet Union celebrates [[Victory Day (Eastern Europe)|Victory Day]] on 9 May, as the end of operations occurred after midnight [[Moscow time]].\n\n'''German units cease fire''': Although the military commanders of most German forces obeyed the order to surrender issued by the ''[[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]]'' (OKW)\u2014the German Armed Forces High Command, not all commanders did so. The largest contingent was [[Army Group Centre]] under the command of ''Generalfeldmarschall'' [[Ferdinand Sch\u00f6rner]] who had been promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the Army on 30 April in Hitler's last will and testament. On 8 May, Sch\u00f6rner deserted his command and flew to Austria; the Soviet Army sent overwhelming force against Army Group Centre in the Prague Offensive, forcing German units in Army Group Centre to capitulate by 11 May. The other forces which did not surrender on 8 May surrendered piecemeal:\n* The [[2nd Army (Wehrmacht)|Second Army]], under the command of General [[Dietrich von Saucken|von Saucken]], on the [[Heiligenbeil Pocket|Heiligenbeil]] and [[Danzig]] beachheads, on the [[Hel Peninsula]] in the [[Vistula]] delta surrendered on 9 May, as did the forces on the Greek islands; and the garrisons of most of the last [[Atlantic pockets]] in France, in [[Siege of Dunkirk (1944-45)|Dunkirk]] and [[La Rochelle]] (after the [[Allied siege of La Rochelle|Allied siege]]).\n* The Atlantic Pocket of [[Lorient]] surrenders on 10th May\n* The Atlantic Pocket of [[Saint-Nazaire]] surrenders on 11th May\n* [[Battle of Slivice]], the last battle in Czechoslovakia, on 12 May\n* On 13 May, the Red Army halted all offensives in Europe. Isolated pockets of resistance in Czechoslovakia were mopped up by this date.[[File:Ve Day Celebrations in London, England, UK, 8 May 1945 D24587.jpg|thumb|People gathered in [[Whitehall]] to hear [[Winston Churchill]]'s victory speech, 8 May 1945]]\n* The garrison on [[Alderney]], one of the Channel Islands [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied by the Germans]], surrendered on 16 May, one week after the garrisons on [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]] had surrendered on 9 May and those on [[Sark]] on 10 May.\n* A military engagement took place in Yugoslavia (today's Slovenia), on 14 and 15 May, known as the [[Battle of Poljana]].\n* The [[Georgian Uprising of Texel]] (5 April \u2013 20 May) was fought between [[Georgian Legion (1941\u201345)|Georgian]] Nazi-collaborationist army units on Texel against the German occupiers of that Dutch island.\n* Last battle in Europe, [[Battle of Od\u017eak]] between [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslav Army]] and [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Armed Forces]], concludes on 25th of May.

On 12 May an Allied liaison team arrived in Flensburg and took quarters aboard the passenger ship ''Patria''. The liaison officers and the Supreme Allied Headquarters soon realized that they had no need to act through the Flensburg government and that its members should be arrested. On 23 May, acting on SHAEF's orders and with the approval of the Soviets, American Major General Rooks summoned D\u00f6nitz aboard the ''Patria'' and communicated to him that he and all the members of his Government were under arrest, and that their government was dissolved. The Allies had a problem, because they realized that although the German armed forces had surrendered unconditionally, SHAEF had failed to use the document created by the \"[[European Advisory Commission]]\" (EAC) and so there had been no formal surrender by the civilian German government. This was considered a very important issue, because just as the civilian, but not military, surrender in 1918 had been used by Hitler to create the \"[[Dolchstosslegende|stab in the back]]\" argument, the Allies did not want to give any future hostile German regime a legal argument to resurrect an old quarrel.\n\n'''[[Morgenthau Plan|Order JCS 1067]]''' was signed into effect by President [[Harry S. Truman]] on 10 May 1945. This was part of the post-war economic plan that advocated how the Allied occupation would include measures to prevent Germany from waging further war by eliminating its armament industry, and the removal or destruction of other key industries required for military strength.

Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.\n\nSuch confusion has been documented in [[Self-driving car#Classification|SAE J3016]] which states that \"Some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (Level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS [automated driving system] at or above Level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS).\"\n\n===Terminology and safety considerations===\n\nModern vehicles provide partly automated features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls or emergency braking. Nonetheless, differences remain between a fully autonomous self-driving car on one hand and [[Advanced driver-assistance systems|driver assistance technologies]] on the other hand. According to the [[BBC]], confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44159581|title=Who is to blame for 'self-driving car' deaths?|first=Theo|last=Leggett|date=22 May 2018|via=BBC|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Association of British Insurers]] considers the usage of the word ''autonomous'' in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think 'autonomous' and 'autopilot' means a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology alone still is not able to drive the car.\n\nWhen some car makers suggest or claim vehicles are ''self-driving'', when they are only partly automated, drivers risk becoming excessively confident, leading to crashes, while fully self-driving cars are still a long way off in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44439523|title=Insurers warning on 'autonomous' cars|first=Rory|last=Cellan-Jones|date=12 June 2018|via=BBC|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n=== Autonomous vs. automated ===\n''Autonomous'' means self-governing.<ref name=\"antsaklis1991introduction\">{{cite journal|last1=Antsaklis|first1=Panos J.|last2=Passino|first2=Kevin M.|last3=Wang|first3=S.J.|year=1991|title=An Introduction to Autonomous Control Systems|url=http://neuron-ai.tuke.sk/hudecm/PDF_PAPERS/Intro-Aut-Control.pdf|journal=IEEE Control Systems Magazine|volume=11|issue=4|pages=5\u201313|doi=10.1109/37.88585|citeseerx=10.1.1.840.976|access-date=21 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516202116/http://neuron-ai.tuke.sk/hudecm/PDF_PAPERS/Intro-Aut-Control.pdf|archive-date=16 May 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been ''automated'' (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.<ref name=\"antsaklis1991introduction\" />\n\nOne approach is to implement [[communication networks]] both in the immediate vicinity (for [[Collision avoidance system|collision avoidance]]) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle's autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.\n\nWood et al. (2012) wrote, \"This Article generally uses the term 'autonomous,' instead of the term 'automated.' \" The term \"autonomous\" was chosen \"because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. 'Automated' connotes control or operation by a machine, while 'autonomous' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver's seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term 'automated' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts.\"<ref name=\"Woodetal\">{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=S.

Examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed ([[Cruise control|Cruise Control]]) or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed ([[Adaptive Cruise Control]] or ACC); and [[Automatic Parking|Parking Assistance]], where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. [[Lane departure warning system|Lane Keeping Assistance]] (LKA) Type II is a further example of Level 1 self-driving. A [[Automatic Emergency Braking|collision mitigation system]] which alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a Level 1 feature, according to Autopilot Review magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autopilotreview.com/self-driving-cars-sae-levels/|title=SAE Self-Driving Levels 0 to 5 for Automation - What They Mean|date=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n* Level 2 (\"hands off\"): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle: accelerating, braking, and [[lane centering|steering]]. The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand \"hands off\" is not meant to be taken literally \u2013 contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene. The eyes of the driver might be monitored by cameras to confirm that the driver is keeping his/her attention to traffic.\n* Level 3 (\"eyes off\"): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. You can think of the automated system as a co-driver that will alert you in an orderly fashion when it is your turn to drive. An example would be a Traffic Jam Chauffeur.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.groupe-psa.com/en/newsroom/automotive-innovation/traffic-jam-chauffeur/|title=Traffic Jam Chauffeur: Autonomous driving in traffic jams|date=28 August 2016}}</ref>\n* Level 4 (\"mind off\"): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver's seat. Self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas ([[Geo-fence|geofenced]]) or under special circumstances. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. park the car, if the driver does not retake control. An example would be a robotic taxi or a robotic delivery service that only covers selected locations in a specific area.\n* Level 5 (\"steering wheel optional\"): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic taxi that works an all roads all over the world, all year around, in all weather conditions.\n\nIn the formal SAE definition below, note in particular the shift from SAE 2 to SAE 3: the human driver no longer has to monitor the environment. This is the final aspect of the \"dynamic driving task\" that is now passed over from the human to the automated system. At SAE 3, the human driver still has responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is always relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+SAE (J3016) Automation Levels<ref name=\"SAE_definitions\" />\n|-\n!

Due to these characteristics, autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes. The characteristics will be explained based on the following subjects: homogenization and decoupling, connectivity, reprogrammable and smart, digital traces and modularity.\n\n=== Homogenization and decoupling ===\nHomogenization comes from the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format. This concept of homogenization also applies to autonomous vehicles. In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Due to homogenization, the digital information from these different techniques is stored in a homogeneous way. This implies that all digital information comes in the same form, which means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored and computed in a way that the vehicles and its operating system can better understand and act upon it. Homogenization also helps to exponentially increase the computing power of hard- and software (Moore's law) which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the marginal costs.;\n\n=== Connectivity ===\nConnectivity means that users of a certain digital technology can connect easily with other users, other applications or even other enterprises. In the case of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for them to connect with other 'devices' in order to function most effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion. In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connect and manage each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection. This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs.<ref>{{Citation|last=Reuters|first=Thomson|title=No lights, no signs, no accidents - future intersections for...|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2012/03/22/no-lights-no-signs-no-accidents-future-i?videoId=232193655&videoChannel=6|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref> These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services (such as intersection computer systems) in the autonomous vehicles market. This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network. Eventually, this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through the usage of other autonomous vehicles. Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities.;\n\n=== Reprogrammable===\nAnother characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine. This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, because through machine learning, smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software. This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can continuously be improved.\n\n=== Digital traces ===\nAutonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and/or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles' driving ability or safety.\n\n=== Modularity ===\nTraditional vehicles and their accompanying technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike autonomous vehicles, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced. As said, autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished. This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.\n\n* (1) The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers.;\n* (2) On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform.;\n* (3) The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and\n* (4) The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos. The autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content's origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).\n\nThe consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles (and other digital technologies) is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product. Traditionally, automotive vehicles were developed, manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers. Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles.\n\n== Human factor challenges ==\n\nSelf-driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals, and models of behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms.<ref name=\":7\" /> Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles, where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals. [[Drive.ai]] is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle, announcing status such as \"going now, don't cross\" vs. \"waiting for you to cross\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/what-s-big-orange-covered-leds-start-s-new-approach-ncna897151|title=What's big, orange and covered in LEDs? This start-up's new approach to self-driving cars|website=NBC News}}</ref>\n\nTwo human-factor challenges are important for safety. One is the handoff from automated driving to manual driving, which may become necessary due to unfavorable or unusual road conditions, or if the vehicle has limited capabilities. A sudden handoff could leave a human driver dangerously unprepared in the moment. In the long term, humans who have less practice at driving might have a lower skill level and thus be more dangerous in manual mode. The second challenge is known as [[risk compensation]]: as a system is perceived to be safer, instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety, people engage in riskier behavior and enjoy other benefits. Semi-automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem, for example with users of [[Tesla Autopilot]] ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous. In the near future, pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self-driving cars are capable of avoiding them.\n\nIn order for people to buy self-driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads, the technology must be trusted as safe.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 January 2015|title=Trust in Automation \u2013 Before and After the Experience of Take-over Scenarios in a Highly Automated Vehicle|journal=Procedia Manufacturing|language=en|volume=3|pages=3025\u20133032|doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.847|issn=2351-9789|last1=Gold|first1=Christian|last2=K\u00f6rber|first2=Moritz|last3=Hohenberger|first3=Christoph|last4=Lechner|first4=David|last5=Bengler|first5=Klaus|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/08/survey-data-suggests-self-driving-cars-could-be-slow-to-gain-consumer-trust/|title=Survey Data Suggests Self-Driving Cars Could Be Slow To Gain Consumer Trust|work=GM Authority|access-date=3 September 2018|language=en-us}}</ref> Self-driving elevators were invented in 1900, but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/07/31/427990392/remembering-when-driverless-elevators-drew-skepticism|title=Remembering When Driverless Elevators Drew Skepticism|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/07/29/427467598/episode-642-the-big-red-button|title=Episode 642: The Big Red Button|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\n== Testing ==\n[[File:Waymo self-driving car front view.gk.jpg|thumb|A prototype of [[Waymo]]'s self-driving car, navigating public streets in [[Mountain View, California]] in 2017]]\nThe testing of vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be carried out either physically, in a closed environment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtc.umich.edu/|title=Mcity testing center|date=8 December 2016|work=University of Michigan|access-date=13 February 2017}}</ref> or, where permitted, on public roads (typically requiring a license or permit,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/testing|title=Adopted Regulations for Testing of Autonomous Vehicles by Manufacturers|date=18 June 2016|work=DMV|access-date=13 February 2017}}</ref> or adhering to a specific set of operating principles),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/automated-vehicle-technologies-testing-code-of-practice|title=The Pathway to Driverless Cars: A Code of Practice for testing|date=19 July 2015|access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref> or in a virtual environment, i.e. using computer simulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/index|title=Automobile simulation example|date=18 June 2018|work=Cyberbotics|access-date=18 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324194968|title=Toolchain for simulation-based development and testing of Automated Driving|volume=1|issue=2|pages=93\u2013106|date=3 April 2018|work=SAE World Congress 2018|access-date=22 December 2018|doi=10.4271/2018-01-1066|chapter=Simulation-based Identification of Critical Scenarios for Cooperative and Automated Vehicles|series=SAE Technical Paper Series|last1=Hallerbach|first1=Sven|last2=Xia|first2=Yiqun|last3=Eberle|first3=Ulrich|last4=Koester|first4=Frank}}</ref>\nWhen driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and \"take over\" when needed.

Different human drivers make various ethical decisions when driving, such as avoiding harm to themselves, or putting themselves at risk to protect others. These decisions range from rare extremes such as self-sacrifice or criminal negligence, to routine decisions good enough to keep the traffic flowing but bad enough to cause accidents, road rage and stress.\n\nHuman thought and reaction time may sometimes be too slow to detect the risk of an upcoming fatal crash, think through the ethical implications of the available options, or take an action to implement an ethical choice. Whether a particular automated vehicle's capacity to correctly detect an upcoming risk, analyse the options or choose a 'good' option from among bad choices would be as good or better than a particular human's may be difficult to predict or assess. This difficulty may be in part because the level of automated vehicle system understanding of the ethical issues at play in a given road scenario, sensed for an instant from out of a continuous stream of synthetic physical predictions of the near future, and dependent on layers of pattern recognition and situational intelligence, may be opaque to human inspection because of its origins in probabilistic machine learning rather than a simple, plain English 'human values' logic of parsable rules. The depth of understanding, predictive power and ethical sophistication needed will be hard to implement, and even harder to test or assess.\n\nThe scale of this challenge may have other effects. There may be few entities able to marshal the resources and AI capacity necessary to meet it, as well as the capital necessary to take an automated vehicle system to market and sustain it operationally for the life of a vehicle, and the legal capacity to deal with the potential for liability for a significant proportion of traffic accidents. This may have the effect of narrowing the number of different system operators, and eroding the diverse global vehicle market down to a small number of system suppliers.\n\n== Potential limits or

These changes include breakthrough technological advances and when the market demands and adopts new technology quickly. In the rapid advance of both factors, the end of the era of incremental change was recognized. When the transition is made to a new technology, new entrants to the automotive industry present themselves, which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft, as well as tech giants such as [[Google]] and [[Nvidia]].  As new entrants to the industry arise, market uncertainty naturally occurs due to the changing dynamics. For example, the entrance of tech giants, as well as the alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers causes a variation in the innovation and production process of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences. As a result of the rise of mobility providers, the number of vehicles per capita has flatlined. In addition, the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to market uncertainty and causes forecasters to question whether personal ownership of vehicles is still relevant as new transportation technology and mobility providers are becoming preferred among consumers.\n\n=== Taxis ===\nWith the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the personal ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity. Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16841090/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-car-ces-2018|title=You can take a ride in a self-driving Lyft during CES|work=The Verge|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Healthcare, car repair, and car insurance ===\nWith the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real-time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions.<ref name=\":7\" /> Numbers made available by the US government state that 94% of the vehicle accidents are due to human failures. As a result, major implications for the healthcare industry become apparent. Numbers from the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on US roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident reveal that an estimated US$500 billion loss may be imminent for the US healthcare industry when autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads. It is likely the anticipated decrease in traffic accidents will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources. As collisions are less likely to occur, and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly, the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames. Meanwhile, as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to proactively replace a part that will fail soon. This \"Asset Efficiency Service\" would implicate a productivity gain for the automotive repair industry.  As fewer collisions implicate less money spent on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well. It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general. The insurance industry may have to create new insurance models in the near future to accommodate the changes.  An unexpected disadvantage of the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles would be a reduction in organs available for transplant.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Adams |first1=Ian |title=Self-Driving Cars Will Make Organ Shortages Even Worse |url=https://slate.com/technology/2016/12/self-driving-cars-will-exacerbate-organ-shortages.html |accessdate=9 November 2018 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Rescue, emergency response, and military ===\nThe technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries. The implementation of autonomous vehicles with rescue, emergency response, and military applications has already led to a decrease in deaths.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Military personnel use autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies, and even rescue people. In addition, a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows autonomous vehicles to become more and more autonomous. Another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances. An advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine and execute routes more efficiently than human drivers. The time savings can be invaluable in these situations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2017/08/29/the-us-army-is-developing-autonomous-armored-vehicles/|title=The US Army is developing autonomous armored vehicles|last=Snow|first=Shawn|date=29 August 2017|newspaper=[[Army Times]]|access-date=26 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Interior design and entertainment ===\nWith the driver decreasingly focused on operating a vehicle, the interior design and media-entertainment industry will have to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road. Vehicles need to be redesigned, and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage. In practice, it will show that travelers have more time for business and/or leisure. In both cases, this gives increasing opportunities for the media-entertainment industry to demand attention. Moreover, the advertisement business is able to provide location based ads without risking driver safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cardesignresearch.com/en/insights/2015/01/driverless-car-design-sleepwalking-into-the-future|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405203131/https://cardesignresearch.com/en/insights/2015/01/driverless-car-design-sleepwalking-into-the-future|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 April 2016|title=Driver-less car design: Sleep-walking into the future?|date=5 April 2016|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Telecommunication and energy ===\nAll cars can benefit from information and connections, but autonomous cars \"Will be fully capable of operating without C-V2X.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@ford/how-talking-and-listening-vehicles-could-make-roads-safer-cities-better-f215c68f376f|title=How 'Talking' and 'Listening' Vehicles Could Make Roads Safer, Cities Better|last=Company|first=Ford Motor|date=7 January 2019|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref> In addition, the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment. This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry.\n\nSince many autonomous vehicles are going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases. Similarly, radar, sensors, [[lidar]], and high-speed internet connectivity require higher auxiliary power from vehicles, which manifests as greater power draw from batteries.<ref name=\"EEICAV\"/> The larger battery requirement causes a necessary increase in supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry. On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand. As this implication depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry. This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem.\n\n=== Restaurant, hotels, and airlines ===\nDriver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future, and in the more distant future the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle. As indicated above, this will have implications for the entertainment- and interior design industry. For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function. Moreover, accompanied with the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases. In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms. The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry. In the case of relatively short-haul flights, waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers. With the improved convenience in future car travel, it is possible that customers might go for this option, causing a loss in customer bases for airline industry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://interestingengineering.com/volvos-fully-autonomous-360c-concept-vehicle-even-lets-you-sleep-in-it|title=Volvo's Fully Autonomous 360c Concept Vehicle Even Lets You Sleep in It|date=6 September 2018|access-date=26 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Elderly and disabled===\nThe elderly and [[persons with disabilities]] (such as persons who are [[hearing-impaired]], [[Vision impairment|vision-impaired]], [[Persons with reduced mobility|mobility-impaired]], or [[Cognitive impairment|cognitively-impaired]]) are potential beneficiaries of adoption of autonomous vehicles; however, the extent to which such populations gain greater mobility from the adoption of AV technology depends on the specific designs and regulations adopted.<ref>Ashley Jalsey III, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/driverless-cars-promise-far-greater-mobility-for-the-elderly-and-people-with-disabilities/2017/11/23/6994469c-c4a3-11e7-84bc-5e285c7f4512_story.html Driverless cars promise far greater mobility for the elderly and people with disabilities], ''Washington Post'' (23 November 2017).</ref><ref>Henry Claypool, Amitai Bin-Nun & Jeffrey Gerlach, [https://rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Self-Driving-Cars-The-Impact-on-People-with-Disabilities_FINAL.pdf Self-Driving Cars: The Impact on People with Disabilities] (January 2017), [[Ruderman Family Foundation]]/Securing America's Future Energy.</ref>\n\n===Children===\n{{see|Student transport}}\nChildren and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves, are also benefiting of the introduction of autonomous cars{{when|date=November 2019}}. Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick up and drop off systems by car in addition to [[walking]], [[cycling]] and busing, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers. The extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish. Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent, the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design.

However, there is no obvious reason why they should escape liability if any such effects were found to be modest or nonexistent, since part of the purpose of such liability is to give an incentive to the party controlling something to do whatever is necessary to avoid it causing harm. Potential users may be reluctant to trust an operator if it seeks to pass its normal liability on to others.\n\nIn any case, a well-advised person who is not controlling a car at all (Level 5) would be understandably reluctant to accept liability for something out of their control. And when there is some degree of sharing control possible (Level 3 or 4), a well-advised person would be concerned that the vehicle might try to pass back control at the last seconds before an accident, to pass responsibility and liability back too, but in circumstances where the potential driver has no better prospects of avoiding the crash than the vehicle, since they have not necessarily been paying close attention, and if it is too hard for the very smart car it might be too hard for a human. Since operators, especially those familiar with trying to ignore existing legal obligations (under a motto like 'seek forgiveness, not permission'), such as Waymo or Uber, could be normally expected to try to avoid responsibility to the maximum degree possible, there is potential for attempt to let the operators evade being held liable for accidents while they are in control.\n\nAs higher levels of automation are commercially introduced (Level 3 and 4), the insurance industry may see a greater proportion of commercial and product liability lines while personal automobile insurance shrinks.<ref name=\"KPMG\">{{cite web|title=Marketplace of change: Automobile insurance in the era of autonomous vehicles|url=https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/insights/2016/05/era-of-autonomous-vehicles-survey.html|access-date=1 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413185623/https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/insights/2016/05/era-of-autonomous-vehicles-survey.html|archive-date=13 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhen it comes to the direction of fully autonomous car liability, torts cannot be ignored. In any car accident the issue of negligence usually arises. In the situation of autonomous cars, negligence would most likely fall on the manufacturer because it would be hard to pin a breach of duty of care on the user who isn't in control of the vehicle. The only time negligence was brought up in an autonomous car lawsuit, there was a settlement between the person struck by the autonomous vehicle and the manufacturer (General Motors).<ref>{{Citation|title=Self-driving car liability|date=2020-04-13|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Self-driving_car_liability&oldid=950656907|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> Next, product liability would most likely cause liability to fall on the manufacturer.

While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to a presumed but untestable potential for reduction of crashes by \"up to\" 90%<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Preparing a nation for autonomous vehicles: Opportunities, barriers and policy recommendations.|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|volume=77}}</ref> and their potential greater accessibility to disabled, elderly, and young passengers, a range of ethical issues have not been fully addressed. Those include, but are not limited to: the moral, financial, and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law; the decisions a car is to make right before a (fatal) crash; privacy issues including potential for mass surveillance; potential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers; de-skilling and loss of independence by vehicle users; exposure to hacking and malware; and the further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity, and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries.\n\nThere are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|title=Responsibility for Crashes of Autonomous Vehicles: An Ethical Analysis|journal=Sci Eng Ethics|volume=21}}</ref> Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and criminal consequences. However, there are also voices {{who|date=February 2019}} that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. Experts {{who|date=February 2019}} suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.<ref name=\":2\" /> Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include [[software engineers]] that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Coming Collision Between Autonomous Vehicles and the Liability System|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|volume=52}}</ref>\n\nTaking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility, the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like: pedestrians, bicyclists and other drivers are endangered. A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment, the trolley problem: a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over five people, or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person, assuming there is no traffic on it.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Trolley Problem|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=94|issue=6}}</ref> When a self-driving car is in following scenario: it's driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way.

First, what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions? Second, how could those be translated into software code? Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: [[Deontological ethics|deontology]] and [[utilitarianism]].<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Road vehicle automation|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TxmfDAAAQBAJ}}|last=Meyer|first=G.|last2=Beiker|first2=S|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2014|pages=93\u2013102}}</ref> Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics]] are a typical example of deontological ethics. The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility. This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMany 'trolley' discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future, what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any, what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified, and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes. These practical difficulties, and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them, may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nWhile most trolley conundrums involve hyperbolic and unlikely fact patterns, it is inevitable mundane ethical decisions and risk calculations such as the precise millisecond a car should yield to a yellow light or how closely to drive to a bike lane will need to be programmed into the software of autonomous vehicles.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Himmelreich |first1=Johannes |title=Never Mind the Trolley: The Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles in Mundane Situations |journal=Ethical Theory and Moral Practice |date=2018 |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=669|doi=10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4 }}</ref> Algorithms dictate, for example, how closely to drive to a bike lane or the precise moment an autonomous car should yield to a yellow light.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Mundane ethical situations may even be more relevant than rare fatal circumstances because of the specificity implicated and their large scope.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Mundane situations involving drivers and pedestrians are so prevalent that, in the aggregate, produce large amounts of injuries and deaths.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Hence, even incremental permutations of moral algorithms can have a notable effect when considered in their entirety.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nPrivacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual.

The car later sacrifices itself to help the protagonist escape from the pursuing authorities.   \n* ''[[Geostorm]]'' (2017), set in 2022, features a self-driving taxi stolen by protagonists Max Lawson and Sarah Wilson to protect the President from mercenaries and a superstorm.\n* The film ''[[Logan (film)|Logan]]'' (2017), set in 2029, features fully automated trucks.\n* ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'' (2017) opens with [[LAPD]] [[Replicant]] cop K waking up in his modern ''Spinner'' (a [[Flying car|flying police car]], now featuring automatic driver and separable surveillance roof drone) on approach to a protein farm in northern California.\n* ''[[Upgrade (film)|Upgrade]]'' (2018), set in a not too distant future, highlights the hazardous side to automated cars as their driving systems can get hijacked and imperil the passengers.\n* In ''[[Child's Play (2019 film)|Child's Play]]'' (2019) [[Chucky (character)|Chucky]] hijacks a self-driving \"Kaslan Car\" for the murder of Mike's mother, making it crash into normal cars at a department store's parking lot.\n* In the film ''[[Spies in Disguise]]'' (2019), Lance Sterling's car is capable of driving autonomously.\n\n=== In literature ===\nIntelligent or self-driving cars are a common theme in [[science fiction]] literature. Examples include:\n* In [[Isaac Asimov]]'s science-fiction short story, \"[[Sally (short story)|Sally]]\" (first published May\u2013June 1953), automated cars have \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and communicate via honking horns and slamming doors, and save their human caretaker. Due to the high cost of the brain, few can afford a personal vehicle, so buses have become the norm.\n* [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s ''[[Commonwealth Saga]]'' series features intelligent or self-driving vehicles.\n* In [[Robert A Heinlein]]'s novel, ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'' (1980), Zeb Carter's driving and flying car \"Gay Deceiver\" is at first semi-automated and later, after modifications by Zeb's wife Deety, becomes sentient and capable of fully autonomous operation.\n* In [[Edizioni Piemme]]'s series ''[[Geronimo Stilton]]'', a robotic vehicle called \"Solar\" is in the 54th book.\n* [[Alastair Reynolds]]' series, ''[[Revelation Space]]'', features intelligent or self-driving vehicles.\n* In [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]]' novels ''[[Daemon (novel series)|Daemon]]'' (2006) and ''[[Freedom\u2122]]'' (2010) driverless cars and motorcycles are used for attacks in a software-based [[open-source warfare]].

Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle's autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.\n\nWood et al. (2012) wrote, \"This Article generally uses the term 'autonomous,' instead of the term 'automated.' \" The term \"autonomous\" was chosen \"because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. 'Automated' connotes control or operation by a machine, while 'autonomous' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver's seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them.

Examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed ([[Cruise control|Cruise Control]]) or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed ([[Adaptive Cruise Control]] or ACC); and [[Automatic Parking|Parking Assistance]], where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. [[Lane departure warning system|Lane Keeping Assistance]] (LKA) Type II is a further example of Level 1 self-driving. A [[Automatic Emergency Braking|collision mitigation system]] which alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a Level 1 feature, according to Autopilot Review magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autopilotreview.com/self-driving-cars-sae-levels/|title=SAE Self-Driving Levels 0 to 5 for Automation - What They Mean|date=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n* Level 2 (\"hands off\"): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle: accelerating, braking, and [[lane centering|steering]]. The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand \"hands off\" is not meant to be taken literally \u2013 contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene. The eyes of the driver might be monitored by cameras to confirm that the driver is keeping his/her attention to traffic.\n* Level 3 (\"eyes off\"): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. You can think of the automated system as a co-driver that will alert you in an orderly fashion when it is your turn to drive. An example would be a Traffic Jam Chauffeur.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.groupe-psa.com/en/newsroom/automotive-innovation/traffic-jam-chauffeur/|title=Traffic Jam Chauffeur: Autonomous driving in traffic jams|date=28 August 2016}}</ref>\n* Level 4 (\"mind off\"): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver's seat. Self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas ([[Geo-fence|geofenced]]) or under special circumstances. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. park the car, if the driver does not retake control. An example would be a robotic taxi or a robotic delivery service that only covers selected locations in a specific area.\n* Level 5 (\"steering wheel optional\"): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic taxi that works an all roads all over the world, all year around, in all weather conditions.\n\nIn the formal SAE definition below, note in particular the shift from SAE 2 to SAE 3: the human driver no longer has to monitor the environment. This is the final aspect of the \"dynamic driving task\" that is now passed over from the human to the automated system. At SAE 3, the human driver still has responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is always relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+SAE (J3016) Automation Levels<ref name=\"SAE_definitions\" />\n|-\n!

The term \"autonomous vehicle\" excludes a motor vehicle enabled with active safety systems or driver- assistance systems, including systems to provide electronic blind-spot assistance, crash avoidance, emergency braking, parking assistance, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assistance, lane-departure warning, or traffic-jam and queuing assistance, unless the system alone or in combination with other systems enables the vehicle on which the technology is installed to drive without active control or monitoring by a human operator.}}\n\nIn the same district code, it is considered that:\n\n{{quote|An autonomous vehicle may operate on a public roadway; provided, that the vehicle:\n* (1) Has a manual override feature that allows a driver to assume control of the autonomous vehicle at any time;\n* (2) Has a driver seated in the control seat of the vehicle while in operation who is prepared to take control of the autonomous vehicle at any moment; and\n* (3) Is capable of operating in compliance with the District's applicable traffic laws and motor vehicle laws and traffic control devices.}}\n\n== Semi-automated vehicles ==\nBetween manually driven vehicles (SAE Level 0) and fully autonomous vehicles (SAE Level 5), there are a variety of vehicle types that can be described to have some degree of [[Vehicular automation|automation]]. These are collectively known as semi-automated vehicles. As it could be a while before the technology and infrastructure are developed for full automation, it is likely that vehicles will have increasing levels of automation. These semi-automated vehicles could potentially harness many of the advantages of fully automated vehicles, while still keeping the driver in charge of the vehicle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hancock|first=P.

Due to these characteristics, autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes. The characteristics will be explained based on the following subjects: homogenization and decoupling, connectivity, reprogrammable and smart, digital traces and modularity.\n\n=== Homogenization and decoupling ===\nHomogenization comes from the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format. This concept of homogenization also applies to autonomous vehicles. In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Due to homogenization, the digital information from these different techniques is stored in a homogeneous way. This implies that all digital information comes in the same form, which means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored and computed in a way that the vehicles and its operating system can better understand and act upon it. Homogenization also helps to exponentially increase the computing power of hard- and software (Moore's law) which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the marginal costs.;\n\n=== Connectivity ===\nConnectivity means that users of a certain digital technology can connect easily with other users, other applications or even other enterprises. In the case of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for them to connect with other 'devices' in order to function most effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion. In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connect and manage each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection. This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs.<ref>{{Citation|last=Reuters|first=Thomson|title=No lights, no signs, no accidents - future intersections for...|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2012/03/22/no-lights-no-signs-no-accidents-future-i?videoId=232193655&videoChannel=6|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref> These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services (such as intersection computer systems) in the autonomous vehicles market. This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network. Eventually, this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through the usage of other autonomous vehicles. Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities.;\n\n=== Reprogrammable===\nAnother characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine. This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, because through machine learning, smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software. This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can continuously be improved.\n\n=== Digital traces ===\nAutonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and/or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles' driving ability or safety.\n\n=== Modularity ===\nTraditional vehicles and their accompanying technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike autonomous vehicles, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced. As said, autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished. This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.\n\n* (1) The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers.;\n* (2) On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform.;\n* (3) The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and\n* (4) The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos. The autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content's origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).\n\nThe consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles (and other digital technologies) is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product. Traditionally, automotive vehicles were developed, manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers. Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles.\n\n== Human factor challenges ==\n\nSelf-driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals, and models of behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms.<ref name=\":7\" /> Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles, where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals. [[Drive.ai]] is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle, announcing status such as \"going now, don't cross\" vs. \"waiting for you to cross\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/what-s-big-orange-covered-leds-start-s-new-approach-ncna897151|title=What's big, orange and covered in LEDs? This start-up's new approach to self-driving cars|website=NBC News}}</ref>\n\nTwo human-factor challenges are important for safety. One is the handoff from automated driving to manual driving, which may become necessary due to unfavorable or unusual road conditions, or if the vehicle has limited capabilities. A sudden handoff could leave a human driver dangerously unprepared in the moment. In the long term, humans who have less practice at driving might have a lower skill level and thus be more dangerous in manual mode. The second challenge is known as [[risk compensation]]: as a system is perceived to be safer, instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety, people engage in riskier behavior and enjoy other benefits. Semi-automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem, for example with users of [[Tesla Autopilot]] ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous. In the near future, pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self-driving cars are capable of avoiding them.\n\nIn order for people to buy self-driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads, the technology must be trusted as safe.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 January 2015|title=Trust in Automation \u2013 Before and After the Experience of Take-over Scenarios in a Highly Automated Vehicle|journal=Procedia Manufacturing|language=en|volume=3|pages=3025\u20133032|doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.847|issn=2351-9789|last1=Gold|first1=Christian|last2=K\u00f6rber|first2=Moritz|last3=Hohenberger|first3=Christoph|last4=Lechner|first4=David|last5=Bengler|first5=Klaus|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2017/08/survey-data-suggests-self-driving-cars-could-be-slow-to-gain-consumer-trust/|title=Survey Data Suggests Self-Driving Cars Could Be Slow To Gain Consumer Trust|work=GM Authority|access-date=3 September 2018|language=en-us}}</ref> Self-driving elevators were invented in 1900, but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/07/31/427990392/remembering-when-driverless-elevators-drew-skepticism|title=Remembering When Driverless Elevators Drew Skepticism|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/07/29/427467598/episode-642-the-big-red-button|title=Episode 642: The Big Red Button|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\n== Testing ==\n[[File:Waymo self-driving car front view.gk.jpg|thumb|A prototype of [[Waymo]]'s self-driving car, navigating public streets in [[Mountain View, California]] in 2017]]\nThe testing of vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be carried out either physically, in a closed environment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtc.umich.edu/|title=Mcity testing center|date=8 December 2016|work=University of Michigan|access-date=13 February 2017}}</ref> or, where permitted, on public roads (typically requiring a license or permit,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/autonomous/testing|title=Adopted Regulations for Testing of Autonomous Vehicles by Manufacturers|date=18 June 2016|work=DMV|access-date=13 February 2017}}</ref> or adhering to a specific set of operating principles),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/automated-vehicle-technologies-testing-code-of-practice|title=The Pathway to Driverless Cars: A Code of Practice for testing|date=19 July 2015|access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref> or in a virtual environment, i.e. using computer simulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cyberbotics.com/doc/automobile/index|title=Automobile simulation example|date=18 June 2018|work=Cyberbotics|access-date=18 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324194968|title=Toolchain for simulation-based development and testing of Automated Driving|volume=1|issue=2|pages=93\u2013106|date=3 April 2018|work=SAE World Congress 2018|access-date=22 December 2018|doi=10.4271/2018-01-1066|chapter=Simulation-based Identification of Critical Scenarios for Cooperative and Automated Vehicles|series=SAE Technical Paper Series|last1=Hallerbach|first1=Sven|last2=Xia|first2=Yiqun|last3=Eberle|first3=Ulrich|last4=Koester|first4=Frank}}</ref>\nWhen driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and \"take over\" when needed.

Different human drivers make various ethical decisions when driving, such as avoiding harm to themselves, or putting themselves at risk to protect others. These decisions range from rare extremes such as self-sacrifice or criminal negligence, to routine decisions good enough to keep the traffic flowing but bad enough to cause accidents, road rage and stress.\n\nHuman thought and reaction time may sometimes be too slow to detect the risk of an upcoming fatal crash, think through the ethical implications of the available options, or take an action to implement an ethical choice. Whether a particular automated vehicle's capacity to correctly detect an upcoming risk, analyse the options or choose a 'good' option from among bad choices would be as good or better than a particular human's may be difficult to predict or assess. This difficulty may be in part because the level of automated vehicle system understanding of the ethical issues at play in a given road scenario, sensed for an instant from out of a continuous stream of synthetic physical predictions of the near future, and dependent on layers of pattern recognition and situational intelligence, may be opaque to human inspection because of its origins in probabilistic machine learning rather than a simple, plain English 'human values' logic of parsable rules. The depth of understanding, predictive power and ethical sophistication needed will be hard to implement, and even harder to test or assess.\n\nThe scale of this challenge may have other effects. There may be few entities able to marshal the resources and AI capacity necessary to meet it, as well as the capital necessary to take an automated vehicle system to market and sustain it operationally for the life of a vehicle, and the legal capacity to deal with the potential for liability for a significant proportion of traffic accidents. This may have the effect of narrowing the number of different system operators, and eroding the diverse global vehicle market down to a small number of system suppliers.\n\n== Potential limits or

These changes include breakthrough technological advances and when the market demands and adopts new technology quickly. In the rapid advance of both factors, the end of the era of incremental change was recognized. When the transition is made to a new technology, new entrants to the automotive industry present themselves, which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft, as well as tech giants such as [[Google]] and [[Nvidia]].  As new entrants to the industry arise, market uncertainty naturally occurs due to the changing dynamics. For example, the entrance of tech giants, as well as the alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers causes a variation in the innovation and production process of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences. As a result of the rise of mobility providers, the number of vehicles per capita has flatlined. In addition, the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to market uncertainty and causes forecasters to question whether personal ownership of vehicles is still relevant as new transportation technology and mobility providers are becoming preferred among consumers.\n\n=== Taxis ===\nWith the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the personal ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity. Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/2/16841090/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-car-ces-2018|title=You can take a ride in a self-driving Lyft during CES|work=The Verge|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Healthcare, car repair, and car insurance ===\nWith the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real-time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions.<ref name=\":7\" /> Numbers made available by the US government state that 94% of the vehicle accidents are due to human failures. As a result, major implications for the healthcare industry become apparent. Numbers from the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on US roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident reveal that an estimated US$500 billion loss may be imminent for the US healthcare industry when autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads. It is likely the anticipated decrease in traffic accidents will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources. As collisions are less likely to occur, and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly, the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames. Meanwhile, as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to proactively replace a part that will fail soon. This \"Asset Efficiency Service\" would implicate a productivity gain for the automotive repair industry.  As fewer collisions implicate less money spent on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well. It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general. The insurance industry may have to create new insurance models in the near future to accommodate the changes.  An unexpected disadvantage of the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles would be a reduction in organs available for transplant.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Adams |first1=Ian |title=Self-Driving Cars Will Make Organ Shortages Even Worse |url=https://slate.com/technology/2016/12/self-driving-cars-will-exacerbate-organ-shortages.html |accessdate=9 November 2018 |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=30 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Rescue, emergency response, and military ===\nThe technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries. The implementation of autonomous vehicles with rescue, emergency response, and military applications has already led to a decrease in deaths.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Military personnel use autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies, and even rescue people. In addition, a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows autonomous vehicles to become more and more autonomous. Another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances. An advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine and execute routes more efficiently than human drivers. The time savings can be invaluable in these situations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2017/08/29/the-us-army-is-developing-autonomous-armored-vehicles/|title=The US Army is developing autonomous armored vehicles|last=Snow|first=Shawn|date=29 August 2017|newspaper=[[Army Times]]|access-date=26 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Interior design and entertainment ===\nWith the driver decreasingly focused on operating a vehicle, the interior design and media-entertainment industry will have to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road. Vehicles need to be redesigned, and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage. In practice, it will show that travelers have more time for business and/or leisure. In both cases, this gives increasing opportunities for the media-entertainment industry to demand attention. Moreover, the advertisement business is able to provide location based ads without risking driver safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cardesignresearch.com/en/insights/2015/01/driverless-car-design-sleepwalking-into-the-future|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405203131/https://cardesignresearch.com/en/insights/2015/01/driverless-car-design-sleepwalking-into-the-future|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 April 2016|title=Driver-less car design: Sleep-walking into the future?|date=5 April 2016|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Telecommunication and energy ===\nAll cars can benefit from information and connections, but autonomous cars \"Will be fully capable of operating without C-V2X.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@ford/how-talking-and-listening-vehicles-could-make-roads-safer-cities-better-f215c68f376f|title=How 'Talking' and 'Listening' Vehicles Could Make Roads Safer, Cities Better|last=Company|first=Ford Motor|date=7 January 2019|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref> In addition, the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment. This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry.\n\nSince many autonomous vehicles are going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases. Similarly, radar, sensors, [[lidar]], and high-speed internet connectivity require higher auxiliary power from vehicles, which manifests as greater power draw from batteries.<ref name=\"EEICAV\"/> The larger battery requirement causes a necessary increase in supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry. On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand. As this implication depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry. This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem.\n\n=== Restaurant, hotels, and airlines ===\nDriver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future, and in the more distant future the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle. As indicated above, this will have implications for the entertainment- and interior design industry. For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function. Moreover, accompanied with the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases. In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms. The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry. In the case of relatively short-haul flights, waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers. With the improved convenience in future car travel, it is possible that customers might go for this option, causing a loss in customer bases for airline industry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://interestingengineering.com/volvos-fully-autonomous-360c-concept-vehicle-even-lets-you-sleep-in-it|title=Volvo's Fully Autonomous 360c Concept Vehicle Even Lets You Sleep in It|date=6 September 2018|access-date=26 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Elderly and disabled===\nThe elderly and [[persons with disabilities]] (such as persons who are [[hearing-impaired]], [[Vision impairment|vision-impaired]], [[Persons with reduced mobility|mobility-impaired]], or [[Cognitive impairment|cognitively-impaired]]) are potential beneficiaries of adoption of autonomous vehicles; however, the extent to which such populations gain greater mobility from the adoption of AV technology depends on the specific designs and regulations adopted.<ref>Ashley Jalsey III, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/driverless-cars-promise-far-greater-mobility-for-the-elderly-and-people-with-disabilities/2017/11/23/6994469c-c4a3-11e7-84bc-5e285c7f4512_story.html Driverless cars promise far greater mobility for the elderly and people with disabilities], ''Washington Post'' (23 November 2017).</ref><ref>Henry Claypool, Amitai Bin-Nun & Jeffrey Gerlach, [https://rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Self-Driving-Cars-The-Impact-on-People-with-Disabilities_FINAL.pdf Self-Driving Cars: The Impact on People with Disabilities] (January 2017), [[Ruderman Family Foundation]]/Securing America's Future Energy.</ref>\n\n===Children===\n{{see|Student transport}}\nChildren and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves, are also benefiting of the introduction of autonomous cars{{when|date=November 2019}}. Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick up and drop off systems by car in addition to [[walking]], [[cycling]] and busing, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers. The extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish. Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent, the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design. It is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury, which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jalopnik.com/why-autonomous-cars-could-be-the-change-disabled-people-1688864804|title=Why Autonomous Cars Could Be The Change Disabled People Need|last=McParland|first=Tom|work=Jalopnik|access-date=26 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Incidents ==\n{{See also|List of self-driving car fatalities}}\n\n=== Tesla Autopilot ===\n{{Main|Tesla Autopilot}}\nIn mid{{nbhyph}}October 2015, [[Tesla Motors]] rolled out version 7 of their software in the US that included [[Tesla Autopilot]] capability.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20151014/OEM06/151019938/tesla-beams-down-autopilot-mode-to-model-s|title=Tesla beams down 'autopilot' mode to Model S|last=Nelson|first=Gabe|date=14 October 2015|work=Automotive News|access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref> On 9 January 2016, Tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an [[Over-the-air programming|over-the-air]] update, adding a new \"summon\" feature that allows cars to self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-two-years-car-202858960.html|title=ELON MUSK: In 2 years your Tesla will be able to drive from New York to LA and find you|last=Zhang|first=Benjamin|date=10 January 2016|work=Automotive News|access-date=12 January 2016}}</ref> Tesla's automated driving features is currently classified as a Level 2 driver assistance system according to the [[SAE International|Society of Automotive Engineers']] (SAE) five levels of vehicle automation.

It is claimed by proponents to have potential to affect the frequency of road accidents, although it is difficult to assess this claim in the absence of data from substantial actual use.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ten ways autonomous driving could redefine the automotive world|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/ten-ways-autonomous-driving-could-redefine-the-automotive-world|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref> If there was a dramatic improvement in safety, the operators may seek to project their liability for the remaining accidents onto others as part of their reward for the improvement.  However, there is no obvious reason why they should escape liability if any such effects were found to be modest or nonexistent, since part of the purpose of such liability is to give an incentive to the party controlling something to do whatever is necessary to avoid it causing harm. Potential users may be reluctant to trust an operator if it seeks to pass its normal liability on to others.\n\nIn any case, a well-advised person who is not controlling a car at all (Level 5) would be understandably reluctant to accept liability for something out of their control. And when there is some degree of sharing control possible (Level 3 or 4), a well-advised person would be concerned that the vehicle might try to pass back control at the last seconds before an accident, to pass responsibility and liability back too, but in circumstances where the potential driver has no better prospects of avoiding the crash than the vehicle, since they have not necessarily been paying close attention, and if it is too hard for the very smart car it might be too hard for a human. Since operators, especially those familiar with trying to ignore existing legal obligations (under a motto like 'seek forgiveness, not permission'), such as Waymo or Uber, could be normally expected to try to avoid responsibility to the maximum degree possible, there is potential for attempt to let the operators evade being held liable for accidents while they are in control.\n\nAs higher levels of automation are commercially introduced (Level 3 and 4), the insurance industry may see a greater proportion of commercial and product liability lines while personal automobile insurance shrinks.<ref name=\"KPMG\">{{cite web|title=Marketplace of change: Automobile insurance in the era of autonomous vehicles|url=https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/insights/2016/05/era-of-autonomous-vehicles-survey.html|access-date=1 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413185623/https://home.kpmg.com/us/en/home/insights/2016/05/era-of-autonomous-vehicles-survey.html|archive-date=13 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWhen it comes to the direction of fully autonomous car liability, torts cannot be ignored. In any car accident the issue of negligence usually arises. In the situation of autonomous cars, negligence would most likely fall on the manufacturer because it would be hard to pin a breach of duty of care on the user who isn't in control of the vehicle. The only time negligence was brought up in an autonomous car lawsuit, there was a settlement between the person struck by the autonomous vehicle and the manufacturer (General Motors).<ref>{{Citation|title=Self-driving car liability|date=2020-04-13|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Self-driving_car_liability&oldid=950656907|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> Next, s product liability which would most likely cause liability to fall on the manufacturer.

Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hewitt |first1=Charlie |last2=Politis |first2=Ioannis |last3=Amanatidis |first3=Theocharis |last4=Sarkar |first4=Advait |title=Assessing public perception of self-driving cars: the autonomous vehicle acceptance model |journal=Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces |date=2019 |pages=518\u2013527 |doi=10.1145/3301275.3302268 |publisher=ACM Press}}</ref>\n\n== Moral issues ==\n{{See also|Machine ethics}}\n{{tone|section|date=February 2019}}\nWith the emergence of automated automobiles, various ethical issues arise. While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to a presumed but untestable potential for reduction of crashes by \"up to\" 90%<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Preparing a nation for autonomous vehicles: Opportunities, barriers and policy recommendations.|journal=Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice|volume=77}}</ref> and their potential greater accessibility to disabled, elderly, and young passengers, a range of ethical issues have not been fully addressed. Those include, but are not limited to: the moral, financial, and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law; the decisions a car is to make right before a (fatal) crash; privacy issues including potential for mass surveillance; potential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers; de-skilling and loss of independence by vehicle users; exposure to hacking and malware; and the further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity, and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries.\n\nThere are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|title=Responsibility for Crashes of Autonomous Vehicles: An Ethical Analysis|journal=Sci Eng Ethics|volume=21}}</ref> Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and criminal consequences. However, there are also voices {{who|date=February 2019}} that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. Experts {{who|date=February 2019}} suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.<ref name=\":2\" /> Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include [[software engineers]] that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Coming Collision Between Autonomous Vehicles and the Liability System|journal=Santa Clara Law Review|volume=52}}</ref>\n\nTaking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility, the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like: pedestrians, bicyclists and other drivers are endangered. A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment, the trolley problem: a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over five people, or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person, assuming there is no traffic on it.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Trolley Problem|journal=The Yale Law Journal|volume=94|issue=6}}</ref> When a self-driving car is in following scenario: it's driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way. The car has to decide between the two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Himmelreich|first=Johannes|date=17 May 2018|title=Never Mind the Trolley: The Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles in Mundane Situations|journal=Ethical Theory and Moral Practice|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=669\u2013684|doi=10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4|issn=1386-2820}}</ref> There are two main considerations that need to be addressed. First, what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions? Second, how could those be translated into software code? Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: [[Deontological ethics|deontology]] and [[utilitarianism]].<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Road vehicle automation|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=TxmfDAAAQBAJ}}|last=Meyer|first=G.|last2=Beiker|first2=S|publisher=Springer International Publishing|year=2014|pages=93\u2013102}}</ref> Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics]] are a typical example of deontological ethics. The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility. This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMany 'trolley' discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future, what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any, what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified, and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes. These practical difficulties, and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them, may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nWhile most trolley conundrums involve hyperbolic and unlikely fact patterns, it is inevitable mundane ethical decisions and risk calculations such as the precise millisecond a car should yield to a yellow light or how closely to drive to a bike lane will need to be programmed into the software of autonomous vehicles.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Himmelreich |first1=Johannes |title=Never Mind the Trolley: The Ethics of Autonomous Vehicles in Mundane Situations |journal=Ethical Theory and Moral Practice |date=2018 |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=669|doi=10.1007/s10677-018-9896-4 }}</ref> Algorithms dictate, for example, how closely to drive to a bike lane or the precise moment an autonomous car should yield to a yellow light.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Mundane ethical situations may even be more relevant than rare fatal circumstances because of the specificity implicated and their large scope.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Mundane situations involving drivers and pedestrians are so prevalent that, in the aggregate, produce large amounts of injuries and deaths.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Hence, even incremental permutations of moral algorithms can have a notable effect when considered in their entirety.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nPrivacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual.
