Bowen]], president of [[Princeton University]] from 1972 to 1988,<ref>Leitch, Alexander. [http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/bowen_william_gordon.html \"Bowen, William Gordon\"]. [[Princeton University Press]].</ref> founded JSTOR in 1995. JSTOR originally was conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries, especially [[Research library|research and university libraries]], due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence. Most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals. By digitizing many journal titles, JSTOR allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term. Online access and full-text search ability improved access dramatically.\n\nBowen initially considered using CD-ROMs for distribution.<ref>\"JSTOR, A History\" by Roger C. Schonfeld, Princeton University Press, 2003</ref> However, [[Ira Fuchs]], Princeton University's vice-president for Computing and Information Technology, convinced Bowen that CD-ROM was becoming an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility. (For example, all Princeton's administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989; the student dormitory network was completed in 1994; and campus networks like the one at Princeton were, in turn, linked to larger networks such as [[BITNET]] and the [[Internet]].) JSTOR was initiated in 1995 at seven different library sites, and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals. JSTOR access improved based on feedback from its initial sites, and it became a fully searchable index accessible from any ordinary [[web browser]]. Special software was put in place to make pictures and graphs clear and readable.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>\n\nWith the success of this limited project, Bowen and Kevin Guthrie, then-president of JSTOR, wanted to expand the number of participating journals. They met with representatives of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] and an agreement was made to digitize the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' dating from its beginning in 1665. The work of adding these volumes to JSTOR was completed by December 2000.<ref name = \"Taylor\" />\n\nThe [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] funded JSTOR initially. Until January 2009 JSTOR operated as an independent, self-sustaining [[nonprofit organization]] with offices in [[New York City]] and in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]]. Then JSTOR merged with the nonprofit [[Ithaka Harbors, Inc.]]<ref>{{cite web\n  |title = About\n  |url = http://about.jstor.org/about\n  |publisher = JSTOR\n  |accessdate = 28 November 2015\n}}</ref>\u2014a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 and \"dedicated to helping the [[academic community]] take full advantage of rapidly advancing information and networking technologies\".<ref name = \"About Ithaka\" />\n\n==Content==\nJSTOR content is provided by more than 900 publishers.<ref name=\"Annual Summary\"/> The [[bibliographic database|database]] contains more than 1,900 journal titles,<ref name=\"Annual Summary\"/> in more than 50 disciplines. Each object is uniquely identified by an integer value, starting at <code>1</code>.\n\nIn addition to the main site, the JSTOR labs group operates an open service that allows access to the contents of the archives for the purposes of [[corpus]]{{dn|date=November 2019}} analysis{{clarify|reason=which kind of corpus?|date=November 2019}} at its ''Data for Research'' service.<ref>[http://dfr.jstor.org/ Data for Research]. JSTOR.</ref> This site offers a search facility with graphical indication of the article coverage and loose integration into the main JSTOR site. Users may create focused sets of articles and then request a dataset containing word and [[n-gram|{{var|n}}-gram]] frequencies and basic metadata. They are notified when the dataset is ready and may download it in either [[XML]] or [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] formats. The service does not offer full-text, although academics may request that from JSTOR, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nJSTOR Plant Science<ref>[http://plants.jstor.org/ JSTOR Plant Science]. JSTOR.</ref> is available in addition to the main site. JSTOR Plant Science provides access to content such as plant type specimens, taxonomic structures, scientific literature, and related materials and aimed at those researching, teaching, or studying botany, biology, ecology, environmental, and conservation studies. The materials on JSTOR Plant Science are contributed through the Global Plants Initiative (GPI)<ref>[http://about.jstor.org/content/global-plants#partnerships Global Plants Initiative]. JSTOR.</ref> and are accessible only to JSTOR and GPI members. Two partner networks are contributing to this: the African Plants Initiative, which focuses on plants from Africa, and the Latin American Plants Initiative, which contributes plants from Latin America.\n\nJSTOR launched its Books at JSTOR program in November 2012, adding 15,000 current and backlist books to its site. The books are linked with reviews and from citations in journal articles.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://about.jstor.org/news/new-chapter-begins-books-jstor-launches |title=A new chapter begins: Books at JSTOR launches |date=November 12, 2012 |publisher=JSTOR |accessdate=December 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2014, JSTOR launched ''JSTOR Daily'', an online magazine meant to bring academic research to a broader audience. Posted articles are generally based on JSTOR entries, and some entries provide the backstory to current events.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lichterman |first=Joseph |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/10/opening-up-the-archives-jstor-wants-to-tie-a-library-to-the-news/ |title=Opening up the archives: JSTOR wants to tie a library to the news |work=[[Nieman Lab]] |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Access==\nJSTOR is licensed mainly to academic institutions, public libraries, research institutions, museums, and schools.

''The Atlantic''. Retrieved 29 January 2013.</ref>\n\nInquiries have been made about the possibility of making JSTOR [[open access]]. According to Harvard Law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]], JSTOR had been asked \"how much would it cost to make this available to the whole world, how much would we need to pay you? The answer was $250 million\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HAw1i4gOU4#t=44m39 Lessig on \"Aaron's Laws\u2014Law and Justice in a Digital Age\"]. YouTube (2013-02-20).

Aaron Swartz}}\n{{see also|Aaron Swartz#JSTOR}}\nInternet activist [[Aaron Swartz]] noted that by limiting access to the knowledge produced at public universities and financed by US government and students, JSTOR was earning billions of US dollars each year to for-profit corporations that did not invest in any of these public works. Instead of benefiting the creators of the knowledge or its sponsors, JSTOR secured multi-billion dollar profits for private publishers, by repackaging their publications in [[List of academic databases and search engines|academic databases]] that university libraries pay thousands of dollars to subscribe to, so that their students can access the content.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html|title=Internet Activist, a Creator of RSS, Is Dead at 26, Apparently a Suicide|last=Schwartz|first=John|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, Swartz used [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s data network to bulk-download a substantial portion of JSTOR's collection of academic journal articles.<ref name=\"JSTORstatement\" /><ref name=\"HuffPost\" /> When the bulk-download was discovered, a video camera was placed in the room to film the mysterious visitor and the relevant computer was left untouched. Once video was captured of the visitor, the download was stopped and Swartz was identified. Rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him, in June 2011 they reached a settlement wherein he surrendered the downloaded data.<ref name=\"JSTORstatement\" /><ref name=\"HuffPost\" />\n\nThe following month, federal authorities charged Swartz with several \"[[data theft]]\"\u2013related crimes, including [[wire fraud]], computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a [[Computer security|protected computer]], and recklessly damaging a protected computer.<ref name=\"Bilton\"/><ref name=\"open-access-adv\" /> Prosecutors in the case claimed that Swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P file-sharing sites]].<ref name=HuffPost /><ref name=\"Feds: Harvard fellow hacked millions of papers\"/>\n\nSwartz surrendered to authorities, pleaded not guilty to all counts, and was released on $100,000 bail. In September 2012, U.S. attorneys increased the number of charges against Swartz from four to thirteen, with a possible penalty of 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines.<ref name = JusticeGov /><ref name =Wired/> The case still was pending when Swartz committed [[suicide]] in January 2013.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21001452 \"Aaron Swartz, internet freedom activist, dies aged 26\"], [[BBC News]]</ref> Prosecutors dropped the charges after his suicide.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/27/technology/aaron-swartz-father/ \"Aaron Swartz's father: He'd be alive today if he was never arrested\"], money.cnn.com</ref>\n\n===Limitations===\nThe availability of most journals on JSTOR is controlled by a \"[[Embargo (academic publishing)|moving wall]]\", which is an agreed-upon delay between the current volume of the journal and the latest volume available on JSTOR. This time period is specified by agreement between JSTOR and the publisher of the journal, which usually is three to five years. Publishers may request that the period of a \"moving wall\" be changed or request discontinuation of coverage. Formerly, publishers also could request that the \"moving wall\" be changed to a \"fixed wall\"\u2014a specified date after which JSTOR would not add new volumes to its database. {{As of |2010|11}}, \"fixed wall\" agreements were still in effect with three publishers of 29 journals made available online through sites controlled by the publishers.<ref name=\"Wall\" />\n\nIn 2010, JSTOR started adding current issues of certain journals through its Current Scholarship Program.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://about.jstor.org/content/about-current-journals |title=About current journals |publisher=JSTOR |accessdate=December 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Increasing public access===\nBeginning September 6, 2011, JSTOR made public domain content available at no charge to the public.<ref name=\"JSTOR_EJC_announcement\"/><ref name = LibraryJournal /> This \"Early Journal Content\" program constitutes about 6% of JSTOR's total content, and includes over 500,000 documents from more than 200 journals that were published before 1923 in the United States, and before 1870 in other countries.<ref name=\"JSTOR_EJC_announcement\"/><ref name = LibraryJournal /><ref name=JSTOR_EJC_about/> JSTOR stated that it had been working on making this material free for some time.

Bowen]], president of [[Princeton University]] from 1972 to 1988,<ref>Leitch, Alexander. [http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/bowen_william_gordon.html \"Bowen, William Gordon\"]. [[Princeton University Press]].</ref> founded JSTOR in 1995. JSTOR originally was conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries, especially [[Research library|research and university libraries]], due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence. Most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals. By digitizing many journal titles, JSTOR allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term. Online access and full-text search ability improved access dramatically.\n\nBowen initially considered using CD-ROMs for distribution.<ref>\"JSTOR, A History\" by Roger C. Schonfeld, Princeton University Press, 2003</ref> However, [[Ira Fuchs]], Princeton University's vice-president for Computing and Information Technology, convinced Bowen that CD-ROM was becoming an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility. (For example, all Princeton's administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989; the student dormitory network was completed in 1994; and campus networks like the one at Princeton were, in turn, linked to larger networks such as [[BITNET]] and the [[Internet]].) JSTOR was initiated in 1995 at seven different library sites, and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals. JSTOR access improved based on feedback from its initial sites, and it became a fully searchable index accessible from any ordinary [[web browser]]. Special software was put in place to make pictures and graphs clear and readable.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>\n\nWith the success of this limited project, Bowen and Kevin Guthrie, then-president of JSTOR, wanted to expand the number of participating journals. They met with representatives of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] and an agreement was made to digitize the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' dating from its beginning in 1665. The work of adding these volumes to JSTOR was completed by December 2000.<ref name = \"Taylor\" />\n\nThe [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] funded JSTOR initially. Until January 2009 JSTOR operated as an independent, self-sustaining [[nonprofit organization]] with offices in [[New York City]] and in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]]. Then JSTOR merged with the nonprofit [[Ithaka Harbors, Inc.]]<ref>{{cite web\n  |title = About\n  |url = http://about.jstor.org/about\n  |publisher = JSTOR\n  |accessdate = 28 November 2015\n}}</ref>\u2014a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 and \"dedicated to helping the [[academic community]] take full advantage of rapidly advancing information and networking technologies\".<ref name = \"About Ithaka\" />\n\n==Content==\nJSTOR content is provided by more than 900 publishers.<ref name=\"Annual Summary\"/> The [[bibliographic database|database]] contains more than 1,900 journal titles,<ref name=\"Annual Summary\"/> in more than 50 disciplines. Each object is uniquely identified by an integer value, starting at <code>1</code>.\n\nIn addition to the main site, the JSTOR labs group operates an open service that allows access to the contents of the archives for the purposes of [[corpus]]{{dn|date=November 2019}} analysis{{clarify|reason=which kind of corpus?|date=November 2019}} at its ''Data for Research'' service.<ref>[http://dfr.jstor.org/ Data for Research]. JSTOR.</ref> This site offers a search facility with graphical indication of the article coverage and loose integration into the main JSTOR site. Users may create focused sets of articles and then request a dataset containing word and [[n-gram|{{var|n}}-gram]] frequencies and basic metadata. They are notified when the dataset is ready and may download it in either [[XML]] or [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] formats. The service does not offer full-text, although academics may request that from JSTOR, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nJSTOR Plant Science<ref>[http://plants.jstor.org/ JSTOR Plant Science]. JSTOR.</ref> is available in addition to the main site. JSTOR Plant Science provides access to content such as plant type specimens, taxonomic structures, scientific literature, and related materials and aimed at those researching, teaching, or studying botany, biology, ecology, environmental, and conservation studies. The materials on JSTOR Plant Science are contributed through the Global Plants Initiative (GPI)<ref>[http://about.jstor.org/content/global-plants#partnerships Global Plants Initiative]. JSTOR.</ref> and are accessible only to JSTOR and GPI members. Two partner networks are contributing to this: the African Plants Initiative, which focuses on plants from Africa, and the Latin American Plants Initiative, which contributes plants from Latin America.\n\nJSTOR launched its Books at JSTOR program in November 2012, adding 15,000 current and backlist books to its site. The books are linked with reviews and from citations in journal articles.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://about.jstor.org/news/new-chapter-begins-books-jstor-launches |title=A new chapter begins: Books at JSTOR launches |date=November 12, 2012 |publisher=JSTOR |accessdate=December 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2014, JSTOR launched ''JSTOR Daily'', an online magazine meant to bring academic research to a broader audience. Posted articles are generally based on JSTOR entries, and some entries provide the backstory to current events.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lichterman |first=Joseph |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/10/opening-up-the-archives-jstor-wants-to-tie-a-library-to-the-news/ |title=Opening up the archives: JSTOR wants to tie a library to the news |work=[[Nieman Lab]] |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Access==\nJSTOR is licensed mainly to academic institutions, public libraries, research institutions, museums, and schools.

''The Atlantic''. Retrieved 29 January 2013.</ref>\n\nInquiries have been made about the possibility of making JSTOR [[open access]]. According to Harvard Law professor [[Lawrence Lessig]], JSTOR had been asked \"how much would it cost to make this available to the whole world, how much would we need to pay you? The answer was $250 million\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HAw1i4gOU4#t=44m39 Lessig on \"Aaron's Laws\u2014Law and Justice in a Digital Age\"]. YouTube (2013-02-20).

Aaron Swartz}}\n{{see also|Aaron Swartz#JSTOR}}\nInternet activist [[Aaron Swartz]] noted that by limiting access to the knowledge produced at public universities and financed by US government and students, JSTOR was earning billions of US dollars each year to for-profit corporations that did not invest in any of these public works. Instead of benefiting the creators of the knowledge or its sponsors, JSTOR secured multi-billion dollar profits for private publishers, by repackaging their publications in [[List of academic databases and search engines|academic databases]] that university libraries pay thousands of dollars to subscribe to, so that their students can access the content.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html|title=Internet Activist, a Creator of RSS, Is Dead at 26, Apparently a Suicide|last=Schwartz|first=John|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, Swartz used [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s data network to bulk-download a substantial portion of JSTOR's collection of academic journal articles.<ref name=\"JSTORstatement\" /><ref name=\"HuffPost\" />When the bulk-download was discovered, a video camera was placed in the room to film the mysterious visitor and the relevant computer was left untouched. Once video was captured of the visitor, the download was stopped and Swartz was identified. Rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him, in June 2011 they reached a settlement wherein he surrendered the downloaded data.<ref name=\"JSTORstatement\" /><ref name=\"HuffPost\" />\n\nThe following month, federal authorities charged Swartz with several \"[[data theft]]\"\u2013related crimes, including [[wire fraud]], computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a [[Computer security|protected computer]], and recklessly damaging a protected computer.<ref name=\"Bilton\"/><ref name=\"open-access-adv\" /> Prosecutors in the case claimed that Swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|P2P file-sharing sites]].<ref name=HuffPost /><ref name=\"Feds: Harvard fellow hacked millions of papers\"/>\n\nSwartz surrendered to authorities, pleaded not guilty to all counts, and was released on $100,000 bail. In September 2012, U.S. attorneys increased the number of charges against Swartz from four to thirteen, with a possible penalty of 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines.<ref name = JusticeGov /><ref name =Wired/> The case still was pending when Swartz committed [[suicide]] in January 2013.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-21001452 \"Aaron Swartz, internet freedom activist, dies aged 26\"], [[BBC News]]</ref> Prosecutors dropped the charges after his suicide.<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/27/technology/aaron-swartz-father/ \"Aaron Swartz's father: He'd be alive today if he was never arrested\"], money.cnn.com</ref>\n\n===Limitations===\nThe availability of most journals on JSTOR is controlled by a \"[[Embargo (academic publishing)|moving wall]]\", which is an agreed-upon delay between the current volume of the journal and the latest volume available on JSTOR. This time period is specified by agreement between JSTOR and the publisher of the journal, which usually is three to five years. Publishers may request that the period of a \"moving wall\" be changed or request discontinuation of coverage. Formerly, publishers also could request that the \"moving wall\" be changed to a \"fixed wall\"\u2014a specified date after which JSTOR would not add new volumes to its database. {{As of |2010|11}}, \"fixed wall\" agreements were still in effect with three publishers of 29 journals made available online through sites controlled by the publishers.<ref name=\"Wall\" />\n\nIn 2010, JSTOR started adding current issues of certain journals through its Current Scholarship Program.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://about.jstor.org/content/about-current-journals |title=About current journals |publisher=JSTOR |accessdate=December 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Increasing public access===\nBeginning September 6, 2011, JSTOR made public domain content available at no charge to the public.<ref name=\"JSTOR_EJC_announcement\"/><ref name = LibraryJournal /> This \"Early Journal Content\" program constitutes about 6% of JSTOR's total content, and includes over 500,000 documents from more than 200 journals that were published before 1923 in the United States, and before 1870 in other countries.<ref name=\"JSTOR_EJC_announcement\"/><ref name = LibraryJournal /><ref name=JSTOR_EJC_about/> JSTOR stated that it had been working on making this material free for some time.

{"title_page": "Free and open-source software", "text_new": "<br />\n{{short description|software whose source code is available and which is permissively licensed}}'''Free and open-source software''' ('''FOSS''') is software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software. That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright licensing and the source code is usually hidden from the users.\n\nFOSS maintains the software user's civil liberty rights (see the Four Essential Freedoms, below).  Other benefits of using FOSS can include decreased software costs, increased security and stability (especially in regard to malware), protecting privacy, education, and giving users more control over their own hardware. Free and open-source operating systems such as Linux and descendants of BSD are widely utilized today, powering millions of servers, desktops, smartphones (e.g., Android), and other devices. Free-software licenses and open-source licenses are used by many software packages. The free-software movement and the open-source software movement are online social movements behind widespread production and adoption of FOSS.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\n{{Further|Alternative terms for free software}}\n\n\"'''Free and open-source software'''\" ('''FOSS''') is an umbrella term for software that is simultaneously considered both [[Free software]] and [[open-source software]].  FOSS (free and open-source software) allows the user to inspect the source code and provides a high level of control of the software's functions compared to [[proprietary software]]. The term \"free software\" does not refer to the monetary cost of the software at all, but rather whether the license maintains the software user's civil liberties (\"free\u201d as in \u201cfree speech,\u201d not as in \u201cfree beer\u201d).<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html|title=What is free software?

A growing and evolving software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products; rather than funding software development from hardware revenue, these new companies were selling software directly. Leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers who were able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of software bundled with hardware product costs. In ''United States vs. [[IBM]]'', filed January 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was anticompetitive.{{sfn|Fisher|McKie|Mancke|1983}} While some software was still being provided without monetary cost and license restriction, there was a growing amount of software that was only at a monetary cost with restricted licensing. In the 1970s and early 1980s, some parts of the [[software industry]] began using technical measures (such as distributing only [[Executable|binary copies]] of [[computer programs]]) to prevent [[computer users]] from being able to use [[reverse engineering]] techniques to study and customize software they had paid for.

An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the ''[[GNU Manifesto]]''. The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, ''[[Free Software Definition]]'' and \"[[copyleft]]\" ideas. The FSF takes the position that the fundamental issue [[Free software]] addresses is an ethical one\u2014to ensure software users can exercise what it calls \"[[Free software#Definition and the Four Freedoms|The Four Essential Freedoms]]\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Linux kernel]], created by [[Linus Torvalds]], was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. Initially, Linux was not released under either a Free software or an Open-source software license. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] the project under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | title=Release notes for Linux kernel 0.12 | publisher=Kernel.org | access-date=2016-07-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819045030/http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | archive-date=2007-08-19 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[FreeBSD]] and [[NetBSD]] (both derived from [[386BSD]]) were released as Free software when the [[USL v. BSDi]] lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. [[OpenBSD]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD in 1995. Also in 1995, The [[Apache HTTP Server]], commonly referred to as Apache, was released under the [[Apache License|Apache License 1.0]].\n\nIn 1997, [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]] published [[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]], a reflective analysis of the hacker community and Free software principles. The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release their popular [[Netscape Communicator]] Internet suite as [[Free software]]. This code is today better known as [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].\n\nNetscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the FSF's Free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry. They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, and looked for a way to rebrand the Free software movement to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code. The new name they chose was \"Open-source\", and quickly [[Bruce Perens]], publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]], [[Linus Torvalds]], and others signed on to the rebranding. The [[Open Source Initiative]] was founded in February 1998 to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize open-source principles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI |publisher=Opensource.org |access-date=2014-02-02 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69LfEzfps?url=http://opensource.org/history |archive-date=2012-07-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhile the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to, commercial software vendors found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application's [[source code]]. A [[Microsoft]] executive publicly stated in 2001 that \"Open-source is an intellectual property destroyer. I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business.\"{{sfn|Charny|2001}} This view perfectly summarizes the initial response to FOSS by some software corporations.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} For many years FOSS played a niche role outside of the mainstream of private software development.  However the success of FOSS Operating Systems such as Linux, BSD and the companies based on FOSS such as [[Red Hat]], has changed the software industry's attitude and there has been a dramatic shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of Free and Open-source software (FOSS).{{sfn|Miller|Voas|Costello|2010|pages=14\u201316}}\n\n==Usage==\n{{See also|Linux adoption|Free software#Adoption|Open-source software#Adoption}}\n\n===FOSS benefits over proprietary software===\n<!--to include: https://books.google.com/books?id=C0Z30r8qdpcC-->\n\n====Personal control, customizability and freedom====\n{{See also|Vendor lock-in}}\nUsers of FOSS benefit from the [[Free software#Definition and the Four Freedoms|Four Essential Freedoms]] to make unrestricted use of, and to study, copy, modify, and redistribute such software with or without modification.

FOSS (free and open-source software) allows the user to inspect the source code and provides a high level of control of the software's functions compared to [[proprietary software]]. The term \"free software\" does not refer to the monetary cost of the software at all, but rather whether the license maintains the software user's civil liberties (\"free\u201d as in \u201cfree speech,\u201d not as in \u201cfree beer\u201d).<ref name=\":1\" /> There are a number of related terms and abbreviations for free and open-source software (FOSS or F/OSS), or free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS or F/LOSS\u2014FLOSS is the FSF-preferred term).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html|title=FLOSS and FOSS|last=Stallman|first=Richard|date=|website=The GNU Project -- GNU.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180916040800/https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html|archive-date=2018-09-16|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there is almost a complete overlap between [[Free software|free-software]] licenses and [[Open-source software|open-source-software]] licenses, there is a strong philosophical disagreement between the advocates of these two positions.

A growing and evolving software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products; rather than funding software development from hardware revenue, these new companies were selling software directly. Leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers who were able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of software bundled with hardware product costs. In ''United States vs. [[IBM]]'', filed January 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was anticompetitive.{{sfn|Fisher|McKie|Mancke|1983}} While some software was still being provided without monetary cost and license restriction, there was a growing amount of software that was only at a monetary cost with restricted licensing. In the 1970s and early 1980s, some parts of the [[software industry]] began using technical measures (such as distributing only [[Executable|binary copies]] of [[computer programs]]) to prevent [[computer users]] from being able to use [[reverse engineering]] techniques to study and customize software they had paid for.

An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the ''[[GNU Manifesto]]''. The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, ''[[Free Software Definition]]'' and \"[[copyleft]]\" ideas. The FSF takes the position that the fundamental issue [[Free software]] addresses is an ethical one\u2014to ensure software users can exercise what it calls \"[[Free software#Definition and the Four Freedoms|The Four Essential Freedoms]]\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Linux kernel]], created by [[Linus Torvalds]], was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. Initially, Linux was not released under either a Free software or an Open-source software license. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he [[Software relicensing|relicensed]] the project under the [[GNU General Public License]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | title=Release notes for Linux kernel 0.12 | publisher=Kernel.org | access-date=2016-07-25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819045030/http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | archive-date=2007-08-19 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[FreeBSD]] and [[NetBSD]] (both derived from [[386BSD]]) were released as Free software when the [[USL v. BSDi]] lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. [[OpenBSD]] [[Fork (software development)|forked]] from NetBSD in 1995. Also in 1995, The [[Apache HTTP Server]], commonly referred to as Apache, was released under the [[Apache License|Apache License 1.0]].\n\nIn 1997, [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]] published [[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]], a reflective analysis of the hacker community and Free software principles. The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release their popular [[Netscape Communicator]] Internet suite as [[Free software]]. This code is today better known as [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].\n\nNetscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the FSF's Free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry. They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, and looked for a way to rebrand the Free software movement to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code. The new name they chose was \"Open-source\", and quickly [[Bruce Perens]], publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]], [[Linus Torvalds]], and others signed on to the rebranding. The [[Open Source Initiative]] was founded in February 1998 to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize open-source principles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI |publisher=Opensource.org |access-date=2014-02-02 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69LfEzfps?url=http://opensource.org/history |archive-date=2012-07-22 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhile the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to, commercial software vendors found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application's [[source code]]. A [[Microsoft]] executive publicly stated in 2001 that \"Open-source is an intellectual property destroyer. I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business.\"{{sfn|Charny|2001}} This view perfectly summarizes the initial response to FOSS by some software corporations.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} For many years FOSS played a niche role outside of the mainstream of private software development.  However the success of FOSS Operating Systems such as Linux, BSD and the companies based on FOSS such as [[Red Hat]], has changed the software industry's attitude and there has been a dramatic shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of Free and Open-source software (FOSS).{{sfn|Miller|Voas|Costello|2010|pages=14\u201316}}\n\n==Usage==\n{{See also|Linux adoption|Free software#Adoption|Open-source software#Adoption}}\n\n===FOSS benefits over proprietary software===\n<!--to include: https://books.google.com/books?id=C0Z30r8qdpcC-->\n\n====Personal control, customizability and freedom====\n{{See also|Vendor lock-in}}\nUsers of FOSS benefit from the [[Free software#Definition and the Four Freedoms|Four Essential Freedoms]] to make unrestricted use of, and to study, copy, modify, and redistribute such software with or without modification.
