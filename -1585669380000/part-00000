The early tactics mainly focused on large demonstrations, in particular blockades of marches inspired by the 30th November events in Lund between 1991 and 1993.

Since the late 2000s the type of militant street-based antifascism that AFA and Revolution\u00e4ra Fronten represented has declined, in response to a more parliamentarian and online focus in the far right. This is evident by the very limited public role in many of the largest antifascist demonstrations in the 2010s, including the large 2018 Gothenburg blockade of the Nordic Resistance Movement, the massive [[K\u00e4rrtorp]] protest, and the massive 13.000 person strong demonstration in 2014 in response to the stabbing of [[Showan Shattak]] and three other antifascists in Malm\u00f6.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Merill|first=Samuel|last2=Pries|first2=Johan|date=|year=2019|title=Translocalising and Relocalising Antifascist Struggles: From #K\u00e4mpaShowan to #K\u00e4mpaMalm\u00f6|url=https://www.academia.edu/37732490/Translocalising_and_Relocalising_Antifascist_Struggles_From_K%C3%A4mpaShowan_to_K%C3%A4mpaMalm%C3%B6|journal=Antipode|volume=51|issue=1|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== United States===\n{{main|Antifa (United States)}}\n\nAfter World War II, but prior to the development of the modern antifa movement, violent confrontations with Fascist elements happened sporadically in the [[United States]].

The early tactics mainly focused on large demonstrations, in particular blockades of marches inspired by the 30th November events in Lund between 1991 and 1993.

Since the late 2000's the type of militant street-based antifascism that AFA and Revolution\u00e4ra Fronten represented has declined, in response to a more parliamentarian and online focus in the far right. This is evident by the very limited public role in many of the largest antifascist demonstrations in the 2010s, including the large 2018 Gothenburg blockade of the Nordic Resistance Movement, the massive [[K\u00e4rrtorp]] protest, and the massive 13.000 person strong demonstration in 2014 in response to the stabbing of [[Showan Shattak]] and three other antifascists in Malm\u00f6.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Merill|first=Samuel|last2=Pries|first2=Johan|date=|year=2019|title=Translocalising and Relocalising Antifascist Struggles: From #K\u00e4mpaShowan to #K\u00e4mpaMalm\u00f6|url=https://www.academia.edu/37732490/Translocalising_and_Relocalising_Antifascist_Struggles_From_K%C3%A4mpaShowan_to_K%C3%A4mpaMalm%C3%B6|journal=Antipode|volume=51|issue=1|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== United States===\n{{main|Antifa (United States)}}\n\nAfter World War II, but prior to the development of the modern antifa movement, violent confrontations with Fascist elements happened sporadically in the [[United States]].

Typically operating as independent [[non-profit organization]]s, drum corps perform in competitions, parades, festivals, and other civic functions. Participants of all ages are represented within the band activity, but the majority are between the ages of 13 and 22 and are members of corps within Drum Corps International or Drum Corps Associates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dci.org/about/ |title=DCI.org: Introduction |accessdate=9 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nCompetitive summer marching bands participate in summer touring circuits, such as [[Drum Corps International|Drum Corps International (DCI)]] and [[Drum Corps Associates|Drum Corps Associates (DCA)]]. Corps prepare a new show each year, approximately 8\u201312 minutes in length, and refine it throughout the summer tour.  Shows are performed on [[American football|football]] fields and are judged in various musical and visual categories, or \"captions\".  Musical repertoires vary widely among corps and include [[European classical music|symphonic]], [[jazz]], [[big band]], [[contemporary music|contemporary]], [[rock music|rock]], [[wind band]], [[choir|vocal]], [[hip hop music|rap]], [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], and [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]], among other genres.  Competitive junior corps usually spend between 10 and 15 weeks on tour over the summer, practicing and performing full-time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phantom Regiment Schedule|url=http://www.regiment.org/calendar/index.cfm|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nDrum and bugle corps stems from a rich American and Canadian military history, separate from other marching musical activities. Beginning after [[World War I]] through the 1970s, corps and competitions were often sponsored by the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]], [[Scout troop]]s, churches, the [[Royal Canadian Legion]], and the [[American Legion]]. Owing to many of these groups' roots, corps were traditionally militaristic. By the late 1960s, many corps wanted more creative freedom and better financial compensation than was offered by their sponsoring organizations. Some felt the prize-money structures, based on competitive placement, were not fairly compensating all corps for their appearances. Additionally, some felt the current judging rules were stifling musical and theatrical possibilities. At the peak of North American drum corps participation (with perhaps a thousand active corps in the U.S. and nearly as many in Canada), several corps decided to \"unionize\", as stated by Don Warren (founder of the [[The Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps|Cavaliers]]). They formed their own organizations, which ultimately led to the formation of [[Drum Corps Associates|DCA]] in 1965 and [[Drum Corps International|DCI]] in 1972. By this time, many corps had already lost their church or community sponsors.\n\nFor the corps that remained, longer travel times were necessary to attend the shrinking numbers of contests, further adding to the financial and time demands on the organizations and their individual members. At the same time costs for the increasingly complex field shows mounted and creative and instructional demands rose leading many competitive corps to falter and become inactive. By the late 1990s only a fraction of the corps that existed in the 60s and 70s remained, although several new corps, some of which have become very successful, did start up along the way.\n\nNon-competitive classic-style corps (often and sometimes inaccurately known as \"alumni corps\") saw a renaissance beginning in the mid-1980s and they continue to organize in the 21st Century; members often remain vigilant about the traditions and virtues of the drum corps activity before the advent of electronic technology, band instruments, dancing and singing.\n\nFreed from the traditional and more-restrictive judging rules of the late 1960s, corps began making innovative changes such as the use of Bb brass instruments (late 1990s early 2000s), wide-ranging tempos, intricate asymmetric drill formations, elaborate guard costumes and props, and the use of stationary orchestral percussion instruments. A common criticism of drum corps is that it has become too similar to [[marching band]], but although the two activities are very similar they are still clearly distinct. A few corps still utilize the traditional G [[Bugle]] which is very rarely found in DCI marching units. The competitive season for drum corps is in the summer rather than fall, with auditions and initial ensemble rehearsals beginning as early as late October of the previous year. The top-tier competitive corps are often very complex and more professional than the average marching band, as members in full-time touring units have no distractions outside their organization during the season and membership is achieved only through competitive auditions.\n\n== Musical program ==\n\n=== Repertoire ===\nA typical show usually revolves around one genre of music, or sometimes melds separate genres together. Modern corps programs have become increasingly conceptual and programmatic, with overarching show themes rather than loosely related musical selections. Often, especially within classical selections, a single composer's material is featured. Corps have performed virtually every genre of music that can be fit for on-field adaptation, including jazz, new age, classical, and rock music. It is becoming increasingly common to hear corps performing original music, composed specifically for the corps by their musical staff or consultants.\n\n=== Instrumentation ===\n\n==== Brass ====\n{{main|Marching brass}}\n\n[[File:2007-Brigadiers-Contra-Line.jpg|thumb| The lowest-pitched of the horns used in drum corps is the [[contrabass bugle]], or 'contra'. Here, members of a [[Drum Corps Associates|DCA]] corps from [[Upstate New York]] are shown performing in a parade.]]\n\nThe exclusive use of bell-front [[brass instrument]]ation is a defining musical element of drum corps. Throughout the years, the horns used in drum corps have evolved from true, single-valved [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]]s to modern Bb brass instruments. Until 1999, drum and bugle corps hornlines within DCI were required to be pitched in the key of G.  That year, the DCI rules congress passed a rule change to allow \"brass bell-front valve instruments in any key with the exception of sousaphones and trombones.\"<ref>Gibbs, Dave (1999-01-07). [http://bluedevils.org/news/index.php?newsID=14 \"Multi-key Instrument Rule Change\"]. Retrieved 2010-08-06.</ref> In World Class, the rule did not go into effect until the 2000 season, while Open Class opted for a two-year [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] prior to implementation in 2002; [[Drum Corps Associates|DCA]] followed suit in 2004. Hornlines are now most commonly pitched in B{{music|b}}, with mellophones pitched in F. In 2014, the DCI Board of Directors passed a rule change that changed their definition of a bugle to allow the entire brass family, including trombones and concert French horns.<ref>{{cite web|title='Rules Congress' returns to DCI\u2019s annual business meetings|url=http://www.dci.org/news/view.cfm?news_id=6d00148c-fd0f-4cb5-9164-6f33f9996d09|website=dci.org|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"\n|+ Instrument names\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Key of G\n! scope=\"col\" | Key of B{{music|b}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Key of F\n|-\n| Soprano/Flugelhorn\n| [[Trumpet]]/[[Flugelhorn]]\n|\n|-\n| [[Mellophone]] in G\n| Marching [[French Horn]]\n| Mellophone in F/French Horn\n|-\n| Baritone/Euphonium in G\n| Baritone/Euphonium\n|\n|-\n| Contrabass\n| [[Tuba]]\n|\n|}\n\n*tuba and baritone/euphonium are pitched in Bb(BBb) and are written in C (CC).\n\n==== Percussion ====\n{{main|Marching percussion}}\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Phantom 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Phantom Regiment]] continually wins best percussion in the DCI World Championships.]] -->\n\n[[File:Bluecoats drum corps 2007 pit.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps|Bluecoats]] pit used thematic vocal amplification in their 2007 performance, \"Criminal.\"]]\n\nThe [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] section consists of two subsections: the [[front ensemble]] (also known as \"pit\") and the [[Marching percussion|battery]] (also known as the \"drumline\").\n\nFront ensemble members perform on [[orchestral percussion]], [[electronic instruments]], and a wide variety of other percussion instruments. These can range from auxiliary instruments like a viberaslap or tambourine to taiko drums and hammer dulcimers.  Due to the size of these instruments, the pit typically remains stationary, positioned directly in front of the field and centered on or around the 50 yard line. However, some groups have begun to use the front ensemble in creative ways by moving them around the field or putting them in different locations. A full-size front ensemble features 10&ndash;15 members. \n\nMembers of the batterie perform on [[marching percussion]] instruments, including [[snare drum]]s, [[tenor drum]]s (also known as \"quads\", \"quints\", or \"tenors\"), tonal [[bass drum]]s, and cymbals.  A full-size battery features 7&ndash;10 snare drummers, 3&ndash;6 tenor drummers, 5-6 bass drummers, and sometimes cymbal players, which tends to be 4-6 players in size. Sometimes the battery will feature some musicians changing sections. A group by the name of \"Phantom Regiment\" once put all of their snare drummers on tenor drums for a portion of their show.\n\n== Visual program and other visual arts ==\n\n=== Color guard ===\n{{main|Color guard (flag spinning)}}\n\nIn modern drum corps, the color guard has become a crucial part of each group's visual and thematic program. Standard equipment includes silk flags, non-functioning rifles and sabres, and other objects like bare poles, hoops, balls, windsocks, and custom-made props are sometimes used to create visual effects that enhance the show.\n\nThe primary role of the color guard is to complement the corps' musical program by creating visual interpretations of the music through choreographed dance.  The color guard can also enhance the overall drill design by marching in formations that integrate with the rest of the corps. However, the color guard most often performs as an ensemble that frames the rest of the corps or performs within the drill formations of the corps proper.  Like all other sections of the corps, the guard often features solo work.\n[[File:drumcorps1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.90| A Blue Stars practice.]]\nWhile the rest of the corps generally wears the same uniform for several consecutive seasons, the guard members more often wear spandex uniforms that are custom-made for each corps' theme for a particular season.\n\n=== Drill formations ===\nDrill formations have become very sophisticated in modern corps. Traditional blocks, company fronts, and symmetrical formations &mdash; while still utilized occasionally for impact &mdash; have largely given way to abstract formations and band members running around, dancing, prancing and occasionally playing stabs{{Clarify|date=November 2016}}. Drill writing is meant to keep instrumental sections together, put featured members at the center of attention, and visually reinforce the choreography.\n\n=== Marching technique ===\nAs visual programs have increased in complexity, corps have developed and formalized various movement techniques, the goal of each being the achievement of fluid, consistent movements that allow for precise musical technique at all tempos, step sizes, and directions.  Given that instrument-wielding members most often face toward the audience (for maximum sound projection), marching technique must not affect the rigidity of members' upper torsos. Although most horn players are able to follow this technique, members of the battery must keep their entire bodies facing forward at all times due to the nature of their equipment. This has led to the invention of the \"crab walk\" or oblique, where the legs cross over one another to facilitate sideways motion; the technique is used mostly by battery, but in rare instances by the hornline. Being visually oriented, guard members are not as bound to facing the front sideline, and may face any direction at any time as dictated by choreography.\n\nThe most common backward marching technique requires balancing on one's platform (visually seen as the 'toes' and keeping the heels off the ground), which is especially effective at faster tempos. The reverse the heel&ndash;toe roll step, allowing for heel&ndash;ground contact is another technique used, most often at slower tempos.\nAs an alternative, there are four major groups which utilize a bent leg technique (Santa Clara Vanguard, Madison Scouts, Pacific Crest, and Guardians), in which the feet come off of the ground and move in a bicycle type motion.\n\nMarching technique programs have largely been inspired by [[dance]] technique. Terminology from [[ballet]] is used to describe foot placement and positioning, and members of the color guard and hornline often ''[[jazz run]]'' in order to maintain upper body stability when marching at fast tempos with large step sizes. In addition, choreography has permeated all sections of the contemporary drum corps.\n\n== Season ==\nWhile performances and competitions only occur during the summer, preparation for the next season starts as soon as the last one ends. Corps activity of some sort goes on year-round. Months in advance of next season's first camp, corps begin assembling their staffs, choosing their musical repertoires, writing drill, etc.\n\n=== Camps ===\nFor junior (DCI) corps, the season is a very intense process. Most corps begin having camps on or around [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] weekend and continue having monthly weekend camps throughout the winter. Potential members travel far and wide&mdash;literally from around the world&mdash;to attend the camps of their favorite corps. Membership in the top corps are highly competitive and are generally determined during the first few camps. By spring, the members have been chosen and camps are held more frequently as the beginning of the summer touring season approaches. Most junior corps require their non-local members to secure temporary housing (often with local members or a vacant dormitory) near the corps' rehearsals facilities around [[Memorial Day]] weekend. For most of May and into June (as college and high school classes end), full-day rehearsals are held virtually every day so members can finish learning the music and marching drill of the show. This pre-season \"spring training\" (also commonly referred to as \"everydays\" or \"alldays\") is usually 3&ndash;4 weeks long. It is not uncommon for members to rehearse 10&ndash;14 hours a day, 6&ndash;7 days a week throughout the entire pre-season. In mid to late June, corps leave to begin their summer tours.\n[[File:drumcorps2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.90| A Blue Stars practice.]] \nFor All-Age (formerly Senior) corps the process is not quite as grueling. Since most members have lives outside of drum corps, senior corps rehearse on weekends and occasionally on weekday evenings. Rather than extensive tours, senior corps usually take weekend trips to perform in shows, and make longer trips only to regional championships and finals. Many smaller DCI corps and foreign corps have similar itineraries. Non-competitive corps, such as classic-style corps, alumni corps, or newly aspiring corps might not have a defined season at all. They practice and perform as they deem necessary or possible. Occasionally such corps make exhibition appearances at DCI or DCA shows.\n\n=== Tour and competition ===\n[[File:Santa Clara Vanguard Bus.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]], like that of [[Santa Clara Vanguard Drum and Bugle Corps|Santa Clara Vanguard]], is used to transport members while on tour.  Most corps often rent a public charter bus for their traveling needs.]]\n\n[[File:Carolina Crown Semi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Semi-trailer]]s, such as this one from [[Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps|Carolina Crown]], are used variously as equipment trucks and mobile kitchens for DCI corps.  DCA corps have no realistic need for such equipment and usually make use of smaller trucks such as former [[U-Haul]]s or other moving van type vehicles that do not require a special operator license.]]\n\n[[File:Bluecoats food truck.JPG|thumb|right|Members of the [[Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps|Bluecoats]] eat from their food truck before a performance.]]\n\nWhile on tour, junior corps travel mainly at night after leaving the performance venue. Members sleep on the buses and in sleeping bags on gym floors when the next housing destination is reached. Housing for the entire tour is secured in advance through local schools, churches, or other community facilities. Corps practice their shows for as long as possible each day before getting ready to leave for that night's competition, if scheduled. Not every day is a performance day; many days on tour are spent simply traveling to a distant location or entirely on the practice field.\n\nA full-sized, adequately funded junior corps will have a fleet of vehicles, including three or more coach buses for members and staff, a truck or van to carry souvenirs that are sold at shows, and two semi trucks, one for show equipment and one that serves as a kitchen on wheels. Most meals for all members and staff are provided by the cook truck, but occasionally corps have scheduled free days where there are no rehearsals or performances and the members are free to see some local sights and procure their own meals.\n\nCompetitions are not the only performances that corps partake in while on tour. Most corps also participate in parades and standstill performances throughout the summer to gain further public exposure and to supplement their budget with performance fees. On the [[Independence Day (US)|Fourth of July]] weekend, corps often locate themselves in large metro areas so they can participate in more than one parade.\n\nCompetitions are usually held at college or high school football stadiums or similar venues, and are scored by circuit-approved judges. Most circuits follow the three-caption system of General Effect (GE), Visual, and Music, with GE carrying the most weight. This is the scoring system currently used by DCI (others are similar):\n\n{| clear=\"both\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|+ style=\"margin-bottom: 0.25em;\" | '''Total possible score: 100'''\n\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Adjudicators freed to judge 'more like an audience member' in updated system|url=http://www.dci.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=33500&ATCLID=209936977|website=dci.org|publisher=Drum Corps International|accessdate=12 June 2015|format=Web|date=10 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n<ref>{{cite web|title=New judging system ready to debut June 16|url=http://www.dci.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=33500&ATCLID=209937964&SPID=166025&SPSID=965782|website=dci.org|publisher=Drum Corps International|accessdate=12 June 2015|format=Web|date=6 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n|- style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | General Effect\n! 40\n! style=\"text-align: left; border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Visual\n! 30\n! style=\"text-align: left; border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Music\n! 30\n|-\n| General Effect Visual || 20 \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Visual Proficiency || 20 \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Music Brass || 20\n|-\n| General Effect Music || 20 \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Visual Analysis || 20 \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Music Analysis || 20\n|-\n| || \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Color guard  || 20 \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Music Percussion || 20\n|-\n| || \n| | Each 20-point sub caption \nis divided by two \n| || Each 20-point sub caption \nis divided by two \n|\n|}\n\nThe timing and organization of contests varies significantly from circuit to circuit. Only large DCI corps typically have the funding and time commitment from members to participate in DCI's touring circuit, where corps spend the majority of the summer traveling around the continent performing at different local and regional contests. In other circuits, and for smaller DCI corps, competitions are usually scheduled to allow corps to travel, perform, and return home within a weekend. For this reason, and to boost audience attendance, large competitions are more frequently scheduled on weekends.\n\nA typical regular-season contest consists of fewer than 10 corps, with corps from one or more classes competing together but scored separately. In North America, DCI and DCA corps occasionally perform at the same shows. DCI also schedules larger contests interspersed throughout the latter half of its season. These are restricted to corps in specific classes and feature many (if not all) of the corps within each class. European circuits, such as DCUK, operate on a \"minimum performance and lot\" system: appearance at the first two shows of the year is determined by lot, and then the corps must appear in a minimum number of shows before the circuit's championships. In such a system, the championships are often the only time all corps in a class compete together.\n\nSome circuits also organize optional individual and ensemble (I&E) competitions for individuals or groups from corps to showcase members' skills outside the field performance environment. These are usually held only once or twice per season at championships or a major regional contest. Members practice their routine(s) in their scant free time throughout the season.\n\n== Corps organization ==\nMost corps are operated as or by dedicated non-profit organizations; very few are associated with schools or for-profit entities. Some corps are even parts of larger non-profit performance arts organizations, which might also include theater groups, [[winter guard]]s, [[winter drumline]]s, and other various musical or visual activities. In Europe, many are also registered charities, assisting with their fundraising aims.\n\n=== Staff ===\nDespite their non-profit status, a well-run corps is just like a well-run business.  It requires many people to handle fiscal and operational responsibilities. There are four levels of staff operating a drum corps: '''Executive Management''', '''Executive Staff''', '''Instructional''', and '''Volunteer'''. Each plays an essential role in creating a well-run corps.\n\nThe '''executive management''' consists of the Board of Directors and the Executive Director. Often the board are unpaid volunteers. This group is almost always long-standing within successful corps. They create the long-term vision and strategy for the organization, handling the financial, operational, and organizational issues to keep the corps running. The board of directors may be composed of alumni and other closely affiliated people. They hire the Executive (operational) Director who is responsible for hiring the executive staff, the instructional staff, and recruiting volunteers.\n\nThe '''executive staff''' usually includes the operational office staff, the program director(s) and tour director(s) who run the day-to-day operational needs of the organization.\n\nThe '''instructional staff''' puts the show on the field. They create the concept of the show, choose and arrange the music, write the drill, and instruct the members on how to play, march, execute, and exude the image of the corps on the field. The staff consists of brass, percussion, guard, and visual (marching) instructors who are most often alumni of the corps or other corps. A well-funded World Class corps usually has 15-20 full-time instructors. Just as members, they attend winter camps and travel with the corps all summer long.\n\n'''Volunteers''' are the lifeblood of any corps. Parents, alumni, friends, and fans make the corps work on a day-to-day basis&mdash;driving buses and trucks, caring for the corps' uniforms, cooking meals for the corps and staff, and countless other peripheral duties. Corps on touring circuits particularly rely on volunteers due to the extra necessities which come with the tour: cooking and cleaning, providing mechanical maintenance, health and medical needs.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Drum Corps International|Drum Corps International (DCI)]]\n* [[Drum Corps Associates|Drum Corps Associates (DCA)]]\n* [[Drum Corps United Kingdom]]\n* [[Drum Corps Europe]]\n* [[Drum Corps Asia]]\n* [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)]]\n* [[DCI Division I World Champions]]\n* [[List of DCI drum corps]]\n* [[Marching arts|Marching Arts]]\n* [[Marching band|Marching Band]]\n* [[Marching percussion]]\n* [[Winter Guard International|Winter Guard International (WGI)]]\n* [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.halftimemag.com/ Halftime Magazine, \"the sights sounds and spirit of the marching arts\"]\n*[http://www.dcacorps.org/ Drum Corps Associates]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20181014053047/http://www.drumcorps.nl/ Drum Corps Europe]\n*[http://www.drumcorpsasia.org/ Drum Corps Asia]\n*[http://www.drumcorpsfrance.fr/ Drum Corps France]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060109014211/http://www.drumcorps-germany.de/ Drum Corps Germany]\n*[http://www.dci.org/ Drum Corps International]\n*[http://www.dcjpn.org/ Drum Corps Japan]\n*[http://www.drumcorpsnederland.nl/ Drum Corps Nederland]\n*[http://www.dcuk.org.uk/ Drum Corps United Kingdom]\n*[http://www.byba.org.uk/ British Youth Band Association]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070504090022/http://www.drumcorpsmusic.org/ Drum Corps Music]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110423113844/http://www.corpsconnect.com/ Corps Connect, \"resources for drum corps fans everywhere\"]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070820162739/http://www.marchingtvchannel.com/ Marching TV Channel web site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142553/http://members.fortunecity.co.uk/dlcapi/ Drum and Lyre Corps Association of the Philippines Incorporated]\n*[http://www.fieldband.org.za/ Field Band Foundation (South Africa)]\n*[http://www.wamsb.org/ World Association of Marching Show Bands]\n*[http://www.middlehornleader.com/ The Middle Horn Leader]\n*[http://www.gregorymkuzma.com/ \"On the field, from Denver, Colorado...The Blue Knights!\"]\n*[http://www.drumcorpshistoricalsociety.org/ Drum Corps Historical Society (DCHS)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drum And Bugle Corps (Modern)}}\n[[Category:Types of musical groups]]\n[[Category:Child musical groups]]\n[[Category:Drum and bugle corps]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the Military unit|Corps of Drums}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=September 2010}}\n{{fanpov|date=September 2010}}\n{{external links|date=February 2019}}\n}}\nA modern '''drum and bugle corps''' is a musical marching unit of 150+ members, consisting of [[brass instrument]]s, [[percussion instrument]]s, [[synthesizers]], [[Color guard (flag spinning)|color guard]], and choreographic movements.

Beginning after [[World War I]] through the 1970s, corps and competitions were often sponsored by the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars|VFW]], [[Scout troop]]s, churches, the [[Royal Canadian Legion]], and the [[American Legion]]. Owing to many of these groups' roots, corps were traditionally militaristic. By the late 1960s, many corps wanted more creative freedom and better financial compensation than was offered by their sponsoring organizations. Some felt the prize-money structures, based on competitive placement, were not fairly compensating all corps for their appearances. Additionally, some felt the current judging rules were stifling musical and theatrical possibilities. At the peak of North American drum corps participation (with perhaps a thousand active corps in the U.S. and nearly as many in Canada), several corps decided to \"unionize\", as stated by Don Warren (founder of the [[The Cavaliers Drum and Bugle Corps|Cavaliers]]). They formed their own organizations, which ultimately led to the formation of [[Drum Corps Associates|DCA]] in 1965 and [[Drum Corps International|DCI]] in 1972. By this time, many corps had already lost their church or community sponsors.\n\nFor the corps that remained, longer travel times were necessary to attend the shrinking numbers of contests, further adding to the financial and time demands on the organizations and their individual members. At the same time costs for the increasingly complex field shows mounted and creative and instructional demands rose leading many competitive corps to falter and become inactive. By the late 1990s only a fraction of the corps that existed in the 60s and 70s remained, although several new corps, some of which have become very successful, did start up along the way.\n\nNon-competitive classic-style corps (often and sometimes inaccurately known as \"alumni corps\") saw a renaissance beginning in the mid-1980s and they continue to organize in the 21st Century; members often remain vigilant about the traditions and virtues of the drum corps activity before the advent of electronic technology, band instruments, dancing and singing.\n\nFreed from the traditional and more-restrictive judging rules of the late 1960s, corps began making innovative changes such as the use of Bb brass instruments (late 1990's early 2000's), wide-ranging tempos, intricate asymmetric drill formations, elaborate guard costumes and props, and the use of stationary orchestral percussion instruments. A common criticism of drum corps is that it has become too similar to [[marching band]], but although the two activities are very similar they are still clearly distinct. A few corps still utilize the traditional G [[Bugle]] which is very rarely found in DCI marching units. The competitive season for drum corps is in the summer rather than fall, with auditions and initial ensemble rehearsals beginning as early as late October of the previous year.

In 2014, the DCI Board of Directors passed a rule change that changed their definition of a bugle to allow the entire brass family, including trombones and concert French horns.<ref>{{cite web|title='Rules Congress' returns to DCI\u2019s annual business meetings|url=http://www.dci.org/news/view.cfm?news_id=6d00148c-fd0f-4cb5-9164-6f33f9996d09|website=dci.org|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\"\n|+ Instrument names\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Key of G\n! scope=\"col\" | Key of B{{music|b}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Key of F\n|-\n| Soprano/Flugelhorn\n| [[Trumpet]]/[[Flugelhorn]]\n|\n|-\n| [[Mellophone]] in G\n| Marching [[French Horn]]\n| Mellophone in F/French Horn\n|-\n| Baritone/Euphonium in G\n| Baritone/Euphonium\n|\n|-\n| Contrabass\n| [[Tuba]]\n|\n|}\n\n*tuba and baritone/euphonium are pitched in Bb(BBb) and are written in C (CC).\n\n==== Percussion ====\n{{main|Marching percussion}}\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Phantom 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Phantom Regiment]] continually wins best percussion in the DCI World Championships.]] -->\n\n[[File:Bluecoats drum corps 2007 pit.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps|Bluecoats]] pit used thematic vocal amplification in their 2007 performance, \"Criminal.\"]]\n\nThe [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] section consists of two subsections: the [[front ensemble]] (also known as \"pit\") and the [[Marching percussion|battery]] (also known as the \"drumline\").\n\nFront ensemble members perform on [[orchestral percussion]], [[electronic instruments]], and a wide variety of other percussion instruments. These can range from auxiliary instruments like a viberaslap or tambourine to taiko drums and hammer dulcimers.  Due to the size of these instruments, the pit typically remains stationary, positioned directly in front of the field and centered on or around the 50 yard line. However, some groups have begun to use the front ensemble in creative ways by moving them around the field or putting them in different locations. A full-size front ensemble features 10&ndash;15 members. \n\nMembers of the batterie perform on [[marching percussion]] instruments, including [[snare drum]]s, [[tenor drum]]s (also known as \"quads\", \"quints\", or \"tenors\"), tonal [[bass drum]]s, and cymbals.  A full-size battery features 7&ndash;10 snare drummers, 3&ndash;6 tenor drummers, 5-6 bass drummers, and sometimes cymbal players, which tends to be 4-6 players in size. Sometimes the battery will feature some musicians changing sections. A group by the name of \"Phantom Regiment\" once put all of their snare drummers on tenor drums for a portion of their show.\n\n== Visual program and other visual arts ==\n\n=== Color guard ===\n{{main|Color guard (flag spinning)}}\n\nIn modern drum corps, the color guard has become a crucial part of each group's visual and thematic program. Standard equipment includes silk flags, non-functioning rifles and sabres, and other objects like bare poles, hoops, balls, windsocks, and custom-made props are sometimes used to create visual effects that enhance the show.\n\nThe primary role of the color guard is to complement the corps' musical program by creating visual interpretations of the music through choreographed dance.  The color guard can also enhance the overall drill design by marching in formations that integrate with the rest of the corps. However, the color guard most often performs as an ensemble that frames the rest of the corps or performs within the drill formations of the corps proper.  Like all other sections of the corps, the guard often features solo work.\n[[File:drumcorps1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.90| A Blue Stars practice.]]\nWhile the rest of the corps generally wears the same uniform for several consecutive seasons, the guard members more often wear spandex uniforms that are custom-made for each corps' theme for a particular season.\n\n=== Drill formations ===\nDrill formations have become very sophisticated in modern corps. Traditional blocks, company fronts, and symmetrical formations &mdash; while still utilized occasionally for impact &mdash; have largely given way to abstract formations and band members running around, dancing, prancing and occasionally playing stabs{{Clarify|date=November 2016}}. Drill writing is meant to keep instrumental sections together, put featured members at the center of attention, and visually reinforce the choreography.\n\n=== Marching technique ===\nAs visual programs have increased in complexity, corps have developed and formalized various movement techniques, the goal of each being the achievement of fluid, consistent movements that allow for precise musical technique at all tempos, step sizes, and directions.  Given that instrument-wielding members most often face toward the audience (for maximum sound projection), marching technique must not affect the rigidity of members' upper torsos. Although most horn players are able to follow this technique, members of the battery must keep their entire bodies facing forward at all times due to the nature of their equipment. This has led to the invention of the \"crab walk\" or oblique, where the legs cross over one another to facilitate sideways motion; the technique is used mostly by battery, but in rare instances by the hornline. Being visually oriented, guard members are not as bound to facing the front sideline, and may face any direction at any time as dictated by choreography.\n\nThe most common backward marching technique requires balancing on one's platform (visually seen as the 'toes' and keeping the heels off the ground), which is especially effective at faster tempos. The reverse the heel&ndash;toe roll step, allowing for heel&ndash;ground contact is another technique used, most often at slower tempos.\nAs an alternative, there are four major groups which utilize a bent leg technique (Santa Clara Vanguard, Madison Scouts, Pacific Crest, and Guardians), in which the feet come off of the ground and move in a bicycle type motion.\n\nMarching technique programs have largely been inspired by [[dance]] technique. Terminology from [[ballet]] is used to describe foot placement and positioning, and members of the color guard and hornline often ''[[jazz run]]'' in order to maintain upper body stability when marching at fast tempos with large step sizes. In addition, choreography has permeated all sections of the contemporary drum corps.\n\n== Season ==\nWhile performances and competitions only occur during the summer, preparation for the next season starts as soon as the last one ends. Corps activity of some sort goes on year-round. Months in advance of next season's first camp, corps begin assembling their staffs, choosing their musical repertoires, writing drill, etc.\n\n=== Camps ===\nFor junior (DCI) corps, the season is a very intense process. Most corps begin having camps on or around [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] weekend and continue having monthly weekend camps throughout the winter. Potential members travel far and wide&mdash;literally from around the world&mdash;to attend the camps of their favorite corps. Membership in the top corps are highly competitive and are generally determined during the first few camps. By spring, the members have been chosen and camps are held more frequently as the beginning of the summer touring season approaches. Most junior corps require their non-local members to secure temporary housing (often with local members or a vacant dormitory) near the corps' rehearsals facilities around [[Memorial Day]] weekend. For most of May and into June (as college and high school classes end), full-day rehearsals are held virtually every day so members can finish learning the music and marching drill of the show. This pre-season \"spring training\" (also commonly referred to as \"everydays\" or \"alldays\") is usually 3&ndash;4 weeks long. It is not uncommon for members to rehearse 10&ndash;14 hours a day, 6&ndash;7 days a week throughout the entire pre-season. In mid to late June, corps leave to begin their summer tours.\n[[File:drumcorps2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.90| A Blue Stars practice.]] \nFor All-Age (formerly Senior) corps the process is not quite as grueling. Since most members have lives outside of drum corps, senior corps rehearse on weekends and occasionally on weekday evenings. Rather than extensive tours, senior corps usually take weekend trips to perform in shows, and make longer trips only to regional championships and finals. Many smaller DCI corps and foreign corps have similar itineraries. Non-competitive corps, such as classic-style corps, alumni corps, or newly aspiring corps might not have a defined season at all. They practice and perform as they deem necessary or possible. Occasionally such corps make exhibition appearances at DCI or DCA shows.\n\n=== Tour and competition ===\n[[File:Santa Clara Vanguard Bus.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]], like that of [[Santa Clara Vanguard Drum and Bugle Corps|Santa Clara Vanguard]], is used to transport members while on tour.  Most corps often rent a public charter bus for their traveling needs.]]\n\n[[File:Carolina Crown Semi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Semi-trailer]]s, such as this one from [[Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps|Carolina Crown]], are used variously as equipment trucks and mobile kitchens for DCI corps.  DCA corps have no realistic need for such equipment and usually make use of smaller trucks such as former [[U-Haul]]s or other moving van type vehicles that do not require a special operator license.]]\n\n[[File:Bluecoats food truck.JPG|thumb|right|Members of the [[Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps|Bluecoats]] eat from their food truck before a performance.]]\n\nWhile on tour, junior corps travel mainly at night after leaving the performance venue. Members sleep on the buses and in sleeping bags on gym floors when the next housing destination is reached. Housing for the entire tour is secured in advance through local schools, churches, or other community facilities. Corps practice their shows for as long as possible each day before getting ready to leave for that night's competition, if scheduled. Not every day is a performance day; many days on tour are spent simply traveling to a distant location or entirely on the practice field.\n\nA full-sized, adequately funded junior corps will have a fleet of vehicles, including three or more coach buses for members and staff, a truck or van to carry souvenirs that are sold at shows, and two semi trucks, one for show equipment and one that serves as a kitchen on wheels. Most meals for all members and staff are provided by the cook truck, but occasionally corps have scheduled free days where there are no rehearsals or performances and the members are free to see some local sights and procure their own meals.\n\nCompetitions are not the only performances that corps partake in while on tour. Most corps also participate in parades and standstill performances throughout the summer to gain further public exposure and to supplement their budget with performance fees. On the [[Independence Day (US)|Fourth of July]] weekend, corps often locate themselves in large metro areas so they can participate in more than one parade.\n\nCompetitions are usually held at college or high school football stadiums or similar venues, and are scored by circuit-approved judges. Most circuits follow the three-caption system of General Effect (GE), Visual, and Music, with GE carrying the most weight. This is the scoring system currently used by DCI (others are similar):\n\n{| clear=\"both\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border: 1px solid #aaa; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|+ style=\"margin-bottom: 0.25em;\" | '''Total possible score: 100'''\n\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Adjudicators freed to judge 'more like an audience member' in updated system|url=http://www.dci.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=33500&ATCLID=209936977|website=dci.org|publisher=Drum Corps International|accessdate=12 June 2015|format=Web|date=10 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n<ref>{{cite web|title=New judging system ready to debut June 16|url=http://www.dci.org/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=33500&ATCLID=209937964&SPID=166025&SPSID=965782|website=dci.org|publisher=Drum Corps International|accessdate=12 June 2015|format=Web|date=6 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n|- style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;\"\n! style=\"text-align: left;\" | General Effect\n! 40\n! style=\"text-align: left; border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Visual\n! 30\n! style=\"text-align: left; border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Music\n! 30\n|-\n| General Effect Visual || 20 \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Visual Proficiency || 20 \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Music Brass || 20\n|-\n| General Effect Music || 20 \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Visual Analysis || 20 \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Music Analysis || 20\n|-\n| || \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Color guard  || 20 \n| style=\"border-left: 1px solid #aaa;\" | Music Percussion || 20\n|-\n| || \n| | Each 20-point sub caption \nis divided by two \n| || Each 20-point sub caption \nis divided by two \n|\n|}\n\nThe timing and organization of contests varies significantly from circuit to circuit. Only large DCI corps typically have the funding and time commitment from members to participate in DCI's touring circuit, where corps spend the majority of the summer traveling around the continent performing at different local and regional contests. In other circuits, and for smaller DCI corps, competitions are usually scheduled to allow corps to travel, perform, and return home within a weekend. For this reason, and to boost audience attendance, large competitions are more frequently scheduled on weekends.\n\nA typical regular-season contest consists of fewer than 10 corps, with corps from one or more classes competing together but scored separately. In North America, DCI and DCA corps occasionally perform at the same shows. DCI also schedules larger contests interspersed throughout the latter half of its season. These are restricted to corps in specific classes and feature many (if not all) of the corps within each class. European circuits, such as DCUK, operate on a \"minimum performance and lot\" system: appearance at the first two shows of the year is determined by lot, and then the corps must appear in a minimum number of shows before the circuit's championships. In such a system, the championships are often the only time all corps in a class compete together.\n\nSome circuits also organize optional individual and ensemble (I&E) competitions for individuals or groups from corps to showcase members' skills outside the field performance environment. These are usually held only once or twice per season at championships or a major regional contest. Members practice their routine(s) in their scant free time throughout the season.\n\n== Corps organization ==\nMost corps are operated as or by dedicated non-profit organizations; very few are associated with schools or for-profit entities. Some corps are even parts of larger non-profit performance arts organizations, which might also include theater groups, [[winter guard]]s, [[winter drumline]]s, and other various musical or visual activities. In Europe, many are also registered charities, assisting with their fundraising aims.\n\n=== Staff ===\nDespite their non-profit status, a well-run corps is just like a well-run business.  It requires many people to handle fiscal and operational responsibilities. There are four levels of staff operating a drum corps: '''Executive Management''', '''Executive Staff''', '''Instructional''', and '''Volunteer'''. Each plays an essential role in creating a well-run corps.\n\nThe '''executive management''' consists of the Board of Directors and the Executive Director. Often the board are unpaid volunteers. This group is almost always long-standing within successful corps. They create the long-term vision and strategy for the organization, handling the financial, operational, and organizational issues to keep the corps running. The board of directors may be composed of alumni and other closely affiliated people. They hire the Executive (operational) Director who is responsible for hiring the executive staff, the instructional staff, and recruiting volunteers.\n\nThe '''executive staff''' usually includes the operational office staff, the program director(s) and tour director(s) who run the day-to-day operational needs of the organization.\n\nThe '''instructional staff''' puts the show on the field. They create the concept of the show, choose and arrange the music, write the drill, and instruct the members on how to play, march, execute, and exude the image of the corps on the field. The staff consists of brass, percussion, guard, and visual (marching) instructors who are most often alumni of the corps or other corps. A well-funded World Class corps usually has 15-20 full-time instructors. Just as members, they attend winter camps and travel with the corps all summer long.\n\n'''Volunteers''' are the lifeblood of any corps. Parents, alumni, friends, and fans make the corps work on a day-to-day basis&mdash;driving buses and trucks, caring for the corps' uniforms, cooking meals for the corps and staff, and countless other peripheral duties. Corps on touring circuits particularly rely on volunteers due to the extra necessities which come with the tour: cooking and cleaning, providing mechanical maintenance, health and medical needs.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Drum Corps International|Drum Corps International (DCI)]]\n* [[Drum Corps Associates|Drum Corps Associates (DCA)]]\n* [[Drum Corps United Kingdom]]\n* [[Drum Corps Europe]]\n* [[Drum Corps Asia]]\n* [[Drum and bugle corps (classic)]]\n* [[DCI Division I World Champions]]\n* [[List of DCI drum corps]]\n* [[Marching arts|Marching Arts]]\n* [[Marching band|Marching Band]]\n* [[Marching percussion]]\n* [[Winter Guard International|Winter Guard International (WGI)]]\n* [[United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.halftimemag.com/ Halftime Magazine, \"the sights sounds and spirit of the marching arts\"]\n*[http://www.dcacorps.org/ Drum Corps Associates]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20181014053047/http://www.drumcorps.nl/ Drum Corps Europe]\n*[http://www.drumcorpsasia.org/ Drum Corps Asia]\n*[http://www.drumcorpsfrance.fr/ Drum Corps France]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060109014211/http://www.drumcorps-germany.de/ Drum Corps Germany]\n*[http://www.dci.org/ Drum Corps International]\n*[http://www.dcjpn.org/ Drum Corps Japan]\n*[http://www.drumcorpsnederland.nl/ Drum Corps Nederland]\n*[http://www.dcuk.org.uk/ Drum Corps United Kingdom]\n*[http://www.byba.org.uk/ British Youth Band Association]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070504090022/http://www.drumcorpsmusic.org/ Drum Corps Music]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110423113844/http://www.corpsconnect.com/ Corps Connect, \"resources for drum corps fans everywhere\"]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070820162739/http://www.marchingtvchannel.com/ Marching TV Channel web site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142553/http://members.fortunecity.co.uk/dlcapi/ Drum and Lyre Corps Association of the Philippines Incorporated]\n*[http://www.fieldband.org.za/ Field Band Foundation (South Africa)]\n*[http://www.wamsb.org/ World Association of Marching Show Bands]\n*[http://www.middlehornleader.com/ The Middle Horn Leader]\n*[http://www.gregorymkuzma.com/ \"On the field, from Denver, Colorado...The Blue Knights!\"]\n*[http://www.drumcorpshistoricalsociety.org/ Drum Corps Historical Society (DCHS)]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drum And Bugle Corps (Modern)}}\n[[Category:Types of musical groups]]\n[[Category:Child musical groups]]\n[[Category:Drum and bugle corps]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bugle_corps_(modern)"}

It was written by Powter and produced by [[Jeff Dawson]] and [[Mitchell Froom]]. Powter and Dawson recorded the song in 2002, but were initially unable to find a record label to release it. The song was first used in a French [[Coca-Cola]] television advertisement in Christmas 2004 before its official release. Tom Whalley, [[Warner Bros. Records]]' chairman and CEO, offered Powter a contract after hearing a demo tape of it. This track ended up being released as the aforementioned album's [[lead single]] in Europe in early 2005.\n\nThe song was received with a generally mixed reception from critics. While some praised its lyrics for their \"universal appeal\", others felt the lyrics were too broad. Despite this, it was a commercial success. In 2005, the single charted in the top five in more than ten countries worldwide and became the most played song on European radio. After its European success, it was released in the United States where it topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], [[Pop 100]], [[Adult Top 40]], and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, and under Billboard's first modern year end chart, it became the first song to top the list in terms of popularity. In 2006, it became the first song ever to sell two million digital copies in the United States. After another million were sold, it was [[List of music recording certifications|certified]] three-times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2009. It was certified platinum in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, gold in Denmark and Germany, and also received a certification in France and Japan.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Bad Day\" was directed by [[Marc Webb]] and reached 9.8 million views in 2006. The video depicts two downcast people sharing a similar routine until they meet each other at the end of the video. The song was used for advertisements and television programs, most prominently as ''[[American Idol]]''{{'}}s elimination song. Different shows and artists covered and parodied \"Bad Day\", including ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]].

It was written by Powter and produced by [[Jeff Dawson]] and [[Mitchell Froom]]. Powter and Dawson recorded the song in 2002, but were initially unable to find a record label to release it. The song was first used in a French [[Coca-Cola]] television advertisement in Christmas 2004 before its official release. Tom Whalley, [[Warner Bros. Records]]' chairman and CEO, offered Powter a contract after hearing a demo tape of it. This track ended up being released as the aforementioned album's [[lead single]] in Europe in early 2005.\n\nThe song was received with a generally mixed reception from critics. While some praised its lyrics for their \"universal appeal\", others felt the lyrics were too broad. Despite this, it was a commercial success. In 2005, the single charted in the top five in more than ten countries worldwide and became the most played song on European radio. After its European success, it was released in the United States where it topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], [[Pop 100]], [[Adult Top 40]], and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, and under Billboard's first modern year end chart, it became the first song to top the list in terms of popularity. In 2006, it became the first song ever to sell two million digital copies in the United States. After another million were sold, it was [[List of music recording certifications|certified]] three-times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 2009. It was certified platinum in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, gold in Denmark and Germany, and also received a certification in France and Japan.\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Bad Day\" was directed by [[Marc Webb]] and reached 9.8 million views in 2006. The video depicts two downcast people sharing a similar routine until they meet each other at the end of the video. The song was used for advertisements and television programs, most prominently as ''[[American Idol]]''{{'}}s elimination song. Different shows and artists covered and parodied \"Bad Day\", including ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]]. Powter has also performed the song on television shows including ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', and during his concert tours in North America and Europe. The song's success made it Powter's \"anthem\" and would be included on his later compilation albums ''B-Sides'' (2007) and ''Best of Me'' (2010).\n\n== Background and release ==\nAfter leaving [[MacEwan University]] in [[Edmonton]] at 20, Powter moved to [[Vancouver]], British Columbia where he played keyboards before he started composing songs.<ref name=su/><ref name=fls>{{cite journal | title=Daniel Powter almost gave up on music | date=April 24, 2006 | author=Farber, Jim | journal=[[The Free Lance\u2013Star]] | publisher=Sandton Capital Partners | accessdate=January 21, 2016 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=20060424&id=OIw1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=qggGAAAAIBAJ&pg=6877,7635900}}</ref> In 1997, he partnered with music producer [[Jeff Dawson]]; they recorded \"Bad Day\" in 2002.<ref name=su/> For two weeks,<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1529020/bad-day-singer-powter-says-he-doesnt-watch-american-idol/ |title='Bad Day' Singer Powter Says He Doesn't Watch 'American Idol' |author=Moss, Corey |date=April 19, 2006 |publisher=[[MTV News]].

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2018. This was the last season with current, and longest running host, [[Art Rooijakkers]]. The season took place in [[Georgia (Country)|Georgia]], the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union State]]. The season premiered on January 6, 2018. The Live Finale aired on March 10, 2018 from the [[Vondelpark|VondelCS pavilion]]. During the Finale, Ruben Hein was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac17,750.-. Hein had successfully unmasked [[Jan Versteegh]] as the Mole of 2018, outwitting his fellow finalist, [[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]].\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe season began with the candidates unknowingly split across 5 different countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine) for the first assignment to discover where the host country of the season will be, Georgia. This season also had a candidate quit in the season for the upkeep of their mental health; a series' first compared to previous medical evacuations and withdrawals. The season also changed the unmasking of the Mole. Where after the final test had been written, the finalists were informed that they would find out who the Mole is along with the rest of the Netherlands at the Live Finale. Typically the finalists would be informed of the Mole immediately after the final test and the secret would remain until the unmasking during the Live Finale broadcast.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Jan Versteegh]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Ruben Hein|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Simone Weimans|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Stine Jensen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 13\n|4th place\n|-\n|[[Loes Haverkort]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Emilio Guzman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 7\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Bella Hay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[Jean-Marc van Tol]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|Quit\n|-\n|{{ill|Ron Boszhard|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 1\n|8th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

Meanwhile, the Brave team went tandem paragliding off one of the nearby mountains. Once they are up in the air, the Brave team may listen to their podcasts to answer the Organized team's questions until they touchdown. Each correct answer out of the 40 questions earned \u20ac100 for the pot.\n\nThe teams managed to answer 18 questions correctly, earning \u20ac1,800 for the pot.\n\n===Episode 4 - Vooruitzicht===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 4 - Vooruitzicht\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 27/01/2018<br>Locations: [[Stepantsminda|Stepantsminda, Georgia]] \u2192 [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \n|-\n!

The remaining four candidates were dropped off in Tbilisi and instructed to find where the three missing candidates were hidden underground. The Underground candidates have no idea where they have been hidden, but hold the information in which the Searchers could use to find them. The underground candidates were hidden in a tunnel maze, where throughout the tunnels they could find simple instructions and photographs of where the Searchers had to go in order to receive new instructions. The Underground candidate's phone could only receive signal at a small opening far from the instructions board in the maze. With a phone in hand, the Searchers have 45 minutes to find the Underground candidates to earn \u20ac1,500 for the pot.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Niets is Wat Het Lijkt (Nothing is What It Seems)'''\nThe day of the assignment was Georgia's independence day from the Soviet Union. The candidates were taken to the 9 April Park, for a private interrogation with Art. Between Art and the candidate stood a table with a series of flowchart questions. Before Art begins the interrogation, he informs each of the candidates that they could earn an Exemption for the Finale if they do well in this assignment. The interrogation begins with Art asking if the candidates want to know who the Mole already, with the candidate having to answer yes or no. They proceed through the flowchart answering Art's questions about their personal tactics and potential dilemmas until they reach the bottom of the table, with a final question between \u20ac5,000 for the pot, or a group exemption.\n\nAt the end of the assignment, Art informed the candidates that if they had paid enough attention, they would have noticed that they were visited by the Mole during their interrogations in the park. Essentially being the exemption to the Finale that Art mentioned at the beginning of the assignment.\n\n'''Rode Draad (Red Wire) - Max. \u20ac5,000.-'''\nThe candidates were taken to the old Soviet District in Tbilisi, a lower-class district with Soviet era accommodations. On top of one of these buildings, the candidates had to zipline between two buildings. With the questions from yesterday noted by Art, the candidates had a choice of earning \u20ac5,000 or a group exemption in this assignment. The choice that the majority had chosen would be inside one of the envelopes Art gives the candidates. The objective of the assignment was for the candidates to transport envelopes across the zipline, earning whatever they managed to bring to Art. Each candidate were allowed to take only one out of the seven envelopes while they ziplined. Ruben panicked and refused to do the zipline, which led to Stine also deciding to not complete the assignment.\n\nOnly five of the candidates completed the zipline, with Art informing the candidates afterwards that they had been competing for \u20ac5,000. After opening all the envelopes, the candidates had successfully brought the \u20ac5,000 envelope to Art, and was added to the pot.\n\n===Episode 5 - Zienswijzen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 5 - Zienswijzen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 03/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \n|-\n!

To prevent a candidate from seeing their screen, and earning money for the pot, both boards had to have matching green screens showing. Art presents a series of questions to the candidates, if they are correct, the candidate can turn a red screen green, or opt out from turning a green screen red. The candidates were divided into two teams: three designated to the red board, two assigned the green board.\n\nThe candidates chose to prevent their results from being shown, except for Simone. Nothing was added to the pot. Simone saw a Green screen for her results, even with a Black Exemption nullifying her Jokers, and everyone proceeded to the next episode.\n\n===Episode 7 - Schijn Werper===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 7 - Schijn Werper\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 17/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tsqaltubo|Tskaltubo, Georgia]] \u2192 [[Kutaisi|Kutaisi, Georgia]] \u2192 [[Borjomi|Borjomi, Georgia]]\n|-\n!

Two longer, diverting routes would lead the finalists to \u20ac2,500.- that they could add to the pot, or to see the Mole at the end of the longest route.

During the reunion after the unmasking, the executed candidates revealed that it was Olcay who misled them into thinking Ruben was the Mole. Meanwhile, Ruben only started to catch onto Jan as the Mole when Loes and Stine, his two main suspects were executed one after the other. In the Final Test, Olcay answered her test thinking Ruben was the Mole, and ultimately had no chance in beating Ruben. During the Final Test, Olcay skipped past the Money and Mole route, as she got lost and took too much time getting to the test. While both Jan and Ruben grabbed the extra \u20ac2,500.-.

(Dutch TV series)|''Wie is de Mol?'']] (\"Who is the Mole?\") aired in the winter of 2018. This was the last season with current, and longest running host, [[Art Rooijakkers]]. The season took place in [[Georgia (Country)|Georgia]], the former [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union State]]. The season premiered on January 6, 2018. The Live Finale aired on March 10, 2018 from the [[Vondelpark|VondelCS pavilion]]. During the Finale, Ruben Hein was declared the winner of the season, earning a grand total of \u20ac17,750.-. Hein had successfully unmasked [[Jan Versteegh]] as the Mole of 2018, outwitting his fellow finalist, [[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]].\n\n==Format==\nFollowed the same format as its [[De Mol (TV series)|Belgian predecessor]], the season had ten Dutch celebrities travel to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to complete Assignments to earn money for the group pot. However, one of the ten is the titular Mole (de Mol), the one designated to sabotage the assignments and cause the group to earn the least amount of money for the winner's pot as possible. Every few days, players would take a 20-question [[multiple choice]] test about the identity of the Mole. Once the test is complete, the candidates await their results in an Execution ceremony. The candidate with the worst score is executed from the game, while in the event of the tie the candidate who completed their test the slowest is executed. The season plays out until there are three remaining candidates, where they must complete a final test (consisting of 40 questions). The candidate with the highest score, or had completed their test the fastest in a tie, is declared the winner and receives the group's pot.<ref>{{cite web |title=Info - Wie is de Mol? |url=https://wieisdemol.avrotros.nl/info/ |website=Wie is de Mol |publisher=AVROTROS |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe season began with the candidates unknowingly split across 5 different countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine) for the first assignment to discover where the host country of the season will be, Georgia. This season also had a candidate quit in the season for the upkeep of their mental health; a series' first compared to previous medical evacuations and withdrawals. The season also changed the unmasking of the Mole. Where after the final test had been written, the finalists were informed that they would find out who the Mole is along with the rest of the Netherlands at the Live Finale. Typically the finalists would be informed of the Mole immediately after the final test and the secret would remain until the unmasking during the Live Finale broadcast.\n\n==Candidates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n!Name\n!Day Exited\n!Result\n|-\n|[[Jan Versteegh]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|style=background:lightgray;|'''The Mole'''\n|-\n|{{ill|Ruben Hein|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|'''Winner'''\n|-\n|[[Olcay Gulsen|Olcay G\u00fcl\u015fen]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 18\n|Runner-Up\n|-\n|{{ill|Simone Weimans|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 15\n|3rd place\n|-\n|{{ill|Stine Jensen|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 13\n|4th place\n|-\n|[[Loes Haverkort]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 9\n|5th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Emilio Guzman|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 7\n|6th place\n|-\n|{{ill|Bella Hay|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 5\n|7th place\n|-\n|[[Jean-Marc van Tol]]\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 3\n|Quit\n|-\n|{{ill|Ron Boszhard|nl}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\"| 1\n|8th place\n|}\n\n==Candidates Progress==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n!

Throughout the performance, Art would text clues to the candidates about which box each of the candidates must be in at the end of the play. In the middle of the assignment, Ron, the first candidate executed in the game back in Moscow, texted the group that he was attending the play with them. He held crucial information for the upcoming test, and if any of the candidates were to join him in his box within the next 10 minutes, he would share that knowledge and re-enter the game.\n\nThe candidates, including Ron's starting partner Loes, stopped each other from meeting with Ron, sending him home at the end of the assignment.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment as well, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Opscheppen (Shovel) - Max. \u20ac3,000.-'''\nUsing heavy machinery, the candidates excavate dirt in order to drive a Lada car along a path in a construction yard.

Choosing between five cars, the candidates had to pick between four cars with increasing amounts of money, and a final car with a Doubler. In a staggered start, the candidates had to drive around Stepantsminda without being trapped in by hunters in red cars. If a car is trapped before returning at the end of their 15 minutes, they are out of the assignment and earn nothing for the pot. If the Doubler car survived the assignment, all money earned in the assignment would be doubled.\n\nThree out of the five cars finished the assignment, including the Doubler car. \u20ac900 was added to the pot.\n\n'''Kwestie van Vertrouwen (A Question of Trust) - Max. \u20ac2,500.-'''\nIn the fields by the Gergeti Trinity Church, the candidates were asked to partner with someone they could trust.

Once each duo has looked in their four respective boxes, they meet in the middle of the field with an opposing duo to share information of what they've seen. After the meeting, the duos must then select a box per candidate on the opposing side of the field to retrieve any items available. All candidates have one opportunity to walk across the field during the assignment.\n\n\u20ac1,250 was removed from the pot at the end of the assignment.\n\n'''Molcast ('Molecast') - Max. \u20ac4,000.-'''\nArt arrived at breakfast to collect all the positive and negative money from the group's treasure.

Meanwhile, the Brave team went tandem paragliding off one of the nearby mountains. Once they are up in the air, the Brave team may listen to their podcasts to answer the Organized team's questions until they touchdown.

The remaining four candidates were dropped off in Tbilisi and instructed to find where the three missing candidates were hidden underground. The Underground candidates have no idea where they have been hidden, but hold the information in which the Searchers could use to find them. The underground candidates were hidden in a tunnel maze, where throughout the tunnels they could find simple instructions and photographs of where the Searchers had to go in order to receive new instructions. The Underground candidate's phone could only receive signal at a small opening far from the instructions board in the maze. With a phone in hand, the Searchers have 45 minutes to find the Underground candidates to earn \u20ac1,500 for the pot.\n\nThe candidates failed the assignment, and nothing was earned for the pot.\n\n'''Niets is Wat Het Lijkt (Nothing is What It Seems)'''\nThe day of the assignment was Georgia's independence day from the Soviet Union. The candidates were taken to the 9 April Park, for a private interrogation with Art. Between Art and the candidate stood a table with a series of flowchart questions. Before Art begins the interrogation, he informs each of the candidates that they could earn an Exemption for the Finale if they do well in this assignment. The interrogation begins with Art asking if the candidates want to know who the Mole already, with the candidate having to answer yes or no. They proceed through the flowchart answering Art's questions about their personal tactics and potential dilemmas until they reach the bottom of the table, with a final question between \u20ac5,000 for the pot, or a group exemption.\n\nAt the end of the assignment, Art informed the candidates that if they had paid enough attention, they would have noticed that they were visited by the Mole during their interrogations in the park. Essentially being the exemption to the Finale that Art mentioned at the beginning of the assignment.\n\n'''Rode Draad (Red Wire) - Max. \u20ac5,000.-'''\nThe candidates were taken to the old Soviet District in Tbilisi, a lower-class district with Soviet era accommodations. On top of one of these buildings, the candidates had to zipline between two buildings. With the questions from yesterday noted by Art, the candidates had a choice of earning \u20ac5,000 or a group exemption in this assignment. The choice that the majority had chosen would be inside one of the envelopes Art gives the candidates. The objective of the assignment was for the candidates to transport envelopes across the zipline, earning whatever they managed to bring to Art. Each candidate were allowed to take only one out of the seven envelopes while they ziplined. Ruben panicked and refused to do the zipline, which led to Stine also deciding to not complete the assignment.\n\nOnly five of the candidates completed the zipline, with Art informing the candidates afterwards that they had been competing for \u20ac5,000. After opening all the envelopes, the candidates had successfully brought the \u20ac5,000 envelope to Art, and was added to the pot.\n\n===Episode 5 - Zienswijzen===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 5 - Zienswijzen\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 03/02/2018<br>Locations: [[Tbilisi|Tbilisi, Georgia]] \n|-\n!

As soon as they entered the Castle, they had to follow signs leading them to where their final test would be written. Two longer, diverting routes would lead the finalists to \u20ac2,500.- that they could add to the pot, or to see the Mole at the end of the longest route. However, their time for the test starts as soon as they enter the castle, so the diversions cost time on their final test.\n\nThe final amount earned for the winner's pot would be revealed during the Live Finale, where for the first time in the series' history would include the unmasking of the Mole in front of the live audience, 167 days after the final day of filming.\n\n===Episode 10 - Finale===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin: 10px\" align=\"right\" width=\"40%\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Episode 10 - Finale\n|-\n!colspan=3|Original airdates: 10/03/2018<br>Locations: [[Amsterdam|Amsterdam, Netherlands]] \n|-\n!

Jan, Ruben, and Olcay arrived at Vondelpark for a final debriefing by Art. At first, Art revealed that Olcay was not the Mole nor the winner, before Jan Versteegh finally stepped forward to reveal himself as the Mole. During the reunion after the unmasking, the executed candidates revealed that it was Olcay who misled them into thinking Ruben was the Mole. Meanwhile, Ruben only started to catch onto Jan as the Mole when Loes and Stine, his two main suspects were executed one after the other. In the Final Test, Olcay answered her test thinking Ruben was the Mole, and ultimately had no chance in beating Ruben. During the Final Test, Olcay skipped past the Money and Mole route, as she got lost and took too much time getting to the test. While both Jan and Ruben grabbed the extra \u20ac2,500.-. With Jan being the Mole, his \u20ac2,500.- was to fool the audiences, and it was not added to the final winner's pot of \u20ac17,750.-.\n\n==Mole Sabotage==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Hidden Clues==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Viewing Figures==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2020}}\n\n== See also ==\n[[:nl:Wie is de Mol?|Wie is de Mol?]] \u2013 Main article in Dutch\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:The Mole (TV series)]]\n[[Category:Dutch reality television series]]\n[[Category:____ Dutch television seasons]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wie_is_de_Mol%3F_(Dutch_season_18)"}
