They inhabit a contiguous region in the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] and the eastern [[Alps]], and in the modern era are geographically separated from the body of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] and [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] people by the [[Romanians]], [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], and [[Austrians]] in between. The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state. From this idea emerged [[Yugoslavia]], which however did not include [[Bulgaria]].\n\n==History==\n{{Hatnote|'Slavic invasion of the Balkans' redirects here.}}\n===Early South Slavs===\n {{main article|Early Slavs|Sclaveni}}\n\nThe Proto-Slavic [[Urheimat|homeland]] is the area of Slavic settlement in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] during the first millennium AD, with its precise location debated by archaeologists, ethnographers and historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|pp=525\u2013526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=37}}</ref> None of the proposed homelands reaches the [[Volga River]] in the east, over the [[Dinaric Alps]] in the southwest or the [[Balkan Mountains]] in the south, or past [[Bohemia]] in the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|2005|p=526}}, {{harvnb|Barford|2001|p=332}}</ref> Traditionally, scholars put it in the marshes of Ukraine, or alternatively between the [[Bug River|Bug]] and the [[Dnieper]];{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=25}} however, according to F. Curta, the homeland of the southern Slavs mentioned by 6th-century writers was just north of the [[Lower Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=56}} Little is known about the Slavs before the 5th century, when they began to spread out in all directions.\n\n[[Jordanes]], [[Procopius]] and other [[Late Antiquity|late Roman]] authors provide the probable earliest references to southern Slavs in the second half of the 6th century.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=71\u201373}} Procopius described the [[Sclaveni]] and [[Antes (people)|Antes]] as two barbarian peoples with the same institutions and customs since ancient times, not ruled by a single leader but living under democracy,<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}</ref> while Pseudo-Maurice called them a numerous people, undisciplined, unorganized and leaderless, who did not allow enslavement and conquest, and resistant to hardship, bearing all weathers.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|pp=524\u2013525}} They were portrayed by Procopius as unusually tall and strong, of dark skin and \"reddish\" hair (neither [[blond]] nor [[black hair|black]]), leading a primitive life and living in scattered huts, often changing their residence.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} Procopius said they were [[henotheistic]], believing in the god of lightning ([[Perun]]), the ruler of all, to whom they sacrificed cattle.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}} They went into battle on foot, charging straight at their enemy, armed with spears and small shields, but they did not wear armour.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=524}}\n\nWhile archaeological evidence for a large-scale migration is lacking, most present-day historians claim that Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=26\u201341}} According to this dominant narrative, up until the late 560s their main activity across the Danube was raiding, though with limited Slavic settlement mainly through Byzantine colonies of ''[[foederati]]''.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The [[Danube]] and [[Sava]] frontier was overwhelmed by large-scale Slavic settlement in the late 6th and early 7th century.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=33}} What is today [[central Serbia]] was an important geo-strategical province, through which the ''[[Via Militaris]]'' crossed.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} This area was frequently intruded upon by [[Barbarians in the Byzantine Empire|barbarians]] in the 5th and 6th centuries.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|2002|p=187}} From the Danube, the Slavs commenced raiding the Byzantine Empire on an annual basis from the 520s, spreading destruction, taking loot and herds of cattle, seizing prisoners and taking fortresses. Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities. Their influence in the Balkans however diminished by the early 7th century and they were finally defeated and disappeared as a power at the turn of the 9th century by [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] and the [[Frankish Empire]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=29\u201343}} The first South Slavic polity and regional power was [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], a state formed in 681 as a union between the much numerous [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavic]] [[Sclaveni|tribes]] and the [[bulgars]] of [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Khan Asparuh]]. The scattered Slavs in Greece, the ''Sklavinia'', were Hellenized.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=41}} Romance-speakers lived within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]].{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Traditional historiography, based on DAI, holds that the migration of [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] to the Balkans was part of a second Slavic wave, placed during Heraclius' reign.{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=66}}\n \nInhabiting the territory between the Franks in the north and Byzantium in the south, the Slavs were exposed to competing influences.{{sfn|Portal|1969|p=90}} In 863 to Christianized [[Great Moravia]] were sent two Byzantine brothers monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], Slavs from Thessaloniki on missionary work.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

The South Slavs today include the nations of [[Bosniaks]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Croats]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Serbs]] and [[Slovenes]]. They are the main population of the [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]an countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]].\n\nIn the 20th century, the country of [[Yugoslavia]] (lit. \"South Slavia\"/\"Southern Slavland\") united the regions inhabited by South Slavic nations{{spaced ndash}} with the key exception of [[Bulgaria]]{{spaced ndash}} into a single state. The concept of ''Yugoslavia'', a single state for all South Slavic peoples, emerged in the late 17th century and gained prominence through the 19th-century [[Illyrian movement]]. The [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, following the unification of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe South Slavs are known in Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin as ''Ju\u017eni Sloveni'' ({{cyrl|\u0408\u0443\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438}}); in Bulgarian as ''Yuzhni Slavyani'' ({{cyrl|\u042e\u0436\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0438}}); in Croatian and Bosnian as ''Ju\u017eni Slaveni''; in Slovene as ''Ju\u017eni Slovani''. The Slavic root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/jug\u044a|*jug\u044a]]'' means \"south\". The [[Slavic ethnonym]] itself was used by 6th-century writers to describe the southern group of Early Slavs (the ''[[Sclaveni]]''); West Slavs were called ''[[Vistula Veneti|Veneti]]'' and East Slavs ''[[Antes (people)|Antes]]''.{{sfn|Kmietowicz|1976}} The South Slavs are also called \"Balkan Slavs\",<ref>{{harvnb|Kmietowicz|1976}}, {{harvnb|Vlasto|1970}}</ref> although this term does not encompass the Slovenes.\n\nAnother name popular in the early modern period was \"Illyrians\", the name of a pre-Slavic Balkan people, a name first adopted by Dalmatian intellectuals in the late 15th century to refer to South Slavic lands and population.{{sfn|URI|2000|p=104}} It was then used by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Illyrian Provinces|France]], and notably adopted by the 19th-century Croatian nationalist and Pan-Slavist [[Illyrian movement]].{{sfn|Hupchick|2002|p=199}} Eventually, the idea of [[Yugoslavism]] appeared, aimed at uniting all South Slav-populated territories into a common state.

Often, the Byzantine Empire was stretched, defending its rich Asian provinces from Arabs, Persians and others. This meant that even numerically small, disorganised early Slavic raids were capable of causing much disruption, but could not capture the larger, fortified cities.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=29}} The first Slavic raid south of the Danube was recorded by Procopius, who mentions an attack of the Antes, \"who dwell close to the Sclaveni\", probably in 518.<ref>{{harvnb|James|2014|p=95}}, {{harvnb|Curta|2001|p=75}}</ref> Sclaveni are first mentioned in the context of the military policy on the Danube frontier of Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527\u2013565).{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=76}} Throughout the century, Slavs raided and plundered deep into the Balkans, from Dalmatia to Greece and Thrace, and were also at times recruited as mercenaries, fighting the [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=78\u201386}} Justinian seems to have used the strategy of '[[Divide and rule|divide and conquer]]', and the Sclaveni and Antes are mentioned as fighting each other.{{sfn|James|2014|p=97}} The Antes are last mentioned as anti-Byzantine belligerents in 545, and the Sclaveni continued to raid the Balkans.<ref name=Byzantinoslavica-2003-78>{{cite book|title=Byzantinoslavica |volume=61\u201362 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twwrAQAAIAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Academia|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> In 558 the [[Avar Khaganate|Avars]] arrived at the Black Sea steppe, and defeated the Antes between the Dnieper and Dniester.{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=536}} The Avars subsequently allied themselves with the Sclaveni,{{sfn|Kobyli\u0144ski|1995|p=537\u2013539}} although there was an episode in which the Sclavene [[Daurentius]] (fl. 577\u2013579), the first Slavic chieftain recorded by name, dismissed Avar suzerainty and retorted that \"Others do not conquer our land, we conquer theirs [...] so it shall always be for us\", and had the Avar envoys slain.{{sfn|Curta|2001|pp=47, 91}} By the 580s, as the Slav communities on the Danube became larger and more organized, and as the Avars exerted their influence, raids became larger and resulted in permanent settlement. Most scholars consider the period of 581-584 as the beginning of large-scale Slavic settlement in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=31}} F. Curta points out that evidence of substantial Slavic presence does not appear before the 7th century and remains qualitatively different from the \"Slavic culture\" found north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=308}} In the mid-6th century, the Byzantines re-asserted their control of the Danube frontier, thereby reducing the economic value of Slavic raiding. This growing economic isolation, combined with external threats from the Avars and Byzantines, led to political and military mobilisation. Meanwhile, the itinerant form of agriculture (lacking [[crop rotation]]) may have encouraged micro-regional mobility. Seventh-century archaeological sites show earlier hamlet collections evolving into larger communities with differentiated zones for public feasts, craftmanship, etc.{{sfn|Curta|2007|p=61}} It has been suggested that the Sclaveni were the ancestors of the Serbo-Croatian group while the Antes were that of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] [[Seven Slavic tribes|Slavs]], with much mixture in the contact zones.<ref>{{harvnb|Hupchick|2004}}, {{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=26}}</ref> The diminished pre-Slavic inhabitants, also including also Romanized native peoples,{{Cref2|a}} fled from the barbarian invasions and sought refuge inside fortified cities and islands, whilst others fled to remote mountains and forests and adopted a [[transhumant]] lifestyle.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=37}} The Romance speakers within the fortified [[Dalmatian city-states]] managed to retain their culture and language for a long time.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=35}} Meanwhile, the numerous Slavs mixed with and assimilated the descendants of the indigenous population.{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=38, 41}}\n\nSubsequent information about Slavs' interaction with the Greeks and early Slavic states comes from the 10th-century ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' (DAI) by Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], the 7th-century compilations of the ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'' (MSD) and the ''History'' by [[Theophylact Simocatta]]. DAI mentions the beginnings of the Croatian, Serbian and Bulgarian states from the early 7th to the mid-10th century. MSD and Theophylact Simocatta mention the Slavic tribes in Thessaly and Macedonia at the beginning of the 7th century. The 9th-century ''[[Royal Frankish Annals]]'' (RFA) also mention Slavic tribes in contact with the [[Franks]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nBy 700 AD, Slavs had settled in most of the Central and Southeast Europe, from Austria even down to the Peloponnese of Greece, and from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, with the exception of the coastal areas and certain mountainous regions of the Greek peninsula.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=36}} The [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], who arrived in Europe in the late 550s and had a great impact in the Balkans, had from their base in the Carpathian plain, west of main Slavic settlements, asserted control over Slavic tribes with whom they besieged Roman cities.

In 1371, the Ottomans defeated a large Serbian army at the [[Battle of Maritsa]], and in 1389 defeated the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]. By now, Serbian and Bulgarian rulers became Ottoman vassals, the southern Serbian provinces and Bulgaria holding out until annexation in the 1390s. The Ottomans conquered Constantinople (1453), Greece (1453\u201360), the [[Serbian Despotate]] (1459) and [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnia]] (1463). Much of the Balkans was under Ottoman rule throughout the [[early modern period]]. Ottoman rule lasted from the 14th into the early 20th century in some territories. Ottoman society was multi-ethnic and multi-religious, and confessional groups were divided according to the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|''millet'' system]], in which Orthodox Christians (Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs, etc.) constituted the [[Rum Millet]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Christians had ''[[dhimmi]]'' status, which entailed certain taxes and lesser rights. Through Islamization, communities of [[Slavic Muslims]] emerged, which survive until today in Bosnia, south Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bulgaria. \n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] controlled what is today Slovenia, Croatia and northern Serbia. The [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], which included smaller parts of what is today Croatia, was a crown land of the Habsburg emperor. The early modern period saw large-scale migrations of Orthodox Slavs (mainly Serbs) to the north and west. The [[Military Frontier]] was set up as the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' against Ottoman incursions. There were several rebellions against Ottoman rule, but it was not until the 18th century that parts of the Balkans, namely [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|Serbia, were liberated]] for a longer period. While [[Pan-Slavism]] has its origins in the 17th-century Slavic Catholic clergymen in the Republic of Venice and Republic of Ragusa, it crystallized only in the mid-19th century amidst rise of nationalism in the Ottoman and Habsburg empires.\n\n==Statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

These Serbo-Croatian standards are all based on the [[Shtokavian]] dialect group. Other dialect groups, which have lower intelligibility with Shtokavian, are [[Chakavian]] in [[Dalmatia]] and [[Kajkavian]] in [[Croatia proper]]. The dominance of Shtokavian across Serbo-Croatian speaking lands is due to historical westward migration during the Ottoman period. Slovene is South Slavic but has many features shared with West Slavic languages. The [[Prekmurje Slovene]] and [[Kajkavian]] are especially close, and there is no sharp delineation between them. In southeastern Serbia, dialects enter a transitional zone with Bulgarian and Macedonian, with features of both groups, and are commonly called [[Torlakian]].\n\nThe Eastern South Slavic languages are Bulgarian and Macedonian. Bulgarian has retained more archaic Slavic features in relation to the other languages. Bulgarian has two main [[yat]] splits. Slavic Macedonian was codified in Communist Yugoslavia in 1945 and was historically classified as Bulgarian. The [[Macedonian dialects]], divided into three main groups, are regarded overall as being transitional to Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian. The westernmost [[Bulgarian dialects]] (called [[Shopi]]) share features with Serbo-Croatian. Furthermore, in Greece there is a notable Slavic-speaking population [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|in Greek Macedonia]] and [[Pomaks|western Thrace]].\n\nBalkan Slavic languages are part of a \"[[Balkan sprachbund]]\" with [[areal feature]]s shared with other non-Slavic languages in the Balkans.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Plos.Balkans.2.png|thumb|400px|\"Admixture plot\" of automosal SNPs in 7 major population groups, including in Balkans (middle columns).]]\nThe earliest [[Genetic analysis|genetic studies]] for population affinities were according to 'classical markers', i.e. protein and blood group polymorphisms, according to which Cavalli-Sforza's team suggested several European cluster groups: \"Germanic\", \"Scandinavian\", \"Celtic\", south-western European and eastern European. The Yugoslavs (Bulgarians were not tested) did not group into any of the above but formed a group of their own, attributed to internal heterogeneity.\n\nAccording to a 2006 Y-DNA study, most South Slavs clustered together, while western Croats and Slovenians were instead clustered with West and East Slavic populations. Southern-Slavic populations (Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, and northern Croats) are\ngenetically distinct from their northern linguistic relatives.<ref name=\"R\u0119ba\u0142a ''et al.'' 2007\">{{cite journal | pmid = 17364156 | year = 2007 | last1 = Reba\u0142a | first1 = K | last2 = Mikulich | first2 = AI | last3 = Tsybovsky | first3 = IS | last4 = Siv\u00e1kov\u00e1 | first4 = D | last5 = Dzupinkov\u00e1 | first5 = Z | last6 = Szczerkowska-Dobosz | first6 = A | last7 = Szczerkowska | first7 = Z | title = Y-STR variation among Slavs: Evidence for the Slavic homeland in the middle Dnieper basin | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 406\u201314 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-007-0125-6 | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | doi-access = free }}</ref> A 2008 study concluded that except for some isolated communities, Europeans are somewhat genetically homogeneous, and individual population groups are often closely related to their immediate neighbours (irrespective of language or ethnicity).<ref>{{Citation |last=Novembre |first=J |last2=Johnson |first2=T |last3=Bryc |first3=K |title=Genes mirror geography within Europe |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7218 |pages=98\u2013101 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18758442 |doi=10.1038/nature07331 |pmc=2735096|bibcode = 2008Natur.456...98N |displayauthors=1 |last4=Kutalik |last5=Boyko |first5=AR |last6=Auton |first6=A |last7=Indap |first7=A |last8=King |first8=KS |last9=Bergmann |first9=S |last10=Nelson |first10=MR |last11=Stephens |first11=M |last12=Bustamante|first12=CD}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |vauthors=Lao O, Lu TT, Nothnagel M, etal |title=Correlation between genetic and geographic structure in Europe |journal=Curr.

South of the [[Jire\u010dek line]] were the [[Greeks]]. To the north, there were [[Illyrians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Dacians]]. They were mainly tribalistic and generally lacked awareness of any ethno-political affiliation. Over the classical ages, they were at times invaded, conquered and influenced by [[Celts]], [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]]. Roman influence, however, was initially limited to cities concentrated along the Dalmatian coast, later spreading to a few scattered cities inside the Balkan interior, particularly along the river Danube ([[Sirmium]], [[Belgrade]], [[Ni\u0161]]). Roman citizens from throughout the empire settled in these cities and in the adjacent countryside. Following the fall of Rome and numerous barbarian raids, the population in the Balkans dropped, as did commerce and general standards of living. Many people were killed or taken prisoner by invaders. This demographic decline was particularly attributed to a drop in the number of indigenous peasants living in rural areas. They were the most vulnerable to raids and were also hardest hit by the financial crises that plagued the falling empire. However, the Balkans were not desolate, and considerable numbers of indigenous people remained. Only certain areas tended to be affected by the raids (e.g. lands around major land routes, such as the Morava corridor).{{sfn|Fine|1991|pp=9\u201312, 37}} In addition to the autochthons, there were remnants of previous invaders such as \"[[Huns]]\" and various [[Germanic peoples]] when the Slavs arrived. [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian tribes]] such as the [[Iazyges]] were still recorded as living in the [[Banat]] region of the Danube.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=57}} The mixing of Slavs and other peoples is evident in

warn that a journal will not necessarily be predatory if they meet one of the criteria, \"but the more points on the list that apply to the journal at hand, the more sceptical you should be.\" The full list is quoted below:\n#The publisher is not a member of any recognized professional organisation committed to best publishing practices (like [[Committee on Publication Ethics|COPE]] or [[European Association of Science Editors|EASE]])\n#The journal is not indexed in well-established [[bibliographic database|electronic databases]] (like [[MEDLINE]] or [[Web of Science]])\n#The publisher claims to be a \"leading publisher\" even though it just got started\n#The journal and the publisher are unfamiliar to you and all your colleagues\n#The papers of the journal are of poor research quality, and may not be academic at all (for instance allowing for obvious [[pseudo-science]])\n#There are fundamental errors in the titles and abstracts, or frequent and repeated typographical or factual errors throughout the published papers\n#The journal website is not [[web design|professional]]\n#The journal website does not present an [[editorial board]] or gives insufficient detail on names and affiliations\n#The journal website does not reveal the journal's editorial office location or uses an incorrect address\n#The publishing schedule is not clearly stated\n#The journal title claims a national affiliation that does not match its location (such as \"''American Journal of ...''\" while being located on another continent) or includes \"International\" in its title while having a single-country editorial board\n#The journal mimics another journal title or the website of said journal\n#The journal provides an [[impact factor]] in spite of the fact that the journal is new (which means that the impact [[Five-year impact factor|cannot yet be calculated]])\n#The journal claims an unrealistically high impact based on [[fake impact factor|spurious alternative impact factors]] (such as 7 for a [[List of bioethics journals|bioethics journal]], which is far beyond the top notation)\n#The journal website posts non-related or non-academic advertisements\n#The publisher of the journal has released an overwhelmingly large suite of new journals at one occasion or during a very short period of time\n#The [[editor in chief]] of the journal is editor in chief also for other journals with widely different focus\n#The journal includes articles (very far) outside its stated scope\n#The journal sends you an unsolicited invitation to submit an article for publication, while making it blatantly clear that the editor has absolutely no idea about your field of expertise\n#Emails from the journal editor are written in poor language, include exaggerated flattering (everyone is a leading profile in the field), and make contradictory claims (such as \"You have to respond within 48 h\" while later on saying \"You may submit your manuscript whenever you find convenient\")\n#The journal charges a submission or handling fee, instead of a publication fee (which means that you have to pay even if the paper is not accepted for publication)\n#The types of submission/publication fees and what they amount to are not clearly stated on the journal's website\n#The journal gives unrealistic promises regarding the speed of the [[scholarly peer review|peer review process]] (hinting that the journal's peer review process is minimal or non-existent)\u2014or boasts an equally unrealistic track-record\n#The journal does not describe [[copyright]] agreements clearly or demands the copyright of the paper while claiming to be an open access journal\n#The journal displays no strategies for how to handle [[academic misconduct|misconduct]], [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], or secure the [[archiving]] of articles when no longer in operation\n\n=== Growth and structure ===\nPredatory journals have

If a causative connection is to be made in this regard, it is thus not between predatory practices and OA. Instead it is between predatory publishing and the unethical use of one of the many OA business models adopted by a ''minority ''of DOAJ registered journals.

In this regard, it is also important to note the emergence of journals and platforms that select purely on (peer-reviewed) methodological quality, often enabled by the APC-model and the lack of space restrictions in online publishing.

full list is quoted below:\n#The publisher is not a member of any recognized professional organisation committed to best publishing practices (like [[Committee on Publication Ethics|COPE]] or [[European Association of Science Editors|EASE]])\n#The journal is not indexed in well-established [[bibliographic database|electronic databases]] (like [[MEDLINE]] or [[Web of Science]])\n#The publisher claims to be a \"leading publisher\" even though it just got started\n#The journal and the publisher are unfamiliar to you and all your colleagues\n#The papers of the journal are of poor research quality, and may not be academic at all (for instance allowing for obvious [[pseudo-science]])\n#There are fundamental errors in the titles and abstracts, or frequent and repeated typographical or factual errors throughout the published papers\n#The journal website is not [[web design|professional]]\n#The journal website does not present an [[editorial board]] or gives insufficient detail on names and affiliations\n#The journal website does not reveal the journal's editorial office location or uses an incorrect address\n#The publishing schedule is not clearly stated\n#The journal title claims a national affiliation that does not match its location (such as \"''American Journal of ...''\" while being located on another continent) or includes \"International\" in its title while having a single-country editorial board\n#The journal mimics another journal title or the website of said journal\n#The journal provides an [[impact factor]] in spite of the fact that the journal is new (which means that the impact [[Five-year impact factor|cannot yet be calculated]])\n#The journal claims an unrealistically high impact based on [[fake impact factor|spurious alternative impact factors]] (such as 7 for a [[List of bioethics journals|bioethics journal]], which is far beyond the top notation)\n#The journal website posts non-related or non-academic advertisements\n#The publisher of the journal has released an overwhelmingly large suite of new journals at one occasion or during a very short period of time\n#The [[editor in chief]] of the journal is editor in chief also for other journals with widely different focus\n#The journal includes articles (very far) outside its stated scope\n#The journal sends you an unsolicited invitation to submit an article for publication, while making it blatantly clear that the editor has absolutely no idea about your field of expertise\n#Emails from the journal editor are written in poor language, include exaggerated flattering (everyone is a leading profile in the field), and make contradictory claims (such as \"You have to respond within 48 h\" while later on saying \"You may submit your manuscript whenever you find convenient\")\n#The journal charges a submission or handling fee, instead of a publication fee (which means that you have to pay even if the paper is not accepted for publication)\n#The types of submission/publication fees and what they amount to are not clearly stated on the journal's website\n#The journal gives unrealistic promises regarding the speed of the [[scholarly peer review|peer review process]] (hinting that the journal's peer review process is minimal or non-existent)\u2014or boasts an equally unrealistic track-record\n#The journal does not describe [[copyright]] agreements clearly or demands the copyright of the paper while claiming to be an open access journal\n#The journal displays no strategies for how to handle [[academic misconduct|misconduct]], [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]], or secure the [[archiving]] of articles when no longer in operation\n\n=== Growth and structure ===\nPredatory journals have

If a causative connection is to be made in this regard, it is thus not between predatory practices and OA. Instead it is between predatory publishing and the unethical use of one of the many OA business models adopted by a ''minority ''of DOAJ registered journals.

In this regard, it is also important to note the emergence of journals and platforms that select purely on (peer-reviewed) methodological quality, often enabled by the APC-model and the lack of space restrictions in online publishing.

The latter idea spread across the English-speaking world and remains in place today in most teaching hospitals. Through this system, physicians in training make up much of a teaching hospital's medical staff. The success of his residency system depended, in large part, on its pyramidal structure with many interns, fewer assistant residents and a single chief resident, who originally occupied that position for years. While at Hopkins, Osler established the full-time, sleep-in residency system whereby staff physicians lived in the administration building of the hospital. As established, the residency was open-ended, and long tenure was the rule. Physicians spent as long as seven or eight years as residents, during which time they led a restricted, almost [[monasticism|monastic]] life.\n\nHe wrote in an essay \"Books and Men\" that \"He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/osler/booksandmen.htm|title=Aequanimitas \u2013 Books and Men|website=www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu}}</ref> His best-known saying was \"Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis\", which emphasises the importance of taking a good history.<ref name = \"Tuteur\" />\n\nThe contribution to medical education of which he was proudest was his idea of clinical clerkship \u2013 having third- and fourth-year students work with patients on the wards. He pioneered the practice of bedside teaching, making rounds with a handful of students, demonstrating what one student referred to as his method of \"incomparably thorough physical examination.\" Soon after arriving in Baltimore, Osler insisted that his medical students attend at bedside early in their training. By their third year they were taking patient histories, performing physicals and doing lab tests examining secretions, blood and excreta.\n\n[[File:Four doctors.jpg|frame|right|''The Four Doctors'' by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1905, depicts the four physicians who founded [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. The original hangs in the William H. Welch Medical Library of [[Johns Hopkins University]].<br/>From left to right: [[William H. Welch|William Henry Welch]], [[William Stewart Halsted]], William Osler, [[Howard Atwood Kelly|Howard Kelly]]]]\n\nHe reduced the role of [[Didacticism|didactic]] lectures and once said he hoped his tombstone would say only, \"He brought medical students into the wards for bedside teaching.\" He also said, \"I desire no other epitaph \u2026 than the statement that I taught medical students in the wards, as I regard this as by far the most useful and important work I have been called upon to do.\"  Osler fundamentally changed medical teaching in North America, and this influence, helped by a few such as the Dutch [[internal medicine|internist]] [[P. K. Pel]], spread to medical schools across the globe.\n\nOsler was a prolific author and a great collector of books and other material relevant to the [[history of medicine]]. He willed his library to the Faculty of Medicine of [[McGill University]] where it now forms the nucleus of McGill University's [[Osler Library of the History of Medicine]], which opened in 1929.

Osler, who had a well-developed humorous side to his character, was in his mid-fifties when he gave the speech and in it he mentioned [[Anthony Trollope]]'s ''[[The Fixed Period]]'' (1882), which envisaged a college where men retired at 67 and after being given a year to settle their affairs, would be \"peacefully extinguished by chloroform\".

The latter idea spread across the English-speaking world and remains in place today in most teaching hospitals. Through this system, physicians in training make up much of a teaching hospital's medical staff. The success of his residency system depended, in large part, on its pyramidal structure with many interns, fewer assistant residents and a single chief resident, who originally occupied that position for years. While at Hopkins, Osler established the full-time, sleep-in residency system whereby staff physicians lived in the administration building of the hospital. As established, the residency was open-ended, and long tenure was the rule. Physicians spent as long as seven or eight years as residents, during which time they led a restricted, almost [[monasticism|monastic]] life.\n\nHe wrote in an essay \"Books and Men\" that \"He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu/osler/booksandmen.htm|title=Aequanimitas \u2013 Books and Men|website=www.medicalarchives.jhmi.edu}}</ref> His best-known saying was \"Listen to your patient, he is telling you the diagnosis\", which emphasises the importance of taking a good history.<ref name = \"Tuteur\" />\n\nThe contribution to medical education of which he was proudest was his idea of clinical clerkship \u2013 having third- and fourth-year students work with patients on the wards. He pioneered the practice of bedside teaching, making rounds with a handful of students, demonstrating what one student referred to as his method of \"incomparably thorough physical examination.\" Soon after arriving in Baltimore, Osler insisted that his medical students attend at bedside early in their training. By their third year they were taking patient histories, performing physicals and doing lab tests examining secretions, blood and excreta.\n\n[[File:Four doctors.jpg|frame|right|''The Four Doctors'' by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1905, depicts the four physicians who founded [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. The original hangs in the William H. Welch Medical Library of [[Johns Hopkins University]].<br/>From left to right: [[William H. Welch|William Henry Welch]], [[William Stewart Halsted]], William Osler, [[Howard Atwood Kelly|Howard Kelly]]]]\n\nHe reduced the role of [[Didacticism|didactic]] lectures and once said he hoped his tombstone would say only, \"He brought medical students into the wards for bedside teaching.\" He also said, \"I desire no other epitaph \u2026 than the statement that I taught medical students in the wards, as I regard this as by far the most useful and important work I have been called upon to do.\"  Osler fundamentally changed medical teaching in North America, and this influence, helped by a few such as the Dutch [[internal medicine|internist]] [[P. K. Pel]], spread to medical schools across the globe.\n\nOsler was a prolific author and a great collector of books and other material relevant to the [[history of medicine]]. He willed his library to the Faculty of Medicine of [[McGill University]] where it now forms the nucleus of McGill University's [[Osler Library of the History of Medicine]], which opened in 1929.

The series marked James' second starring role in a CBS sitcom, after ''[[The King of Queens]]'', which ran from 1998 until 2007.\n\nThe series began with James starring as a recently retired [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County,]] [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Nassau County Police Department|police officer]] and father of three, married to Donna ([[Erinn Hayes]]). Beginning with season two, the character of Donna has died, and the series' new female lead is Vanessa Cellucci ([[Leah Remini]]), Kevin's former rival on the force and now his partner at their new security company, Monkey Fist Security. While the first season focused on Kevin's personal and family life, the second concerns his new profession, his relationship with Vanessa, and his adjustment to life as a single parent.\n\nOn May 12, 2018, CBS cancelled the series after two seasons.<ref name=\"Schwartz\">{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/05/12/kevin-can-wait-cancelled-season-3-cbs/|title=Kevin Can Wait Cancelled at CBS After Polarizing Season 2 Shake-Up|first=Ryan|last=Schwartz|date=May 12, 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nKevin Gable is a newly retired Nassau County police officer living in [[Massapequa, New York]], on [[Long Island]], with his wife Donna, daughters Kendra and Sara, and son Jack Cole. He looks forward to a carefree early retirement hanging out with his friends, who are also retired officers: Goody, Duffy, and Mott. However, Kevin soon realizes his smaller pension paycheck and family challenges will put those plans on hold.  His elder daughter Kendra, who was away at college, moves back into town with her unemployed fianc\u00e9, Chale, and they begin living in the home's garage; Sara is becoming increasingly difficult, with anger-management issues; and youngest son Jack is a [[hypochondriac]] who sees the school therapist for anxiety-related issues.\n\nDuring the first season, Kevin holds various odd jobs to supplement his retirement income while the family deals with several issues, including Kendra's and Chale's wedding. First season episodes revolve around Kevin and Donna, although Kevin is frequently seen with his group of friends. Most scenes during the first season take place either at the Gable household or the bar Enzo's (where Kendra is employed and where Kevin hangs out with his friends).\n\nSeason two picks up over a year after the events of the first-season finale. Donna has been deceased for about a year, leaving the widowed Kevin with the three kids, and now working full-time with his old work rival, Vanessa Cellucci, in their new security company, Monkey Fist Security.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/08/01/kevin-can-wait-kills-off-wife/|title='Kevin Can Wait' Will Kill Off Erinn Hayes' Character This Fall|date=August 1, 2017|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/09/kevin-can-wait-wife-death-erinn-hayes-season-2-premiere-1201880223/ |title='Kevin Can Wait' Spent Less Than One Minute Mourning Erinn Hayes' Character in Season 2 Premiere |last=Travers |first=Ben |publisher=indiewire.com |date=September 26, 2017 |accessdate=September 28, 2017}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|The company was named Golden Phoenix Security in \"Business Unusual\" and \"Kevin Goes Nuts\", before being changed in the latter episode.}} With the death of Donna, Kevin's reentry into the work force, and the regular inclusion of Vanessa, season two expands its focus to also feature more of the supporting characters not seen much in the first season. The Monkey Fist Security office also becomes a frequently used location.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Kevin James]] as Kevin Gable: <br />The patriarch of the Gable household. As the series started, Kevin, a recently retired cop married to wife Donna, tends to get involved in some situation, which he usually solves with his down-to-earth principles, and some help from Donna. After Donna's death between the first two seasons, the widowed Kevin becomes a helicopter parent, who goes to work at a security firm with his ex-partner, Vanessa Cellucci. Kevin is a generally good man at heart, although he tends to sometimes get distracted in his goals. He cares deeply about his family and friends, and is willing to do most anything to help them.\n* [[Erinn Hayes]] as Donna Gable (season 1): <br />Kevin's wife and the matriarch of the Gable household for the first season. Donna is a school nurse, until she quits in the first season finale (also her last physical appearance in the series). Donna passes away before the second season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/erinn-hayes-kevin-can-wait-donna-killed-off-leah-remini-1202512614/|title=Erinn Hayes' Character to Be Killed Off 'Kevin Can Wait' |first=Elizabeth|last=Wagmeister|date=August 1, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2017/08/23/this-is-us-season-2-spoilers-jack-kid-young-flashback/|title=Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on The Flash, Grey's Anatomy, This Is Us, Scandal, Supernatural, Lucifer, Chi Fire and More|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=August 23, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|Donna's death has still yet to be explained to the audience.

Although her actual cause of death also has yet to be revealed, many conversations suggest it was sudden.}} Her father does, or did, not like Kevin, as mentioned in the pilot episode. The episode \"The Fantastic Pho\" reveals Kevin and Donna met at a bar, and \"The Might've Before Christmas\" reveals she and Kevin got together after Vanessa urged them (on their first night as partners).\n* [[Taylor Spreitler]] as Kendra Gable-Witt: <br />The elder Gable daughter. Kendra is a 21-year-old college student (she gets into Columbia Law School in the first season finale), who also works as a waitress at Enzo's. Out of all the Gable kids, she has the most prominent role in the series. In the pilot, she revealed her engagement to her parents (Donna only knew they were dating, while Kevin was not even told) and moved back in with her fianc\u00e9, Chale. Kendra is the most responsible and dependable of the Gable kids. She is also shown to be nagging at times, more specifically towards Chale after their marriage.<br/>While most of the first season shows her and Donna planning her wedding, she and Chale get married in the season two premiere, after he faces deportation. Following the death of Donna, Kendra becomes the surrogate matriarch of the family.\n* [[Ryan Cartwright]] as Chale Witt: <br />Kendra's English fianc\u00e9, later husband. He moves into the Gables' garage following the revelation of his engagement with Kendra. Chale is shown to be shy and soft-spoken, but very intelligent. Kevin initially shows hostility towards him, but their relationship somewhat improves over the course of the series.<br/>When the show first begins, Chale claims to be designing an app that will be successful; thus, Chale is unemployed for the majority of season one, working on the app. In the season two premiere, he and Kendra marry as he faces deportation. Chale begins working at Enzo's alongside Kendra in \"Plus One is the Loneliest Number\", and gets promoted to manager (and temporarily stops working on his app) in \"The Kevin Crown Affair.\n* Mary-Charles Jones as Sara Marie Gable: <br />The younger Gable daughter. Sara has anger management issues that are frequently mentioned throughout the series (e.g. starting a food fight, calling a family friend's baby \"stupid\", etc.). Sara is somewhat of a tomboy\u2014she excels at and loves sports, watches football, and frequently fights. Sara is also known to have a rebellious streak: she has been suspended, stolen her father's money, and even created a secret second Facebook account and snuck off with her boyfriend. Despite her hostility (especially towards her siblings), she does overall love her family.<br/>The first season saw Sara mostly in short, cameo roles; she becomes more prominent in the second season.\n* James DiGiacomo as Jack Gable: <br />The son of the Gables. Jack is 11-years-old, and is portrayed as the weakest Gable child (especially when compared to Sara), and somewhat dim. He has very few friends, and is stated to be a hypochondriac. He frequently tries to make friends, but with little success.<br/>The first season saw Jack mostly in short, cameo roles; he becomes more prominent in the second season.\n* [[Gary Valentine]] as Kyle Gable: <br />Kevin's older brother. He is a firefighter for the [[New York City Fire Department]]. Kyle is a bachelor, and has a crush on Vanessa (much to her dismay). Like Jack, he is also shown to have below-average intelligence, and is mainly relegated to being a cook at the Fire Department.<br/>As a part of Kevin's group, he is frequently seen with Kevin's friends, and is also seen at the Gable household.\n* Leonard Earl Howze as Tyrone \"Goody\" Goodman: <br />Kevin's friend from the police force, who he is frequently seen with. He is married to Didi, who was good friends with Donna. In the second season, Goody begins working for Monkey Fist security.\n* [[Lenny Venito]] as Duffy (season 1): <br />Kevin's friend, also newly retired from the force. He has been divorced three times. Duffy was written out in the second season, without any explanation for the character's absence.\n* Christopher Brian Roach (also credited as Chris Roach) as Mott: one of Kevin's retired officer friends, who is usually regarded as the dimmest of the group. He is married to Cindy, and has seven young, rambunctious kids. In the second season, Mott begins working for Monkey Fist security.\n* [[Leah Remini]] as Vanessa Cellucci (season 2; guest season 1): <br />Kevin's former partner on the force, and later, his business partner.

In the former, which served as the season premiere, criticism was placed on the brief mention of Donna's death, via a piece of mail, and a subsequent joke many found distasteful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/09/25/how-kevin-can-wait-addressed-donna-death/|title=Here's How 'Kevin Can Wait' Addressed Donna's Death|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> The later episode, the season's fifth episode, was panned for its plot that the characters use a single parents support group for getting out of work and their romantic life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a13082438/kevin-can-wait-season-2-episode-5-recap/|title=The Death of Donna on 'Kevin Can Wait' Has Taken a F*cked Up Turn|date=October 24, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> The series' reduced mention of Donna following her death, as well as no specific cause to her death, has also been target of criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a13125274/kevin-can-wait-episode-6-recap/|title='Kevin Can Wait' Is Trying to Erase All Memory of Donna|date=October 31, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nViewers and critics of the show remain divided over the retool. Some stated the decision was a well-made one, and that the chemistry between James and Remini made the quality of the series better. Others said that Hayes' firing, and the addition of Remini with how the show handled her character's death, with poor script quality, made the show worse. Despite the division, both Hayes and Remini spoke highly of each other. Remini stated that, before Hayes' firing, she was looking forward to working with her again; Hayes (who mostly remained silent over the firing) asked fans to not place blame on Remini.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/09/27/kevin-can-waits-leah-remini-praises-shows-ex-star-erinn-hayes.html|title='Kevin Can Wait's' Leah Remini praises show's ex-star Erinn Hayes|date=September 27, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"BoycottTweets\">{{cite web|url=http://people.com/tv/erinn-hayes-liking-tweets-kevin-can-wait-boycott/|title=Erinn Hayes Has Been 'Liking' Tweets from Fans Calling for a Kevin Can Wait Boycott|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/news/a45000/leah-remini-kevin-can-wait-wife-death/|title=Leah Remini Responds To 'Kevin Can Wait' Backlash Over Donna's Death|date=September 26, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIt has been rumored and hinted at that the addition of co-star Leah Remini was an attempt to save the show from cancellation. Many suggested this theory is due not only to their chemistry and ability to play off one another well, but also to capitalize on their successful run on ''The King of Queens'' a decade earlier. However, James insisted the choice was purely creative, as the writers felt they were running out of ideas, and he was unsure if it would continue beyond a second season. James also stated that the original plot line of the series was to have him as a single father, but the original producers gave him a wife instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/kevin-james-tv-wife-killed-kevin-wait-article-1.3563140|title=Kevin James on why his TV wife was killed off 'Kevin Can Wait'|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"BoycottTweets\"/>\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the revamp, the series' ratings remained steady. As of December 1, 2017, the series was averaging 8.2 million viewers (with delayed viewing) in the season, competing against more established Top 20 series ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]''. The series also performs well in the much-coveted 18-49 demographic, ranking as the fifth-highest rated program on CBS in that category.<ref>{{cite

television series starring [[Kevin James]] that aired on [[CBS]] from September 19, 2016 to May 7, 2018. The series marked James' second starring role in a CBS sitcom, after ''[[The King of Queens]]'', which ran from 1998 until 2007.\n\nThe series began with James starring as a recently retired [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County,]] [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Nassau County Police Department|police officer]] and father of three, married to Donna ([[Erinn Hayes]]). Beginning with season two, the character of Donna has died, and the series' new female lead is Vanessa Cellucci ([[Leah Remini]]), Kevin's former rival on the force and now his partner at their new security company, Monkey Fist Security. While the first season focused on Kevin's personal and family life, the second concerns his new profession, his relationship with Vanessa, and his adjustment to life as a single parent.\n\nOn May 12, 2018, CBS cancelled the series after two seasons.<ref name=\"Schwartz\">{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/05/12/kevin-can-wait-cancelled-season-3-cbs/|title=Kevin Can Wait Cancelled at CBS After Polarizing Season 2 Shake-Up|first=Ryan|last=Schwartz|date=May 12, 2018|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nKevin Gable is a newly retired Nassau County police officer living in [[Massapequa, New York]], on [[Long Island]], with his wife Donna, daughters Kendra and Sara, and son Jack Cole. He looks forward to a carefree early retirement hanging out with his friends, who are also retired officers: Goody, Duffy, and Mott. However, Kevin soon realizes his smaller pension paycheck and family challenges will put those plans on hold.  His elder daughter Kendra, who was away at college, moves back into town with her unemployed fianc\u00e9, Chale, and they begin living in the home's garage; Sara is becoming increasingly difficult, with anger-management issues; and youngest son Jack is a [[hypochondriac]] who sees the school therapist for anxiety-related issues.\n\nDuring the first season, Kevin holds various odd jobs to supplement his retirement income while the family deals with several issues, including Kendra's and Chale's wedding. First season episodes revolve around Kevin and Donna, although Kevin is frequently seen with his group of friends. Most scenes during the first season take place either at the Gable household or the bar Enzo's (where Kendra is employed and where Kevin hangs out with his friends).\n\nSeason two picks up over a year after the events of the first-season finale. Donna has been deceased for about a year, leaving the widowed Kevin with the three kids, and now working full-time with his old work rival, Vanessa Cellucci, in their new security company, Monkey Fist Security.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/08/01/kevin-can-wait-kills-off-wife/|title='Kevin Can Wait' Will Kill Off Erinn Hayes' Character This Fall|date=August 1, 2017|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/09/kevin-can-wait-wife-death-erinn-hayes-season-2-premiere-1201880223/ |title='Kevin Can Wait' Spent Less Than One Minute Mourning Erinn Hayes' Character in Season 2 Premiere |last=Travers |first=Ben |publisher=indiewire.com |date=September 26, 2017 |accessdate=September 28, 2017}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|The company was named Golden Phoenix Security in \"Business Unusual\" and \"Kevin Goes Nuts\", before being changed in the latter episode.}} With the death of Donna, Kevin's reentry into the work force, and the regular inclusion of Vanessa, season two expands its focus to also feature more of the supporting characters not seen much in the first season. The Monkey Fist Security office also becomes a frequently used location.\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Kevin James]] as Kevin Gable: <br />The patriarch of the Gable household. As the series started, Kevin, a recently retired cop married to wife Donna, tends to get involved in some situation, which he usually solves with his down-to-earth principles, and some help from Donna. After Donna's death between the first two seasons, the widowed Kevin becomes a helicopter parent, who goes to work at a security firm with his ex-partner, Vanessa Cellucci. Kevin is a generally good man at heart, although he tends to sometimes get distracted in his goals. He cares deeply about his family and friends, and is willing to do most anything to help them.\n* [[Erinn Hayes]] as Donna Gable (season 1): <br />Kevin's wife and the matriarch of the Gable household for the first season. Donna is a school nurse, until she quits in the first season finale (also her last physical appearance in the series). Donna passes away before the second season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/erinn-hayes-kevin-can-wait-donna-killed-off-leah-remini-1202512614/|title=Erinn Hayes' Character to Be Killed Off 'Kevin Can Wait' |first=Elizabeth|last=Wagmeister|date=August 1, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2017/08/23/this-is-us-season-2-spoilers-jack-kid-young-flashback/|title=Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on The Flash, Grey's Anatomy, This Is Us, Scandal, Supernatural, Lucifer, Chi Fire and More|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=August 23, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref>{{refn|group=note|Donna's death has still yet to be explained to the audience. Multiple earlier season two episodes state it's been a year, but in \"Cooking Up a Storm\", it was stated that Wendy has been chasing after Kevin for ten months. Although her actual cause of death also has yet to be revealed, many conversations suggest it was sudden.}} Her father does, or did, not like Kevin, as mentioned in the pilot episode. The episode \"The Fantastic Pho\" reveals Kevin and Donna met at a bar, and \"The Might've Before Christmas\" reveals she and Kevin got together after Vanessa urged them (on their first night as partners).\n* [[Taylor Spreitler]] as Kendra Gable-Witt: <br />The elder Gable daughter. Kendra is a 21-year-old college student (she gets into Columbia Law School in the first season finale), who also works as a waitress at Enzo's. Out of all the Gable kids, she has the most prominent role in the series. In the pilot, she revealed her engagement to her parents (Donna only knew they were dating, while Kevin was not even told) and moved back in with her fianc\u00e9, Chale. Kendra is the most responsible and dependable of the Gable kids. She is also shown to be nagging at times, more specifically towards Chale after their marriage.<br/>While most of the first season shows her and Donna planning her wedding, she and Chale get married in the season two premiere, after he faces deportation. Following the death of Donna, Kendra becomes the surrogate matriarch of the family.\n* [[Ryan Cartwright]] as Chale Witt: <br />Kendra's English fianc\u00e9, later husband. He moves into the Gables' garage following the revelation of his engagement with Kendra. Chale is shown to be shy and soft-spoken, but very intelligent. Kevin initially shows hostility towards him, but their relationship somewhat improves over the course of the series.<br/>When the show first begins, Chale claims to be designing an app that will be successful; thus, Chale is unemployed for the majority of season one, working on the app. In the season two premiere, he and Kendra marry as he faces deportation. Chale begins working at Enzo's alongside Kendra in \"Plus One is the Loneliest Number\", and gets promoted to manager (and temporarily stops working on his app) in \"The Kevin Crown Affair.\n* Mary-Charles Jones as Sara Marie Gable: <br />The younger Gable daughter. Sara has anger management issues that are frequently mentioned throughout the series (e.g. starting a food fight, calling a family friend's baby \"stupid\", etc.). Sara is somewhat of a tomboy\u2014she excels at and loves sports, watches football, and frequently fights. Sara is also known to have a rebellious streak: she has been suspended, stolen her father's money, and even created a secret second Facebook account and snuck off with her boyfriend. Despite her hostility (especially towards her siblings), she does overall love her family.<br/>The first season saw Sara mostly in short, cameo roles; she becomes more prominent in the second season.\n* James DiGiacomo as Jack Gable: <br />The son of the Gables. Jack is 11-years-old, and is portrayed as the weakest Gable child (especially when compared to Sara), and somewhat dim. He has very few friends, and is stated to be a hypochondriac. He frequently tries to make friends, but with little success.<br/>The first season saw Jack mostly in short, cameo roles; he becomes more prominent in the second season.\n* [[Gary Valentine]] as Kyle Gable: <br />Kevin's older brother. He is a firefighter for the [[New York City Fire Department]]. Kyle is a bachelor, and has a crush on Vanessa (much to her dismay). Like Jack, he is also shown to have below-average intelligence, and is mainly relegated to being a cook at the Fire Department.<br/>As a part of Kevin's group, he is frequently seen with Kevin's friends, and is also seen at the Gable household.\n* Leonard Earl Howze as Tyrone \"Goody\" Goodman: <br />Kevin's friend from the police force, who he is frequently seen with. He is married to Didi, who was good friends with Donna. In the second season, Goody begins working for Monkey Fist security.\n* [[Lenny Venito]] as Duffy (season 1): <br />Kevin's friend, also newly retired from the force. He has been divorced three times. Duffy was written out in the second season, without any explanation for the character's absence.\n* Christopher Brian Roach (also credited as Chris Roach) as Mott: one of Kevin's retired officer friends, who is usually regarded as the dimmest of the group. He is married to Cindy, and has seven young, rambunctious kids. In the second season, Mott begins working for Monkey Fist security.\n* [[Leah Remini]] as Vanessa Cellucci (season 2; guest season 1): <br />Kevin's former partner on the force, and later, his business partner. She was introduced in the two-part first-season finale<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2017/06/02/kevin-can-wait-season-2-leah-remini-returns-series-regular/|title= Kevin Can Wait: Leah Remini Returning as a Series Regular in Season 2 |publisher=[[TVLine]]|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|date=June 2, 2017|accessdate= June 2, 2017}}</ref> as a police detective who had worked with Kevin on a major case, even though they were rivals and frequently bickered.

In the former, which served as the season premiere, criticism was placed on the brief mention of Donna's death, via a piece of mail, and a subsequent joke many found distasteful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/09/25/how-kevin-can-wait-addressed-donna-death/|title=Here's How 'Kevin Can Wait' Addressed Donna's Death|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> The later episode, the season's fifth episode, was panned for its plot that the characters use a single parents support group for getting out of work and their romantic life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a13082438/kevin-can-wait-season-2-episode-5-recap/|title=The Death of Donna on 'Kevin Can Wait' Has Taken a F*cked Up Turn|date=October 24, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref> The series' reduced mention of Donna following her death, as well as no specific cause to her death, has also been target of criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a13125274/kevin-can-wait-episode-6-recap/|title='Kevin Can Wait' Is Trying to Erase All Memory of Donna|date=October 31, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nViewers and critics of the show remain divided over the retool. Some stated the decision was a well-made one, and that the chemistry between James and Remini made the quality of the series better. Others said that Hayes' firing, and the addition of Remini with how the show handled her character's death, with poor script quality, made the show worse. Despite the division, both Hayes and Remini spoke highly of each other. Remini stated that, before Hayes' firing, she was looking forward to working with her again; Hayes (who mostly remained silent over the firing) asked fans to not place blame on Remini.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2017/09/27/kevin-can-waits-leah-remini-praises-shows-ex-star-erinn-hayes.html|title='Kevin Can Wait's' Leah Remini praises show's ex-star Erinn Hayes|date=September 27, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"BoycottTweets\">{{cite web|url=http://people.com/tv/erinn-hayes-liking-tweets-kevin-can-wait-boycott/|title=Erinn Hayes Has Been 'Liking' Tweets from Fans Calling for a Kevin Can Wait Boycott|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/news/a45000/leah-remini-kevin-can-wait-wife-death/|title=Leah Remini Responds To 'Kevin Can Wait' Backlash Over Donna's Death|date=September 26, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIt has been rumored and hinted at that the addition of co-star Leah Remini was an attempt to save the show from cancellation. Many suggested this theory is due not only to their chemistry and ability to play off one another well, but also to capitalize on their successful run on ''The King of Queens'' a decade earlier. However, James insisted the choice was purely creative, as the writers felt they were running out of ideas, and he was unsure if it would continue beyond a second season. James also stated that the original plot line of the series was to have him as a single father, but the original producers gave him a wife instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/kevin-james-tv-wife-killed-kevin-wait-article-1.3563140|title=Kevin James on why his TV wife was killed off 'Kevin Can Wait'|publisher=|accessdate=January 21, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"BoycottTweets\"/>\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the revamp, the series' ratings remained steady. As of December 1, 2017, the series was averaging 8.2 million viewers (with delayed viewing) in the season, competing against more established Top 20 series ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]''. The series also performs well in the much-coveted 18-49 demographic, ranking as the fifth-highest rated program on CBS in that category.<ref>{{cite

Cassie is also struggling with Abigail, a spirit only she can perceive and who wants Cassie to help her find peace. Using Cassie\u2019s insights, Tom and Damien realize that the killer deliberately staged the crime scene to throw them off, but when Shannon\u2019s abusive ex-boyfriend provides them with an alibi, they have no suspect until Damien rewatches video of Roven and concludes that James Stark, the only one of Roven\u2019s victims to survive, is the copycat, using his job as a paramedic to gain access to Shannon. Cassie delivers a message to Abigail\u2019s incarcerated grandfather, who sexually abused her prior to accidentally overdosing her on sleeping meds, and Abigail leaves her to torment him.

Elliot subsequently flees from police custody, leaving an injured Karen behind. Roven stalks Cassie at work and offers to help find Jason. A search of Elliot's phone uncovers a link between him and John McPherson, who lost his family in a hit-and-run committed by Elliot four years ago. The police rescue Elliot, who agrees to sign a confession. Nevertheless, McPherson refuses to help, insisting that Jason must die. With no other options, Damien suggests triggering a new vision from Cassie using video footage of Jason. Roven warns her that doing so means she must \"dive straight in\", without any fear or hesitation. This leads her to a storage facility, where the police find Jason on the brink of death. McPherson believes he has finally been vindicated, only for Tom to then show him proof that both Karen and Jason are still alive.

She also gets tangled in a homicide investigation into the murder of a nurse, Grace Morrow, who turns out to have treated Ethan Grant--the boy Cassie saw. Roven, hoping to earn redemption, offers to help free Ethan's spirit. Tom asks Cassie to stay out of the investigation since hospitals upset her, but she insists. The [[medical examiner]], Amy, tells Damien that Shane Vogel, Ethan's surgeon, denied a request by Grace for a post-mortem test on Ethan's corpse. He then tells Tom why Cassie was at the hospital: to try and connect with Sally. With information from Cassie and Amy, Tom and Damien realize that an [[angel of mercy (criminology)|angel of mercy]] has been killing terminal patients like Ethan at Woodgate for years and used another employee's badge to steal lethal drugs to do so. Cassie also identifies the woman from Tom's photos: Ellen Vogel, Shane's late mother. Shane ultimately kills himself rather than be arrested. Refusing to accept Roven's help, Cassie convinces Ellen to leave the basement, but Ethan and the other patients' spirits are already gone.

Tom learns that a fictional entity referred to as \"Mr. Nightfall\" was the killer, which leads him to Bradley Tennant, a student who took his own life after bullies used Mr. Nightfall to play a cruel prank on him.

A police sting nets Eric Vaughn, Bradley's friend who blames himself for helping set up the prank, and Tom arrests him.

She then has a vision that exonerates Vaughn, and Tom and Damien discover that Dr. Kelly, the school's guidance counselor, posed as Mr. Nightfall and killed the bullies because his own son committed suicide after being bullied.

The two victims are linked to a 1988 massacre in the [[Philippines]], committed by a war criminal, Col. Denila, who is living in Seattle under the name George West; Tom and Damien stop him from escaping by sea. Hannah stabs her boyfriend to death when he threatens her baby daughter Crystal, and Tom assures her she won\u2019t face charges. Abigail tells Cassie she is leaving her for good, and that if she finds her mother\u2019s spirit in the InBetween, she\u2019ll tell her to come find her daughter.\n |LineColor       = 172433\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = The Length of a River\n |DirectedBy      = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n |WrittenBy       = Moira Kirland & Gabrielle Stanton\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|17}}\n |Viewers         = 2.30<ref name=\"1.06\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/wednesday-final-ratings-july-17-2019/|title='Love Island,' 'First Responders Live' adjust down: Wednesday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Melinda, Cassie's old friend, asks her to contact the spirit of her dead fiancee Jenna, but every time she tries, Jenna's spirit dies in a \"death echo\". Tom and Damien lead a task force to capture the \"newlywed killer\", a murderer targeting married couples; Damien infers that the murders may be motivated by the killer's contempt for adulterers. Brian suggests that Jenna's strong love for Melinda is keeping her trapped. The police determine that the killer only goes after women in support groups, taking advantage of their strict adherence to confidentiality. Cassie asks for Melinda's [[engagement ring]] so Jenna can finally be at peace. Damien picks up a suspect who points to the group coordinator, Lyla James, as the killer. Cassie confirms that Lyla is planning to murder her ex-fiancee and his wife next, and Tom takes her into custody. Cassie tells Brian that she knows he's forgetting things, and asks him to get checked. Jenna's spirit thanks Cassie for giving Melinda closure. Damien expresses dismay that he failed to accurately profile the killer, to which Cassie reminds him that they both can only interpret the evidence they're given.\n |LineColor       = 172433\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Let Me in Your Window\n |DirectedBy      = [[Romeo Tirone]]\n |WrittenBy       = Karen Wyscarver & Sanford Golden\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|24}}\n |Viewers         = 2.18<ref name=\"1.07\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/wednesday-final-ratings-july-24-2019/|title='Jane the Virgin,' 'S.W.A.T.' rerun adjust down: Wednesday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=July 25, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = <!-- Episode summaries must be expressed in your own words.

Tom's new partner, Damien, correctly deduces that the murderer is a copycat emulating deceased [[serial killer]] Ed Roven, but is skeptical of Cassie and her abilities until he finds a clue on Shannon\u2019s body matching one that Cassie saw in a vision. Cassie is also struggling with Abigail, a spirit only she can perceive and who wants Cassie to help her find peace. Using Cassie\u2019s insights, Tom and Damien realize that the killer deliberately staged the crime scene to throw them off, but when Shannon\u2019s abusive ex-boyfriend provides them with an alibi, they have no suspect until Damien rewatches video of Roven and concludes that James Stark, the only one of Roven\u2019s victims to survive, is the copycat, using his job as a paramedic to gain access to Shannon. Cassie delivers a message to Abigail\u2019s incarcerated grandfather, who sexually abused her prior to accidentally overdosing her on sleeping meds, and Abigail leaves her to torment him. Tom and Damien take James into custody, and celebrate with Cassie.

Damien and Tom are looking into the disappearance of Karen Sinclair and her son Jason when Cassie has two visions: a woman and her baby and Karen's husband Elliot trying to run her over. Elliot subsequently flees from police custody, leaving an injured Karen behind. Roven stalks Cassie at work and offers to help find Jason. A search of Elliot's phone uncovers a link between him and John McPherson, who lost his family in a hit-and-run committed by Elliot four years ago. The police rescue Elliot, who agrees to sign a confession. Nevertheless, McPherson refuses to help, insisting that Jason must die. With no other options, Damien suggests triggering a new vision from Cassie using video footage of Jason. Roven warns her that doing so means she must \"dive straight in\", without any fear or hesitation. This leads her to a storage facility, where the police find Jason on the brink of death. McPherson believes he has finally been vindicated, only for Tom to then show him proof that both Karen and Jason are still alive. Roven explains why he reached out to Cassie: he believes she can help him escape the \"InBetween\".   \n |LineColor       = 172433\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Where the Shadows Fall\n |DirectedBy      = [[Ruba Nadda]]\n |WrittenBy       = Nick Parker\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|6|19}}\n |Viewers         = 2.74<ref name=\"1.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/wednesday-final-ratings-june-19-2019/|title='Press Your Luck,' 'Card Sharks,' and 'Match Game' adjust down: Wednesday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=June 20, 2019|accessdate=June 20, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = While visiting Damian's fiancee Sally at Woodgate Hospital, Cassie encounters the ghost of a young boy and an angry woman in the basement. She also gets tangled in a homicide investigation into the murder of a nurse, Grace Morrow, who turns out to have treated Ethan Grant--the boy Cassie saw. Roven, hoping to earn redemption, offers to help free Ethan's spirit. Tom asks Cassie to stay out of the investigation since hospitals upset her, but she insists. The [[medical examiner]], Amy, tells Damien that Shane Vogel, Ethan's surgeon, denied a request by Grace for a post-mortem test on Ethan's corpse. He then tells Tom why Cassie was at the hospital: to try and connect with Sally. With information from Cassie and Amy, Tom and Damien realize that an [[angel of mercy (criminology)|angel of mercy]] has been killing terminal patients like Ethan at Woodgate for years and used another employee's badge to steal lethal drugs to do so. Cassie also identifies the woman from Tom's photos: Ellen Vogel, Shane's late mother. Shane ultimately kills himself rather than be arrested. Refusing to accept Roven's help, Cassie convinces Ellen to leave the basement, but Ethan and the other patients' spirits are already gone.

Cassie is visited by the spirit of Edina De Forest, an [[opioid]] addict who believes she was murdered; Damien learns that Edina had a lucrative [[life insurance]] policy. Tom learns that a fictional entity referred to as \"Mr. Nightfall\" was the killer, which leads him to Bradley Tennant, a student who took his own life after bullies used Mr. Nightfall to play a cruel prank on him. Cassie finds Edina's car and reports it to Damien, who identifies the fingerprints on it as belonging to a known drug dealer, leaving her feeling stupid for not realizing Edina was still using. A police sting nets Eric Vaughn, Bradley's friend who blames himself for helping set up the prank, and Tom arrests him. Realizing that Edina lied about being murdered because she overdosed, Cassie locates her body so her family can claim the insurance. She then has a vision that exonerates Vaughn, and Tom and Damien discover that Dr. Kelly, the school's guidance counselor, posed as Mr. Nightfall and killed the bullies because his own son committed suicide after being bullied.
